1490065 although we want to reduce manpower in the short term to manage our cost as we are similarly affected by the fuel price our approach is different as we will grow in the medium to long term we want to keep our skilled employees
1490066 although downside risks to growth remain the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern to the committee the federal open market committee said in a statement yesterday in washington
1490067 labour markets have softened further and financial markets remain under considerable stress the feds statement said
1490068 tight credit conditions the ongoing housing contraction and elevated energy prices are likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters
1490069 inflation has been high spurred by the earlier increases in the prices of energy and some other commodities the fed said
1490070 the committee expects inflation to moderate later this year and next year but the inflation outlook remains highly uncertain
1490071 as a policy maker it doesnt get any worse than this fed governor frederic mishkin said after a speech in washington on july 28 he will leave the central bank at the end of the month

1490186 if the way to close the achievement gap is to pull whites down thats not a strategy that any intelligent person or any responsible school district would ever follow
1490187 in the real world no one looks at proficiency scores to determine the likelihood of someone getting ahead
1490188 what really matters is how people do in relation to one another and so if you have groups remaining the same distance apart then the group ahead is still going to remain ahead when you look at selection into colleges and the labor market
1490189 over the past six years weve done everything possible to narrow the achievement gap and we have
1490190 i think overall it looks to be pretty good news
1490191 when one looks at this presentation the picture is a lot more modest
1490192 this is not strong evidence that the gap is closing
1490193 the only thing you can say is that theyre relatively flat that the gap is relatively stable
1490194 those are just confidence levels nobody is saying this is a science
1490195 if three points is flat and four points is statistically significant then what youre doing is youre playing something of a game
1490196 my view is that our black kids in the fourth grade are outperforming all black kids in america
1490197 our kids are ripping the leather off the ball of the other kids around the country
1490198 we need to be aware that what were doing right now to close the achievement gap may not be working
1490199 if what were doing isnt working we need to be aware of that and perhaps think about doing something else
1490200 i think the data in the memo are accurate and thats as much as we can say
1490201 im really looking forward to racing in the nascar craftsman truck
1490202 friday will be the first time ive been in a truck at nashville but i am confident that chad norris and the zaxbys team will help me get up to speed quickly everyone keeps telling me that its always hot in nashville in august so ive been working extra hard on my conditioning this summer to be prepared for the heat this weekend
1490203 were going to take the same truck john wes raced at kentucky a few weeks ago hes gaining experience every time he races with us this will be his fourth race of the season in the zaxbys f 150 but hes never raced at nashville before the extra track time in the arca car will certainly help this weekend
1490204 nashville is a long but fun track to race on ive had some decent runs here the past couple of years including picking up the pole back in 2006 the last concrete track we raced at was dover and that wasnt pretty at all so i expect a lot better race this time around the team has put in a lot of extra hours in the shop with the week off preparing for saturday night we are coming down to a handful of races left in the season and if we want to stay in the championship hunt we must keep up the strong finishes if we can do that everything else will fall into place
1490205 my advice to erik this weekend is to hold on tight because nashville is one fast race track the concrete surface and large track size makes it one of the more exciting tracks we visit during the season we are bringing the charlotte truck with us to nashville this truck gave erik his second top five of the season back in may erik really likes the way it handles and i feel it gives us our best shot at a win
1490206 the adjustment will be made in appropriate numbers in order to decrease tensions enough troops will be left to protect our sovereignty and integrity
1490207 we had such a great run in memphis that it was hard to set back and watch at orp
1490208 kyle busch is just a great driver and it was important for me to learn from him on the handling of the truck richie wauters and i work well together and i have learned a lot from him not being in the seat i am ready to put that education to use and finish upfront this weekend in nashville
1490209 grip is often more important than speed this concrete track doesnt give a lot of grip it is pretty bumpy i know though that richie wauters and this miccosukee resort team have put together a fast toyota tundra for us this weekend i would love to have a top 5 finish or maybe even a win

1490214 im looking forward to going to a track that ive already raced at this year i ran the nationwide race in nashville in the spring and really had fun its a great track and its a lot of fun for a driver since im already comfortable with the track we will be able to spend our practice on friday working on race set up and long runs i learned in the first half of the season that its actually more important to make the truck handle well rather than just making it go fast going fast for a few laps doesnt help you if the handling goes away 20 laps into a run its great for qualifying but not a 200 mile race
1490215 i expect colin to have a strong run in nashville saturday night he ran there earlier this year in the nationwide car so that gives him more experience there than most places weve been im looking forward to the second half of the season since well be returning to a lot of tracks and hes learned a lot in the first 14 races hes racing smarter and learning patience
1490216 we broke a motor on thursday we tore the motor apart and they worked all night and all day and got that motor put back together and made it to this race it was unbelievable we drove three hours away from here to charlie longs and rebuilt the thing drove back here and got back at 3am last night my crew was running on like five hours of sleep the last couple of days i couldnt have done it without them
1490217 our pit stops were great and our strategy worked in our favor right now we dont have a crew chief and we are just doing it ourselves its tough being underfunded like we are and not being a big money team but its great to get this win under our belt
1490218 we have been running top 10 almost every race just not being able to finish where we need to we have been right there all year and we finally got the car right and the finish to show it this is just unbelievable maybe it will sink in when i start reading the articles and stuff its hard to believe the race is already over our car was just so good i didnt have to work too hard the crew did their job and got me in the position that we needed to be the car was just perfect
1490219 i remember when i was younger watching bobby gill run around this place on tv in the pro cup series and i said man i want to be there one day and i am finally here its just amazing
1490220 all i want to do is race them clean and earn their respect and i think that i did a good job of earning that tonight

1490289 last year i got to the point were i was frustrated with our results we ran so many races and things just didnt work out then we got hooked up with performance concepts and they helped us out a lot this means a lot to us to pull out our fourth win tonight
1490290 i was underneath him and i was up to his door i was up to his number and he gave me no room what so ever he pushed me down and we were very low on the track i am not going to back out and give it too him i stayed right there with him we almost wrecked twice i didnt want to race like that i would have gotten around him clean if i could have
1490291 it looked like the last lap of a bristol race it was fun
1490292 we started seventh and at the beginning of the race i didnt know for sure if i had the car to win or not i was going to give it my all later on in the race it started coming to me more and more when went back green after the long run the car was just on
1490293 i am going to do all i can do hopefully we can come out with a win that would be awesome i have always wanted to run bristol when we ran pro cup but the budget didnt allow it were ready for next week
1490294 the track is very narrow and im not use to that weve also go to be very careful about tire wear here looks like conserving the brakes is going to be key
1490295 im spinning the tires and trying not to rev it up right now
1490296 i cant see there is oil and dirt all over my windshield
1490297 there was zero visibility out there my windshield kept fogging up on me and it made it impossible to get into the corners then the rain started to fall harder and puddles accumulated on the race track making it that much tougher to drive nascar did the right thing by ending it when they did
1490298 i had never seen a race here so i kept saying nah its going to be racy said seuss after his fifth place run
1490299 it is actually very much about strategy its follow the leader but real real tough once i was here and drove the track i said that i had no idea how i was going to drive with other cars on the track we went out there and learned a lot and now next year maybe i wont be too frightened to come here
1490300 after the wreck up front at the start it moved us up to 12th
1490301 when they came over the radio and said it was half way i said that i wished the race was over because we had all four wheels still left on it it was a good run they kept on preaching patience to me i have the best teachers out there with the riggs family and my father is an excellent drivers coach they kept me cool and we came out with a top five to run with guys that have that much experience here says a lot for our effort here this weekend
1490302 bring an open mind and be ready to adapt because it is wild
1490303 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1490304 ron suskind has chosen to dwell in the netherworld of bizarre conspiracy theories the notion that the white house directed anyone to forge a letter from habbush to saddam hussein is absurd
1490305 as every report and commission on pre war intelligence has concluded the saddam hussein wanted his neighbors to believe he had weapons of mass destruction
1490306 our intelligence estimates at the time and intelligence estimates from other nations believed that he still harbored such weapons we know now that those estimates were wrong but they were the estimates we all relied on regardless military force in iraq was used because saddam hussein defiantly failed to comply with the 17 un security council resolutions iraq was subject to
1490307 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from cia ever involved in any such effort it is well established that at my direction cia resisted efforts on the part of some in the administration to paint a picture of iraqi al qaeda connections that went beyond the evidence the notion that i would suddenly reverse our stance and have created and planted false evidence that was contrary to our own beliefs is ridiculous
1490308 as mr suskind tells it the white house directed and cia allegedly went along with burying that information so that the war could go ahead as planned this is a complete fabrication
1490309 there are undoubtedly many other errors in the book but these are the first ones of which ive been made aware one would think a serious journalist would have at a minimum asked the supposed participants if what he was prepared to write was consistent with the facts mr suskind never contacted me on anything regarding this book i suppose he had a story that fell into the category of too good to check
1490310 it should be noted that the intelligence sources who are quoted in this book in no way disclosed any classified information none crossed the line
1490311 if they go in the other direction i think theyre probably going to have to start firing people
1490312 george said something like well marine ive got a job for you though you may not like it
1490313 richer remembers looking down at the creamy white house stationery on which the assignment was written

1490316 blood curdling igorisms but thats exactly like me damn it
1490317 if philip ball as natures editor had not fought so successfully against crazy eastern europe anti relativists those cranks could have turned gold into silver and so the very foundation of western culture would have been destroyed
1490318 mom guess what my friends at school think i should be a comedian when i grow up isnt that great

1490324 you have to have a certain level of disregard for your body
1490325 i mean if you lead with your head yes youll break yourself
1490326 the whole idea was to bring new people to the table thinking creatively about pittsburgh
1490327 to support local culture which will make the city more interesting
1490328 we invest in whats important to them we invest in their ideas to change communities
1490329 significantly improves the way communities think about themselves these murals are visually compelling articulations of a communitys self image through an artists eyes
1490330 is that theyve made it so that everyday artists have access a lot more simply and frequently theyre so supportive they help artists be productive in the community
1490331 sprouts the coolest thing on the planet its one of the only organizations in town thats put together a new paradigm for non profits bringing people to the table
1490332 this is a city where you can have an idea and make it happen
1490333 sprout facilitates that anyone can have an idea and submit it because sprout takes risks on people this organization sees value where others see things as too out of the ordinary or dont see a direct benefit like the zany umbrella circus a few guys who travel around and put on a circus sprout gave them money to purchase their own tent whos going to give guys money to buy a circus tent
1490334 you need to invest in them how do we get 14 counties to care about pittsburgh 250 lets celebrate what they care about
1490335 but we were shocked at how many people were not the usual suspects grass roots marketing brought in a lot of new people to the process
1490336 there were plenty of introductions between people that had never met before they were geographically and culturally diverse
1490337 first time people like me had a fair shot at getting their projects looked at funding small community oriented projects gives people buy in to the future of this area
1490338 the thread is civic engagement we learned that people are poised to think regionally to build on a network of equity at a grassroots level its momentum for the future
1490339 it took sprout to the next level weve propagated democratic decision making thats both progressive and different from the past
1490340 we are starting to ask ourselves where do we go from here
1490341 how do we continue to find meaningful ways to chart a course for the future through pittsburgh 250 weve seen that one way is to connect small scale activities to larger regional issues
1490342 they found a way to make something impossible possible i think thats a big value to the pittsburgh community lint in the laundromat puppets made of dry lint thats the kind of wacky project i do they saw it as a way to make pittsburgh a more interesting place a giant puppet lending library they continue to be very supportive of my work
1490343 they have this huge sense of trust to see a crazy project come to life because of their trust is just great

1490350 our intention is to really put more value at that price point and offer some amazing proposition to companies
1490351 we expect to hold the price point and add more and more value at that price point
1490352 we want to have commercial relationships with lots of companies and it matters more that we have that than exactly how much dollar per user were getting
1490353 we can certainly hold that price point we can continue to put more capabilities there the cost of an additional application to us is tiny its hardly material there are certainly types of applications that we could add that would add cost and we would price appropriately but i dont expect the price to climb that wouldnt be my expectation
1490354 id like all the holes in the feature set to be filled but ill say generally were not in the model of trying to replicate the products that work really well for what they do
1490355 never knew what that was i turned it off and problem solved
1490356 theyre a continuation of our efforts in security but theyre also a reflection of a changing threat environment

1490359 it was a mistake to launch mobileme at the same time as iphone 3g iphone 2 0 software and the app store
1490360 we all had more than enough to do and mobileme could have been delayed without consequence
1490361 the mobileme launch clearly demonstrates that we have more to learn about internet services and learn we will
1490362 the vision of mobileme is both exciting and ambitious and we will press on to make it a service we are all proud of by the end of this year
1490363 this case highlights our increasing vulnerability to the theft of personal information
1490364 computer networks and the internet are an indispensable part of the world economy but even as they provide extraordinary opportunities for legitimate commerce and communication they also provide extraordinary opportunities for criminals where criminals are able to breach computer security systems as alleged here they have enormous ability to cause harm

1490367 owning the windows pc is not really a priority anymore
1490368 all the basic really easy exploits you could use against network services are really gone
1490369 to me its part of the toolkit when you do forensics but its not the only tool you should rely on
1490370 we sort of get a pass because no one wants to monkey with the infrastructure that theyre using
1490371 its like screwing up the freeway while youre trying to go to a different city

1490385 how many people get the chance to coach another country i would say you play for your country thats all good but i coach for soccer
1490386 ive seen the changes all the improvement and development in womens soccer so for me its about coaching for the sport
1490387 international sports is very much international now in the last olympic games the chinese mens basketball team had a u s coach del harris
1490388 i think for coaching were going around the world and its normal for me im very happy and honored to coach the u s team as a chinese person
1490389 my message to democratic lawmakers is this if youre really for increased american energy production then prove it by putting it in writing sign the discharge petitions house republicans are circulating that will force votes on energy legislation speaker pelosi refuses to bring to the floor and sign onto the american energy act our all of the above plan to increase conservation innovation and american energy production instead of doing the speakers bidding by voting against bringing it to a vote if you arent willing to put it in writing youre fooling no one youre siding with the speaker of the drill nothing congress and radical special interests that favor higher gas prices at the expense of energy strapped american families
1490390 this cynical strategy is disgustingly dishonest without any real solutions to help americans who are struggling with record high gas prices it appears the democratic leadership has hit on a new plan deceive deceive the press deceive its members and deceive the american people democratic members have a pass from their leaders to talk about drilling at home while the liberal democratic leadership which is beholden to special interests that want higher gas prices plays rope a dope back in washington ensuring there is no vote to help the american people before november its cynical dishonest and wrong and it wont work
1490391 conspiracy theorists rejoice because youre going to be right eventually

1490398 it was way too out of control for what we were trying to do we couldnt see anything so we had to stop to see out the windshield
1490399 we had a strategy and we were going to stick to it
1490400 when it started raining like that just about everything went out the window rain is one thing but a monsoon like that changed everyones strategy once the track got saturated the only strategy was to stay on course and finish kelly did that so it was a successful trip
1490401 my second road course race a downpour a speeding penalty an unscheduled stop to wipe off my windshield and i wheel hopped off track all that and we still finished
1490402 we were up against a lot of obstacles but we accomplished our main goal of bringing this car home in one piece it may take a week to dry everything out but well have the car ready for next weeks race i feel a little more comfortable on the road courses now lets hope it doesnt rain at watkins glen
1490403 we were going to have a good day i thought but i couldnt see
1490404 it was a safety thing we had to pit under green and they threw the caution a lap later and it just bit us they did the right thing

1490414 the negotiations are ongoing with egypt and it s still unclear whether we ll have to take a writedown in egypt or not
1490415 we ve been in egypt for many years doing all the pre work for this and so hopefully we can come to an arrangement that is mutually acceptable to both parties
1490416 there is a possibility that we will be in egypt longer term if we can come up to an arrangement with them
1490417 the situation shows how many different stakeholders it takes to get any project going so as a result agrium like everybody else has to compromise
1490418 it s too bad because it was bound to be a good project for the area
1490419 i don t think you ll see them desperately doing a deal because they want to replace this i think they will consider any alternatives in the usual patient matter
1490420 we ve got other expansion plans in potash and we ve just expanded our retail pretty considerably
1490421 it was really a perfect storm that catapulted oil to its record of us 147 and now bit by bit you re seeing that really subside
1490422 bottom line the trend is moving down and probably will continue to do so slowly but surely for the next six months
1490423 economic activity expanded in the second quarter partly reflecting growth in consumer spending and exports
1490424 inflation has been high spurred by the earlier increases in the prices of energy and some other commodities
1490425 it was supposed to contain screws which it did but it also contained a note and an unknown substance
1490426 it was a very simple note and from what i heard it wasn t even that rational
1490427 the probability of it being a hoax or not we don t even go there we just assume in every case that the threat s serious
1490428 it was supposed to contain screws which it did but it also contained a note and an unknown substance
1490429 we re taking the threat seriously and we should hope to have some results this afternoon as far as what we re dealing with
1490430 it was a very simple note and from what i heard it wasn t even that rational
1490431 the probability of it being a hoax or not we don t even go there we just assume in every case that the threat s serious
1490432 israel is surprised at the need to open an interests section and about the timing of the american move
1490433 we receive reassuring messages from the americans but on the other hand questions arise in light of the intention to open an interests section
1490434 how do i choose the right programs for my children
1490435 researchers divided students into three groups a program only group of students who attended their afterschool program two or three times a week and did nothing else outside the school a program plus group who visited the afterschool programs two or three times a week and also took part in sports church programs music lessons or other extracurricular activities and a low supervision group who dropped in on a mix of afterschool activities from one to three days a week the researchers found over the course of the three year project that the more engaged students were in supervised afterschool activities the better they did on a range of academic social and behavioral outcomes for instance 3rd and 4th graders in the program plus group tallied gains on standardized mathematics tests that were 20 percentile points higher than those of children who rarely went the frequent attendees also made more progress in developing sound work habits task persistence and better social skills and in reducing negative behaviors such as skipping school or fighting
1490436 remove the regulations and or bail us out or thousands of jobs will be lost
1490437 every pound per square inch of tire underinflation wastes 4 million gallons of gas daily in the u s
1490438 the maximum estimated fuel economy i e mileage savings drivers could expect as a result of keeping their engines properly tuned 4 replacing air filters up to 10 properly inflating tires up to 3 and using the correct motor oil 1 2 is 18 19 since american drivers use roughly 380 million gallons of gasoline not including diesel per day an 18 improvement translates into a savings of 68 million gallons or 1 62 million barrels of oil per day
1490439 so the production offset is more likely to approach 800 thousand barrels per day a tidy sum and a worthwhile target for savings but not equal to ocs output
1490440 mcacin wants to keep troops in iraq for 100 years
1490441 you cannot call proper vehicle maintenance a solution to the energy problem
1490442 if you are not going to do those things obama is not going to make you magically start doing them
1490443 for very little effort you could help out and save money
1490444 if you dont already take care of your car you are probably part of the non voting mouth breathing part of america
1490445 the real solution to gas being so high is doing something about how hard the oil companies are us right now
1490446 ask not what your country can do for you but what you can do for your country
1490447 hed like to take more of that out of your pocket because some other guy cant pay
1490448 well while you may disagree with global warming doesnt it suck breathing in smoggy air cant be good for kids right well lets clean that up
1490449 some of us put that lame bribe in a savings account some of us do what we can to make ends meet even checking our tires and maintaining our crappy oil guzzling american made cars since you repugs refuse to offer any alternative
1490450 theres a blogger thats asserting the person making the assertion is a forensics expert
1490451 the american people will just drive that much more if they can squeeze another mile out of their tank
1490452 and isnt 3 the savings nationally when richard nixon decided to toss all sense out the window and make 55mph the law i dont recall that the us became energy independent then either if it really is cheaper to go 55 then why does my truck get 2 mpg more at 72
1490453 as president of planet spaceball i can assure both you and your viewers that theres absolutely no air shortage whatsoever
1490454 the oil companies and i want to be perfectly clear on this point are private businesses and theres not a damn thing politicians can do to make them lower their prices
1490455 if it really is cheaper to go 55 then why does my truck get 2 mpg more at 72
1490456 wow i just came up with my energy policy with this idea and no others i will steal the election
1490457 so that would meet about 1 of our demand two decades from now
1490458 nashville is a place where i really want to win and get one of those cool guitars trophies its right up there with that elvis trophy from memphis we had a good run at nashville last year and finished second the truck was good and rick ren crew chief made an air pressure adjustment to the right side tires on the last stop and really made the truck come alive we were able to get up there and run with the leaders we need to follow that up with another strong run this year and keep ourselves in contention for the points lead
1490459 we qualified 14th last year and we worked on the truck throughout the race and finished second this year we want to gain one more spot and get that guitar
1490460 the brand is the basic fundamental of a company and has got a life of its own it has to be worked on fertilised strengthened and packaged
1490461 we have got the internal expertise but we wanted it to be the best so we got outsiders to come in
1490462 when you are standing on your own ground looking at yourself it helps to have an external party to look at you and tell you who you are
1490463 they also understand the customer from another angle so their input is very valuable
1490464 nowadays we also have customers from as far away as the central area
1490465 when you build a brand with high customer loyalty it is easier and less costly to retain their loyalty compared to winning over a new customer

1490468 it was treacherous it was tricky but i think all the drivers kept of the race track for the most part and we got a race in which is important i think to nascars credit for not running rain races very often that they did a pretty good job
1490469 we had a great day going i just sped down pit lane actually i took off too early i couldnt see the end of pit lane i just couldnt see it the line on the race track i couldnt see it i couldnt see the cone i waited until i got passed scott pruett and counted to three and took off and i must have just jumped the line but 20 or 30 feet i feel robbed about it to be honest with you
1490470 weve been in position to win and had the best car twice and couldnt close the deal
1490471 they couldnt keep the race going it was too wet
1490472 i guess i could be mad at nascar but im not im mad at myself for making a mistake its hard to see that cone i guess a lot of guys got penalized for doing the same thing but its just the way it goes
1490473 the thing ive learned for the next road course is i dont want to race in the rain again
1490474 that win still is alluding me i guess if you keep knocking on the door it will come i feel comfortable out there i feel like i belong if we keep this up the win will fall our way
1490475 i always like to run well but especially at this race every year
1490476 my uncle is the reason my brother scott and i got in to racing so its always nice when i can run well at the detjens race
1490477 my car was a little loose during the day and i think i just tightened it up too much for the feature as the sun went down and the track cooled down my car just got too tight
1490478 kaukauna is always a tough place for my family to go
1490479 but ive been there quite a few times and raced there since my uncle was killed so ive kind of dealt with those emotions
1490480 the iowa race was a lot of fun and to get a top five was great for me and the whole team
1490481 kaukaunas a pretty rough race track from what i remember but we hope to keep this recent momentum going
1490482 i would give us a b even though our results dont show it we have run really well our team has come together in a very short period of time we still have a few bugs to be worked out here and there but all in all were a good quality team i believed from the beginning of this season that we are a championship caliber team and i still believe that ernie cope crew chief and the guys bring me quality fast trucks to the track week in and week out it is just unfortunate that we have been victims of circumstances beyond our control
1490483 weve been running well but have had some bad luck the past couple of races this solid finish was much needed for all of us we knew we were much better than the 19th place qualifying spot but my crew chief jonathan davis worked hard to get my car where it was comfortable and we knew that we would definitely be competitive in the race my guys did a great job this weekend and i really appreciate it
1490484 fast as heck but gets tighter and tighter as the run goes on
1490485 all i saw was smoke behind me and then a car flying through the air
1490486 we had a really fast race car that was great on long runs
1490487 unfortunately we didnt have those long green flag runs at the end im very happy with our solid finish and this aarons lucky dog dream machine toyota hats off to my guys were looking forward to another great run in nashville
1490488 backspace is relatively new but its the real deal which is amply proved both by the quality of discourse within and the truly amazing hit rate its members have already achieved
1490489 i love being associated with you guys such a class act backspace is the pre eminent writers organization because you guys have made it so always innovating thinking outside the box and just generally doing conferences bigger and better than they have been done before im just honored to have been there from the start
1490490 i mention backspace whenever i teach my writers workshop around the country the yearly backspace conference is an invaluable resource ive taught there and cant say enough good things about the information encouragement and enthusiasm they provide
1490491 i have never had such an excellent time at a conference the presenters were uniformly accessible and pleasant the overall mood was also excellent
1490492 the workshop was so well organized and run bravo to all of you who worked to pull together a truly remarkable event well worth the price of admission
1490493 the superlatives just flow whenever i try to describe my experience at the conference i cant say enough or thank you enough superb as i keep telling folks its impossible to convey what i took away from the experience because the most valuable things are the intangibles
1490494 it was the best writing conference ive ever attended on all dimensions the amount of new information real contact with other writers and people in the industry and the level of truth telling made it stand out

1490505 our hope is that people will be motivated to sell what would other wise be thrown away many people throw away clothing items that perhaps a child has grown out of and is in wonderful condition well with the internet there are billions of people that may be looking for such they really love to shop for deals everyday the wonderful thing about this program is they get a deal and the seller makes money allowing people to list for free on the auction if listing used items our belief if people can earn a little money they will be more then likely to sell it then throw it away

1490624 but i feel our boys have been showing continuous improvement as the league progresses our results at the start of the season were poor because we were truly surprised by how high the standard of play is in the s league
1490625 we lost some pretty good players like li zhichao and especially our joint top scorer lu peng who were called up to the senior squad
1490626 they played at national youth levels so their experience will be sorely missed
1490627 i was really excited about scoring that goal it was truly a great feeling
1490628 ive had no problems settling in so far except maybe getting used to the heat here i just need some time to gel well with the rest of the team i still get very nervous when i get on field but ill get over that

1490965 the trouble with you mr gough is you are a dreamer however the best thing about you mr gough is that you are a dreamer
1490966 what has been significantly underappreciated is how jesus changed the way his followers actually engaged life he launched a movement that unleashed previously untapped potential in those who believed in him he created an environment where his disciples began to believe the impossible and soon found they were turning dreams into reality his became a movement of dreamers and visionaries they were called and compelled to dream of a better world he called them to touch the whole of humanity with his message of life and love theirs was a life of faith and a call to accomplish great things by serving humanity this is one of the things i love about jesus and the scriptures they call us to dream and to dream with our eyes open to live wide awake you have to begin to dream you have to dare to dream great dreams and find the courage to live them

1490973 the earth is flat and horizontally infinite it stretches horizontally forever
1490974 this is perhaps one of the most commonly asked questions

1490976 they are one of evolutions most useful and prevalent inventions ninety five percent of living species are equipped with eyes and they exist in many different forms learn how the ancestors of jellyfish may have been the first to evolve light sensitive cells discover how dinosaurs evolved eyes that helped them become successful hunters finally learn how primates evolved unique adaptations to their eyes that allowed them to better exploit their new habitat and how the ability to see colors helped them find food

1491009 most incidents relate to old buildings which have now been demolished at pembury hospital there is no specific problem
1491010 labour have said over and over again that they will improve cleanliness in our hospitals but these figures clearly show that they are failing it is difficult for health service estates to maintain a completely pest free environment but the level and variety of these infestations is concerning
1491011 we need greater transparency in nhs infection control and publishing data like this is one way in which we can drive up overall hygiene standards
1491012 we receive a wide range of information on hygiene from different sources however concerns around pest control have to date been negligible
1491013 clearly it may be necessary to take action against pests in these large public buildings from time to time
1491014 however it is important for hospital trusts to have robust procedures in place to deal with any pest problems and if they persist trusts should question whether they have the right systems in place
1491015 if we were concerned that the safety of patients was at risk through poor hygiene standards or in any other way we would take immediate action
1491016 hospitals must be responsible for ensuring their buildings are clean and that patient safety is not compromised the hygiene code requires nhs bodies to have a pest control policy that anticipates and manages this issue
1491017 trusts should take rapid action and follow through with surveillance in place to avoid pest incidents and minimize hazards use of pest control is a sign of good proactive management
1491018 the claim that insects spread hospital acquired infections is entirely unproven there is no evidence of their carriage of antibiotic resistant bacteria being a hazard to patients despite this we expect hospitals to take continued action to tackle pest problems
1491019 these figures must be put into context it goes without saying that as the fourth largest trust in the country our hospitals are bigger than most others around the country and therefore our figures should be compared with trusts with similar sized estates rather than smaller acute trusts

1491027 what many do gooders fail to acknowledge is that it is not enough to do good one must also confront then work artfully at marginalizing out witting out designing and out performing the forces of evil that are afoot in the world forces like greed hate terror racism misunderstanding obfuscation and fear heroism is only as strong as the calumny it overcomes
1491028 imagine that we lived in a world where all photography was the kind you see in magazines in this world all photos are taken by professionals and all the people who got their pictures taken are models at the peak of their career if you had your picture taken normally youd think you were hideously ugly that is the musical world we grew up in and its bogus things dont have to be that way

1491030 much as the rise of proprietary software led to the free software movement we expect the rise of proprietary databases to result in a free data movement within the next decade one can see early signs of this countervailing trend in open data projects such as wikipedia the creative commons and in software projects like greasemonkey which allow users to take control of how data is displayed on their computer
1491031 vehicle platform sharing combined with advanced and flexible manufacturing technology enables automakers to sharply reduce product development and changeover times while modular design and assembly allow building a greater variety of vehicles from one basic set of engineered components many vendors refer to this as product or vehicle architecture
1491032 hondas share of vietnams motorcycle market for instance dropped from nearly 90 percent in 1997 to 30 percent in 2002
1491033 in a multisided strategy the software platform mainly facilitates inter actions between the sides of the platform particularly applications vendors and end users
1491034 in the case of the software platforms we have examined even the weakest relationships are far deeper than the relationships one sees in many one sided industries software platforms cant have direct relationships with the thousands of small developers hardware makers and peripheral device makers yet they document and make apis available to developers provide interface information to hardware and peripheral makers and make sure their platforms have the relevant drivers for the peripherals and they develop relationships through large developer conferences and small focus groups that bring some of these smaller players together at the other extreme software platforms often have deep relationships with several larger partners these relationships involve regular exchange of information and joint work on defining new standards and specifications they may also involve joint investments in product development or marketing
1491035 platform providers must determine how much of the value created through network
1491036 there can be no long value chains where each employee is a rung in a ladder with all the value ultimately flowing to the top such hierarchical organizations are essentially immobile by design they are not capable of creating new capabilities because everyone in the vertical hierarchy is participating in a way that only serves the existing value chain this is great for incremental innovations as such a structure essentially institutionalizes the process of adding more value to existing value chains it is not so effective though for creating new value chains

1491055 level four is the gold standard which the government puts a lot of weight on we know schools run booster classes for pupils who are just below that mark but it doesnt explain why the difference is so marked this year
1491056 the level five results are not as important to schools as level four results the targets are at level four and thats where all the effort goes
1491057 vote of confidence in the markers and the validation of their hard work over the last few months
1491058 i still cant understand why the results were published in the first place the previous decision to remove borderlining checking of test scripts that fall just below level thresholds combined with etss incompetence can only increase the size of the question mark over the results
1491059 these are alarming figures suggesting that fewer pupils are achieving excellence and that pupils are not being stretched to the best of their abilities
1491060 since labour came to power a total of over 3 million pupils have not obtained the basics in the three rs and ministers have still failed to hit targets that they promised to meet two years ago
1491061 no one thing is going to be the silver bullet and the quality and diversity of education that children and young people receive will be absolutely crucial in terms of engagement post 16 whether compulsory or not
1491062 if you inspire children to learn in whatever format they will want to continue the crucial part is the making sure education is about the whole child and not just what they learn in maths and english
1491063 where young people have a sense of hope for the future they are much less likely to get pregnant
1491064 a decis o da corte reflete a gravidade da conduta b rbara do condenado

1491066 the centre of marketing excellence for government it provides strategic advice consultancy procurement and project management for public information campaigns
1491067 this problem was acute at southwark a suite run entirely on overtime and which in spite of an earlier extremely critical internal report was still unfit for use
1491068 i used to refer to people who carry the opinions i carry today as cynics and conspiracy theorists
1491069 the experience has made me extremely cynical of the police force the government the mod and the establishment
1491070 i let the story people wanted to tell me lead me to the play
1491071 i never asked a leading question and was careful to get people to tell me what they wanted to tell me its an important story it goes into every area of the state the government the judiciary the police the army and the mod
1491072 if it was suicide what made these four children do it
1491073 there must have been something going on to make four apparently happy and healthy people do that
1491074 but i wouldnt dream of telling you what they are ive looked at all the available evidence in the way that nicholas blake did in his review my ideas hold no more water than his in my opinion unless you were standing there when it happened you dont know
1491075 the play is focusing on the parents quest for justice rather than speculating on what happened
1491076 they know their own children they were such happy go lucky boys and suicide wasnt in keeping with the way their lives were going they are adamant their children didnt commit suicide so it follows that someone else killed them
1491077 it was subdued after the first two deaths but it rose again in 2001 and 2002 when you have a similar situation mysterious deaths and more to the point no investigation that shows the culture in the camp is at the core of this
1491078 it is an appalling wrong in a civilised society that four kids can die and we can allow our government to dance around justice in the way that they have i dont think its something i can walk away from
1491079 at shelter we see many homeowners owing very small amounts of money whose lives are wrecked by some particularly sub prime lenders racing to repossess
1491080 the fsas call for fair treatment of customers is a good first step but as the regulator it must now put its money where its mouth is and clamp down on merciless mortgage lenders who are robbing people of their homes
1491081 surprised at the fsas observations on specialist lenders who have been working extremely hard to manage arrears
1491082 our data shows in these current market conditions more people are struggling to meet their mortgage payments and it is vital that firms treat them fairly repossession has to be the last resort
1491083 consumers generally arrived at the belief that lenders were not in a position or possibly not willing to take account of personal circumstance
1491084 one or two examples of intimidating contact were cited from customers of sub prime lenders including having experienced frequent phone calls at inappropriate times of the day demanding payment or calls warning of bailiff action
1491085 will be more prolonged than we thought a year ago it is important to be straight with people
1491086 stamp duty acts as a material disincentive to moving and reforms would help first time buyers but removing stamp duty only addresses buyer confidence not the wider problems in the financial markets
1491087 the government estimates that 2 5 million families are living in fuel poverty yet despite the billions in profits the energy industry spends just 50m a year combating fuel poverty and has only agreed to raise this to 150m by 2010
1491088 its really sad ive had to close after 15 years because my mother is extremely ill and ive had to give up to look after her
1491089 happy to be in the midst of so many asian babes
1491090 in fact im happy that the podium covers me from the waist down
1491091 while british attitudes are more egalitarian than in the 1980s there are signs that support for gender equality may have hit a high point some time during the 1990s
1491092 when it comes to the clash between work and family life doubts about whether a woman should be doing both are starting to creep in
1491093 attempts to shoehorn women into workplaces made by men for men have failed
1491094 women still shoulder the bulk of caring and housework at home the long working hours culture and lack of flexible working means women are presented with impossible choices forced to choose between caring for a family at home or maximising their career opportunities the result motherhood carries a penalty and women and men are straitjacketed by gender stereotypes
1491095 many mothers tell us that in the first year of a babys life they want to stay at home but often feel they have to return to work too early because of financial constraints we need to do more to help mothers and fathers by increasing well paid parental leave and changing how it can be shared between them
1491096 the results are even more extreme in the us where the percentage of people arguing that family life does not suffer if a woman works has plummeted from 51 in 1994 to 38 in 2002
1491097 the notion that there has been a steady increase in favour of women taking an equal role in the workplace and away from their traditional role in the home is clearly a myth
1491098 instead there is clear evidence that womens changing role is viewed as having costs both for the woman and the family
1491099 it is conceivable that opinions are shifting as the shine of the super mum syndrome wears off and the idea of women juggling high powered careers while also baking cookies and reading bedtime stories is increasingly seen to be unrealisable by ordinary mortals
1491100 in britain and the us however where support for equal opportunities for both sexes is much longer standing some people are now starting to have second thoughts
1491101 in most cases this appears to revolve around concerns that the welfare of children and of the family are being compromised the more women spend their time at work and find themselves lumbered with the double burden of employment and family care
1491102 we are still educating to confirm a gender role division that people thought was eradicated 25 years ago
1491103 at the moment in the uk we are heading in the wrong direction after a period when there was greater support at an ideological level for an equal division of labour
1491104 if we are to make progress in devising policies that encourage equal working opportunities for women we need to know more about what gender roles people view as practical as possible and as fair
1491105 by making all roles flexible at every level ending the long working hours culture and challenging discriminatory attitudes women and men could participate in the workplace on an equal footing and live free from stereotypes about whose role it is to do the caring
1491106 when this happens business the economy and society as a whole will all reap the benefits
1491107 the british economy cannot afford not to have women in the workforce women make up 45 of employees in an age when we have significant skill shortages we cannot miss out on any part of the talent pool
1491108 our latest research shows 79 of organisations are struggling to recruit and 75 are struggling to retain skills they have to think how to address the need for more flexibility for women and men
1491109 a family does not suffer if a woman is in full time employment
1491110 it is the husbands job to earn income and the wifes to look after the children
1491111 the problems relating to affordability and tight lending conditions run pretty deep
1491112 probably the main help it would provide is in helping first time buyers coming up with the deposit they need to buy a house
1491113 they are in such a mess at the moment you wonder if they can afford it
1491114 in a weakening housing market stamp duty acts as a material disincentive to moving and reforms would help first time buyers and the wider housing market
1491115 removing stamp duty only addresses buyer confidence not the wider problems in the financial markets
1491116 men have been under siege by a culture that too often embraces the notion that men are to blame for all lifes ills
1491117 i define power as control over ones life a balanced life is far superior to the male definition of power earning money someone else spends while he dies sooner
1491118 it is essential that women receive the right education and information so they understand the techniques of control frequently used by abusive men
1491119 once she recognises theres a problem she can do something about it the government spends very little on education campaigns on what is a major social problem
1491120 we need more prevention rather than just picking up the pieces research says that it takes on average 35 beatings before a woman seeks help thats a long way down the road
1491121 even where the conduct itself does not result in a conviction of a crime
1491122 the mist in the air that we see in those places including here is not a feature of pollution primarily but a feature of evaporation and humidity
1491123 we do have a communication problem here once the misconception has become sort of established in the minds of people its not that easy to get the right message through
1491124 i would not discourage athletes from wearing protection devices if they are concerned but i do not think it is necessary i would not wear one whether i was an athlete or not
1491125 exaggeration of the problem that has been seen in the media
1491126 those who standards are fairly tough to meet but in many respects the beijing area does so im sure im confident the air quality will not prove to pose major problems to the athletes and to the visitors in beijing
1491127 we have had some readings that were above the interim target data but since then they have gone down and been below that level we will evaluate those pollution levels and should problems arise we may have to take some action
1491128 to come to a city even though the air quality might be inferior the long term effects should no longer be feared by temporary visitors
1491129 loveland captivated me with its modern day twist on the dating format bringing something fresh and exciting to the genre
1491130 cilla is the undisputed queen of the dating show theres been many pretenders to her throne but she remains in a class of her own
1491131 the vibrant energetic look reflects our strengthening entertainment positioning and puts the standout content right at its heart
1491132 abbas dancing queen or knowing me knowing you is better than the entire collected works of van morrison
1491133 this acquisition will allow us to achieve a deeper and more robust integration between the wide ranging global assets of the music company and sonys products operating companies and affiliates it enables us to offer a total entertainment experience to consumers
1491134 i spend my life trying to block out other peoples needs
1491135 there isnt a company out there that we compete with that i dont want to see smashed into the ground
1491136 for me this is still a business decision you know this is outlay versus reward
1491137 boom diddy boom diddy boom diddy boom well goodness gracious me
1491138 darling you look marvellous in that white coat and the stethoscope gives you that touch of butch and i loved the way you slapped the prescription pad down and looked over your half moons and said i think we can sort this out for you it gave me shivers down my spine honestly now i wonder what thats a symptom of
1491139 many people consider that the use of disinterested to mean not interested is incorrect and that uninterested should be used
1491140 to avoid danger of misunderstanding it may be safer to replace disinterested by unbiased or impartial
1491141 without doubt the sense uninterested is making a strong challenge at the present time
1491142 a regrettable tendency has emerged in recent years especially in non standard english in britain and abroad to construe the verb bore with of
1491143 at the moment we say we prefer bored with or bored by but id be very surprised if a few years down the line we wont be saying bored of
1491144 the distinction that exists between disinterested and uninterested is worth maintaining
1491145 disinterested party for example is a very useful and precise phrase
1491146 but there are other causes of change which though slow in their operation and invisible in their progress are perhaps as much superior to human resistance as the revolutions of the sky or intumescence of the tide
1491147 because teaching to the tests means that pupils may not retain or may not even possess in the first place the skills which are supposedly evidenced by their test results
1491148 to industrialise an area of great and fragile beauty for a near negligible gain is entirely against the spirit of any environmental policy rooted in common sense and practical solutions on a small and crowded island like ours we count ourselves lucky that there remain still places of such tranquillity and loveliness as reeves hill we owe it to our childrens children to preserve such treasures and at the same time take rational steps to limit our greenhouse gas emissions
1491149 i think its unlikely were going to hit the first year target of 5 9 billion its too early to say how big a miss it is
1491150 the state still has plenty of money to cover its needs
1491151 reduction in the future rate of increase in property taxes
1491152 unfortunately poor minority and low achieving students are far more likely to be taught by an under qualified teacher than their more affluent white and high achieving peers
1491153 the students most in need of the most qualified teachers are the least likely to be taught by them
1491154 labour have said over and over that they will improve cleanliness in our hospitals but these figures clearly show that they are failing
1491155 in countries with good standards of healthcare the possibility for insects or pests to transmit infections in hospitals would be very remote
1491156 in the uk wounds are treated appropriately and dressings applied to ensure good hygiene and prevent infection
1491157 how can patients be safe amid bedbugs fleas and rats these findings reveal what happens when money is taken away from where patients expect to see it spent
1491158 if these hospitals were restaurants they would be closed down and out of business
1491159 clearly it may be necessary to take action against pests in these large public buildings from time to time
1491160 however it is important for hospital trusts to have robust procedures in place to deal with any pest problems
1491161 the hygiene code requires nhs bodies to have a pest control policy that anticipates and manages this issue
1491162 trusts should take rapid action and follow through with surveillance in place to avoid pest incidents and minimize hazards
1491163 the thing thats always been missing in the linux desktop world is the business model
1491164 if we can make it as simple as possible for people to use it as an alternative whether on pcs or on mobile devices that is the way to go kindle amazon coms always connected electronic book reader has done that should serve as an inspiration to linux developers
1491165 the slow adoption of vista among businesses and budget conscious cios coupled with the proven success of a new type of microsoft free pc in every region provides an extraordinary window of opportunity for linux
1491166 well work to unlock the desktop to save our customers money and give freedom of choice
1491167 to liberate small businesses from microsofts proprietary small business server
1491168 there is a huge national push to conduct training and anti school violence seminars
1491169 its for anyone who would be interested in stopping the growing problem of school violence
1491170 we need to be aware that its around us and we need to combat it
1491171 marjorie has some videos of other columbine students that she made just for this presentation
1491172 is really just to bring an awareness to school violence
1491173 we will talk about my experiences that day my friends experiences and the five stages of the active shooter
1491174 the montgomery county sheriffs office recognizes the school violence epidemic and we are committed to working with other law enforcement agencies fire departments and the community to prevent school violence
1491175 i personally know of a couple different cases in montgomery county where kids have written down threats and plans that they were intending to carry out but they were stopped

1491184 during dinner they would lean in and kiss each other over the table
1491185 had his arm around williams and kissed her on the cheeks then on the lips
1491186 frankly i think that a lot of the intellectual property we create are better than the licenses that doesnt mean there isnt room for great licenses theres room for both
1491187 i think what youre noticing is that in years gone by we havent had as many great original intellectual properties theres a lot more of that this year from ea and i think from here forward
1491188 i think what redeems our industry is quality and i think we take a step back every time we take a license and exploit it with a crappy game thats not what were about
1491189 phoebe i need a lab coat up here stat seems like our chemists are getting clumsy next thing you know well be spilling chemicals on each other and the facility will be a disaster
1491190 dr snyder weve made a breakthrough with the new chemical
1491191 weve been testing this chemical on the rats for some time now even though our goal is to give life to inanimate objects
1491192 however we made a few adjustments and instead of killing the rats
1491193 however the only problem is that this effect only lasts a few seconds you see this chemical contains a hazardous acid and it quickly dissolves the rats internal organs
1491194 its not good enough ill need to work with this later in the day give me a copy of your work
1491195 i will be here till six today trying to fix things up seeing what we can do about it
1491196 you shouldnt go without dinner and try concentrating on your work it will drive you mad
1491197 after all if i stick at this for a while shell be asleep by the time i come home
1491198 his schedule for next week has not even been set up
1491199 i think post storm is the time communities really need to come together and people need to be surrounded by their peers
1491200 thats what im trying to allow here allow people to tell a good story or a bad story but everybody has a story that has to be told
1491201 weve been so dry flooding hasnt been much of an issue
1491202 were prepared to identify problems identify resources and supply those resources if needed
1491203 its just now starting to recede at one point it was up to four feet in the front yard
1491204 the van is going to be one of those insurance cases
1491205 chlamydia is the most common sexually transmitted disease in the uk and up to 70 of people who have it have no symptoms and could therefore remain undiagnosed
1491206 we are keen to support the availability of more medicines over the counter where it is safe to do so
1491207 reclassifying azithromycin will expand on existing services and improve access to chlamydia screening and treatment for patients
1491208 for people who are already testing themselves at home it is a really positive step forward that the treatment can now also be bought from pharmacies
1491209 they woke up this morning and saw the chairs in the pool so that was pretty interesting
1491210 he said wed be ok once the storm passed over
1491211 but when we got here and saw people boarding up the windows my wife got a little nervous
1491212 the winds were blowing too hard out of the north
1491213 that intersection has flooded all my life but with the new drainage project kicked in it didnt flood
1491214 in terms of feedstock we do have a supply of crude in tanks that will enable us to continue running for the foreseeable future
1491215 we had very little rain and a breeze of 5 to 10 mph
1491216 weve had worse thunderstorms than this like the squall that came through sunday night
1491217 and in the spirit of happily ever after he even learned to read
1491218 tell me when i can actually take delivery until then interesting but not exciting
1491219 no way do i want to give up that right

1491239 i sometimes question whether im in the same party i started off in
1491240 ive been in the senate a long time and theres nobody ive liked more than chuck hagel
1491241 i asked barack obama what he wanted for his birthday
1491242 so now the republicans are going around this is the kind of thing they do i dont understand it theyre going around theyre sending like little tire gauges making fun of this idea as if this is barack obamas energy plan
1491243 now two points one they know theyre lying about what my energy plan is but the other thing is theyre making fun of a step that every expert says would absolutely reduce our oil consumption by 3 to 4 percent its like these guys take pride in being ignorant
1491244 obama to america youre all ignorant and im going to school all you idiots
1491245 why is your avatar a black man with a white face

1491249 our minister for magic says the school will be open he feels that every child of the magical community must be educated and armed and it is the duty of hogwarts to do it
1491250 but will the wizards allow their children to come here after all what has happened
1491251 but i feel at least some family might allow their children if the ministry satisfies them with their security systems i think scrimgoeur would be able to do it he is efficient isnt he however i hope many like harry would still want to study you will study wouldnt you potter
1491252 our minister told me that he wants a word with you
1491253 but he asked me to inform you and said that it was about the reopening of hogwarts and its nothing about the night our former headmaster was killed
1491254 i feel you should meet him if its about reopening the school had dumbledore been alive he would have felt the same
1491255 thank you we have to talk to one of the ministrys officer and i think you wouldnt feel happy to be questioned if you wish you can stay here
1491256 so are you going to see the minister i was listening
1491257 it will be better if you see him but be careful not to speak anything unwise

1491264 here comes the orator with his flood of words and his drop of reason
1491265 people who make careers out of helping others sometimes at great sacrifice often not usually dont like to hear that those others might get along fine might even get along better without their help
1491266 success is not final failure is not fatal it is the courage to continue that counts
1491267 it is essential to the triumph of reform that it should never succeed
1491268 what is amazing this year is how many people have bought the fundamentally childish notion that if you dont like the way things are going the answer is to write a blank check for generic change empowering someone chosen not on the basis of any track record but on the basis of his skill with words
1491269 so senator obama and his campaign decided that it would be inappropriate to visit wounded soldiers in germany while touring europe as a candidate for the presidency senator mccain hit this one right on the head it is never inappropriate to visit our wounded men and women in uniform
1491270 barack obama represents an obnoxiously elitist attitude that reeks of paternalistic government
1491271 sen obama owes it to the public to let us know how much of our hard earned money he in his wisdom believes we have a moral obligation to give away to poor people around the world and how much of our money that he has a moral obligation to extract from our wages forcefully through federal taxation
1491272 the time may be coming when our lunatic environmental policies are swept away by a rising tide of common sense
1491273 obama is a three year senator without a single important legislative achievement to his name a former illinois state senator who voted present nearly 130 times as president of the harvard law review as law professor and as legislator has he ever produced a single notable piece of scholarship written a single memorable article his most memorable work is a biography of his favorite subject himself
1491274 obama was in germany last week and 200 000 people showed up there was so many germans shouting and screaming that france surrendered just in case

1491278 i swore an oath to have as many oaths sworn at me as humanly possible if you only serve halfway through the month youre not completing the whole cycle of insults invective and offense you dont want to just dive into the pool and not get your feet wet because that would probably mean you dove into the shallow end and hit your head or something
1491279 i feel weve been very diligent in our efforts as commissioners to take the scorn and disdain people may not have liked how we voted but theyve liked the way weve taken the abuse

1491290 theres a pent up demand from people on the right side of the aisle who feel that the mainstream media is effusively covering barack obama and not critically covering him
1491291 the obama nation leftist politics and the cult of personality
1491292 the case against barack obama the unlikely rise and unexamined agenda of the medias favorite candidate
1491293 fleeced how barack obama media mockery of terrorist threats liberals who want to kill talk radio the do nothing congress companies that help iran and washington lobbyists for foreign governments are scamming us and what to do about it
1491294 with book like these the minute some people know theyre out there they must have them
1491295 the anti obama readership is largely one that has already made up its mind and is looking for validation while the obama readership comprises both those who have already made up their minds and those who are curious about him
1491296 mccain doesnt have the same kind of resonance its nothing in comparison because you can still shape peoples view of obama but its way too late to shape their view of mccain
1491297 gets people excited about the idea of reading a book

1491303 security was tight and was a bit over controlling which is par for the course at these events and as par for the course i tried to get near the candidate when i saw another reporter there alex leary security tried to throw me out but i found a mccain staffer i knew and the person vouched for me
1491304 the campaign looked into this and found that no one from the campaign was involved
1491305 race played absolutely no role in any actions taken by our employees or anybody else in this case
1491306 it was just a really crazy situation we were being carted out of there and everyone was looking
1491307 im upset because my reporter was singled out for whatever reason that bothers me were just trying to figure out what that reason was
1491308 i think it was about security and security acting overzealous and security singling out a black reporter to be removed
1491309 thats not giving him mccain a pass on it i think his campaign does have an obligation to figure out what happened and to make sure it doesnt happen again
1491310 barack and i as partners as friends and as lovers we accessorize each other in many ways
1491311 the best thing i love having on me is barack on my arm and vice versa whether its having him standing there smiling at me or watching him mesmerize a crowd or talk to some seniors in a senior center
1491312 my first job in all honesty is going to continue to be mom in chief
1491313 making sure that in this transition which will be even more of a transition for the girls that they are settled and that they know they will continue to be the center of our universe
1491314 tack on the fact that there is no sustained mental health support for these families as they are struggling with loved ones who are coming back dealing with emotional issues
1491315 youve got people in pain and we dont hear those voices a lot
1491316 i found it wasnt that barack wasnt interested in helping
1491317 its just that when the baby cried at 4 a m i got up faster than he did because i would hear the baby and i would be up
1491318 being fit has become even more important as ive had children because im also thinking about how im modeling health to my daughters
1491319 nations that sponsor or harbor terrorists are our enemies we have to treat them accordingly we must act against them using whatever force is necessary to destroy the threat we will have to take on other nations and other terrorist networks we cannot let them have a moments peace there must be no safe place for them to hide and no hesitation to attack them or those who give them shelter

1491357 it is usual that travellers forget their luggage but not a child
1491358 we mustnt wrap our children up in cotton wool but allow them to play outside so as to better understand the opportunities and challenges in the world around them and how to be safe
1491359 children need to take risks to learn how to manage risks an essential part of growing up
1491360 to ensure families get the support and information they need to judge what is right for their child increasing parents knowledge and understanding of the risks and benefits of play
1491361 play is often talked about as if it were a relief from serious learning but for children play is serious learning play is really the work of childhood

1491364 inequities in access to healthcare and disparities in health outcomes
1491365 the divide between rich and poor is rising at a troubling rate within subregions of asia pacific leaving vast numbers of mothers and children at risk
1491366 it is not just bigger health budgets we could make a big difference by focusing on the three or four states in north india where most of these children die governments need to tackle female discrimination in the region too half the child deaths recorded in pakistan india and afghanistan occurred in the first month of the babys life
1491367 india could learn from chinas experience in two big ways
1491368 one is getting health services out to the villages the other is female education educated women making educated choices has a big impact on the survival of their children
1491369 of course the police have a duty to protect themselves and the community from violent situations but arming more officers with dangerous weapons without the rigorous training and necessary safeguards could well be a recipe for disaster

1491386 there has always been violence in schools and communities and chris death wasnt the first and hasnt been the last
1491387 we deal with it everyday in the school district and its devastating
1491388 as young people peer acceptance is extremely important and when that dont get that or get bullied they feel worthless it destroys their self esteem
1491389 we respond to the hospital and its a juvenile both boys and girls and when we are done tracing back how it started it started with a verbal altercation

1491394 rather than being dominated by rural farmers tropical deforestation now is substantially driven by major industries especially large scale farming mining and logging
1491395 although this trend is pretty scary its also much easier to target a handful of globalized corporations than many millions of poor farmers living on the frontier
1491396 it is easier for pressure groups to target corporations and enterprises rather than tens of millions of poor farmers who are simply trying to put food on the table for their families
1491397 green groups are learning to use public boycotts and embarrassment to target the corporate bad guys
1491398 and it already seeing the global soy palm oil and timber industries beginning to change their approach theyre realizing they cant run roughshod over the just too risky for them
1491399 in addition some massive financial firms including goldman sachs jp morgan chase citigroup and bank of america have altered their lending practices after coming under fire from environmentalists
1491400 environmental groups are using carrots as well as sticks many multinational corporations are developing greener products because theyre more profitable for example the market for eco friendly timber products is expected to be worth tens of billions of dollars in the u s by 2010
1491401 if ecosystem services markets can make conservation of natural forests a profitable endeavor for enterprise the opportunity cost of deforestation will increase dramatically
1491402 the net result could be enterprise driven preservation of wild lands
1491403 we argue that the public and green groups need to send a loud clear message to the corporate sector
1491404 stateless computing isnt about having no state its kind of a misnomer its about where that state is stored since the emergence of the pc in the early 80s we have stored the state on the physical computer and that has presented a myriad of challenges that has driven it costs through the roof
1491405 the key to this is the version the idea is to put everything you view whether its an application or library you put it into this file system so therefore you never have this problem of an it industry created problem of the software stack
1491406 if you placed every little thing that you had a config file everything into a version name space and then you were able to build your applications against that and all the dependencies for applications were referable in this file system there would be no need to ever build a stack because every application would inherently know what its dependents were and would all be retrievable through this global file system

1491420 btw can you move this stuff out of the room
1491421 it is essential that women receive the right education and information so they understand the techniques of control frequently used by abusive men
1491422 once she recognises theres a problem she can do something about it the government spends very little on education campaigns on what is a major social problem
1491423 we need more prevention rather than just picking up the pieces research says that it takes on average 35 beatings before a woman seeks help thats a long way down the road
1491424 every man i have ever been involved with has been violent to me
1491425 many vulnerable women escaping domestic violence lie low and stay away from councils altogether so are not counted
1491426 raped beaten and burned just because i had nowhere to go and wouldnt do what someone wanted me to homeless women are especially bullied
1491427 for the first couple of days everyone is so nice to you the next thing you know someones stolen your stuff you might get kicked to death at night sleeping rough but in a hostel you can get any number of diseases with all the germs theyre very unhygienic
1491428 women are still much more of a sexual object on the streets than men sure there are young boys begging and prostituting themselves they go into the public toilets and its never ever talked about but sadly its all about drugs the whole issue around everything on the streets today is about drugs
1491429 but she doesnt have the experience to get around it she begs then hands the money over to him and theyre off to score if she doesnt get off the gear theres no way shell escape him you see a lot of this kind of thing
1491430 they stored my possessions and offered me a place to shower most days
1491431 if you are a woman one of the worst experiences of being homeless is when your period comes the lack of hygiene and the humiliation is hard to describe simple things are suddenly so complicated you have to go and find some place to clean up and its not always easy a man does not have these problems
1491432 it was my passport and the few coins that i had in that bag a bus driver along with two other people ran to help me he punched my attacker until he ran away
1491433 while british attitudes are more egalitarian than in the 1980s there are signs that support for gender equality may have hit a high point some time during the 1990s
1491434 when it comes to the clash between work and family life doubts about whether a woman should be doing both are starting to creep in
1491435 attempts to shoehorn women into workplaces made by men for men have failed
1491436 women still shoulder the bulk of caring and housework at home the long working hours culture and lack of flexible working means women are presented with impossible choices forced to choose between caring for a family at home or maximising their career opportunities the result motherhood carries a penalty and women and men are straitjacketed by gender stereotypes
1491437 many mothers tell us that in the first year of a babys life they want to stay at home but often feel they have to return to work too early because of financial constraints we need to do more to help mothers and fathers by increasing well paid parental leave and changing how it can be shared between them
1491438 the results are even more extreme in the us where the percentage of people arguing that family life does not suffer if a woman works has plummeted from 51 in 1994 to 38 in 2002
1491439 the notion that there has been a steady increase in favour of women taking an equal role in the workplace and away from their traditional role in the home is clearly a myth
1491440 instead there is clear evidence that womens changing role is viewed as having costs both for the woman and the family
1491441 it is conceivable that opinions are shifting as the shine of the super mum syndrome wears off and the idea of women juggling high powered careers while also baking cookies and reading bedtime stories is increasingly seen to be unrealisable by ordinary mortals
1491442 in britain and the us however where support for equal opportunities for both sexes is much longer standing some people are now starting to have second thoughts
1491443 in most cases this appears to revolve around concerns that the welfare of children and of the family are being compromised the more women spend their time at work and find themselves lumbered with the double burden of employment and family care
1491444 we are still educating to confirm a gender role division that people thought was eradicated 25 years ago
1491445 at the moment in the uk we are heading in the wrong direction after a period when there was greater support at an ideological level for an equal division of labour
1491446 if we are to make progress in devising policies that encourage equal working opportunities for women we need to know more about what gender roles people view as practical as possible and as fair
1491447 by making all roles flexible at every level ending the long working hours culture and challenging discriminatory attitudes women and men could participate in the workplace on an equal footing and live free from stereotypes about whose role it is to do the caring
1491448 when this happens business the economy and society as a whole will all reap the benefits
1491449 the british economy cannot afford not to have women in the workforce women make up 45 of employees in an age when we have significant skill shortages we cannot miss out on any part of the talent pool
1491450 our latest research shows 79 of organisations are struggling to recruit and 75 are struggling to retain skills they have to think how to address the need for more flexibility for women and men
1491451 a family does not suffer if a woman is in full time employment
1491452 it is the husbands job to earn income and the wifes to look after the children
1491453 elitist is another word for arrogant which is another word for uppity that old calumny applied to blacks who stood up for themselves
1491454 any discussion of obamas skinniness and its impact on the typical american voter
1491455 cant avoid being interpreted as a coded discussion of race
1491456 no one thing is going to be the silver bullet and the quality and diversity of education that children and young people receive will be absolutely crucial in terms of engagement post 16 whether compulsory or not
1491457 if you inspire children to learn in whatever format they will want to continue the crucial part is the making sure education is about the whole child and not just what they learn in maths and english
1491458 where young people have a sense of hope for the future they are much less likely to get pregnant
1491459 the signs were cut or burnt into the body and advertised that the bearer was a slave a criminal or a traitor a blemished person ritually polluted to be avoided especially in public places
1491460 we believe the person with the stigma is not quite human on this assumption we exercise varieties of discrimination through which we effectively if often unthinkingly reduce his life chances
1491461 they had lethal metal hooks that we kids used to fight with
1491462 it was easier to write without them but it was thought it was best if we had attachments to make us look normal the truth was i looked like metal mickey
1491463 the philosophy at our school was that being disabled was bad so you must do all you could to appear not disabled
1491464 wed had it instilled in us that you must do all you can to fit into the world because thats how youre going to get on
1491465 ridiculous charade of pretending to be a non disabled person
1491466 it was my safety valve where i could be a disabled person
1491467 we couldnt get a meeting with the department so i thought lets organise a march
1491468 suddenly when they knew we were coming it was much easier to get a meeting
1491469 having that diversity of voices is one of the most powerful things
1491470 for disabled people non disabled society has created the barriers
1491471 we needed to shift away from the polemical painful discussions where all you hear is anger
1491472 it doesnt help parents or us as an organisation to move on
1491473 i think you and i are probably on the same side because you wouldnt have chosen to segregate your child youve done it because the system has let you and your child down
1491474 what we are asking is what can we do together with schools teachers and qualification bodies so that anyone that participates in education achieves not just academically but is also given the tools to be a citizen
1491475 the truth is that if you have inclusive education you wont need special schools but its not about closing schools overnight
1491476 im slapped in the face about the reality of disablism on a daily basis
1491477 i had the humiliation of an it support guy piggy back me down the stairs id never met him before
1491478 a day doesnt go by without someone asking me how did that happen
1491479 its a very nice thing that you do but im not sure we can trust our money to an organisation thats run by disabled people
1491480 thats why the award is so important for the campaign to succeed i need someone to assist me and put me in other peoples shoes
1491481 mariah gets up early and loves to work out first thing and nick picked up her habit quickly they wake up watch the sun rise and work out simultaneously they do lots of cardio
1491482 hes become obsessed with his body and health just like mariah they really bond over staying in shape it sounds superficial but its one of the things they really love doing together mariah loves nicks body and wants him to maintain his physique
1491483 cindy crawford shows shes still got it in a tiny bikini
1491484 in front of a packed and vocal crowd at town hall the board of selectmen last night denied end zone sports pubs application for adult entertainment saying it is outside a special zoning district
1491485 ill take the big one if i lose it ill know where it is

1491536 if atheism is a religion then health is a disease
1491537 things falling apart is a kind of testing and also a kind of healing we think that the point is to pass the test or to overcome the problem but the truth is that things dont really get solved they come together and they fall apart then they come together again and fall apart again its just like that the healing comes from letting there be room for all this to happen room for grief for relief for misery for joy when we think that something is going to bring us pleasure we dont know whats really going to happen when we think something is going to give us misery we dont know letting there be room for not knowing is the most important thing of all we try to do what we think is going to help but we dont know we never know if were going to fall flat or sit up tall when theres a big disappointment we dont know if thats the end of the story it may be just the beginning of a great adventure

1491542 everyone uses from time to time such expressions as a thought pops up an idea comes from the blue or dawns or comes as though out of a dream or it suddenly hit me these are various ways of describing a common experience the breakthrough of ideas from some depth above the level of awareness

1491562 since the poker room opened almost two years ago area charitable organizations who donate the time of their members to operate the games for a 35 percent cut of the profits have raised over 2 3 million in revenue from the poker and blackjack tables park officials estimate the same groups may raise more than 2 million over the next year in part due to the additional gaming options

1491592 although i didnt grow up shooting or hunting and i only broke nine out of one hundred clays the first time i went to the shooting course ive kept practicing and having fun i am proof that trying a new hobby may lead to meeting great new friends and enjoying fun events like the turkey shoot

1491609 but i wouldnt dream of telling you what they are ive looked at all the available evidence in the way that nicholas blake did in his review my ideas hold no more water than his in my opinion unless you were standing there when it happened you dont know
1491610 the play is focusing on the parents quest for justice rather than speculating on what happened
1491611 they know their own children they were such happy go lucky boys and suicide wasnt in keeping with the way their lives were going they are adamant their children didnt commit suicide so it follows that someone else killed them
1491612 it was subdued after the first two deaths but it rose again in 2001 and 2002 when you have a similar situation mysterious deaths and more to the point no investigation that shows the culture in the camp is at the core of this

1491622 afghanistan is very different from iraq where iraq is fairly flat afghanistan is anything but the terrain is mountainous and not favorable for conventional warfare the people are different although they are not arabs but a m lange of central asians persians and other minor groups they are 80 percent sunni and 20 percent shia their main languages are indo european and their culture is tied more to persia than to the arab world they have the reputation of being unconquerable and ungovernable

1492237 while u win tin is the longest serving prisoner of conscience in myanmar he is far from alone
1492238 he has been joined by thousands of others since 1988 roughly 900 in just the past ten months the un should no longer accept the governments hollow assurances but hold myanmar firmly to its word

1492268 its time to work on inheriting political stream in lebanon without a rude entrance or through iranian and syrian intelligence networks as did fatah al islam last year in the palestinian refugee camp of nahr al barid such a wrong approach inflicted a double loss on the lebanese sunnis
1492269 what shaykh kabbani said about the struggle being between hezbollah and the sunnis is false the struggle is political between a u s zionist project and forces of resistance extending beyond lebanon some insist on giving this struggle a religious nature to please washington or some arab rulers
1492270 lebanon is not one country but rather many countries at war with each other shiites have their state maronites have their state and the u s spies pretending to belong to the sunnis have a state the army cant touch any of them but because the mujahideen in our arab world dont have a state to protect them it was necessary to eliminate any pure islamic jihadi movement that wouldnt acquiesce to oppression

1492467 sony of japan will buy bertelsmann s 50 percent stake in the venture sony bmg music entertainment for 900 million
1492468 under the terms of the partnership either sony or bertelsmann could have forced a sale next year and executives at bertelsmann said they worried that the industry might deteriorate further

1492503 its a last minute last ditch effort to put something together and rush it to the ballot
1492504 for those of us that are truly supportive of high speed rail lets take it off the ballot give it time and work on these things

1492518 so far as we know this is the single largest and most complex identity theft case ever charged in this country
1492519 it highlights the efforts of the justice department to fight this pernicious crime and shows that with the cooperation of our law enforcement partners around the world we can identify charge and apprehend even the most sophisticated international computer hackers
1492520 while technology has made our lives much easier it has also created new vulnerabilities
1492521 this case clearly shows how strokes on a keyboard with a criminal purpose can have costly results
1492522 they used sophisticated computer hacking techniques breaching security systems and installing programs that gathered enormous quantities of personal financial data which they then allegedly sold to others or used themselves
1492523 and in total they caused widespread loses by banks retailers and consumers
1492524 computer hacking and identity theft pose serious risks to our commercial personal and financial security
1492525 hackers who reach into our country from abroad will find no refuge from the reach of u s criminal justice

1492535 if we could get a couple more days like tuesday well be in seventh heaven
1492536 one to reduce costs to make sure were cost efficient the other is competitiveness with other companies in the sense of reflecting the pay practices
1492537 we found they typically dont pay any premium for working alternate work shifts the majority of them dont for the few that do they pay less than half of what we do so were getting away from having a pay premium for the work schedule and instead putting the money into a base salary which we think will continue to be competitive with what the rest of the industry pays
1492538 obviously if youre one whos facing a cut in your pay you may have to make some changes thats one reason were talking about it now five months before it goes into effect so each employee will understand what the impact will or will not be on their pay
1492539 as theyre putting more money into their oil tanks more money into the gasoline tanks of their cars or trucks this is certainly piling on top of it and certainly not good news for the regional economy
1492540 this is the thing that unfortunately is the state of the economy these days as we become more global
1492541 it opens up great opportunities but it also unfortunately opens more global competitive threats i think this was one example
1492542 what im trying to do is open the door to as many people as possible

1492544 well i am a progressive and im not changing who i am or what im about and i wouldnt pretend to do that what i do find is other people sometimes allow party labels to get in their way because of tradition
1492545 i would accept anthony pollinas argument that there are people who are just turned off by party label and that a few more voters may vote for him as an independent than as a progressive but i dont believe thats more then a few percentage points of the electorate
1492546 yes it was a tough decision because over the years you get to know a lot of folks you build up a relationship and when you make a decision like this not everybody is going to agree with you
1492547 am i excited that hes running as an independent instead of a progressive not entirely im trying to build a third party option
1492548 i think hes appealing to that independent streak if you are with my ideas vote for me
1492549 jovem p que estava na molhada com os outros e que nem sabia que aquilo a acontecer porque ele foi s fumar uma ganza com os bacanos dos amigos
1492550 i havent heard anything about a wedding from lindsay but if she was marrying sam i dont think shed ask me to walk her down the aisle
1492551 she knows about my christian faith she just wouldnt ask

1492553 i too do know how to drive it im just not used to it yet
1492554 well young lady the first thing you need to do is take those cowboy boots off
1492555 isaiah 17 1 3 the fortress of ephraim refers to the ten tribe northern kingdom a symbol of wealth power and self glory which would be ruthlessly destroyed by assyria
1492556 and in that day it shall come to pass that the glory of jacob shall be made thin and the fatness of his flesh shall wax lean and it shall be as when the harvestman gathereth the corn and reapeth the ears with his arm and it shall be as he that gathereth ears in the valley of rephaim yet gleaning grapes shall be left in it as the shaking of an olive tree two or three berries in the top of the uppermost bough four or five in the outmost fruitful branches thereof saith the lord god of israel
1492557 matthew 6 19 21 wealth accumulated for self interest may lead to greed and can weaken our faith leaving us to become jealous and envious of others no matter how successful we become
1492558 go ye therefore and teach all nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost teaching them to observe all things whatsoever i have commanded you and lo i am with you always even unto the end of the world amen
1492559 in terms of figuring out what the issue was that was a relatively quick process
1492560 the other issue is you want to make sure exactly what you are dealing with
1492561 we dont need to harden internal servers we have a firewall
1492562 no one can hack the application because it uses ssl
1492563 i have a complicated ssid that people will not be able to guess
1492564 thats not the way the application is supposed to work so users will not see that behaviour
1492565 you can see that data because you are using a proxy if you go directly to the web app it is secure
1492566 the storage tapes do not have to be encrypted because no one will have a device to read these tapes
1492567 oracle 8 is totally secure there is no reason to upgrade
1492568 until i hear from dr andrews thats all ive got
1492569 i hope we dont miss him for very long but you think of a guy of jobas caliber and you know hes going to miss a start that doesnt mean the guy who replaces him cant pitch well
1492570 politics is the business of getting power and privilege without possessing merit
1492571 the best british political libertarian blog on the web consistently excellent but not for the squeamish
1492572 but for all that he is a brilliant writer incisive fisker extraordinaire and with an over developed sense of humour and he can back up his sometimes extraordinary views with some good old fashioned intellectual rigour im promoting him on my blogroll to a daily read
1492573 the glorious devils kitchen not for the squeamish or easily offended
1492574 a very smart article takes a pretty firm libertarian line on the matter
1492575 by the way dk seems to be on fucking good form at the moment
1492576 devils kitchen is the big name on the free market libertarian strand of the british blogosphere profane rants are the immediate stand out feature of dks blog but the ranting is backed up by some formidable argument on a wide range of issues particularly relating to british and european parliamentary politics economics and civil liberties
1492577 an excellent intelligent uk political blog which includes a great deal of swearing
1492578 i like the devils kitchen i think its one of the best written and funniest blogs in the business
1492579 for sheer intelligence erudition and fun iain dales diary cranmer and devils kitchen are so far ahead of the rest i dont see how they can figure in a top ten they are the beatles stones and who of the blog world the astair bogart and marlon brando of the blog world the gerswin porter and novello of the blog world the dot cotton pat butcher bette lynch of the blog world
1492580 its the blogging equivalent of someone eating ostrich vindaloo washed down by ten bottles of jamaican hot pepper sauce and then proceeding to breathe very close to your face while talking about how lovely our politicians are but theres much more to his writing than four letter words
1492581 the devils kitchen is a life affirming life enhancing blog this particular post will also lead you to some of the best soldiers in the army of swearbloggers of which he is field marshal
1492582 underneath all the ranting and swearing dk s a very intelligent and thoughtful writer whom many people take seriously despite disagreeing with much of what he says
1492583 the most foul mouthed of bloggers devils kitchen was always likely to provoke sometimes disgust but more often admiration
1492584 i dont mean it literally or even metaphorically i just find that his atheism aside i agree with everything the devil of kitchen fame says i particularly enjoy his well crafted and sharp swearing especially when addressed at self righteous lefties
1492585 spot on accurate and delightful in its simplicity devils kitchen is one of the reasons that were not ready to write off euroweenie land just yet at least not until we get done evacuating the ones with brains
1492586 this hugely entertaining articulate witty scottish commentator is also one of the most foul mouthed bloggers around gird up your loins and have a look essential reading
1492587 the devils kitchen is one of the foremost blogs in the uk the dk is bawdy foul mouthed tasteless vulgar offensive and frequently goes beyond all boundaries of taste and decency so why on earth does dr crippen read the dk because he reduces me to a state of quivering helpless laughter
1492588 dk is a take no prisoners sort of libertarian his blog is renowned for its propensity for foul mouthed invective which can be both amusing and tiresome by turns nevertheless he is usually lucid often scintillating and sometimes illuminating
1492589 if you enjoy a superior anti left rant albeit one with a heavy dash of cursing you could do worse than visit the devils kitchen the devil is an astute observer of the evils of nulabour thats for sure i for one stand converted to the devil and all his works
1492590 this fellow is sharp as a tack funny as hell and when something pisses him off meaner than a badger with a case of the bullhead clap
1492591 foul mouthed eloquence of the highest standard in bad taste offensive immoderate and slanderous f ing brilliant
1492592 i tend to enjoy devils kitchen not only because i disagree with him quite a lot of the time but because i actually have to use my brain to articulate why
1492593 this blog is currently slamming politics certainly aint all my own but style and prose is tight fierce provocative and funny ok i am a child swear words still crack a laugh
1492594 10 000 words per hour blogging output prolific or obsessive compulsive i have yet to decide
1492595 anyone can cuss but to curse in an imaginative fashion takes work
1492596 ive been laffing fit to burst at the unashamed sweariness of the devils kitchen certainly my favourite place recently
1492597 god bless the devils kitchen colourful as his invective is i cannot fault his accuracy
1492598 it made me laugh out loud and laugh so hard and i dont even get all the references i hope his politics dont offend you but he is very funny
1492599 dk himself is unashamedly right wing vitriolic and foul mouthed liberally scattering his posts with four letter words not to be read if youre easily offended but highly entertaining and very much tongue in cheek
1492600 this blog is absolutely wasted here and should be on the front page of one of the broadsheets
1492601 this labour government is the most mendacious dishonest endemically corrupt power hungry incompetent illiberal fucking shower of shits that has ruled this country
1492602 senator obama has said that expanding our nuclear power plants quote doesnt make sense for america he also says no to nuclear storage and no to reprocessing i couldnt disagree more
1492603 i think he might be a little bit confused because when the energy bill came to the floor of the senate full of goodies and breaks for the oil companies i voted against it senator obama voted for it people care not only what you say but how you vote
1492604 he voted against fuel efficiency standards for cars he opposed legislation to provide tax credits for more efficient cars he voted against renewable sources of energy against solar power against wind power against biofuels against an energy bill that despite its flaws represented the largest investment in renewable energy in the history of this country he was dr no
1492605 barack obama supports safe and secure nuclear energy and it is unlikely that we can meet our aggressive climate goals if we eliminate nuclear power as an option however before an expansion of nuclear power is considered obama thinks key issues must be addressed including security of nuclear fuel and waste waste storage and proliferation
1492606 washingtons broken john mccain knows it were worse off than we were four years ago only mccain has taken on big tobacco drug companies fought corruption in both parties hell reform wall street battle big oil make america prosper again hes the original maverick one is ready to lead mccain
1492607 i think you could argue that americans overall are better off because we have had a pretty good prosperous time with low unemployment and low inflation and a lot of good things have happened a lot of jobs have been created
1492608 reform wall street battle big oil make america prosper again
1492609 the meanest man in the senate and proud of it
1492610 failure to report the alleged gifts he was not charged with the more serious offense of taking a bribe or illegal gratuity
1492611 in one place it captures whos best guidance on what the global hiv aids health sector response needs to deliver
1492612 every day more than 6 800 people become infected with hiv and more than 5 700 die mostly because they have no access to hiv prevention treatment and care services despite progress made in scaling up the response over the last decade the hiv pandemic remains the most serious infectious disease challenge to global public health
1492613 hey why dont you let me hold your lunch money
1492614 we are pleased to be able to offer our services to the government and look forward to working with secretary paulson and his team as they work to restore stability to the global capital markets and confidence in the u s housing market
1492615 the oldest celebrity in the world like super old old enough to remember when dancing was a sin and beer was served in a bucket
1492616 hey america im paris hilton and im a celebrity too only im not from the olden days and im not promising change like that other guy im just hot
1492617 that wrinkly white haired guy used me in his campaign ad which i guess means im running for president so thanks for the endorsement white haired dude
1492618 i want america to know that im like totally ready to lead
1492619 now if youll excuse me i have to pick out a vice president
1492620 im thinking rihanna ill see you at the white house oh and i might paint it pink i hope thats cool with you guys
1492621 weve had people call in asking us to bring them milk
1492622 a few years ago an individual called 911 wanting an officer to drive through mcdonalds and bring him a hamburger
1492623 he tasted his sandwich and it didnt have mayonnaise or mustard on it so he became upset
1492624 why cant he be a grown man and do it hisself instead of whine about it and pick and pack and fight about it
1492625 they couldnt have picked a worse time to get into the automobile business domestically
1492626 the strongest steel comes from the hottest fire and while this is like dancing on the sun were making significant improvements in our business
1492627 i work hard for those moments i like those moments its special today thats what i want to do try to help the team win
1492628 the most important thing to me is to stay healthy
1492629 my health is good i can do whatever i can to help the team win im very happy im back in the lineup
1492630 it changes the game hes one of the big superstars in the game i think moreso than his ability to hit the ball out of the ballpark he loosens us up with his charisma and character before and after the game hes a huge part of who we are
1492631 he didnt really have good command ill say that much and sometimes when you dont have command and you dont make quality pitches it hurts you sometimes
1492632 until i hear from dr andrews thats all ive got
1492633 i hope we dont miss him for very long but you think of a guy of jobas caliber and you know hes going to miss a start that doesnt mean the guy who replaces him cant pitch well
1492634 flouting the world court ruling would be yet another blight on americas already tarnished international reputation
1492635 should play its part in ensuring that the united states abides by the commitments undertaken when it signed and ratified the vienna convention and the u n charter
1492636 mexico has a big yard down there full of filth and murders and gangs and drug cartels and theyre not mentioning anything about that
1492637 i dont want sympathy or pity id rather have your anger
1492638 dont feel sorry for me im where im at because i made an adolescent choice thats it
1492639 i just think under cloak and dagger theyre trying to reach out and grab something
1492640 i believe instead of playing this game he should reach out to his creator he needs to spend his time praying to his creator for mercy and forgiveness
1492641 eric 66 amp antinous 67 whilst rik may have been pushing doug a little hard i think there is validit
1492642 this isnt taped at a barber shop either its at some software development business look at the mo
1492643 1 valid point and all candidates need to be evaluated with a consideration for the future that
1492644 of course there are fema type response plans in case of internet collapse its considered infrastru
1492645 oh boy im an american studying urban planning in europe and based upon the demographic changes we
1492646 62 i know how to carry out the testing you suggest i just dont have the wherewithal to do it
1492647 i think theyve got some good ideas and lets face it the horrifically impractical parts of the co
1492648 it raises some real concerns with the tactics of the nra if theyve got one person maybe they have more if theyve done this dirty trick what else have they done
1492649 if theyre open meetings it may be underhanded and sneaky it may not be illegal
1492650 to have somebody that i consider a friend have been with dozens of times shared meals with treated as a friend to have her be an employee a subcontracted spy for the nra is just mind boggling its so venal
1492651 in the battle of ideas with the gun lobby were at a constant disadvantage because were honest
1492652 i feel flattered that the nra would feel that they would have to infiltrate ceasefire of pa obviously theyre hearing our footsteps
1492653 frankly i think its a waste of their money we dont deal in state secrets
1492654 its just now starting to recede at one point it was up to four feet in the front yard
1492655 the van is going to be one of those insurance cases
1492656 a la sainte m lanie de la pluie nen veux mie
1492657 weve been so dry flooding hasnt been much of an issue
1492658 were prepared to identify problems identify resources and supply those resources if needed
1492659 in occasione del consiglio provinciale del coni del 7 luglio 2008 sono emerse le preoccupazioni dei dirigenti sportivi di gorizia relativamente alla sospensione dei lavori di ristrutturazione della palestra coni
1492660 con la presente siamo cortesemente a chiedere a nome dellintero consiglio provinciale del coni chiarimenti
1492661 they woke up this morning and saw the chairs in the pool so that was pretty interesting
1492662 he said wed be ok once the storm passed over
1492663 but when we got here and saw people boarding up the windows my wife got a little nervous
1492664 the winds were blowing too hard out of the north
1492665 i think post storm is the time communities really need to come together and people need to be surrounded by their peers
1492666 thats what im trying to allow here allow people to tell a good story or a bad story but everybody has a story that has to be told
1492667 until i hear from dr andrews thats all ive got
1492668 i hope we dont miss him for very long but you think of a guy of jobas caliber and you know hes going to miss a start that doesnt mean the guy who replaces him cant pitch well
1492669 you dont want to jeopardize their long term health and were talking about a 22 year old kid here
1492670 that intersection has flooded all my life but with the new drainage project kicked in it didnt flood
1492671 in terms of feedstock we do have a supply of crude in tanks that will enable us to continue running for the foreseeable future
1492672 we had very little rain and a breeze of 5 to 10 mph
1492673 weve had worse thunderstorms than this like the squall that came through sunday night
1492674 alguna vez le a mafalda preguntarse por d nde hab a que empujar a este pa s para llevarlo adelante y se me ocurre que la educaci n y la cultura son dos herramientas formidables para eso
1492675 promover la lectura es un hecho cultural y que si viene propuesta dentro de una democracia hay que apoyarla
1492676 weve introduced a new incentive based guide compensation model so that we can reward our best performers and provide the others something to shoot for
1492677 were generally doubling both queries and users every month and were now in the 10s of millions of mobile answers per month
1492678 in other words if you keep the volume up you will get the usual 20 cents however if you just infrequently log on to answer questions you will only get 10 cents not worth it for me twenty was bad enough
1492679 i did the math and figured out that it takes 500 answers to earn 100 at 20 each
1492680 at 3 minutes a question thats 20 questions an hour it would take 25 hours to earn 100 thats ridiculous
1492681 money is not the primary motivator for our best guides
1492682 its being part of a knowledge sharing community thats only available to those who become guides
1492683 dont talk to him he doesnt like extras asking him questions and he doesnt like people talking to him blah blah
1492684 its a wonderfully eclectic objet dart speckled with an observable indifference for maureen dowd
1492685 i tried reading your blog but i couldnt fucking understand any of it
1492686 e vero che linsegnamento tradizionale della chiesa non fatto in modo da aiutarci ad accettare noi omosessuali per quello che siamo siamo accettati vero ma a condizione che noi rimaniamo il meno visibili possibile e che non rivendichiamo dei diritti uguali a quelli degli eterosessuali
1492687 non fa altro che inculcare in noi la convinzione che valiamo ben poco agli occhi degli uomini e di dio e che ci meritiamo di essere infelici
1492688 ges non certo venuto per ispirarci questi pensieri negativi ma al contrario per liberarci da essi egli ci ama cos come siamo e per lui non ci sono n ebrei n greci n uomini n donne n gay n etero
1492689 vale a dire di rivelarsi alla propria famiglia agli amici ai colleghi di lavoro ed compito poi di ciascuno vedere cosa pu essergli maggiormente di aiuto secondo il contesto in cui si trova non si tratta certo di esporsi inutilmente al rischio
1492690 e ne ha pagato il prezzo spesso noi stessi dobbiamo pagare di tasca nostra per poter essere veri ma la fiducia nelle promesse di ges ci aiuta persino ad attraversare il fuoco
1492691 the u s marshals service treats all inappropriate communication directed at our protectees the same each instance is given highest priority and investigated until a determination is made to the credibility of the communication in question
1492692 with the growth of blogs discussion boards video sharing sites and such on the internet we have seen a corresponding increase in the number of inappropriate communications directed at those in our protection
1492693 if as a service provider you dont actually know of copyright infringement thats on your site and as long as you take it down if notified then you are okay
1492694 even though defendants are well aware of the rampant infringement on the youtube website and youtube has the right and ability to control it youtubes intentional strategy has been to take no steps to curtail the infringement from which it profits unless notified of specific infringing videos by copyright owners thereby shifting the entire burden and high cost of monitoring youtubes infringement onto the victims of that infringement
1492695 youtube says safe harbor protection applies viacom says it doesnt
1492696 the safe harbor provision doesnt apply if the host is aware of infringement the legal question is with how much specificity should youtube have been aware of infringement
1492697 viacom wants youtube to keep track of all potential infringement on its site that would be a flip in the way that copyright is handled its always been copyright owners who are responsible for pursing copyright infringement
1492698 hes a grand man if you had to draw him visually he would be what you would photograph as a judge
1492699 hes got this philosophy let the plaintiff do whatever they want then well let them sort it out at the end
1492700 the plaintiff wanted to amend complaint for punitive damages but the law is 1 000 percent clear that it isnt allowed it makes no sense and its against federal law and yet he said okay
1492701 although recognizing that conventional authority holds that punitive damages are unavailable in copyright infringement actions
1492702 i granted blanch leave to amend the complaint so that plaintiff has a chance to prove malice and raise squarely the question whether punitive damages are available to her if it ever was that decision is no longer good law

1492712 we cannot separate love from the process of evangelism without love christians would have no lasting incentive to tell others the good news of salvation in jesus christ
1492713 the law says do this and it is never done grace says believe in this and everything is already done
1492714 if christ is risen nothing else matters and if christ is not risen nothing else matters
1492715 the law says do this and it is never done grace says believe in this and everything is already done
1492716 if christ is risen nothing else matters and if christ is not risen nothing else matters
1492717 we had a great chemistry in the first film and really good friendship
1492718 as much as we could we stayed in touch in the three years between the two movies im particularly close with amber because on the campaign trail together for hilary clinton we all like to keep in touch because we like each others company
1492719 at the core carmen is dealing with the same issues she was dealing with in the first movie which is her issues with abandonment
1492720 in the first movie her father is moving on without her and this time around its her friends are moving on in an easier way than she is and her mother is remarried and pregnant
1492721 so again her world is moving on without her when shes quite happy with the way things are
1492722 shes upset about being abandoned by her friends and her mother and shes stuck in her shell until she realizes that its time to move on before she becomes an unhappy person
1492723 i was really interested in this notion of how friendships evolve in the first movie the friendships were really sweet and a lot of the conflict came from each of the girls individual lives and stories there wasnt a lot of conflict within the friendship
1492724 what i was excited about this time around was the focus of the friendship and how it was changing with my character and ambers character tibby theyre both so lost in their own struggles that they cant be there for each other i liked that the friendship was getting more complicated
1492725 i think in terms of would i have needed to see this when i was a kid the idea is a little bit selfish to be frank
1492726 but when salma hayek came to me with the idea ugly betty i thought to myself god this is the kind of show i would want to watch if i was a girl sitting at home or even now when it comes to sisterhood and when i read those books and was such a huge fan theses are stories i want to watch as movies
1492727 i pick things that way because im a young woman looking for inspiration
1492728 i think that resounds with other women who feel similarly
1492729 rick santorum former u s senator from pennsylvania and a devout catholic was the first to give bush the catholic president label hes certainly much more catholic than kennedy
1492730 john di iulio bushs first director of faith based initiatives has called the president a closet catholic and he was only half kidding
1492731 you said famously when you looked into vladimir putins eyes you saw his soul
1492732 when you look into benedict xvis eyes what do you see
1492733 anything that is in the heaven above or that is in the earth beneath
1492734 are we witnessing the fulfillment of the prophetic scenario of revelation 13 that speaks of
1492735 bush and his administration have had no such qualms about their catholic connections at times theyve even seemed to brandish them for political purposes even before he got to the white house bush and his political guru karl rove invited catholic intellectuals to texas to instruct the candidate bush on the churchs social teachings in january 2001 bushs first public outing as president in the nations capital was a dinner with washingtons then archbishop theodore mccarrick a few months later rove an episcopalian asked former white house catholic adviser dean hudson to find a priest to bless his west wing office
1492736 prior to his presidency bushs political advisor invited catholic intellectuals to texas to explain the teachings of the catholic church to the president bush has also appointed catholic judges to the supreme court has selected catholic speech writers and consultants and has read the popes theological books
1492737 in extraordinarily personal terms saying it the funeral strengthened his own belief in a living god he remarked on how affected he was by the services particularly the music and the sight of the plain casket being carried out with the sun pouring down on it i knew the ceremony today would be majestic but i didnt realize how moved i would be by the service itself the president said todays ceremony i bet you was a reaffirmation for millions
1492738 many protestants suppose that the catholic religion is unattractive and that its worship is a dull meaningless round of ceremony here they mistake while romanism is based on deception it is not a course and clumsy imposture the religious service of the roman catholic church is a most impressive ceremonial its gorgeous display and solemn rites fascinate the senses of the people and silence the voice of reason and of conscience the eye is charmed the ear is also captivated the music is unsurpassed the rich notes of the deep toned organ blending with the melody of many voices as it swells through the lofty domes and pillared aisles of her grand cathedrals cannot fail to impress the mind with awe and reverence
1492739 bush respects how catholicism was founded by christ who appointed peter as the first pope i think what fascinates him about catholicism is its historical plausibility he does appreciate the systematic theology of the church its intellectual cogency and stability
1492740 evangelicalism by comparison with catholicism seem more limited both theologically and historically
1492741 the presence around this altar of the successor of peter his brother bishops and priests and deacons men and women religious and lay faithful from throughout the fifty states of the union eloquently manifests our communion in the catholic faith which comes to us from the apostles
1492742 and i tell you you are peter and on this rock i will build my church and the power of death shall not prevail against it
1492743 shows that there is an unmistakable connection between the two thus peter is the petra upon which christ has built his church
1492744 you are peter and on myself as a rock i will build my church
1492745 you are peter and on the rock of christ you have confessed i will build my church
1492746 built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets christ jesus himself being the cornerstone
1492747 shortly after pope benedict xvis election in 2005 president bush met with a small circle of catholic advisers in the oval office as some mentioned their own religious backgrounds the president remarked that he had read one of the new pontiffs books about faith and culture in western europe
1492748 save for one other soul bush was the only non catholic in the room but his interest in the popes writings was no surprise to those around him as the white house prepares to welcome benedict on tuesday many in bushs inner circle expect the pontiff to find a kindred spirit in the president
1492749 at the hour of its greatest success europe seems hollow as if it were internally paralyzed by a failure of its circulatory system that is endangering its life subjecting it to transplants that erase its identity at the same time as its sustaining spiritual forces have collapsed a growing decline in its ethnicity is also taking place
1492750 europe unlike america is on a collision course with its own history
1492751 built on the foundations created by the free churches it adopts a rigid dogma of separation between church and state above and beyond the single denominations it is characterized by a protestant christian consensus that is not defined in denominational terms but rather in association with the countrys sense of a special religious mission toward the rest of the world the religious sphere thus acquires a significant weight in public affairs and emerges as a pre political and supra political force with the potential to have a decisive impact on political life
1492752 a sense of a special religious mission toward the rest of the world
1492753 the christian heritage is falling apart at an incessant pace
1492754 the moral strength of the pope is the key for politicians and i am going to remind his holy father how important his voice is in making it easier for politicians like me to be able to stand and defend our positions that are i think very important positions to take
1492755 the catholic church is the rock it is the only thing that can withstand the wave of secularization which says you can kill someone else to make your own life more convenient he said the catholic church must never give in on this
1492756 the catholic church is a rock in a raging sea
1492757 it was striking that a protestant president would see the catholic church as a rock but it was also characteristic of a politician who has come to identify closely with catholics and the powerful men who have led the church during his tenure in the white house
1492758 the key to understanding bushs domestic policy is to view it through the lens of rome
1492759 t he vatican is grateful for bushs gesture of coming to the airport but also they want to show their appreciation for someone who upholds catholic teaching in a number of controversial areas
1492760 indeed bush has stood for many of the principles espoused by pope and church during his presidency he has on many occasions voiced his appreciation for the catholic churchs commitment to human life he has backed up those remarks with his own opposition to embryonic stem cell research and appointment of staunchly pro life judges
1492761 this protestant president has surrounded himself with roman catholic intellectuals speech writers professors priests bishops and politicians
1492762 i used to say that there are more catholics on president bushs speech writing team than on any notre dame starting lineup in the past half century said former bush scribe and catholic william mcgurn
1492763 bush has also placed catholics in prominent roles in the federal government and relied on catholic tradition to make a public case for everything from his faith based initiative to antiabortion legislation
1492764 there is an awareness in the white house that the rich catholic intellectual tradition is a resource for making the links between christian faith religiously grounded moral judgments and public policy says richard john neuhaus a catholic priest and editor of the journal first things who has tutored bush in the churchs social doctrines for nearly a decade
1492765 the president said that the pope is a worldwide spiritual leader and that millions of american citizens are excited about having him in this country and that he the president wanted to go to andrews air force base as a sign of respect
1492766 robust welcome for benedict reflects the popes immense significance as a religious and moral leader i want to honor his convictions
1492767 popes normally receive visiting heads of state in the pontiffs imposing library in the apostolic palace next to st peters basilica but benedict wanted to return the special hospitality he had received at the white house on his 81st birthday during his sojourn in the united states in april vatican sources said
1492768 the two men had 30 minutes talks in the medieval st johns tower before standing on a terrace under a scorching sun to admire the view of the 108 acres making up the holy see and listening to a performance by the sistine chapel choir while sitting on lawn chairs
1492769 the mystery of the conversion during the visit to the pope
1492770 the leading corriere della sera of milan newspaper noted that the apostolic nuncio or the vaticans ambassador in washington pietro sambi may have hinted at a possible conversion when talking about the conversations the pope held with mr bush in the united states in april
1492771 are we witnessing the fulfillment of the prophetic scenario of revelation 13 that speaks of
1492772 the protestants of the united states will reach over the abyss to clasp hands with the roman power
1492773 over the abyss to clasp hands with the roman power
1492774 im not really sure i understand this how do we win do we just comment as many times as we can

1492776 while these networks have provided immense value for the growing transitioning space they are all controlled now by venture capitalists which tend to have as their primary objective a sale
1492777 aside from the hit shows which have spawned the networks most of the other shows on these networks have not lived up to their predecessors content wise and new shows are often canceled soon after they are launched
1492778 instead of gaining capital to burn while continuing to build or seek an advertising solution we now have one of the most prominent advertising solutions out there
1492779 along with increased distribution a road map for expansion and a guarantee that i believe is an unprecedented deal for this space
1492780 it is a terrible fight and it is between two wolves one is evil he is anger envy sorrow regret greed arrogance self pity guilt resentment inferiority lies false pride superiority and ego

1492789 that dovbear just loves posting hyperlinks to stuff that many folks dont walk to talk about

1492796 notwithstanding his misguided politics i am amused by the postings of dovbear
1492797 economic activity expanded in the second quarter partly reflecting growth in consumer spending and exports

1492844 deporting christians for worshipping in their private homes shows that king abdullahs speech is mere rhetoric and his country is deceiving the international community about their desire for change and reconciliation
1492845 the first officer to enter the house after breaking down the main gate pointed a pistol at the christians and ordered them to hand over their resident permits and mobile phones
1492846 the other 11 police followed quickly and started searching the entire house the confiscated an electronic drum set an offering box with 500 saudi riyal in it 130 20 bibles and a few christian books
1492847 they later changed the charge to holding a dance party and collecting money to support terrorism
1492848 during the raid the police mocked questioned and harassed the christians for four hours
1492849 then they took them to a police station where the head of the station interrogated them the head of the police then wrote down their statements in arabic and forced the christians who are immigrants and not able to read or write arabic to sign the statements

1492888 the problem is that theres been a lot of damage done and i cant forget it

1492897 abuse could have been stopped it could have been prevented and they chose to not do that
1492898 the laws there are you have up until you are 26 years of age to sue or prosecute im 37 years old
1492899 when you are abused your pain doesnt stop when your statute of limitation runs out
1492900 it seems more like the laws are for the predators and protect the predators than the victims
1492901 i dont want our cases being dismissed to discourage anyone from coming forward because i would do this all over knowing the outcome
1492902 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1492903 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaida something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1492904 the notion that the white house directed anyone to forge a letter from habbush to saddam hussein is absurd
1492905 we know now that those estimates were wrong but they were the estimates we all relied on
1492906 regardless military force in iraq was used because saddam hussein defiantly failed to comply with the 17 un security council resolutions iraq was subject to
1492907 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from cia ever involved in any such effort
1492908 it is well established that at my direction cia resisted efforts on the part of some in the administration to paint a picture of iraqi al qaida connections that went beyond the evidence
1492909 the notion that i would suddenly reverse our stance and have created and planted false evidence that was contrary to our own beliefs is ridiculous
1492910 the white house directed and cia allegedly went along with burying that information so that the war could go ahead as planned this is a complete fabrication in fact the source in question failed to persuade his british interlocutors that he had anything new to offer by way of intelligence concessions or negotiations with regard to the iraq crisis and the british on their own elected to break off contact with him
1492911 there were many iraqi officials who said both publicly and privately that iraq had no wmd but our foreign intelligence colleagues and we assessed that these individuals were parroting the baath party line and trying to delay any coalition attack the particular source that suskind cites offered no evidence to back up his assertion and acted in an evasive and unconvincing manner
1492912 while technology has made our lives much easier it has also created new vulnerabilities
1492913 this case clearly shows how strokes on a keyboard with a criminal purpose can have costly results
1492914 they used sophisticated computer hacking techniques breaching security systems and installing programs that gathered enormous quantities of personal financial data which they then allegedly sold to others or used themselves

1492921 its just possible that kid also has two jobs and is working his a off to pay for that car ever think of that
1492922 and its also possible because drug dealers prey on the reservations that hes dealing because he feels like its his only option and a way to get off the res
1492923 and before you get judgmental if your parents and your parents parents all lived on the reservation thats all you know
1492924 if that kid is dealing he will probably be lucky to live to see 30 meanwhile here you are whining about driving a crappy car when youve had pretty much every advantage including an education at a private college so suck it up and get over yourself
1492925 you know ive been to a reservation and its disgraceful even people who live in the projects have better living conditions

1492944 according to indexuniverse com 204 etfs or etns have total net assets of less than 10 million apiece and 369 have under 50 million in assets that is troubling since a fund smaller than 50 million probably loses money for the firm that sponsors it

1493078 which passages of scripture should guide our public policy should we go with leviticus which suggests slavery is ok and that eaing shellfish is an abomination or we could go with deuteronomy which suggests stoning your child if he strays from the faith or should we just stick with the sermon on the mount a passage that is so radical that it is doubtful that our own defense department would survive its application

1493088 i talk to him all the time and thats not what i heard
1493089 i heard a man who wants to work with the united states to come up with a rational way to have the united states withdraw combat troops depending upon conditions on the ground thats all
1493090 understands the need to set aspirational goals and to make sure the conditions on the ground warrant whatever aspirational goal there is
1493091 the timetables that were being argued in the congress were being argued based upon politics not based upon conditions on the ground
1493092 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1493093 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaida something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1493094 the notion that the white house directed anyone to forge a letter from habbush to saddam hussein is absurd
1493095 we know now that those estimates were wrong but they were the estimates we all relied on
1493096 regardless military force in iraq was used because saddam hussein defiantly failed to comply with the 17 un security council resolutions iraq was subject to
1493097 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from cia ever involved in any such effort
1493098 it is well established that at my direction cia resisted efforts on the part of some in the administration to paint a picture of iraqi al qaida connections that went beyond the evidence
1493099 the notion that i would suddenly reverse our stance and have created and planted false evidence that was contrary to our own beliefs is ridiculous
1493100 if they go in the other direction i think theyre probably going to have to start firing people

1493103 when it was discussed with me i just thought it was incredible a box checking of all outstanding issues in one letter from one guy
1493104 the white house directed and cia allegedly went along with burying that information so that the war could go ahead as planned this is a complete fabrication in fact the source in question failed to persuade his british interlocutors that he had anything new to offer by way of intelligence concessions or negotiations with regard to the iraq crisis and the british on their own elected to break off contact with him
1493105 there were many iraqi officials who said both publicly and privately that iraq had no wmd but our foreign intelligence colleagues and we assessed that these individuals were parroting the baath party line and trying to delay any coalition attack the particular source that suskind cites offered no evidence to back up his assertion and acted in an evasive and unconvincing manner
1493106 after being told that habbush had said there were no wmd bush was frustrated

1493356 anybody who says that we can achieve energy independence without using and increasing these existing energy resources either doesnt have the experience to meet the challenges we face or isnt giving the american people straight talk
1493357 if senator mccain is willing to pass a compromise that provides immediate relief to consumers in the form of a 1 000 energy rebate and makes a serious investment in renewable energy senator obama would be happy to join him in calling on congress to return

1493373 we test two 9500 gt cards one from leadtek and one from galaxy we share with you our preliminary findings with these two sub 100 video cards who aim to take the performance price crown at the entry level can these cards impress how do they stack up to the 9600 gt and 8600 gt read on to find out
1493374 nvidias new geforce 9800 gtx comes with a 55 nm cpu that runs at higher clock speeds yet consumes less power than the original 65 nm chip zotacs amp edition further increases the operating frequencies even though the higher clocks make the card faster than the ati hd 4850 the difference is very small and probably not noticable while gaming
1493375 xfxs xxx range of graphics boards always have plenty to offer performance wise over a reference part and things are no different on this occasion starting out with this boards core clock speed we see a 68mhz increase to give us an overall speed of 670mhz while the gt200s shader clocks on this part are bumped to 1458mhz making for a 162mhz improvements over a reference solution finally the 1gb of gddr3 memory on the board is blessed with a clock speed of 1250mhz 2500mhz effective on this xxx part against 1107mhz on a standard geforce gtx 280 some good clock speeds increases to be found on this offering then and well be seeing how that impacts real world performance later on
1493376 ocz is offering a full line up of ddr3 memory their platinum series was always known for their great price performance ratio and this enhanced bandwidth kit is no different it offers tighter timings at 1600 mhz than the competition at a lower price point so can it give us some serious bang for our buck
1493377 several pc companies came out to show their support of gaming amd intel dell kingston and cyber power were the big names of the show but several others had smaller displays as well each company used their own methods to attract gamers some gave away loads of products and others had exotic booth babes a few companies simply let their products speak for themselves with so many gamers in attendance all were successful quakecon was a perfect spot for these companies to showcase their products to users while many attendees were only roaming the vendor halls looking for free swag several were knowledgeable consumers looking to make their purchasing decision based on the companies that support their growing sport

1493379 today we will be dissecting the lian li a77 full size case the pure size of the a77 alone is enough to win over most of us but for me its the style and other features like the 12 bays the locations for numerous 120mm fans removable motherboard tray top panel and fan controller you may say there are many other cases that have these features there are none that do it the way lian li does so now we will jump into the review and get to know this beautiful tower
1493380 though were sure most nvidia fans are happy with the state of things from a fandom view most of nvidias manufacturing partners are anything but happy profit margins for board partners are getting slim to non existent the manufacturer adoption rate of its 7xx chipset platforms is painfully low the notebook platform business is in serious trouble with intels nehalem just around the corner nvidia might be shut out of the intel camp entirely in this regard is nvidia in trouble and if so how bad is it
1493381 i like lowepro i own 3 other lowepro bags and many other accessories in my personal opinion you cannot get better than their gear for photographic carrying cases packs that having been said i was a little disappointed by what i saw in the fastpack 350 it is a great camera case with tons of room and fits the gear i have perfectly i would not expect any less from lowepro the problem was with the laptop side and general comfort
1493382 overclocking as i mentioned above was a little different than what i was used to i found that leaving the sub timings alone produced better results there was also an issue with overclocking a quad on the p5e64 but i think this is more a limitation of the cpu chipset than the asus design in all i was able to get a very respectable 24 7 oc of 450x9 4050mhz with the kingston ddr3 memory running at 1800mhz this oc provided me with a nice boost to all applications i use for testing asus has also been able to overcome the x48 overheating problems the heat pipe system cooling the x48 and power regulators around the cpu was able to keep me from overheating even while overclocked although board layout was not well done i can honestly say that after a few hiccups the evolution more than made up for layout issues with solid performance and power

1493395 despite incredible gains for english language learners hispanic native american and economically disadvantaged students the achievement gap in both math and reading continues to widen for all sub groups in all grades statewide

1493397 further measures in the autumn to help people with housing and through them the housing market
1493398 we are going through a tough time and thats likely to continue for a while the key is to do everything we can to help ourselves and others to get through it
1493399 i am looking at a number of measures and i am not going to be drawn on that today because we have not concluded what exactly we need to do it is helping people that is important i want to look at a range of options that will help people
1493400 with the economy grinding to a halt we are already likely to see a shortfall in taxation suspending stamp duty even on a temporary basis will only make this situation worse
1493401 the stamp duty is system is deeply unfair as the slab structure creates massive distortions in the market but this needs to be dealt with in a methodical way not through panic decisions
1493402 i think people who design costumes for theater use them
1493403 she was fun until all that gunk got trapped inside
1493404 you didnt know you were supposed to clean her out until it was too late
1493405 some of the baby food would get trapped inside and shed get corroded
1493406 youd twist the top of her head and you could make her go from a blonde to a brunette
1493407 box ball hide n seek skullies we had video games but still went outside on a nice day
1493408 they dont have anything that makes them use their creativity or imagination
1493409 you had to sit down and cut out those paper dolls now you cant get a coloring book unless you go to barnes amp nobles
1493410 the show is a great opportunity for gardeners to display the results of their gardening efforts and learn helpful information and gardening tips from other gardeners in the area
1493411 we dont go into the details of our relationships or problems
1493412 we like to get all the stores open at that time
1493413 i think the building looks great in its context of the surrounding buildings
1493414 its not as bad as i thought it was going to be
1493415 it was too late a representative from jefferson county came and talked to us and said walgreens had the permits it was a done deal
1493416 im definitely ok with it the neighbors joke that we should be glad its not a drive through taco bell
1493417 we take care of all their tech support all the computers phones the photo network
1493418 i will shop there everybody knows evergreen parkway is going to change
1493419 nobody was hurt and the house is fine the trees can be replaced
1493420 weve got no power there are a few limbs down but its not bad it tore a transformer off there was a lot of wind and quite a bit of rain there was no major damage besides the power outage though
1493421 some people said they thought there was small tornado when it hit it was pretty dark and it was hard to see a lot of things i think theyre going to be looking at things tomorrow just to see how much damage there was
1493422 neighbors were getting together using their chain saws to cut up trees people were coming home from work it was kind of scary
1493423 true enough i believe that too but my point is that the early adopter you really need just isnt located in silicon valley
1493424 shes showing me her clit ring thats why i have that expression on my face
1493425 she is someone who has a highly charged sexuality and unlike most people she neither disguises it nor is ashamed of it
1493426 she exhibits explores and displays it and feels no compunction about doing so publicly she also realizes it can be very profitable
1493427 that grand tradition in sexuality the relationship of love to aggression and violence
1493428 its a real high low book ranging from high to low constantly in content form and material its a microcosm of what her career has been a series of changing roles
1493429 i said im doing a book on erotica like my erotic fantasies
1493430 sometimes she brought people in and within minutes of first meeting her they found themselves without their clothes on french kissing madonna
1493431 but the woman who owned the pizza parlor turned on an alarm to summon the police so we kind of got out of there pretty fast
1493432 a lot of cars just passed me by believe it or not
1493433 her body was a weapon not a fatal weapon more like a stun gun more like a fun gun she did it to remind everybody she could bring happiness or she could bring danger kind of like the lone ranger
1493434 like when you were a baby your mother strapped you to the car seat you wanted to be an act of love
1493435 you let someone hurt you who you know would never hurt you its a mutual choice i dont even think s and m is about sex i think its about power
1493436 i love my pussy i think its complete summation of my life
1493437 i wouldnt want a penis it would be like having a third leg it would seem like a contraption that would get in the way i think i have a dick in my brain i dont need to have one between my legs
1493438 i dont have the same hang ups that other people do and thats the point im trying to make with this book
1493439 i dont think that sex is bad i dont think that nudity is bad i dont think that being in touch with your sexuality and being able to talk about it and being able to talk about this person and their sexuality is bad i think the problem is that everybodys so uptight about it that they make it into something bad when it isnt and if people could talk about it freely we would have people practicing more safe sex we wouldnt have people sexually abusing each other because they wouldnt be so uptight to say what they really want what they really feel
1493440 the greengrocers daughter who shaped a nation to her will

1493443 upon entering cleopatras bedroom i did not come here to talk
1493444 it was as if he had spilled something dirty on the tablecloth
1493445 its like throwing a pane of glass with a complicated map upon it on the floor
1493446 and all habits and thoughts and actions that went with it and the staff that went with it you threw it on the floor and it shattered
1493447 we went down to the house of commons for preparations for questions at two oclock
1493448 questions at the house were on tuesday and thursday so on mondays and wednesdays we saw foreign statesmen there were a certain number of overseas events the economic summit two european councils all of this structure happened you geared your clothes buying to external visits and your conferences you geared your hair to when you were in the house etc and then you had a certain amount of entertaining in june there was the trooping of the color a whole range of engagements throughout the year which became the pattern of my life
1493449 sometimes i say which day is it i never said that at no 10
1493450 she is like a great athlete suddenly confined to a wheelchair
1493451 she wants worrisome problems she wants to make decisions she wants to tell you what to do and to save you from yourself
1493452 now she answers her own phone sometimes what a comedown that is like napoleon having to saddle his own horse
1493453 in a sense she hasnt come to yet from the concussion everything was so brutal and sudden
1493454 shes pretty shell shocked still the iron lady has a very emotional side people underestimate the extent to which she was shattered by this
1493455 i went round thinking thered be a long queue of people waiting to say farewell i found myself alone i expected to stay fifteen minutes which would be quite normal after an hour i ran out of conversation she was very short on people
1493456 she had a basket on her arm from the supermarket bringing mummys supplies of cold chicken or something for dinner it was very disorienting
1493457 she had had that high and had gone off of that
1493458 she had time on her hands voil the lassitude of impotence had begun
1493459 in the united states she has this reputation as a chaste saintly figure

1493461 he could throw me his will to win was superstrong
1493462 volodya was not a wrestler of physicality but more of intellect a smart wrestler he always did the unexpected because he was versatile very strong so the speed of the fight was intense
1493463 the best wrestlers come not from talent but from dedication to sport volodya was dedicated to sport and loyal to his coach
1493464 i was with him 15 years his mother died his father died i am a second father
1493465 speaking of nothing i told him how to take care of his knees
1493466 he told me they just complain or cry because they live so badly
1493467 they cant believe they are seeing the president and they hope he can make their lives better because they are so miserable its getting to him
1493468 military activities in the caucasus always bring down popularity ratings
1493469 it was the miracle that putin brought into reality we didnt expect that at all
1493470 for an intelligence officer it was easy he had the alibi hes hiding and in secrecy awaiting orders did he take part in reforms yes but he was stirlitz seen in the movie as working under ss cover but hes not ss was he seen at demonstrations of course not he is stirlitz and not supposed to be seen there and here we are reaching the paradox
1493471 but yeltsin named him as successor and yeltsin was hated by the whole country yes but he is stirlitz and he earned yeltsins trust so well that even yeltsin counts on him that was a very deep mechanism
1493472 of course power should be in a way mysterious and magic especially in russia putin answers that need perfectly
1493473 i wasnt aware of how active the u s administration was in not allowing jewish refugees into the country
1493474 i considered it an honor and a duty to be part of telling this story
1493475 there were 7 000 extras and so many actors came up and threw their arms around me
1493476 they said i told my agent i had to be here one woman had lost her parents in the holocaust another said her g i fathers dog tag was found in dachau
1493477 quite good looking i could not quite make out whether she is jewish or not
1493478 she is an imperious young woman who does not stand on ceremony and wants to have her own way
1493479 i wore out more evening gowns in alaska in a year and a half than in a lifetime
1493480 he flew into a mountain so ickes saved my life
1493481 franklin roosevelt didnt want the new deal to be known as the jew deal
1493482 he didnt want people saying we were fighting the war for jews
1493483 report to the secretary on the acquiescence of this government in the murder of the jews
1493484 that assignment on the ship changed the course of my whole life
1493485 i knew my life was inextricably bound with rescuing people and survival
1493486 so i never knew you were supposed to be objective all i knew was that i had to live the story to write it and not only live it if it was a story of injustice i had to fight it
1493487 no no dat my turn you give me wat r gun no you share dat wat r gun

1493495 perchlorates will tell us quite a bit about the history of water
1493496 not just at the phoenix site but in other parts of mars
1493497 its a very effective agent for soaking up water like a silica gel packet
1493498 when its very wet it forms a sticky substance at very low temperature like antifreeze
1493499 there are microbes that live on the energy contained by this oxidant
1493500 in itself it is neither good nor bad for life
1493501 there were reports over the weekend that indicated that nasa had a major discovery that nasa was withholding from the public todays teleconference is going to set the record straight
1493502 we have substantial evidence that our soil samples has perchlorates
1493503 they are highly stable and do not destroy life under normal conditions in fact there are microbes that live on the energy contained by this oxidant in itself it is neither good nor bad for life
1493504 we dont know what mixture of perchlorate salts we have in our solution sodium perchlorate ammonium perchlorate magnesium perchlorate lets take magnesium perchlorate its a very effective agent for soaking up water like silica gel packet when its very wet it forms a sticky substance at very low temperature like antifreeze weve only begun to think about what this might mean but they could keep a lot of graduate students busy for a long time
1493505 its a stable molecule and it doesnt preclude life on earth in fact it could be an energy source
1493506 there were some initial reports in the the scientific literature that the atacama was very mars like they couldnt find organics or culture microbes but as research continued we found organics and then when we looked closer we found microbes so it turned around microbes can exist quite happily in oxidizing conditions and the story could be the same for mars we dont know for sure
1493507 the other probes had different focuses than the meca wet chem which is looking for soluble salt and perchlorate is a very soluble salt
1493508 because perchlorates are chemically inert they move through the soil very quickly in the presence of water this ties back to mars perchlorates will tell us quite a bit about the history of water not just at the phoenix site but in other parts of mars
1493509 nasa is investigating whether the substance could have gotten there by contamination before launch
1493510 even the scientists admitted to having to hit the textbooks on how it works perhaps the most intriguing suggestion was that magnesium perchlorate can act as a sort of anti freeze in the presence of water
1493511 it will be able to get safely on the ground something a regular airplane cannot really do
1493512 this is just an electric powered version of a piston powered airplane thats been around for quite a long time already
1493513 but the most compelling sell is an economic one the company estimates that
1493514 you have to smuggle or you die of starvation it is the only means to live
1493515 it is their main source of income and they have to feed and pay soldiers there is nothing else for them economically
1493516 its amazing how these afghans get into the freezing water in bare feet
1493517 a billion dollar business depends on a guy pushing an animal skin across a freezing river
1493518 afghans come round in the evening to the small villages on the tajik side where they often have relatives
1493519 you can take it to dushanbe without any problem if you pay 10 to checkpoint guards nobody checks your car
1493520 by the time it reaches europe it can be worth from 20 000 to 30 000 wholesale retail four or five times that amount
1493521 opium is the best crop because it doesnt spoil and you always have customers
1493522 its quite different from latin america where a few groups control production all the way to street sales
1493523 in afghanistan farmers produce it and have nothing to do with trafficking
1493524 seventy tajik cows were stolen by afghans who took them across the panj river nothing happened the afghans had negotiated with the border guards not to see it but then one young tajik man went to afghanistan and brought back drugs and the guards killed him yet before crossing the border he too had negotiated with the russians and paid them 10 000 then he got shot because they took the drugs im giving you the words of the prosecutor
1493525 why didnt the russian border guards notice 70 cows cows moo going across the river they should be heard
1493526 strong people simply tear through it but weak people get caught in it
1493527 he was more the tying up and whips type just the degradation not the asphyxiation
1493528 he grabbed me around the neck so hard he was choking me by his grip
1493529 andrew youre really hurting me stop it something had snapped in him now i realize the guy was hunting he was getting the thrill of the hunt the thrill of the kill i saw it in his eyes i saw it in his body he had stepped over the edge
1493530 i said if youre gianni versace then im coco chanel
1493531 andrew called out and we had a conversation on the side of the street
1493532 it was very andrew to do that have the car pull over
1493533 i categorically deny mr versace mr cunanan and i were in the same car i have never had the pleasure or displeasure of meeting mr cunanan
1493534 and they say the two people he most admired in san francisco are mr gordon getty and mr harry de wildt
1493535 down deep inside the publicity is more sexual to him than anything else right after one or two of these homicides he probably goes to a gay bar in the afternoon when the news comes on and his face is on tv and hes sitting there drinking a beer and loving it you hide in plain view
1493536 as far as we know this is the single largest and most complex identity theft case ever prosecuted in this country
1493537 in an homage to old school arcade action the game forgoes the use of continues or game saving meaning that youll need to play through from the start on every new try this is actually not as bad as you might think considering that there are only five relatively short levels
1493538 you can collect pick ups to switch between three different weapon types a wide pattern a spread pattern and a straight laser shot stick with the laser
1493539 also if you are playing with a friend your regular homing missiles are instead turned into special team attacks like the lightning strike pictured above as fun as this may sound it unfortunately doesnt really feel like the super attack you wish you had sure it looks really cool but i missed my homing missiles

1493545 he put the army before my sister he put the army before anyone

1493563 she speaks on behalf of women her lyrics are about what she imagines women have gone through what she has gone through
1493564 she has to give a few hundred thousand in order to make sure clinton shows up at the ball

1493566 id give die to have my daughter back but with her death i learned another strength inside me i didnt know i had

1493621 its craigslists aversion to real ads from real girls that is the problem
1493622 i think the second anyone sees bi in an ad it gets flagged i could not keep an ad about this brunch up for more than five minutes without it being taken down no matter how much i begged for it not to be flagged
1493623 but i didnt have bi or bisexual anywhere in my ad

1493625 and the creepiest grossest obviously fake ads where some guy is seeking three women to stick live animals up his behind never get flagged
1493626 have you written to craigslist and asked them why your post was flagged

1493637 when i was coming up more top fighters fought each other they all wanted to prove they were the best in their weight class not in the wba the ibf but the best period but now the promoters and the networks get in the way and were losing a lot of fans because of it the promoters milk the prospects they dont match them against top fighters the networks allow too many easy fights
1493638 i would definitely say boxing is declining as the best are not fighting the best in the nba they dont just cancel the playoffs and have the lakers against some sorry team no one would watch thats why the ufc is gaining so much in popularity the best fight the best and the fans love to see it

1493681 we had to get it out so we scared it as best we could and it slithered out
1493682 we think it was either abandoned or escaped from a home near where fiocchi lives in antioch
1493683 its a very docile snake it never tried to bite any of the officers or anything

1493700 these aea figures reflect past problems at heathrow which have been well documented our advertising campaign represents the current reality at terminal 5 which offers customers the best heathrow experience they have had for many years it is not surprising if other airlines are jealous
1493701 heathrow airport is completely full there are no spare landing slots which means the slightest disruption will cause problems in terms of punctuality this underlines the need for a third runway until we get runway expansion there will be problems
1493702 these new figures are yet another indication that heathrow is unsuited to the scale of operations carried out there its the basic problem of having far more traffic than it was ever designed for
1493703 this raises the possibility that uk taxpayers will be more heavily exposed to northern rock and for longer than had been envisaged
1493704 i am confident that the foundations have been well laid for recovery and return in due course to private ownership

1493706 nel cpt la polizia mi ha picchiato con calci e pugni
1493707 aperto la finestra della sala dattesa per cambiare un po laria scatenando del tutto inspiegabilmente lira del poliziotto
1493708 inveendo contro di lei per lapertura della finestra la buttava con violenza per terra e le assestava un calcio al corpo poi le ordinava di alzarsi e sedersi sulla sedia e al suo rifiuto la insultava negro schifoso e le sputava addosso
1493709 veniva nuovamente insultata dallagente di polizia e di fronte alle sue rimostranze interveniva lispettore di polizia che invece di allontanare il poliziotto chiamava altri agenti in totale sei agenti ordinando loro di portare preziosa nello stanzino in fondo sala colloqui priva di videocamere gli agenti dopo aver infilato i guanti la trascinavano nello stanzino e per alcuni minuti sotto lo sguardo dellispettore la riempivano di calci e pugni e persino la colpivano col manganello in loro dotazione

1493713 its been an unusual spirit of co operation but i think its going to deliver the goods for cleaner air
1493714 its not every day you get a letter from the chemical producers and the sierra club co signed
1493715 the fact that were working in this pressure cooker that anybody can basically torpedo this process by pulling out of it is whats keeping us together
1493716 we all want an alternative to what the federal government originally proposed i think theres a consensus that there are some real fundamental flaws in it
1493717 so we all know that we can only come up with that alternative if we all keep working together
1493718 in some areas we see very high ambient air emissions and in other areas we see less
1493719 so you may manage areas differently depending on how big a problem you have environmentally
1493720 at the end of the day well have to achieve agreement and it remains to be seen whether the government will find this an acceptable attractive alternative to what theyve already proposed
1493721 he has travelled through many states during his career in the military as well as with his chosen calling he calls himself a preacher based on that he is a flight risk
1493722 it think its largely a commodity price story especially as weve seen oil prices start to look like they are on a downward trend
1493723 i think youre seeing some of that strength reverse as a result youre seeing some weakening in commodity based currencies including the canada
1493724 generally were in an environment where the u s dollar seems to be on a bit of an upswing and thats adding further fuel to this depreciating trend for the canada
1493725 just last week we had the monthly gdp contract again so that made it the third of four months that weve seen the canadian economy sort of shrink
1493726 thats shown that the weakness in the u s economy is having a real impact on canadas growth prospects and thats a also a reason that we started to see a bit of underperformance in the dollar
1493727 over the long term it will make manufacturers a little more competitive
1493728 unfortunately theyre also dealing with a u s economy thats looking very much to be in recession

1493736 dont worry dad a family of dorks will come along any minute
1493737 i like crocs theyre so comfortable ill tell you who the dork is the guy writing this story thats who and who died and made him the fashion authority anyway

1493741 i doubt microsoft would ever release something that could be traced back to linux but if i recall correctly transmetas midori had some rudimentary cloud computing features vaguely similar to microsofts midori
1493742 we think its really important that these things can scale between in game and out of game and how we can use them on the web
1493743 a category of games to use avatars in different ways
1493744 the final guide we have this year is to think of them in an e10 context that doesnt mean it wont change but this fall they wont be able to blow each others heads off
1493745 the answer is a mixed one from a user profile perspective you have one avatar for one profile you can change you avatar whenever you want but if you want a new avatar you need a new profile
1493746 you could hand me a billion dollars and im still going to be on the field it doesnt matter to me but everyone has different situations has different views on money money is not more important than football to me right now
1493747 how can new media blogs social networks text messaging etc be used to impact the state of hiv
1493748 although we clearly face more challenging economic conditions in fiscal 2009 we are well positioned to deliver continued if somewhat less robust growth
1493749 we are going to fight the action we dont think the fees are warranted
1493750 it is inappropriate to make any comment at this stage
1493751 its not only in the carpet industry its in furniture curtains bedding everythings gone quiet in that area its bloody tough
1493752 the impact of the early 1990s recession on the grocery sector was very limited
1493753 however since then grocery purchasing has arguably become more discretionary as people have treated themselves by trading up to supermarkets finest or best ranges
1493754 as a result this time round the sector could be hit harder if consumers rein in their spend by cutting out unnecessary luxuries and trade down to cheaper rivals
1493755 consumers are already starting to change their behaviour and as consumer spending tightens the proportion spent on discretionary categories within the leisure and retail sectors is likely to decline
1493756 although downside risks to growth remain the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern
1493757 tight credit conditions the ongoing housing contraction and elevated energy prices are likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters
1493758 over time the substantial easing of monetary policy combined with ongoing measures to foster market liquidity should help to promote moderate economic growth
1493759 it is the reduction of interest rates that will bring about the firmest and surest revival of the property market
1493760 the effect was to move the goalposts for the bank of england keeping interest rates lower than they otherwise would have been and allowing the boom to continue
1493761 they are interested and im fairly confident the stores will want to go with it
1493762 the question is whether kpmg the administrators or hsbc will allow it to happen
1493763 wrapit are the ones who have run this business into the ground and hsbc have quite rightly protected what funds they could
1493764 a deal of this size at this stage of the cycle is something of a brave move for adecco given the economic backdrop
1493765 we are confident that we can try cases to the highest standards of justice
1493766 i assume the notion was lets see if we can get this engine to turn over
1493767 i find it difficult to consider this as much of a landmark
1493768 to close guantanamo try those accused of terrorist acts in a fair process release or resettle the others and finally put an end to this black spot on americas reputation
1493769 but i want to be able to say that mohammed had some reprehensible qualities without being thrown in jail without being demonised
1493770 the best thing people can do is stay at home and never get out of bed
1493771 its just so absurd to put the two words together the enlightenment is all about asking questions
1493772 you dont want to scare the kids because the kids love the character
1493773 but i think you could add a little bit of a creep factor i mean it never bugged me to watch frankenstein as a kid so you could have a little bit of it as long as you have a good story backing it up
1493774 but they were human can you bring that mentality to venom and make it work or do you make him all bad
1493775 youre trying to give something to people when they leave i dont know if you can have a movie about a guy who goes out there and maims everybody and wins all the time
1493776 i dont know what their mindset is and how they can get there other than adding too much niceness to him but well see
1493777 the only problem is that my feet hurt i spent seven days on that mountain it was hard it was terrible

1493780 there are about 6000 men in the masri family and hamas knows that if it enters the family quarter it would face a battle far worse than any it has already fought
1493781 hamas members are standing with the movement against their family their loyalty is to their paymaster hamas
1493782 i find it kind of bizarre given what we were doing
1493783 when i look back i cant recall anything that would have been a threat to anyone to think that we were being watched its a surprise
1493784 i dont think they had a reason to be following what we were doing unless they were on to something else i dont know about
1493785 if you wanted to see a bunch of women sitting around talking about issues and going on demonstrations are that are peaceful and non violent then so be it but i dont think there was a reason to do that
1493786 whats radical about equal pay for equal work and trying to empower women to reach the potential that they have
1493787 i think there had to be a lot of fear back then when you would see women get together to discuss these issues and maybe a lack of understanding comes to mind about what it was all about
1493788 all of those songs would have been sung at rallies demonstrations or meetings that we attended
1493789 this is a very partisan issue before us its very serious and im taking it seriously ive got my papers in order
1493790 theres been a concentrated effort over the past 20 years to improve our knowledge and expertise working with elephants and bulls
1493791 we really didnt get a good effort by a lot of different institutions to breed elephants in a co operative manner until the last 15 or 20 years
1493792 theres nothing like being up close to them to realize the size and beauty and intelligence
1493793 they had to use the jaws of life to extract him from the vehicle
1493794 he was lucid conscious he was talking joking with some of the rescue workers at one point
1493795 no one gives you a manual on how to govern
1493796 but i know there is more that unites us than divides us
1493797 we believe this plan strikes the right balance between bilingualism and equality
1493798 i find it kind of bizarre given what we were doing
1493799 when i look back i cant recall anything that would have been a threat to anyone to think that we were being watched its a surprise
1493800 i dont think they had a reason to be following what we were doing unless they were on to something else i dont know about
1493801 if you wanted to see a bunch of women sitting around talking about issues and going on demonstrations are that are peaceful and non violent then so be it but i dont think there was a reason to do that
1493802 whats radical about equal pay for equal work and trying to empower women to reach the potential that they have
1493803 i think there had to be a lot of fear back then when you would see women get together to discuss these issues and maybe a lack of understanding comes to mind about what it was all about

1493806 u s bishops vote your conscience catholics urged to weigh stands on all issues
1493807 single issue voting like simply choosing the anti abortion candidate is out
1493808 each candidates view on the entire spectrum of social issues including the war in iraq health care housing the plight of immigrants as well as abortion
1493809 a catholic cannot vote for a candidate who takes a position in favor of an intrinsic evil such as abortion or racism if the voters intent is to support that position in such cases a catholic would be guilty of formal cooperation in grave evil at the same time a voter should not use a candidates opposition to an intrinsic evil to justify indifference or inattentiveness to other important moral issues involving human life and dignity
1493810 its hard to find a candidate who supports all of the churchs teaching its a difficult time to decide how were voting especially this year
1493811 a catholic may vote for an abortion rights supporter such as democratic presidential candidate barack obama if that candidates views on other moral issues outweigh his abortion stand in the voters conscience
1493812 doctrinal note on some questions regarding the participation of catholics in political life
1493813 it must be noted also that a well formed christian conscience does not permit one to vote for a political program or an individual law which contradicts the fundamental contents of faith and morals no 4
1493814 not all moral issues are equal these ten goals address matters of different moral weight and urgency some involve matters of intrinsic evil that can never be supported section 90
1493815 it depends on the bishop of a certain region and fortunately for me communion has not been withheld
1493816 im a regular communicant so that would be a severe blow to me if that were the case
1493817 didnt raise me to be speaker they raised me to be holy
1493818 a decline in courage may be the most striking feature that an outside observer notices in the west today
1493819 the proclaimed and practiced autonomy of man from any higher force above him
1493820 a decline in courage may be the most striking feature that an outside observer notices in the west today must one point out that from ancient times a decline in courage has been considered the first symptom of the end
1493821 we have placed too much hope in politics and social reforms only to find out that we were being deprived of our most precious possession our spiritual life
1493822 it is trampled by the party mob in the east by the commercial one in the west
1493823 no i am not afraid of death any more when i was young the early death of my father cast a shadow over me and i was afraid to die before all my literary plans came true but between 30 and 40 years of age my attitude to death became quite calm and balanced i feel it is a natural but no means the final milestone of ones existence

1493828 he would live to look upon the western sea for he was complete at every hour
1493829 he watched the fire and if he saw portents there it was much the same to him he would live to look upon the western sea and he was equal to whatever might follow for he was complete at every hour whether his history should run concomitant with men and nations whether it should cease hed long forsworn all weighing of consequence and allowing as he did that mens destinies are given yet he usurped to contain within him all that he would ever be in the world and all that the world would be to him and be his charter written in the urstone itself he claimed agency and said so and hed drive the remorseless sun on to its fatal endarkenment as if hed ordered it all ages since before there were paths anywhere before there were men or suns to go upon them

1493898 so far as we know this is the single largest and most complex identity theft case ever charged in this country
1493899 it highlights the efforts of the justice department to fight this pernicious crime and shows that with the cooperation of our law enforcement partners around the world we can identify charge and apprehend even the most sophisticated international computer hackers
1493900 while technology has made our lives much easier it has also created new vulnerabilities this case clearly shows how strokes on a keyboard with a criminal purpose can have costly results consumers companies and governments from around the world must further develop ways to protect our sensitive personal and business information and detect those whether here or abroad that conspire to exploit technology for criminal gain
1493901 these prosecutions demonstrate that through coordinated commitment the united states secret service and the department of justice will penetrate and prosecute hacker organizations wherever based and however sophisticated the united states attorneys office for the southern district of california is especially gratified that the work of the san diego field office of the secret service contributed to an unprecedented effort to dismantle this international criminal enterprise
1493902 computer hacking and identity theft pose serious risks to our commercial personal and financial security
1493903 hackers who reach into our country from abroad will find no refuge from the reach of u s criminal justice
1493904 technology has forever changed the way commerce is conducted virtually erasing geographic boundaries
1493905 while these advances and the global nature of cyber crime continue to have a profound impact on our financial crimes investigations this case demonstrates how combining law enforcement resources throughout the world sends a strong message to criminals that they will be pursued and prosecuted no matter where they reside
1493906 the internal revenue service criminal investigation division recommends charges in numerous types of financial crimes
1493907 todays indictment is the result of a strong law enforcement partnership that brings together the necessary skills to follow alleged criminal activity from cyberspace to bank accounts we are committed to the governments efforts to stop this type of corruptive activity

1494020 no work in all indian literature is more quoted because none is better
1494021 the gita can be seen as the main literary support for the great religious
1494022 i am most impressed with a c bhaktivedanta swami prabhupadas scholarly and authoritative edition of bhagavad gita it is a most valuable work for the scholar as well as the layman and is of great utility as a reference book as well as a textbook i promptly recommend this edition to my students it is a beautifully done book
1494023 as a successor in direct line from caitanya the author of bhagavad gita
1494024 i have had the opportunity of examining several volumes published by the bhaktivedanta book trust and have found them to be of excellent quality and of great value for use in college classes on indian religions this is particularly true of the bbt edition and translation of the bhagavad gita
1494025 if truth is what works as pierce and the pragmatists insist there must be a kind of truth in the bhagavad gita as it is since those who follow its teachings display a joyous serenity usually missing in the bleak and strident lives of contemporary people
1494026 there is little question that this edition is one of the best books available on the gita and devotion prabhupadas translation is an ideal blend of literal accuracy and religious insight
1494027 the bhagavad gita one of the great spiritual texts is not as yet a common
1494028 the increasing numbers of western readers interested in classical vedic thought have been done a service by swami bhaktivedanta by bringing us a new and living interpretation of a text already known to many he has increased our understanding manyfold
1494029 the scholarly world is again indebted to a c bhaktivedanta swami
1494030 srila prabhupadas edition thus fills a sensitive gap in france where many
1494031 whether the reader be an adept of indian spiritualism or not a reading of
1494032 as a native of india now living in the west it has given me much grief to see so many of my fellow countrymen coming to the west in the role of gurus and spiritual leaders for this reason i am very excited to see the publication of bhagavad gita as it is by sri a c bhaktivedanta swami prabhupada it will help to stop the terrible cheating of false and unauthorized gurus and yogis and will give an opportunity to all people to understand the actual meaning of oriental culture
1494033 it is a deeply felt powerfully conceived and beautifully explained work i dont know whether to praise more this translation of the bhagavad gita its daring method of explanation or the endless fertility of its ideas i have never seen any other work on the gita with such an important voice and style it will occupy a significant place in the intellectual and ethical life of modern man for a long time to come
1494034 i can say that in the bhagavad gita as it is i have found explanations and answers to questions i had always posed regarding the interpretations of this sacred work whose spiritual discipline i greatly admire if the aesceticism and ideal of the apostles which form the message of the bhagavad gita as it is were more widespread and more respected the world in which we live would be transformed into a better more fraternal place

1494059 just curious how you reconcile obama no drilling stance with his ok to drill stance his prior we shouldnt touch the startegic petrolium reserves and now its ok
1494060 obamas reversal on tapping the national stockpile of crude oil comes just days after he said for the first time that he would agree to some offshore drilling as part of a broader energy policy compromise with republicans including john mccain who has supported additional drilling
1494061 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1494062 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaida something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1494063 the notion that the white house directed anyone to forge a letter from habbush to saddam hussein is absurd
1494064 we know now that those estimates were wrong but they were the estimates we all relied on
1494065 regardless military force in iraq was used because saddam hussein defiantly failed to comply with the 17 un security council resolutions iraq was subject to
1494066 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from cia ever involved in any such effort
1494067 it is well established that at my direction cia resisted efforts on the part of some in the administration to paint a picture of iraqi al qaida connections that went beyond the evidence
1494068 the notion that i would suddenly reverse our stance and have created and planted false evidence that was contrary to our own beliefs is ridiculous
1494069 the white house directed and cia allegedly went along with burying that information so that the war could go ahead as planned this is a complete fabrication in fact the source in question failed to persuade his british interlocutors that he had anything new to offer by way of intelligence concessions or negotiations with regard to the iraq crisis and the british on their own elected to break off contact with him
1494070 there were many iraqi officials who said both publicly and privately that iraq had no wmd but our foreign intelligence colleagues and we assessed that these individuals were parroting the baath party line and trying to delay any coalition attack the particular source that suskind cites offered no evidence to back up his assertion and acted in an evasive and unconvincing manner

1494225 however it is important for hospital trusts to have robust procedures in place to deal with any pest problems
1494226 the hygiene code requires nhs bodies to have a pest control policy that anticipates and manages this issue
1494227 trusts should take rapid action and follow through with surveillance in place to avoid pest incidents and minimize hazards

1494240 but i was so glad that i was in a position to compete for the championship to get back into contention to have an opportunity where every putt counted and put myself in a pressure situation heading into this event i would have loved to have won last week theres no arguing that point but i really needed to be there like i was
1494241 when im playing a course im trying to take half the trouble out of play
1494242 so i want to set up down the right edge of the fairway and hit a cut and if i miss it left it doesnt bother me what bothers me is if i hook it
1494243 because i missed it to the side i wanted to miss it
1494244 nothing ever was going to get as tough as birkdale you could put an asterisk next to it
1494245 the irony will be that the u s open could be the easiest course we play all year

1494251 a support group for glbt african americans their families and friends is very much needed in this community this is a large step in the right direction for pflag and i am hoping that it promotes awareness and acceptance in the african american community as a whole around the issue of homophobia
1494252 the announcement of this new support group for our african american community is something pflag winston salem has wanted to do for a very long time tameicka clear has really brought a great deal to the table in helping all of us at pflag recognize and respect the differences between the black and white cultures around glbt issues
1494253 generally speaking research and outreach to lgbt persons of color is still limited
1494254 well i just dont see why you have to look at porn if you have me
1494255 obama subscribed to bang bros in the month of july 2003
1494256 you got to come up here and take the stage and own them and murder them
1494257 we really feel like this is where we should be
1494258 oftentimes at the entry level the flexibility might be limited but they really leapfrog you when you take that next step up
1494259 so getting an employer to explain how all of that works is ammunition for that next step up ask what it will take to get there and consistently monitor where you are so that you can proactively manage it
1494260 assume the offer you get is somewhere close to what they can offer
1494261 the employer is not sandbagging you trying to offend you or saying youre not worth 35 zillion by offering you 35 000 but it shows confidence and professionalism to come back
1494262 the harm is in being obnoxious never asking or not receiving the feedback that you need to learn and grow
1494263 do your best not to come across as demanding but as someone who wants to be recognized for the fantastic contribution you want to make
1494264 theres a misconception among employers that gen yers have out of whack expectations
1494265 but many times what theyre asking for isnt necessarily a huge raise or promotion but thats how they express it and thats perceived as impatience as not valuing the learning process and as devaluing all the people whove gone down this path already
1494266 realize that your audience wants you to be successful but they also want you to contribute learn not race through or overlook things like the importance of those entry level posts
1494267 so go to the point of explicitly overemphasizing that youre not trying to skip steps in the process or looking for a new job before getting the first one done show that you just want to do the best job possible and be leading the pack
1494268 this can work against yers because employers wont consider them for opportunities that require focus and thoughtfulness
1494269 employers fear they wont have the sticktoitiveness required to get the job done
1494270 the launching pad those will give you matter more than whether youre making 30 000 or 60 000 it may seem like a 100 percent difference but that 30k job in the long run could put you on a path thats worth so much more than 30k a year

1494280 how to indicate interest without indicating yourself right out of a job
1494281 when hes out of your life but not out of the office next door
1494282 this has been going on since men and women have worked together since they were sowing crops in the field
1494283 the physical community of yore didnt relocate to the internet it relocated to the workplace
1494284 thats so much more heartening than the possibility that were all just sitting in our rooms plugged in but completely disconnected from each other
1494285 if you jump into an office relationship and turn it into a hookup youre not taking advantage of the one thing that meeting someone at the office offers you the advantage of time
1494286 thats silly and its just going to lead to drama
1494287 just because its an office romance doesnt mean its conducted in the office
1494288 you dont want to be two soldiers in a foxhole thrown together because you work together
1494289 you want to make sure you have more to talk about than work and if you dont then you should take a strong look at your relationship because you dont want to change jobs and realize that you need to change boyfriends
1494290 its much easier to do when youre first dating when youre in love and its all very theoretical than when youre at each others throats
1494291 the office romance is the last bastion of old fashioned courting because you were friends you can remain friends and you have a different history because you werent always a couple
1494292 the first impulse when you start dating someone at the office is to drop out of the office gang
1494293 because thats the best way you can think of not to divulge anything but youre just alienating yourself from your network
1494294 to make people feel comfortable early on discretion makes people comfortable and as a relationship progresses and everyones aware openness makes them comfortable
1494295 most people dont disapprove well over two thirds are happy for you or dont care

1494315 you guys are more skilled and know more than your parents now
1494316 the only thing you lack is confidence for example last night in my litigation course my professor a baby boomer confessed that he didnt know what a motion in limine was until five years out of law school a girl in my class probably about 25 had already done one as an advocate but had to be coaxed to offer this
1494317 you could always just get a phd to buy some time till youre 30
1494318 these young people dont understand that they need to distinguish themselves
1494319 its almost wrong to reach out and say im a leader theyre trained to work in teams in school in extracurriculars they travel in groups of people they dont date singly everything is in this touchy feely team environment thats all fine and merry when youre a very junior candidate but when you start moving up through the ranks you have to put a stake in the ground
1494320 this manifests in all sorts of ways from not having focus to having hyper focus to being in la la land about what they can and cant do to what they make in terms of money some just want to make money while others dont care at all all of that translates into confidence
1494321 when they do have to make a decision on their own theyre looking for affirmation they have no basic experience to allow them to be confident about the decisions theyre making
1494322 im not sorry for not answering your phone you should be on time for your meeting you dont pay or respect me enough

1494327 theyre special and however they say things is very cute

1494331 when the construction is complete travel on the highway will be safer and more reliable for tourists residents and truckers
1494332 and there will be fewer traffic tie ups on this crucial national commercial transportation artery
1494333 upgrading the trans canada highway from coast to coast is one of our highest priorities
1494334 and todays announcement is an important step forward in that plan
1494335 its just now starting to recede at one point it was up to four feet in the front yard
1494336 the van is going to be one of those insurance cases
1494337 there is no economic justification for these changes because balpa is one of the most successful and financially robust trade unions in the uk
1494338 i dont know how anybody can say its a safe republican seat with that kind of a track record
1494339 the republican party and the democratic party will contest this seat as they must as they should and it benefits the state of nebraska i hope the best candidates will come forward
1494340 if kerrey runs democrats will be dancing in the streets
1494341 if johanns comes back and runs i dont think bruning has a chance
1494342 i suspect that there will be many candidates who will be in that race next year
1494343 in our assessment she is the strongest candidate in the race
1494344 i think its too early for anyone to take anything for granted but we have a lot of very encouraging momentum
1494345 it would have been a pain not to get the endorsement
1494346 effective treatment for the physical and psychological wounds our soldiers have suffered in this conflict must rise to the top of capitol hills to do list
1494347 we are right where we hope and expect to be we are building the campaign from ground zero
1494348 most of the folks whom i consulted put the minimum budget needed to be competitive in this primary at half a million dollars or more
1494349 read the writing on the wall she would have trouble fundraising
1494350 right now it is just a campaign of personalities the iraq war is really the only issue that defines any of the candidates
1494351 there are a lot of people that like his idea of not politics as usual
1494352 ive been fighting for issues that people really care about
1494353 they care about their jobs and care about their children they care about access to health care thats how i will build a winning campaign against who is really at the right wing extreme
1494354 we showed that we could raise significant amount of dollars
1494355 barry is very popular in our area and i do know he has a lot of support
1494356 i want to see a bigger picture for our district
1494357 people who seek to divide us do so at their own political peril as this past election demonstrated
1494358 congressman broun is focused on working for the citizens of the 10th congressional district to represent their views and values and we are confident that as they see his record of hard work and fighting for conservative principles that they will want to return him to congress for another term
1494359 our nation faces serious challenges now more than ever the people of californias 52nd congressional district deserve an experienced leader to represent them
1494360 a congressional seat is too important to pass from father to son as a birthright because of name recognition when americas future is at stake
1494361 if you look at the number of people in the gop who backed the son prior to the other challengers getting a fair shake in the primary you just have to scratch your head and wonder is this how our nation was designed to function
1494362 a lot of people in the republican party are starting to think its not working so well for them so im going to provide them an option
1494363 listening to their opinions and learning what issues concern them the most
1494364 competition can be good for the republican party and good for nebraska
1494365 i am encouraged by hals decision to run a positive campaign and his pledge to refrain from the divisive rhetoric and personal attacks of his previous campaigns
1494366 weve been so dry flooding hasnt been much of an issue
1494367 were prepared to identify problems identify resources and supply those resources if needed
1494368 we definitely have a viable campaign were just going through the process of proving it to the public
1494369 there is a strategic issue that has to be dealt with but i personally think its about number nine in a list of strategic threats for america and the world
1494370 you dont challenge the queen unless you know the queen is definitely gone
1494371 i think there is a sense that if there is an overreaching a challenger could pay the price
1494372 the congresswoman has a different district and hasnt relied on fundraising
1494373 it is a small compacted district and she has a great grass roots network
1494374 the numbers indicate in the recent vote totals that the electorate is ready for a change in district seven
1494375 it is obvious that they dont appreciate a congressional delegate that rarely shows up to vote and when they do rarely does it reflect the electorate
1494376 restore our government to its limited constitutional boundaries and biblical foundations
1494377 we are proud of the role sen bidens leadership pac played in electing democratic legislative majorities in iowa and new hampshire
1494378 the early states on the primary calendar are mostly all swing states the democrats need to win the pac has been an invaluable vehicle for sen biden as he helps democrats develop their stances on national security and foreign policy having elected majorities will help us in 2008
1494379 i would have thought that leadership pacs would go into hibernation
1494380 because if they dont they run the risk that the fec is going to consider the expenses made by the leadership pac to be effectively coordinated with the presidential campaign or in kind contributions to the presidential campaign
1494381 its time to tell the big corporations and the lobbyists who have been running things for too long that their time is over
1494382 registered individual lobbyists represent only a small fraction of the money that comes in
1494383 the big money comes from the companies who hire the lobbyists
1494384 but if you got rid of that thered be very little money in the system thats the dilemma
1494385 the solution is not perfect but sen obama believes in leading by example which is why he has refused to take a dime from federal lobbyists or pacs in order to stay true to this commitment we also review contributions on a regular basis to ensure that even a check that has inadvertently slipped through is returned
1494386 to end the game in washington and stop powerful interests from writing our policies to benefit their bottom line while regular families struggle to get by let alone get ahead
1494387 its an important symbolic statement about lobbyist interest in washington and the political power of lobbying interests that has eclipsed the power of voters in washington
1494388 the real solution is will they get rid of the big lobby money by establishing a public finance system
1494389 from a policy point of view thats the key issue
1494390 after 17 years of commuting every week to washington d c 17 years of being gone all week its time to be home with the people that i love and i miss in a nutshell its time to start living life
1494391 there are a lot of people who have been sitting on the sidelines waiting for
1494392 has always shown a willingness to move to the good idea not just the republican idea
1494393 i dont think this is a district that is going to be won by a demagogue
1494394 voters will look for a well balanced thoughtful solutions oriented candidate
1494395 sen kennedy assured me hes going to get it done in the senate and patrick and i assured him were going to get it done in the house
1494396 we have a strong base of support and its now just a question of capitalizing upon that by building the organization
1494397 randy has deep deep experience nationwide in building campaign organizations that have been some of the most successful in history
1494398 all of the people who are well acquainted with the intricacies of the caucus process have pretty much been scooped up by other candidates
1494399 so its hard at this point to try to assemble a particularly good organization to try to turn people out on caucus night
1494400 at this point even tossing five people into that state is not a lot youve got 99 counties and some 2 000 precincts and so thats an awful lot of work to leave yourself in a little time
1494401 hes the only one whos really developed a sophisticated ground operation in iowa at this point
1494402 i dont think its impossible but i think that theyve got a lot of work to do
1494403 thats an advantage to us in that we havent had to spend that money but its also a disadvantage that theyve been out talking to voters a little bit longer than we have but its all going to come down to whose message is able to carry the day whose message is going to be resonating most completely with voters
1494404 hes growing some support but he should have been there wednesday night
1494405 politics is just not going to rattle many peoples cages for a while
1494406 i think florida republicans like republicans elsewhere are waiting to see how well he does in the polls but its kind of a catch 22 youve got to be somewhere to create excitement and move up in the polls but you cant get excitement unless youre up in the polls
1494407 were comfortable with him he speaks our language its like having a conversation on your front porch
1494408 were happy to be in the mix but its football season and all due respect were not as enamored with ourselves to expect to be feted and courted
1494409 its hot as the devil its 95 degrees outside and people are busy and so in terms of getting the greater public to focus on these candidates i dont think in this case for thompson being quote late to the game is going to hurt him one bit
1494410 jeanne shaheen is our strongest candidate to defeat john sununu in 2008
1494411 her commitment to the same principles that i have fought for during this campaign will make her a tremendous senator for new hampshire and the nation i am proud to support her in all her efforts
1494412 as i read the news and watched television about whats been happening in washington i found myself thinking whats wrong with these guys
1494413 im working to teach the next generation to get involved in public service and show how government should work while down in washington government isnt working at all
1494414 bring our troops home as safely and swiftly as we possibly can
1494415 if youre a republican youre going to love it if youre a democrat youre going to hate it
1494416 the conventional wisdom is a republican can win an election without california and a democrat cant
1494417 as opposed to waiting and letting the die get cast we decided to form very quickly and take some aggressive responses right from the beginning
1494418 once people learn about this support drops to the floor pretty quickly
1494419 weve had some success thus far in educating the public on what this is and thats been reflected
1494420 you wont see this campaign doing anything other than trying to excite the base and get the base to go vote in a low turnout election on june 3
1494421 it is a democratic power grab they feel that they have some kind of title and ownership of californias electoral votes
1494422 would not have the stomach for a beer in that bar
1494423 gets access to information of a personal or family nature held on information systems or computers which are public or private
1494424 means the existence of a reserved area away from others which is necessary to maintain a minimum quality of human life
1494425 loveland captivated me with its modern day twist on the dating format bringing something fresh and exciting to the genre
1494426 cilla is the undisputed queen of the dating show theres been many pretenders to her throne but she remains in a class of her own
1494427 the vibrant energetic look reflects our strengthening entertainment positioning and puts the standout content right at its heart
1494428 people have stopped spending on the home its not only in the carpet industry its in furniture curtains bedding everythings gone quiet in that area
1494429 people have got more indebted than they were in 1974
1494430 now after the third hung jury the idea now that suddenly in tampa there is new information previously unknown about this kid who has been investigated ad nauseam for at least the last five years or so doesnt make any sense to me
1494431 at this point it seems to be more personal than professional
1494432 she is not my mummy she is a stranger she took me from my mummy
1494433 i asked where that holiday was but the little girl was incapable of telling me i even asked if she was on a camping site or in a hotel but she was unable to say
1494434 it is a disgrace that we have been kept in the dark about the details of this sighting and perhaps many other sightings for the last 15 months
1494435 iran is a very important country that is on the active agenda of the entire world
1494436 i consider these discussions concerning the details of the visit irrelevant in the context of such an important process they will cast a shadow over the essence of the visit
1494437 the french support was of a political military diplomatic and logistic nature
1494438 french forces directly assassinated tutsis and hutus accused of hiding tutsis french forces committed several rapes on tutsi survivors
1494439 we ask authorities to undertake all necessary actions to bring the accused french political and military leaders to answer for their acts before justice
1494440 we are used to these tactics from the iranians but the fact is that they havent yet broken things off
1494441 will be more prolonged than we thought a year ago it is important to be straight with people
1494442 stamp duty acts as a material disincentive to moving and reforms would help first time buyers but removing stamp duty only addresses buyer confidence not the wider problems in the financial markets
1494443 the government estimates that 2 5 million families are living in fuel poverty yet despite the billions in profits the energy industry spends just 50m a year combating fuel poverty and has only agreed to raise this to 150m by 2010
1494444 in this business there are too many players and when things turn bad it becomes a suicidal race
1494445 our charges remain within the limit we are allowed to charge by our regulator the civil aviation authority
1494446 more than three times the rate of inflation and totally unjustified at a time when most other uk and european airports are reducing costs and charges ryanair will continue to oppose this regulatory rip off
1494447 usually id be at home shaping this thing with the variety of tools that i use and bringing it in and expecting people to go wow this is amazing its harrowers usual sculpted prose
1494448 ok im just joking but im being less of an author in this than anything ive ever done i build the fucking scaffold at home myself usually i have a sense of where the story is going i know where its going to end i have the whole shape of it in my head but with this i havent even read the play through yet
1494449 it was one of those books that opened up a new way of thinking about the world to me
1494450 it exposed the hypocrisy of how we think of ourselves in britain as a civilised society and yet we are surrounded by children in the most terrible circumstances
1494451 to try a different way of working i wanted to test myself
1494452 i knew if we were going to make a piece of theatre we had to do it now it felt urgent black watch communicated something that people needed to know about at the time and this felt similar i wanted us to move quickly
1494453 i dont begin plays this way usually i have a daft wee idea that grows this little carbuncle on it then that grows another bigger one on it and that becomes a play it doesnt start with ninety five per cent of children in care have mental health issues i dont start with statistics ever i start with an idea like a man rubbing the inside of his thigh and someone seeing it do you know what i mean the writing that came out of my addressing statistics was shit
1494454 i was worried there werent enough stories in a flat with the poverty of imagination i have
1494455 my first thought was do they want a lot of scots kids sitting around taking drugs because thats not the stuff that i write
1494456 we did more and more research and realised the flat means the end of care and the end of state parenting and it also means the beginning of adult life
1494457 it also means a place where these people can die a place where things can fuck up so it became this very complex metaphorical place where you find out how well you are prepared for the world about your identity
1494458 the thing about this world is once you get into it its a place with so many ghosts
1494459 we are dealing with people who have very little sense of where they have come from and where they are going you come back to core psychological things low self esteem anger mental health issues these are people who are not in control of their own narratives every time you want to complete the circle you cant time and again with everyone ive talked to there is a sense of unfinishedness about these people incompleteness
1494460 there can often be no such thing as a reliable narrator
1494461 where we try to latch hold of a narrative and grasp at a truth
1494462 when i see people fannying around on the floor i think thats going in my story the story that i started fuck off but as it gets tighter and tighter i realise this is what i always wanted this piece to be a collective response to something
1494463 the cast have got to learn that for the greater good of the piece some people are not going to get as much as other people i write a monologue for somebody and everyone wants a monologue its like youre coming into a war torn country with a lorry full of rice and every day people gather round the back of the lorry and you unload your scripts and they get what they get and theres always about four or five who dont get anything and they sort of retreat to the corner of the room
1494464 everything i have written up to now is two people arguing about why one of them left the other it feels very earthbound i dont think i have ever used a metaphor well
1494465 ive been pissing around doing film and tv for the past year and i think why am i wasting my time with that shit i could stage the peloponnesian war between two people in a caravan
1494466 by the desire to change the political landscape in watford for the benefit of the conservative party
1494467 it was the individual impact of what he did that was so appalling i find it quite extraordinary my daughters were very upset to see it come to a point of determination was a great relief
1494468 this has been a traumatic period for all those who have suffered from his vile campaign
1494469 we need to examine more closely whats behind this when you look at the english results theres a significant drop we need to be able to properly analyse the interplay between reading and writing and testing
1494470 level four is the gold standard which the government puts a lot of weight on we know schools run booster classes for pupils who are just below that mark but it doesnt explain why the difference is so marked this year
1494471 the level five results are not as important to schools as level four results the targets are at level four and thats where all the effort goes
1494472 vote of confidence in the markers and the validation of their hard work over the last few months
1494473 i still cant understand why the results were published in the first place the previous decision to remove borderlining checking of test scripts that fall just below level thresholds combined with etss incompetence can only increase the size of the question mark over the results
1494474 these are alarming figures suggesting that fewer pupils are achieving excellence and that pupils are not being stretched to the best of their abilities
1494475 since labour came to power a total of over 3 million pupils have not obtained the basics in the three rs and ministers have still failed to hit targets that they promised to meet two years ago

1494477 this is a very intelligent woman what is she doing outside of the governors residence
1494478 the woman is a phd is a woman like this really that stupid there is an incongruity and i have trouble accepting the governments claims
1494479 i call her the grey lady because she is almost a ghost a spectre whose cries and screams continue to haunt those who heard her
1494480 led by the american soldier placing his hand on one of her shoulders and the other hand on her back and her hands and feet chained together
1494481 this woman stayed there until she lost her mind until she became insane hitting the door and screaming day and night
1494482 this is one of the greatest lies of the 21st century
1494483 the public clamour has now forced them to own up
1494484 her rape and torture is a crime beyond anything she was accused of
1494485 she has had no access to any lawyer presume her to be innocent before proven guilty please how can this punishment be fit for any crime
1494486 they just release the information when it suits them everything we know about bagram means that we know she siddiqui would have suffered abuse
1494487 the mist in the air that we see in those places including here is not a feature of pollution primarily but a feature of evaporation and humidity
1494488 we do have a communication problem here once the misconception has become sort of established in the minds of people its not that easy to get the right message through
1494489 i would not discourage athletes from wearing protection devices if they are concerned but i do not think it is necessary i would not wear one whether i was an athlete or not
1494490 exaggeration of the problem that has been seen in the media
1494491 those who standards are fairly tough to meet but in many respects the beijing area does so im sure im confident the air quality will not prove to pose major problems to the athletes and to the visitors in beijing
1494492 we have had some readings that were above the interim target data but since then they have gone down and been below that level we will evaluate those pollution levels and should problems arise we may have to take some action
1494493 to come to a city even though the air quality might be inferior the long term effects should no longer be feared by temporary visitors
1494494 im not sure i even agree with myself 100 percent
1494495 you have to figure out whos electable who can win
1494496 because if we make a mistake about that this country is going to go in a direction that i think you and i very much disagree with
1494497 you are pretty used to hearing aspirants for public office come before you and pledge fealty to the cause of the second amendment
1494498 for more than two decades ive opposed the efforts of the anti gun crowd to ban guns ban ammunition ban magazines and paint gun owners as some kind of fringe group dangerous in modern america
1494499 one of the most basic and fundamental rights of every american
1494500 my door was always open to you and that will continue to be the case if i am elected president
1494501 is about the closest to heaven as you can find on this earth
1494502 the second amendment is the last goal line the last bastion of defense against even our own government should it go completely awry and turn into tyranny
1494503 as a governor a westerner a supporter of our individual freedoms and a democrat i urge all nra members to stay involved in the election of candidates of both political parties
1494504 as president i will lead an all out effort to protect all our rights including the second amendment
1494505 was not the second coming of reagan that californians envisioned
1494506 a recognition of god and the fact that there are certain rights that come from him and not the government
1494507 is a system of checks and balances and a separation of powers that flow from our guiding documents and from the rule of law
1494508 as a young aggressive lawyer i couldnt have had a better experience or introduction
1494509 so not only is it in my head its in my heart now
1494510 why would one ever want to run for president thats the real question
1494511 i have to admit in a weak moment it crosses my mind i usually just get over it
1494512 this massive attack was intended to break our spirit it has not done that it has made us stronger more determined and more resolved
1494513 we united first in sorrow and anger and then in the recognition that we were attacked for who we are a people united in a kinship of ideals committed to the fundamental truth that all men and women are created equal and endowed by god with inalienable rights
1494514 stick together in the great challenge of our time as we continue to battle the forces that threaten our country and the cherished ideals for which we stand
1494515 is hard for our minds to contemplate a human darkness so vile that it celebrates murder and the destruction of innocent lives
1494516 but we can honor the bright memories of the fallen from soldiers guarding our liberty on foreign shores to those of us living under the umbrella of the protection they provide we are united in remembering loved ones lost on that day and in our determination to protect our homeland from future attacks
1494517 those who lost their lives at the hands of radical islamic terrorists who despise our values and way of life as well as those men and women who have made the ultimate sacrifice helping their fellow citizens that tragic day
1494518 make sure our nation continues to stand for freedom remains strong and united in the face of threats and secure
1494519 countless new yorkers and others continue to experience health problems as a result of the toxic cloud of chemicals and debris that blanketed streets and poisoned lungs many are sick some have died we must never forget the sacrifice of those who served at ground zero and fresh kills in the rescue and recovery and we must honor their sacrifice by helping all those who need it
1494520 let us always mark this day by affirming that hope will triumph over fear and that a new generation of americans will seek a safer freer and more perfect union
1494521 as we look forward in the face of growing threats americans must remain vigilant in our fight against terrorism and seek a new path that unites like minded nations in a global mission to shut down terrorism once and for all
1494522 congress and the white house must move forward in a bipartisan effort to strengthen our nations security improve our intelligence capabilities and promote a foreign policy that unites the world against the scourge of international terrorism
1494523 the anniversary of sept 11 is a solemn occasion for the nation and the world to remember the loved ones we lost but it is also a reminder that we must make real progress in the face of a continuing threat
1494524 this begins with quickly and safely ending the war in iraq and using the resources we had been expending there to reinforce our efforts to secure afghanistan and hunt down the real terrorists responsible for the 9 11 attacks
1494525 it will also require restoring our standing in the world by restoring our constitution saying no to torture and shutting down guantanamo and we must invest in our first responders who keep our country and our communities at the ready
1494526 six years after the attacks we are not as safe as we should be we remain committed to fighting al qaida where they are and implementing policies that make our country safer and more secure
1494527 it is important that congress wake up to the truth and exercise its obligation under the constitution to save our nation from being destroyed from the lies that took us into iraq the lies that keep us there the lies that are being used to set the stage for war against iran and the lies that have undermined our basic civil liberties here at home
1494528 the sept 11 resolution that congress considers today should have made reference to those matters it does not so i cannot support it
1494529 while british attitudes are more egalitarian than in the 1980s there are signs that support for gender equality may have hit a high point some time during the 1990s
1494530 when it comes to the clash between work and family life doubts about whether a woman should be doing both are starting to creep in
1494531 attempts to shoehorn women into workplaces made by men for men have failed
1494532 women still shoulder the bulk of caring and housework at home the long working hours culture and lack of flexible working means women are presented with impossible choices forced to choose between caring for a family at home or maximising their career opportunities the result motherhood carries a penalty and women and men are straitjacketed by gender stereotypes
1494533 many mothers tell us that in the first year of a babys life they want to stay at home but often feel they have to return to work too early because of financial constraints we need to do more to help mothers and fathers by increasing well paid parental leave and changing how it can be shared between them
1494534 the results are even more extreme in the us where the percentage of people arguing that family life does not suffer if a woman works has plummeted from 51 in 1994 to 38 in 2002
1494535 the notion that there has been a steady increase in favour of women taking an equal role in the workplace and away from their traditional role in the home is clearly a myth
1494536 instead there is clear evidence that womens changing role is viewed as having costs both for the woman and the family
1494537 it is conceivable that opinions are shifting as the shine of the super mum syndrome wears off and the idea of women juggling high powered careers while also baking cookies and reading bedtime stories is increasingly seen to be unrealisable by ordinary mortals
1494538 in britain and the us however where support for equal opportunities for both sexes is much longer standing some people are now starting to have second thoughts
1494539 in most cases this appears to revolve around concerns that the welfare of children and of the family are being compromised the more women spend their time at work and find themselves lumbered with the double burden of employment and family care
1494540 we are still educating to confirm a gender role division that people thought was eradicated 25 years ago
1494541 at the moment in the uk we are heading in the wrong direction after a period when there was greater support at an ideological level for an equal division of labour
1494542 if we are to make progress in devising policies that encourage equal working opportunities for women we need to know more about what gender roles people view as practical as possible and as fair
1494543 by making all roles flexible at every level ending the long working hours culture and challenging discriminatory attitudes women and men could participate in the workplace on an equal footing and live free from stereotypes about whose role it is to do the caring
1494544 when this happens business the economy and society as a whole will all reap the benefits
1494545 the british economy cannot afford not to have women in the workforce women make up 45 of employees in an age when we have significant skill shortages we cannot miss out on any part of the talent pool
1494546 our latest research shows 79 of organisations are struggling to recruit and 75 are struggling to retain skills they have to think how to address the need for more flexibility for women and men
1494547 a family does not suffer if a woman is in full time employment
1494548 it is the husbands job to earn income and the wifes to look after the children
1494549 when i grew up i tried to ask but there werent really answers
1494550 during my theological studies at university it became clear that i couldnt be a minister in the church
1494551 i concluded that christianity was paganism one of its most important dogmas is that god became man and if god becomes man then man also can become god
1494552 well you see he is a father of course but ideologically there was no connection i was so involved in my conviction that i had found the right path all the other items no longer had any importance
1494553 for him that was the end of the world my son is leaving germany to study in a jewish rabbinical seminary he told me i was crazy and renounced me as a son
1494554 people there dont get married and if they do they have one child
1494555 but the turks and the other foreigners have many children so it is a question of time that germany will no longer be german
1494556 germany will leave the stage of history no doubt about it
1494557 all the great cultures have left the stage of history
1494558 the romans the greeks the egyptians the babylonians but this little people who gave so much to the world do not
1494559 the motive of the converts is to join the community of the victims if you become part of the victim community you get rid of the burden of being part of the perpetrator community
1494560 shear yashuv represents a person who ran away from the past
1494561 there were no jews in these stories and no nazis in these stories
1494562 no no there were no nazis we are not nazis we didnt know any jews we didnt know anything
1494563 people said now we have closed the circle now everything is fine
1494564 it was like nothing had happened but there were 11 000 jews in munich before the holocaust where are they now
1494565 because i was annoyed by how the narrative was fixed
1494566 there is something not right when you do it to get rid of your german burden
1494567 that is not honest in my eyes do you stop being the daughter of a wehrmacht soldier if you are jewish no that is no solution you dont get rid of it
1494568 to live here to work here to be this bridge between two worlds
1494569 that is another way of saying what i have already told you
1494570 they want to join the community of the victim they may have their own way of rationalising it
1494571 i was always looking for my place i hated catholicism i have hated it since i was 14
1494572 what counts is the deed in christianity it is enough just to believe
1494573 i didnt think of my family of being like the germans
1494574 you went in the classroom twice a week they told you you fell asleep
1494575 she was 13 she says she remembered there were jewish shops that got burned down and it was a big loss because she said you could always go to the jews and buy something and if you didnt have the money you could bring it in next time
1494576 i feel myself turning into a block of ice every time when i go back i have to force myself to melt down again
1494577 but it is not the way to work through the role of the parents in the war i think it is running away from it in order to be able to really work through the past you have to try to understand how could it be that your father was a mass murderer you have to think of the possibilities that had you lived at this time you might also have been able to do such things
1494578 being in israel is to keep away as far as possible from it
1494579 i am not sure to what extent they have really been accepted into israeli society i think they are struggling i dont envy them
1494580 you are not here to speak to me you are here to speak to my girlfriend
1494581 i met some who surprised me some of them were shockingly unintelligent i even wondered why they would have the intellectual independence to make this choice especially the people who chose to be ultra orthodox who chose to throw away their freedom
1494582 i was worried i would get hurt by information i didnt want to know
1494583 sometimes i feel that a lot of israelis live that way it is better not to ask questions and not be hurt and so you dont have to look at yourself or your family or your nation and you can live with the illusion of who is good and who is bad
1494584 i heard a boy next door call another boy a stupid jew
1494585 i asked my mother what is a jew and is it something bad
1494586 i was physically disgusted and i was totally disgusted by even my own germanness
1494587 and because this entered my mind so early it became as natural as brushing my teeth
1494588 i felt that i was being told that to be a good jew you had to hate arabs
1494589 it causes a lot of tension to come here and say the things that i say
1494590 because it would be very inconsistent to have had so much criticism of germans who were terrible cowards when it was still possible to say something and then to come here and not speak up for justice
1494591 dont think i havent thought about it in those terms myself
1494592 i had wanted to connect myself to a history i did not perceive as shameful now i am wondering if i will stay i am more or less sure that i wont sometimes i feel i am not built for it that i am not strong enough for this country
1494593 sometimes i feel that just by existing i am always wrong here but i cannot live with personal attacks now i cannot bear it
1494594 on the condition that you do not print my name
1494595 hans married my grandmother erna after she divorced my grandfather
1494596 i have neither any blood nor dna from adolf and his family
1494597 but i always appreciated that she told me the truth about it we spoke frankly i never heard that normal german lie you hear so often from that generation
1494598 she became one of those german ladies who cleared up after all the bombing
1494599 that is all that my mother brought home from the war i keep them to honour her
1494600 i saw my father very seldom and the times i saw him i was so proud to have a father that it was not the time to ask what he did in the war he died when i was 19 so i never asked him what he did
1494601 it was not a sudden light from heaven that came down
1494602 how could people be so stupid as to elect a person who was writing things like this its awful
1494603 i dont think you can really understand how awful it is if you dont read it in german i put it away but i keep it here
1494604 you raise up an army if you think you have to use it
1494605 i felt at home i was no longer living in a conflict i didnt have to reject the older generation and i thought i had met for the first time a nationality that at that point in history today it is more problematic still had good reasons to be proud of itself
1494606 the sharp distinction between the generations that committed the crimes and the generation born after wouldnt exist
1494607 when i hear my own son speak as i did last weekend i sat like this
1494608 two of my sons are chauvinists and one of them is even partially racist i cant listen to fascistic discourse i dont suffer that
1494609 each time i hear it is another time too much if the holocaust and the third reich have really somehow shaped me i am a sworn democrat i believe that democracy has to prove itself by keeping the rights of its minorities
1494610 i see that soldier trampling that child and in the end killing it and i remember that kind of aggression i remember the feeling of the child too i remember both i could see my father or my grandfather really standing there
1494611 is that since i came to israel that feeling isnt there any more
1494612 there have to be some places on the planet where you dont go for energy production
1494613 they have taken natural landscapes and turned them into industrial sites
1494614 the coalition gives us the chance to increase the volume and to represent ourselves as mainstream
1494615 i dont think this can go ahead this area is far too valuable there is a saying in business if you want to make omelettes you have to break eggs we dont want to be those eggs
1494616 philanthropic giving should not be a replacement for state support
1494617 we found that when the experimenters mimicked yawning 21 out of 29 dogs showed contagious yawning so this is a very strong and reliable effect
1494618 none of the dogs in the control group yawned we know contagious yawning is linked to empathy so it may mean dogs can empathise well with humans but we need to do more tests to be sure
1494619 our richly diverse electorate deserves a primary process that requires candidates to address the issues they will be held accountable for in the general election
1494620 the january 15th primary in michigan accomplishes precisely this goal
1494621 michigan democrats believe that no state should enjoy a privileged position every four years in selecting our partys presidential nominee
1494622 is an effort to perpetuate their self appointed privileged position
1494623 ive set the date the same way every single time
1494624 and ive been lucky i will set it at a time that i feel will honor the tradition
1494625 the rnc rules that were unanimously adopted at the convention in 2004 are clear and will be applied equally to every state party
1494626 were pretty confident that all of our delegates are going to get seated and that their votes are going to count at the convention
1494627 we ought to mind our own business bring our troops home
1494628 so youre saying we should take our marching orders from al qaida
1494629 were losing elections and were going down next year if we dont change it it has all to do with foreign policy
1494630 even if we lose elections we should not lose our honor and that is more important to the republican party
1494631 i was scheduled to be on jay leno tonight but i gave up my spot for somebody else
1494632 hes done a pretty good job of playing my part on law and order
1494633 if something is called an issue ad but it is really an ad for a particular candidate it is called such
1494634 if it walks quacks and acts like a duck we are going to call it a duck
1494635 it all gets back to pretty basic stuff for me
1494636 i think the american people look at a system where we spend so much time with our hand out for so much money from so many people who do so much business with the federal government who we are basically regulating and legislating on and they look at that system and the amounts of money that are involved nowadays and they dont have much confidence in it
1494637 most conservatives think mccain feingold is an assault on the first amendment and also did not forward the cause of making government more ethical
1494638 in the meetings that i have attended where hes been speaking to conservatives it has come up
1494639 i think that is one area that a lot of conservatives have a lot of difficulty with him
1494640 sen thompson will have to clarify his current position on political speech
1494641 we shouldnt just take off the limits and have the full disclosure with harsh penalties for not reporting everything
1494642 weve got a situation where people could give politicians huge sums of money which is the soft money situation at that time and then come before those same politicians and ask them to pass legislation for them
1494643 i mean you get thrown in jail for stuff like that in the real world and so i always thought that there was some reasonable limitation that ought to be put on that
1494644 i dont think its an issue that goes away it is an issue that he has worked to diffuse and he may successfully diffuse
1494645 i do think it will come up but i dont think campaign finance reform is a big issue
1494646 sen tom called me this morning to let me know that he is pulling out of the 8th district congressional race and is formally and enthusiastically endorsing my candidacy we will be working together in the future to bring real change to the district
1494647 based on my 27 years of experience and my leadership in local government i believe that i am at a point where i can impact events in washington and represent the needs of the 3rd district well
1494648 is focused on his legislative agenda and on serving the people of the 3rd district of illinois
1494649 this has only happened because lipinski is perceived as somewhat weak
1494650 any challenger is still going to have to show that they have the money issue positions and base of support
1494651 i wouldnt put lipinski on the endangered species list yet
1494652 is not a party to the settlement and will not be affected by this settlement or any other anti 527 actions that may be taken by the fec or congress
1494653 sold its name and non monetary assets to a new group
1494654 new congressional lobbying efforts on private equity and other vital economic issues
1494655 it may be that the instruction was erroneous but i guess youve waived the right to challenge it by not challenging it sooner
1494656 we think that youve seen a fair and transparent process
1494657 this trial was a betrayal of american values and will rightly be seen as illegitimate by the rest of the world
1494658 we plan on charging at least 80 individuals down here
1494659 solving our national energy crisis requires an all of the above approach
1494660 nuclear power alone is not enough drilling alone is not enough we need to do all this and more
1494661 john mccain has taken a page out of the bush cheney playbook
1494662 hes offered a plan with no significant investments in alternative energy
1494663 washingtons broken john mccain knows it were worse off than we were four years ago
1494664 only mccain has taken on big tobacco drug companies fought corruption in both parties hell reform wall street battle big oil make america prosper again hes the original maverick one is ready to lead mccain
1494665 being a maverick isnt practicing the same kind of politics we have seen from washington for decades it isnt having a campaign run by washington lobbyists and its certainly not promoting the same policies that have led america down the wrong path these past eight years
1494666 this plan will not lower prices today it will not lower prices during the next administration the truth is we wouldnt see a drop of oil from john mccains plan for at least the next seven years
1494667 if we want to enable the technologies of tomorrow like plug in electric cars we need electricity to plug into
1494668 senator obama has said that expanding our nuclear power plants doesnt make sense for america he also says no to nuclear storage and reprocessing i couldnt disagree more
1494669 i have proposed a plan to build additional nuclear plants that means new jobs and that means new energy
1494670 it is my desire to establish a reputation as a members member
1494671 hard worker responsive straightforward and honest even when we disagree
1494672 it has been a great honor for arlene and i to serve the people of the inland empire in congress over these many years
1494673 the appropriations committee has been the highlight of our work and where i intend to continue to serve the people of the 41st congressional district
1494674 we think that this seat is one of the top pick up opportunities in florida
1494675 congressman feeney would never trade legislative favors for personal gain
1494676 i just dont see how a democrat could knock him off
1494677 he drew the district for himself when you do that and you only draw 58 percent
1494678 we must raise 250 000 by september 30th to show the party that i have what it takes to win
1494679 my work and service to virginia as a senator will conclude on the 6th of january 2009
1494680 that situation in iraq and afghanistan occupies the major portion of my thinking every day of my life
1494681 i feel that i have played i am playing and i will continue to play a role in trying to bring about a cessation of that conflict such that it reflects nothing but dignity upon the men and women in the armed forces and indeed many civilians who have served in those theaters and are still serving
1494682 tom is running he didnt want to say more today because its the senators day hes also very involved in the upcoming general assembly elections and doesnt want to distract from the partys efforts on that front
1494683 theres only so much empathy you can have without actually experiencing it
1494684 for candidates their short stints as faceless indigents would help them better understand the impact of public policy decisions on those who live in the streets
1494685 i probably dozed for 20 minutes i didnt get much sleep that night
1494686 just the fact of seeing it was a good thing for me it helps you understand the city you want to be mayor of
1494687 the saying used to be a chicken in every pot but how about a solar panel on every roof
1494688 iran is ready to provide a clear response to your proposal at the earliest possibility while simultaneously expecting to receive your clear response to our questions and ambiguities as well
1494689 such mutual clarification can pave the way for a speedy and transparent negotiating process with bright prospect
1494690 it is more of the same from the iranians obfuscation and delays
1494691 it was not the type of response the international community was looking for
1494692 the letter handed over is not an answer to the offered package the letter does not mention the freeze for freeze issue
1494693 during the call jalili expressed his readiness to start formal talks
1494694 shutting down the straits and closing off the persian gulf would be a sort of a self defeating exercise
1494695 they have a very weak economy at this point which depends almost entirely on their oil revenue
1494696 got shot down at the convention in philadelphia because karl rove didnt want a floor fight to be on national television on the first monday of the philadelphia convention
1494697 it had nothing to do with the merits of the delaware plan
1494698 it was just that the convention was scripted and there was no room for a three hour floor fight on whether or not the delaware plan should be adopted or whether the party was going to stay with its present system
1494699 the point was why shouldnt a state that is a hell of a good barometer for the republican party not have a say
1494700 we realized that worst case scenario is that we lose half our delegates but its worth it weve got to bring attention to this because everyone else is just a lemming and just fall in like sheep on feb 5 and theres no change were stuck in the status quo and the status quo is not fair
1494701 when the objections of the karl roves of the world probably would not have been so vociferous at that point because there was no doubt that w
1494702 were trying to effect the system in a way that changes it so that it is beneficial for everybody
1494703 the willingness to sacrifice half our delegates in order to play a role in the nomination rather than just to have 28 people go to st paul to party should put a spotlight on the need for change from the present one window system
1494704 i promise you all that i will work harder than ever for you and for our state
1494705 not everyone gets a second chance at life my commitment to you for my second chance at life is to make you and all south dakotans the beneficiary of that gift
1494706 welcome back senator johnson you have been missed we could not be happier that you are back home once again
1494707 rep simpson could hit the ground running in a way that other state level officials couldnt
1494708 i wouldnt even say its appealing this is about idaho being in a crisis and who can step up and help out its not about whats appealing for the congressman
1494709 if republicans want a senator wholl hold the seat and gain seniority
1494710 otter could seek to avoid a primary fight in 2008 with his appointment though of course he cant guarantee there wont be one anyway
1494711 or he could appoint someone i dont want to say a placeholder but someone who wont run again then otter can say he stayed out of it and support who ever wins the primary
1494712 over the years i have accomplished a lot for idaho and i hope idahoans will allow me to continue to do that there are still goals i would like to accomplish and i believe i can still be an effective leader for our state
1494713 as a democrat who voted against the war in iraq from the outset and who has been frankly critical of the administration and the post invasion strategy i am convinced that the situation has at long last begun to change substantially for the better
1494714 to keep american soldiers in iraq for an indefinite period of time being attacked by an unidentifiable enemy is wrong immoral and irresponsible
1494715 swayed by the dog and pony show on the ground
1494716 we just wanted to offer another viewpoint from people that have actually served in combat on the ground
1494717 we havent seen any unequivocal reconciliation because of the escalation so we want to give that point to his constituents
1494718 i didnt know what we were going to get out of the blogosphere
1494719 if they delivered for us a six pack and a pizza i would have been fine but instead they are delivering six figures
1494720 do we want to bring this war in iraq to a responsible close or dont we thats going to be the central question of this campaign and i think we had a tremendous response
1494721 i believe in certain fixed bedrock principles that government should be responsive and accountable to the taxpayers who pay for it that economic growth originates in the private sector that education is the best safeguard of liberty that ethics in government is critical to peoples faith in democracy that the values of faith work family personal responsibility and individual liberty are the building blocks of a prosperous society i have concluded that the republican party is the party that best reflects my values today
1494722 i dont think millionaires are the backbone of the economy
1494723 the easy solution which can be reached during the 30 day appeal period is for states that can do so administratively to move their primaries up seven days
1494724 here in florida i believe that our process is not in violation of the national rules and i believe that im going to be successful in arguing that point
1494725 the next attorney general has to understand that his primary loyalty is to the constitution and the rule of law and that sometimes he has to tell the president no
1494726 his situation was a distraction to the department of justice and its attempt to carry out its important duties
1494727 i want to send a message to everyone in florida that were going to abide by these rules
1494728 hard worker and a dedicated legislator a tireless advocate for the people of rural arizona
1494729 he has a determined spirit that will be missed by both the voters in his district and his colleagues here in the u s house
1494730 this is something that ive dreamed about and wanted to do for at least five or six years
1494731 if i can go to washington and make a difference helping families dealing with these types of issues that would be pretty special
1494732 i think elections are too long as it is and there will be plenty of time to talk about the 3rd congressional district race at a later date
1494733 if he resigns his job as usda you know hell be a candidate
1494734 if youve got one candidate who has a constituency that is significant then they would be at a distinct advantage
1494735 there has been no central republican place to go and make contributions to candidates
1494736 there are hundreds of candidates for federal office and finding a particular candidates web site is not so easy
1494737 as a relaxed unschooler this is what i consider to be the bare minimum school requirements for my kids if we can at least do these things i feel good about our home education
1494738 ive been thinking a lot about reading lately and i just finished maryanne wolfs book proust and the squid the story and science of the reading brain it was a fascinating read about how reading development happens in the brain and how our brains are changed by reading
1494739 i had the opportunity to interview my favorite author and also to giveaway a copy of his latest book
1494740 were studying ancient egypt and so we made a quick and easy version of the ancient game of senet
1494741 im going to be teaching a weekly class on elections via my blog its called vote for me and kids can participate by creating their own campaigns weekly projects printables funny hats campaign commercials and more
1494742 having a hard time getting excited about a new school year
1494743 is it possible to be at two activities at once ask a homeschooler
1494744 warning using moodstream to inspire ideas can lead to tangential thinking but thats a good thing right
1494745 i havent made an announcement yet but im putting some things in place weve actually put up a splash page of a web site and are taking donations and volunteers right now it will be very very soon that were in it fully
1494746 its like youre running for mayor or county supervisor in five different communities because the constituencies are just so broad and so different
1494747 not imported from elsewhere just looking to pick up a congressional seat that they really believe in this district and have fought for the interests of this district
1494748 like a lot of people in the district i am relieved because he hasnt been able to represent us for some time and its time that we are represented by one of our own its why im running
1494749 shes running to represent her family and friends and her neighbors all of the people of the district like herself and thats what were sticking to
1494750 it also will make a difference in those who were undecided and were waiting to make a decision before they jumped on my campaign
1494751 there are a lot of supporters out in those rural communities and elected officials and other community leaders that are encouraging me very strongly to run that consider me the strongest potential candidate
1494752 no disrespect to the three whove announced but the fact that we have three announced candidates in the race and im still getting a lot of calls from people saying they want me to do this and would back me strongly if i get into the race is not only flattering but its very encouraging
1494753 either way its a seat thats a republican seat and we intend to keep it that way
1494754 carta aberta aos senhores sylvio sim es florisvaldo mattos e edivaldo boaventura
1494755 its up to danny to show whether he can play at the nhl level this year whether its now midseason or at the end
1494756 e pronto l estamos n s a falar s da c mara outra vez gostava que aproveitassem e avaliassem o atendimento dos outros organismos p blicos e j agora tamb m de algumas cooperativas associa es e empresas ou com rcios privados se calhar acabava se por concluir que o mau comportamento das pessoas que fazem atendimento no cadaval muito generalizado mesmo quando estamos a pagar para ser servidos numa simples loja
1494757 we look forward to having our caucus plan approved at the dncs rules and bylaws committee meeting this saturday in washington
1494758 they cant afford not to put michigan in their strategic mix now
1494759 placing our state early in the primary cycle will enable arizonans voices to be heard clearly in this process
1494760 only seeing the underbelly of a presidential candidates plane as it flies over arizona is a thing of the past
1494761 its time to take the car keys away from this congress
1494762 we need to get back to low taxes fiscal discipline and personal freedom and responsibility
1494763 my mother tried to explain all those things to me but eventually she just said to me you should be a person who makes better laws
1494764 and thats what got me since the age of about six of wanting to be a public servant
1494765 i dont run only from the basis of being african american
1494766 thats who i am but when im running im running to represent the people in my area whoever they might be
1494767 i just find its ironic that we can find money to fight a war but we cant find money to help our own people in our communities
1494768 way back in the days when the grass was still green
1494769 way back in the days when the grass was still green
1494770 nobodys going to elect me president of the united states
1494771 i believe that certain things and if somebody asks me where i stand i tell them and thats not a way to get elected generally
1494772 if i dont say no categorically youll then read something into it the answer is no
1494773 i just find its ironic that we can find money to fight a war but we cant find money to help our own people in our communities
1494774 i cant say enough good things about ileana ros lehtinen she has been my friend since i was first elected to office
1494775 progressives will be lucky to have a friend like annette taddeo in congress
1494776 i think that senator obama does represent change senator clinton has experience change and experience with me you get both
1494777 i think theres a big difference and i think its a difference that really goes to the heart of whether we should be using hypotheticals
1494778 it is not hypothetical that al qaeda has established base camps in the hills between afghanistan and pakistan
1494779 george ive been standing here for the last 45 minutes praying to god you were going to call on me
1494780 in my public life there hasnt been a time i havent said what i thought im sure theres times in my whole life i havent said everything ive thought and many times that ive said too much of what i did think but my problem isnt saying what i think my problem is saying too much about what i think
1494781 we all know that nuclear power isnt enough and drilling isnt enough we need to do all this and more
1494782 solving our national energy crisis requires an all of the above approach
1494783 is there anyone thats tired of paying 4 a gallon for gasoline
1494784 we need to drill here and we need to drill now
1494785 i knew it was safe then and i know its safe now
1494786 i wouldnt drill off the coast of florida unless the people of florida wanted to and i wouldnt drill off the coast of california unless the people of california wanted to and i wouldnt drill in the grand canyon unless the people in arizona wanted to
1494787 we are extremely honored to partner with planetpals and excited to have the opportunity to represent such a unique trend forward and socially responsible property we see tremendous opportunity in japan
1494788 25 he was deeply in love when she spoke he thought he heard bells as if she were a garbage truck backing up
1494789 her hair glistened in the rain like a nose hair after a sneeze
1494790 the flip side is that these fees have a cost
1494791 originators are the ones that have to pay these up front fees and the originators need to be compensated they most likely will turn around to the borrowers and factor those higher fees into higher mortgage rates
1494792 whats the effect all else being equal it has the effect of pushing mortgage rates higher which is not exactly conducive to generating new business
1494793 the adverse market delivery charge increase addresses continuing market deterioration and the updated loan level price adjustments reflect our continual monitoring and ongoing efforts to fine tune the alignment of price with risk
1494794 fannie mae is announcing these changes to better align pricing with credit risks mitigate losses and support fannie maes ability to provide a stable source of liquidity to lender partners
1494795 it is not surprising house republicans are disenchanted and calling it quits given their partys record of obstructing progress on key american priorities and rubberstamping george bushs endless war in iraq
1494796 democrats will try to make more out of this than what it really is
1494797 at the end of the day they will have an extreme amount of defense that they will have to play
1494798 couldnt win in the best political environment for democrats since watergate
1494799 this is the time that you have to file one way or the other so we needed to make that decision
1494800 weve had a plan all along which is a 40 million budget by iowa and a four state plan
1494801 as the calendar changes we move some pieces around on the board
1494802 in this case weve got some very hard clear organizing targets in iowa and new hampshire as they move up by as much as two weeks we want to make sure that were on track on those targets
1494803 as iowa and new hampshire move up and the distance between nevada grows a little we want to make sure were taking the people who are already trained and a little more experienced and get them to those states that are going to have their contests first
1494804 dramatically increase the organizational work thats needed by these candidates
1494805 means that the candidates who have large amounts of cash in october are going to be the candidates who are going to be best positioned to meet that kind of a process
1494806 as we get closer to nevada we fully expect to fill those spots back up its just weve got trained people we want to put them where the contests are happening first
1494807 his speech is definitely slower than it was prior to the incident but the thoughts are clear his mind is sharp hes doing work from home and were hearing from him every day
1494808 nobody is really certain the extent of his condition that might impact his ability to campaign or be seen as effectively representing his constituency
1494809 theres just so many unknowns right now but the timeline is starting to run out for waiting for both sides
1494810 all the soul searching will take place after that first particularly public forum
1494811 we have been clear from the beginning of our intent to focus on south dakota and that has not changed
1494812 while our first priority is sen johnsons good health we will be prepared to give voters a choice next november
1494813 i just did not feel either one of them truly represents the district and represents the average citizen in the district and i know they dont represent me
1494814 i just felt like i could no longer sit on the sidelines
1494815 nine eleven had a massive impact on me like it did most people in the country
1494816 i had been out of the military for 11 years and within three days i started the process to re enter the military
1494817 i think the philosophy of helping people in need and standing up for peoples individual rights is something that the democratic party represents much better than the republican party
1494818 tonights results prove that our message of results driven optimism resonates with real people that our organization can put together a successful effort and that iowa is winnable for us
1494819 we over performed by having more votes than tickets purchased and having no paid media unlike other candidates
1494820 they knew they werent going to do well with iowa voters because iowa voters tend to be far more conservative
1494821 brownback was definitely trying to position himself as an alternative to romney
1494822 both of them havent had to run a tough race or tough campaign havent really had to be held accountable for their actions in washington
1494823 this is showing both of them theyre going to have to answer to seniors in their district families in their district
1494824 these are red seats and we have every confidence they will remain that way in november 08
1494825 these members have been good representatives for their districts and have a strong record of delivering for their home states they each have won in the worst election cycle for republicans in decades
1494826 the change in the economy has been abrupt serious and its a created a different kind of recession
1494827 this is an issue that is obviously on the mind of voters and its important for candidates and activists to understand what is happening and to have messages that can work with voters
1494828 we are trying to provide real policy alternatives to the political messaging
1494829 are you better off now than you were eight years ago
1494830 we need investments in public infrastructure not more corporate tax breaks if you put money in public investments you build things we need and put people to work
1494831 if i were them i would have brought the information
1494832 the change in the economy has been abrupt serious and its a created a different kind of recession
1494833 would help mobilize the democratic base unions african americans hispanics women environmentalists while reaching out to seniors and working families
1494834 this rally is easy to dismiss as the radical fringe but it holds the potential for a larger movement down the road history shows that protests are organized first by militant radical fringe parties and then get taken over by more centrist voices as the movement grows they provide a vessel for people who want to protest
1494835 are you better off now than you were eight years ago
1494836 the report says 4 11 hispanic male im not really a 4 11 hispanic male
1494837 two weeks later we got a letter and we owed 7 854 in back taxes
1494838 i knew miami was bad but i was shocked when i got here
1494839 there is fraud here like nowhere else in the country los angeles is second but nowhere like it is here
1494840 there is this madness around me around my family without a doubt out on the field is where im most comfortable where im happiest because i know what im doing and i know i can do it
1494841 to be someone kids look up to is a great honor what matters is how you carry yourself off and on the field
1494842 people always say to me why would you place yourself in a position where you have to put pressure on yourself but its what gives me energy
1494843 i never do anything where i dont believe in what im doing i see that something could happen in u s soccer that change isnt going to happen in a year or two its more of a 5 10 or even 15 year plan i believe in it and i believe that in years to come this could be one of the biggest sports here in america
1494844 people always ask me do you play golf because a majority of sportsmen do i used to play quite a few years ago but to be honest id rather spend 4 hours with the kids than 4 hours on a golf course as much as it can be relaxing its a frustrating sport my way of relaxing is listening to music and spending time with the kids
1494845 im a really bad loser it stays with me for a while i always take it quite personally when we dont win as a team or i dont win in everything else i do
1494846 i felt my record as governor of wisconsin and secretary of health and human services gave me the experience i needed to serve as president but i respect the decision of the voters
1494847 i am leaving the campaign trail today but i will not leave the challenges of improving health care and welfare in america
1494848 i think he had a bit of a problem of identifying a niche where he really stood out from the other candidates
1494849 is planning to run for re election and will make his announcement in november as he has said all along
1494850 will field a competitive candidate who will run a strong race
1494851 was instrumental after hurricane katrina and played a vital role in passing our recovery legislation in the house of representatives
1494852 will definitely benefit her pelosi at the national level particularly as she continues to try to prove to be a pragmatic speaker who tries to unite democrats and is really trying to represent all democrats
1494853 pelosi distinguishing herself from cindy sheehan is probably an absolutely necessary condition of her continuing to have national credibility
1494854 but how much additional credibility it gives her i dont know
1494855 inequities in access to healthcare and disparities in health outcomes
1494856 the divide between rich and poor is rising at a troubling rate within subregions of asia pacific leaving vast numbers of mothers and children at risk
1494857 it is not just bigger health budgets we could make a big difference by focusing on the three or four states in north india where most of these children die governments need to tackle female discrimination in the region too half the child deaths recorded in pakistan india and afghanistan occurred in the first month of the babys life
1494858 india could learn from chinas experience in two big ways
1494859 one is getting health services out to the villages the other is female education educated women making educated choices has a big impact on the survival of their children
1494860 would likely pose an enormous financial and reputational risk to the company and the country
1494861 he said we couldnt afford to say no to anyone
1494862 if i had better foresight maybe i could have improved things a bit
1494863 but frankly if i had perfect foresight i would never have taken this job
1494864 their aim is to use simple means to attack the chinese government and to turn 2008 into a year of mourning
1494865 one wrong word and you can end up in prison
1494866 i can only wear a long dress and headscarf at home because it is forbidden at my university
1494867 muslim citizens should not believe the lies of those who want to organise illegal trips
1494868 even small children tell me xinjiang belongs to the uighurs so i should go back to china
1494869 we are carefully evaluating all aspects of our operations in the uk
1494870 our goal is to reduce our operating losses to 13m in fiscal year 2009 7m in fiscal year 2010 and to approach break even in 2011
1494871 we believe the long term growth potential in the uk is much greater than in canada and expect our investment to deliver strong returns over the long term
1494872 nobody ever registers hedge funds in the uk if somebody did wed be scratching our heads over how to deal with it wed have to devise something
1494873 there might be only four or five chaps in a hedge fund office but they have so much money that it doesnt make much difference these guys will have big huge desks and lots of screens
1494874 when we look at clients we go through a very very robust process of due diligence
1494875 its very much establishing a relationship with a counterparty both parties want to be confident its going to be comfortable mutually
1494876 economic activity expanded in the second quarter partly reflecting growth in consumer spending and exports however labour markets have softened further and financial markets remain under considerable stress tight credit conditions the ongoing housing contraction and elevated energy prices are likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters over time the substantial easing of monetary policy combined with ongoing measures to foster market liquidity should help to promote moderate economic growth
1494877 inflation has been high spurred by the earlier increases in the prices of energy and some other commodities and some indicators of inflation expectations have been elevated the committee expects inflation to moderate later this year and next year but the inflation outlook remains highly uncertain although downside risks to growth remain the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern to the committee the committee will continue to monitor economic and financial developments and will act as needed to promote sustainable economic growth and price stability
1494878 the fed is well aware that confidence in the us economy is still fragile the well documented credit crunch has certainly slowed us economic growth but the latest figures show the us economy is still growing and only time will tell if earlier rate cuts will repair some of the damage done
1494879 wasnt a brilliant actor he made 23 films all of which are pretty bad
1494880 to get to a point where we never tell them to stop
1494881 he who walks in the middle of the road gets knocked down by traffic travelling both ways
1494882 this party is totally full of virgins lets get out of here
1494883 god why do you have to be such a virgin
1494884 worst case scenario everyone thinks youre a douche best case scenario someone tries to prove it to you theyre not a virgin face it youre entire life is going to be flip flopping between those two scenarios anyway so enjoy the ride
1494885 find out where he lives find out where his kids go to school find out where his office is picket him all the time
1494886 call him a racist in signs if you see him call him an injustice call him whatever you want to call him but in his face all the time
1494887 how do you deal with this kind of an injustice i wouldnt protest i dont believe in protesting i think it demonstrates the failure of representative government my answer to that problem is i want to empower you as a lawmaker dont rely on your elected officials
1494888 the question is whether he crossed the line in saying find out where his kids go to school
1494889 that to my mind and to government officials including those in the fbi crosses the line into a direct veiled threat
1494890 overwhelming showed and incontrovertibly demonstrated that he was head of the islamic jihad network in the united states
1494891 gordon kromberg is a dedicated talented and scrupulously fair prosecutor further when we decide to prosecute an individual that decision is based strictly on the facts and the law and in the pursuit of justice period
1494892 it seemed to me to be like a product of extreme sexism and i kept thinking to myself god if this was just like kal penn or george clooney or any of the other obama surrogates or supporters there wouldnt be any question about it nobody would even talk about it
1494893 i was merely trying to express my delight at obamas commitment to his campaign in every aspect and his interest and his support in his surrogates and his staff and his fellows and how wonderful and refreshing that is and it was manipulated into such an unfortunate media frenzy of kind of a nonstory
1494894 its just silly because the way people are talking about it youd think it was a bertolucci movie or something
1494895 were just recently very recently engaged so you know were just taking it easy and no big plan yet but its a good time and were just enjoying our time to be young and engaged
1494896 i mean im 23 theres no reason to rush into it everything feels very natural and relaxed
1494897 test of the boundaries of computer programming language design as a proof of concept or as a joke
1494898 the rocketboom episode neatly explains why the world of online video so resembles film school a parent funded enterprise of self indulgent auteurs with macroambitions viewed by microaudiences
1494899 republican congressman chris shays voted five times this year to support george bushs failed policy in iraq
1494900 call chris shays tell him that we need a new direction in iraq

1494932 if you want to be the most powerful leader in the world you should be willing to trudge through the snow in new hampshire
1494933 i dont think it minimizes the role florida will play in the presidential preference primary
1494934 its still a very large state in the front of the preference primary schedule
1494935 the rules of the rnc adopted during the 2004 convention will be applied to each and every state
1494936 man made global warming is the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the american people
1494937 theres a lot of dissatisfaction and a lack of confidence in washington
1494938 and i want for my party and my state to give the people a clear alternative
1494939 oklahoma is a conservative state and despite some losses at the statewide level in 2006 republicans fared well at the state legislative level
1494940 we feel confident that with the senate at the top of the ballot it will be a good year for conservatives and republicans in oklahoma
1494941 i think actually my lack of political experience is a bonus in this race
1494942 if people want a career politician someone whos going to do the way things have always been done then they should just rehire jim inhofe for six years but if they want a new approach then im their choice
1494943 a lot of those lobbyists whether you like it or not represent real americans
1494944 youve got to have a president in the white house that is not subject to the whims of corporate lobbyists
1494945 change one group of insiders for another group of insiders
1494946 we should say this lobbying game is over the system is rigged in washington d c it is not working for you
1494947 the one thing you can count on you will never see a picture of me on the front of fortune magazine saying i am the candidate that big corporate america is betting on
1494948 ive noticed in the last few days that the other campaigns have been using my name a lot
1494949 you can think big but remember you shouldnt always say everything you think when youre running for president because it has consequences across the world and we dont need that right now
1494950 the american people have the right to know it is not just washington insiders
1494951 i really enjoy the retail politics as much as anything it energizes me i feel like i connect with crowds very well i love speaking and i love touring farms and touring ethanol factories and touring a taconite factory
1494952 gets dispelled when i speak and then when people ask questions
1494953 its a real deal you know its a real thing and i take it very very seriously
1494954 almost universal desire to get out of there but theres a spectrum of thought on how to get out which i dont think is so different from washington
1494955 i think people are very puzzled by the lack of diplomacy
1494956 the questions i get are why arent regional assets being used in a diplomatic way whats keeping this administration from pursuing a diplomatic course even while it continues this surge
1494957 i might have done 50 spaghetti dinners and bean feeds and burger bashes last year
1494958 the response was unbelievable not only the first responders but people who actually were in cars that actually fell in the river who actually got out and started saving other people
1494959 yes thank god youre here i was attacked and raped by those men over there the ones laughing and pointing holding my underwear and pants

1494968 i will increase adoptions decrease abortions and protect the quality of life of our children
1494969 rudy giuliani was great for new york as a mayor
1494970 i question as a president if he would uphold the same standards that have become expected from republican presidents since ronald reagan
1494971 in the past when he said he was trying to promote adoption he gave money to planned parenthood
1494972 i think hes taking credit for something he had very little to do with
1494973 abortion did go down in the 90s and its not really through any of his efforts
1494974 educate the general public and cultural leaders about traditional american values and to promote the philosophy of the founding fathers concerning the nature of ordered liberty
1494975 of course they are making progress and we are winning on the ground
1494976 i get tired of people who are holier than thou because theyve been pro life longer than i have
1494977 to have a description of my mistakes in 30 minutes george your father is a priest im going to explain it to your father not to you ok
1494978 in one week he went from saying he was going to sit down for tea with our enemies but that he was going to bomb our allies hes gone from jane fonda to dr strangelove
1494979 i want you to know that also i will not make age an issue of this campaign
1494980 i am not going to exploit for political purposes my opponents youth and inexperience
1494981 its not quite two a days but i think were building some real momentum to keep that momentum were shifting into higher gear
1494982 as i move toward a decision on whether to run for president i am confident he will take our operations to the next level
1494983 it is important for yahoos board to understand there is still pressure on them
1494984 i thought yahoos board was kind of let off the hook last week when they didnt really deserve to be
1494985 you may still see an outsider candidacy like radio host jeff golden who is still thinking about running or theres a portland businesswoman eileen brady
1494986 the portland area has been growing in recent years not because of timber jobs but because of high tech industries that attract voters that while moderates for the most part tend to identify more strongly with the democrats
1494987 at the same time counties in eastern oregon traditionally a base of support for smith have shrunk
1494988 people who were always against the war wont believe him
1494989 and people who support the war wont care much for what hes saying now but for swing voters real moderates they could find that a reasonable position to take
1494990 you can try to be cynical and try to speculate about the shift
1494991 the knights templar are demanding that the vatican give them back their good name and possibly billions in assets into the bargain 700 years after the order was brutally suppressed by a joint venture between the pope and the king of france if the holy see doesnt comply the warrior knights renowned for liberating the holy land will deploy that most fearsome of weapons a laborious court case through the creaking spanish legal system

1494998 such a cancellation after a huge investment is already in itself an unusual event that should not happen too often we might take this event as experimental evidence for our model in which an accelerator with the luminosity and beam energy of the ssc will not be built
1494999 since the lhc has a performance approaching the ssc it suggests that also the lhc may be in danger of being closed under mysterious circumstances
1495000 how could you ever design an experiment that would disprove future causal influence on a current condition
1495001 my aim is to become a champion of the values that define this community and this district common sense conservatism
1495002 the mood has certainly shifted to one of concern and empathy
1495003 instead it will go on to my district going north a very large percent half or slightly more of the traffic could be shifted on that road through my district
1495004 there are no safety concerns but it will just become another parking lot practically
1495005 as the states most traveled bridge located in the heart of the largest metropolitan center the i 35w bridge is one of the most important transportation arteries in minnesota
1495006 every aspect of minnesotas livelihood depends on its restoration which is why we are urgently calling on the federal highway administration to recognize this glaring need and release these critical funds
1495007 i can better serve my constituents in a leadership position as one of 59 state senators than as a freshman in the u s house with its 435 members
1495008 charlie summers represents what is best about our nation bravery commitment honesty and hard work
1495009 barbara and i have great respect for his willingness to serve both in iraq and here at home in the political arena
1495010 charlie has laid out a compelling vision for maine i am very pleased that president and barbara bush recognize this leadership and share our vision to position maine in the future
1495011 charlie will come back with a personal viewpoint of what is happening over there
1495012 in early 2007 thompson embarked on what he calls a dialogue with the american people through his various venues to determine whether there was a desire among american voters for him to enter republican presidential race one cant help but see that thompson again might be hearing the call to serve
1495013 federal law doesnt say when you have to tell the public youre a candidate it does say when you have to tell the fec youre a candidate
1495014 to the extent several weeks ago that mr thompson decided he is going to run i think a fair reading of federal campaign finance law is that that started the 15 day clock for him to register a principal campaign committee
1495015 the other side of that coin though is that it would be incredibly difficult to prove as a matter of law that he had decided to run then had 15 days but failed to register the committee when in fact he could come back and say no what i decided then was not to run and then i changed my mind
1495016 im going to leave my options open im going to look at it and see what happens over the next couple of weeks
1495017 when these jobs come open everybody views them as an opportunity and its a wide open primary
1495018 i have a knowledge of d c and i think i could go in there and do a decent job
1495019 to have an open seat open up is a tremendous opportunity and i certainly am looking at the position and the possibility of running
1495020 i certainly havent made any decision but im looking at the district and talking to some folks and well make a decision probably fairly soon
1495021 timing wise as a democrat its going to be a good year to run
1495022 a lot of folks are thinking that theres going to be some very good opportunities as a democrat to run so thats on the plus side
1495023 theres a very profound and growing sense of dissatisfaction with the direction of the country
1495024 congressional democrats may have enjoyed the shortest of honeymoon periods
1495025 democrats have to take these whopping advantages on health care social security energy independence even wasteful spending and the deficit and add that up to a bigger economic vision for the future
1495026 thank god its a contrast and not just an up or down vote its not like people are going to fire us for the republicans but weve got to work hard to get them more enthusiastic about re electing us
1495027 now its a real chance well take both the house and the senate seat
1495028 but it wasnt hard for me to make up my mind
1495029 theres a lot of people who would like to see a decision either way today
1495030 confident of sen stevens re election next november and we look forward to working with him
1495031 i dont think anyone will step forward now unless its someone like cuddy who has faced him before
1495032 this is not a question of waiting for him to resign basically no one will oppose him until one way or another its clear he will not run
1495033 people say look how good it is that we have longterm experience in the house and senate
1495034 corruption and dishonesty have plagued this district and have undermined our confidence in our federal government
1495035 the people of rural arizona deserve to have a leader in washington that they can trust i am ready to be that person
1495036 im just waiting to see what happens with congressman renzi i support him and he is trying to prove his innocence or whatever with his challenges there
1495037 if they told me that im the person who could keep this a republican seat i would probably run but if theres several other people and they say somebody else would be a better candidate boy i would not run
1495038 hes done a good job for us hes been a good congressman
1495039 we probably know as much as you do right now rick renzi s still a congressman he hasnt let us know what his intentions are
1495040 we are expecting him to run for re election unless he tells us otherwise
1495041 but if he has to step down for personal reasons well be prepared to fight and win his district whether that be in a special election or whether that be in the general election
1495042 the fuel of the future is going to come from fruit like that sumach out by the road or from apples weeds sawdust almost anything
1495043 compared to metal hemp is a very lightweight material which helps to improve vehicle performance and promote greater fuel efficiency hemp is also a renewable lightweight material that absorbs co2 through photosynthesis in addition the particular type of hemp used by lotus is ethically produced in close proximity to the manufacturing plant keeping a lid on the emissions made through transportation
1495044 diesel was especially interested in using coal dust or vegetable oil as fuel and his engine in fact ran on peanut oil
1495045 the prevalence of black females in college sports its just an illusion
1495046 black female participation in college sports has increased 955 percent in the 35 years since title ix which requires colleges to provide equal sports participation opportunities to women became law however black female student athlete participation is for the most part limited to two sports basketball and track ninety percent of black female student athletes compete in one of those sports in womens soccer lacrosse and rowing the sports that have experienced the most growth because of title ix white women outnumber black women 11 692 to 594 during the 2004 2005 academic year only 47 black females competed in division i lacrosse and merely 23 in field hockey
1495047 there are a litany of factors and circumstances that have contributed to the ever increasing inequities between black and white female student athletes the ownership of title ix by white advocates to the exclusion of blacks the inaction of black feminists who fail to acknowledge the importance of sport in the lives of black girls the role of poverty in black female sports participation and the staggering amount of investment required to rectify the situation however what is most concerning is the unwillingness of the most influential title ix advocates to simply make the public aware that title ix has not resolved the racial inequities of female student athletes title ix advocates preach male female equity but have been largely silent about racial inequity title ix advocates who are overwhelmingly white are so out of touch that it is unlikely they have any idea of the cost associated with achieving equity between white and black soccer players during lopianos 1993 speech she presented a 16 point plan to help increase black female participation in sports almost 14 years later lopiano the premiere advocate for women in sports has neglected to implement any of the components of her master plan
1495048 however such a system would tremendously reduce the energy required to propel the car as it s electromagnetic motor would be calibrated to reduce the cars weight
1495049 the vehicle is driven by an electric engine that generates a magnetic field capable of propelling the vehicle
1495050 the winner of the unseen technology award at the interior motives design award 2007
1495051 for some time colorados ranchers have been struggling under the burden of an historic blizzard and record levels of drought now through no fault of their own they have been declared ineligible for the critical use feed program meaning they will be forced to give up 25 percent of their crp rental for grazing purposes
1495052 an elimination or reduction in pasture rental fees this year would make a significant financial difference for these hardworking producers many of whom are struggling to make ends meet
1495053 god what would you have me us give over the next three years to build your church i have every confidence that he will give you clear direction see you next week brad
1495054 i really thought all along that we could and would win this election if we pulled all the pieces together
1495055 the militarys been cut into the muscle and bone and we need to rebuild it so that we dont have to send the same troops to iraq three times in four years
1495056 we need to do the things necessary to keep our military fighting force the worlds best
1495057 im eager to come to the hill to work with democrats as well as republicans
1495058 like most people in this country i hate the partisanship and the political bickering
1495059 to me this was not an athens versus augusta race
1495060 when you look at our numbers holding our own is the best we can hope for
1495061 if we have actionable intelligence about high value terrorist targets and president musharaff wont act we will
1495062 were a nation at war and i think even most democrats are uncomfortable about making commander in chief a guy who a few years ago was an illinois state senator
1495063 obama doesnt seem to have learned the old adage when youre in a hole stop digging
1495064 hes sticking by his earlier assertion that you have to meet without preconditions without any hope of agreement you have to just go and talk to people which further reinforces the image that hes a neophyte in foreign policy and doesnt really know what hes doing and that clinton would be a stronger hand on the tiller
1495065 as a political candidates speech it does many of the right things
1495066 theres a great deal of detail in this speech its very precise in its language but also its fairly extensive as an overview of what directions what needs to be done and theres a lot thats going to appeal here to democrats especially those who are adamantly opposed to the war in iraq
1495067 it was well over the bar and will reassure people who were worried about an inexperienced senator at a time of crisis i dont know whether it will woo people in addition we wont really know until later
1495068 he put the focus on pakistan in a way that is a very subtle dig at everyone who voted for the war that the invasion of iraq is making it harder to clean up pakistan the unspoken message of the speech was voting for the war let musharaff off the hook
1495069 he said something nobody who voted for the war can say and said it in a way that makes him look like a hawkish opponent of iraq not a dovish opponent of iraq thats actually very clever what he did
1495070 its a positive step that we ought to be taking
1495071 instead of states making a mad dash to the front of the line we need an orderly primary and caucus system that combines the need to bring americans truly into the decision making process with the need to allow candidates the opportunity to interact meaningfully with citizens throughout the nation
1495072 things are looking good were getting support really across the board not just democrats theres a real desire for change there
1495073 is it a tough district for a democrat to win yes is it a district that a democrat absolutely cant win absolutely not
1495074 im happy to hear that he thinks he can win that district because he cant
1495075 and if he believes that district 3 is similar at all to district 8 or district 5 then he is in fact as na ve as some people may think
1495076 he needs to check the election results for previous issues that have gone up on the ballot for example the marriage amendment the pro life amendment a few years ago
1495077 this district is both fiscally conservative and socially conservative which is why congressman shadegg enjoys strong support district wide
1495078 im not what many would call an ultra liberal democrat im a tax lawyer ive represented business interests and real estate developers for 25 years i understand the tax code i know that it needs to be simplified for the benefit of business and wont hurt ordinary taxpayers in the process of doing so
1495079 im pretty sure i was clear when we started this about what was going to happen
1495080 its not gonna work okay so why dont we just forget about it and ill suck you okay
1495081 i dont think youre in the position to be making threats right now do you
1495082 do you really want me to suck your dick john
1495083 if you ask me ill do anything you want me to
1495084 you just have to ask and ill do anything ill suck you if you want or ill open you up with my fingers and slide in fuck you hard and deep and long you just have to ask john
1495085 i i want you to i want you to fuck me like you said you would i want you to fuck me so hard i cant breathe
1495086 too often insurance companies control the information that consumers need to make the key health care decisions that affect their lives time and again we hear of consumers realizing too late that their plan doesnt cover this treatment or that medication they learn late not because they dont try to pick the right plan but because the information is impenetrable and the deck is stacked against them it is time that we empower american consumers by giving them the information they need to make wise decisions
1495087 the bill i have introduced takes a first step by giving people who are buying health insurance a consumer friendly guide to what is in the insurance plan and what is not just like when you buy a car or a box of cereal you should have a familiar concise list of whats in a health plan this bill will do that and it will give consumers more tools to get reliable independent advice as they make their personal health care decisions
1495088 was not let go because of any allegation of incompetence by anybody
1495089 the whitewater feature at rock park will raise the bar for recreation in the truckee meadows and bring visitors to sparks from near and far
1495090 the project will be a wonderful use of the truckee river and something our citizens can enjoy for years to come
1495091 my house shall be a house of prayer for all nations
1495092 dont sic talk act or carry himself as a black person
1495093 before we couldnt get out at all and this way he can at least run around and get some energy out
1495094 its horrible it breaks your heart because theres nothing you can do
1495095 you know you have to do this because its for his health
1495096 it is a big breakthrough especially in the pediatric world because children dont like to be in bed 24 hours a day 7 days a week
1495097 a lot of the children here are here for more than 2 3 days
1495098 it changed our relationship in that little bit of time
1495099 it made us stronger because we could do something together and get out and come back and feel refreshed
1495100 this is a discriminatory act since its very clear we hispanics represent 42 percent of the city
1495101 the next point is when you have discrimination of this caliber it reinforces that we hispanics are inferior
1495102 my 15 year old she can go to boys and girls club and that gives me time to go find a job doing the things i never could do with my kids
1495103 and each person is assigned a bed a locker and they have a mailbox
1495104 you pass by you didnt even know we were here
1495105 if good intentions well meaning programs and humanitarian gestures could end homelessness it would have been history long ago in fort worth
1495106 so we have to establish a business oriented plan business principles that get the job done and thats what fort worths plan does
1495107 so if you can get tangible difference and some goodness out of each one of those then now you got it going on
1495108 there was a lot of faith involved the faith of my mother the faith of my friends and my own faith
1495109 sometimes that was all there was to hang onto unfortunately it took 25 years to come into play
1495110 there is this issue of tunnel vision on the part of police officers zeroing in on one suspect and not following the other leads
1495111 once they got started i think they just could not turn off the machine
1495112 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1495113 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaida something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1495114 the notion that the white house directed anyone to forge a letter from habbush to saddam hussein is absurd
1495115 we know now that those estimates were wrong but they were the estimates we all relied on
1495116 regardless military force in iraq was used because saddam hussein defiantly failed to comply with the 17 un security council resolutions iraq was subject to
1495117 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from cia ever involved in any such effort
1495118 it is well established that at my direction cia resisted efforts on the part of some in the administration to paint a picture of iraqi al qaeda connections that went beyond the evidence
1495119 the notion that i would suddenly reverse our stance and have created and planted false evidence that was contrary to our own beliefs is ridiculous
1495120 if they go in the other direction i think theyre probably going to have to start firing people
1495121 george said something like well marine ive got a job for you though you may not like it
1495122 richer remembers looking down at the creamy white house stationery on which the assignment was written
1495123 when it was discussed with me i just thought it was incredible a box checking of all outstanding issues in one letter from one guy
1495124 the white house directed and cia allegedly went along with burying that information so that the war could go ahead as planned this is a complete fabrication in fact the source in question failed to persuade his british interlocutors that he had anything new to offer by way of intelligence concessions or negotiations with regard to the iraq crisis and the british on their own elected to break off contact with him
1495125 there were many iraqi officials who said both publicly and privately that iraq had no wmd but our foreign intelligence colleagues and we assessed that these individuals were parroting the baath party line and trying to delay any coalition attack the particular source that suskind cites offered no evidence to back up his assertion and acted in an evasive and unconvincing manner
1495126 after being told that habbush had said there were no wmd bush was frustrated
1495127 why dont they ask him to give us something we can use to help us make our case
1495128 economic activity expanded in the second quarter partly reflecting growth in consumer spending and exports
1495129 inflation has been high spurred by the earlier increases in the prices of energy and some other commodities
1495130 the wording is a little strong over inflation but theres really no real change in policy
1495131 i think they are trying to buy time to allow the economy to recover and so that the financials can slowly repair
1495132 they seem more concerned about growth for the rest of this year and id say right now they appear to be dovish for the short term
1495133 si esos emails hubieran sido entre obama y george clooney nadie har a tanto esc ndalo
1495134 quise expresarle mi apoyo a su compromiso y a su campa a
1495135 do what it takes and stay as long as it takes
1495136 the gulf coast housing recovery act s 1668 sponsored by sen mary landrieu d la had the support of the entire states delegation and the u s department of housing and urban development until september when hud and vitter suddenly withdrew their backing the congressional quarterly weekly offers partisan politics as one explanation for his actions
1495137 todays vote is a victory for the residents of new orleans who deserve to live in a socially and economically integrated environment where their children can play safely and families can thrive we recognize there is a tremendous need for affordable housing throughout the crescent city and are deeply committed to ensuring that everyone who resided in public housing prior to hurricane katrina has the opportunity to return to something better than they left
1495138 advocates announced friday that they relocated 249 of new orleans homeless encamped in duncan plaza steps from city hall
1495139 i think it is time that the coalition tackled the hard question i think we have been ducking this for too long now
1495140 hope of a bi partisan approach on developing an emissions trading scheme appeared to evaporate yesterday with brendan nelsons calls for australia not to commit to a scheme until india china and the united states all sign up to reduce their emissions
1495141 well of course the renewable energy industry has a vested interest in any progress anything that goes forward
1495142 the president has determined that they are all enemy combatants
1495143 guantanamo has become a major major problem for the way the world perceives america and if it was up to me i would close guantanamo not tomorrow but this afternoon
1495144 shaken the belief the world had in americas justice system
1495145 s o what let them isnt that what our systems all about
1495146 the concept is still good connecting the dots of the bits and pieces of possible information is a good thing it just shouldnt be in a counterintelligence database
1495147 i was upset they threw him out of the game because hes really good hitting hes a cute little fella he didnt throw that hard and he doesnt have very good stuff so its probably a good idea they threw him out because it probably wouldve been in monument park hes good hittin
1495148 its part of baseball but you dont want to mess with anybodys career
1495149 hes a good guy i dont have a reason to hit kevin millar why
1495150 if he thinks im throwing at him on purpose i apologize
1495151 i think the black people would say he obama dont talk act or carry himself as a black person
1495152 i think that thats what they would say even though the black society would pull for him i still think that they think in the back of their mind that the only reason he is in the general election is because he talks acts and carries himself as a caucasian
1495153 grandpappy told my pappy back in my day son a man had to answer for the wicked that hed done take all the rope in texas find a tall oak tree round up all of them bad boys hang them high in the street for all the people to see
1495154 he obama doesnt talk act or carry himself as a black person
1495155 dion has won the admiration of people across the country for meeting real voters face to face
1495156 hes not afraid of the tough questions we should all be asking of our politicians now that the economys turned sour and the federal government seems to be drifting this is a chance for everyone in the region to get out and make their voices heard so policy in ottawa can better mirror public wishes
1495157 dion has won the admiration of people across the country
1495158 we are committed to following a rigorous scientific process while we have not completed our process on these soil samples we have very interesting intermediate results
1495159 further analysis has revealed un earthlike aspects of the soil chemistry
1495160 perchlorate is becoming a serious threat to human health and water resources
1495161 the right of trial by jury shall be preserved and no fact tried by a jury shall be otherwise re examined in any court of the united states
1495162 with the understanding that federal courts respected the principle that every wrong would have a remedy
1495163 that congress rather than this court should make the empirical judgments
1495164 i hope the senate will be permitted by the minority to consider this important legislative effort after months and months of delaying tactics and opposition by the bush administration the time has come to pass a federal shield law
1495165 tiene razon a muxos millones de a os luz en otra galaxia cientificos de la n technival festeja nuestro 10 aniversario
1495166 in a long career counseling individuals being investigated by the justice department i have had to explain to sometimes cynical citizens that politics are prohibited from influencing such inquiries my ability to give that assurance has hinged on both the public perception and reality that the career assistant u s attorneys line prosecutors and lawyers who work at the department are picked on their merits and proceed without regard to politics until now
1495167 what is it about george w bush that makes you want to serve him
1495168 a an experienced career terrorism prosecutor was rejected by goodling for a detail to the executive office of u s attorneys eousa to work on counterterrorism issues because of his wifes political affiliations instead eousa had to select a much more junior attorney who lacked any experience in counterterrorism issues and who eousa officials believed was not qualified for the position
1495169 systemic use of political or ideological affiliations in screening candidates for career positions that occurred
1495170 the protection of intellectual property is vital to our economy
1495171 the value of invention and innovation can be seen in so many vermont made products the time has come to bolster the federal effort to protect this most valuable and vulnerable property to give law enforcement the resources and the tools it needs to combat piracy and counterfeiting and to make sure that the many agencies that deal with intellectual property enforcement have the opportunity and the incentive to talk with each other to coordinate their efforts and to achieve the maximum effects for their efforts this bill does just that
1495172 with intellectual property contributing over 5 trillion to our national economy it is one of our most valuable assets and we must protect it
1495173 this bill gives our government the additional tools that it needs to do just that by enhancing the civil and criminal penalties for intellectual property violations and discouraging criminal organizations from entering the business of counterfeiting and piracy
1495174 the global economy is not working as it should when we buy from countries that have a competitive advantage over us and they steal from us when we have a competitive advantage over them
1495175 american businesses lose 250 billion every year and we have lost more than 750 000 jobs because of intellectual property theft the american auto industry estimates it could hire an additional 200 000 workers if we eliminated the trafficking of counterfeit auto parts if hundreds of our cargo ships were being hijacked on the high seas or thousands of our business people were being held up at gunpoint in a foreign land there would be a great sense of alarm and unshakable government resolve to act that in effect is what is happening today yet we are not doing nearly enough to stop it
1495176 in the fierce competition of the 21 st century global marketplace intellectual property is one of the few areas where america has a clear advantage over foreign competitors it is vital that we protect that advantage level the playing field and ensure continued economic growth for americans
1495177 this vital legislative is a critical step toward safeguarding the economic health of our country by improving the management coordination and effectiveness of our nations intellectual property enforcement efforts
1495178 i will be sending letters to karl roves lawyer and the white house counsel to schedule mr rove and mr boltens long overdue appearances before the senate judiciary committee
1495179 the white houses response to the senate judiciary committees subpoenas has been to assert blanket claims of executive privilege and novel claims of absolute immunity to block current and former officials from complying based on these claims neither mr rove nor mr bolten even appeared before the committee to respond to the subpoenas now a court has said that they must
1495180 the effects of the white houses assertions of privilege and immunity have been unmistakable amounting to the withholding of critical evidence related to the congressional investigation
1495181 and all along they have contended that their blanket claim of privilege cannot be tested but must be accepted by the congress as the last word todays ruling from judge bates is a resounding rejection of this white house attempt to thwart accountability and a reaffirmation of congresss ability to conduct oversight and the right of the american people to learn the truth about their government
1495182 t he executives current claim of absolute immunity from compelled congressional process for senior presidential aides is without any support in the case law
1495183 i f the executives absolute immunity argument were to prevail congress could be left with no recourse to obtain information that is plainly not subject to any colorable claim of executive privilege
1495184 executives proposed absolute immunity would thus deprive congress of even non privilege information
1495185 clear precedent and persuasive policy reasons confirm that the executive cannot be the judge of its own privilege
1495186 both the court and the parties will need some way to evaluate the privilege assertions going forward
1495187 frankly i think that a lot of the intellectual property we create are better than the licenses
1495188 i think in years gone by we havent had as many great original intellectual properties theres a lot more of that this year from ea and i think from here forward
1495189 weve had a 20 year partnership with the nfl were incredibly proud of that
1495190 a 15 ish year partnership with the nba nhl etc but also we partner with j k rowling and warner brothers in bringing over the harry potter games to market
1495191 what weve been focusing on is making the worlds most creative and innovative games making sure we put the creators first because thats how it happens
1495192 driving the r8 is like smearing honey into keira knightly
1495193 in principle this car is too fast for my thoughts
1495194 today when we learned that no other than u s senator barack obama will be this years parades grand marshall
1495195 the members for congress team will no longer be marching in the parade instead we plan to boycott it
1495196 this is our opportunity to let the media know that we were not impressed with baracks political performance when he was a state senator we are not happy with his current performance as our us senator and for him to be president is just absurd
1495197 spread the message to the 1st district that its not about race its about the best man for the job and baracks not him
1495198 i think hes a great producer with the kind of sound that i want
1495199 and in talking to him hes just a good guy like the song selection i had on the show rob just fit
1495200 gt is married to kathryn and has four beautiful daughters
1495201 oh mr jones is lurching and drooling perhaps he needs a kerchief
1495202 certainly the government will intervene soon ill just sit tight
1495203 we are not dealing with wholesale fragmentation the marketplace is jelling
1495204 i think unification is a very good thing and that its happening
1495205 limos role is to bring this all together so it can all happen efficiently
1495206 what were trying to do is kickstart greater innovation were trying to embrace all companies
1495207 intel is really going after all segments of the market
1495208 i dont think amd has to be worried about this particular threat i think its part of a much larger threat from intel is there a threat yes its larrabee its nehalem its everything intel is doing theyre really pushing hard
1495209 do they have to be in the graphics market no but it helps
1495210 it rounds out their offering so they can say yah weve got everything
1495211 what we want to get to is someone who comes in and says i need x amount of capacity i need it for this amount of time i need it 24 by 7 or i need 20 minutes of capacity and at the end of the month i need 100 units of capacity as opposed to i need x number of servers
1495212 this is the shared utility computing model it is moving away from the dedicated server or desktop idea
1495213 is that you have made access to all applications ubiquitous by placing them in an organized file system or namespace much like the world wide web is a namespace
1495214 we can do the same thing with applications even if you are talking about an enterprise
1495215 we call it the enterprise file system but it could be called the application deployment system
1495216 the key to this thing is versioning the idea is you put everything you do in an application library and you put it in this file system so therefore you never have the problem of the software stack or individual execution environments that is the wrong concept
1495217 every application would know what its dependencies are and they would be serviceable through this global processing that is a key concept
1495218 which is why i personally sponsored black hat at the platinum level ever since because i think we had some atonement to do
1495219 all of a sudden this year a lot of stuff has been breaking loose
1495220 owning the windows pc is not really a priority anymore
1495221 were the first group to help create a 20 million dollar surplus
1495222 were also the first group to oversee sags commercials contract topping the 800 million dollar mark
1495223 the first union contract to completely cover new media and the first to secure new media residuals weve already signed three hundred new media deals and 620 feature film completion deals with independent producers with budgets ranging from 10 million up to 45 million
1495224 brandi i have told you over and over about your leg humping and showing me that peepee that little tiny peepee im tired of you not listening im tired of your leg humping and showing off that weenie now its time to make some changes are you ready for real cock control
1495225 your sissy pet is a true sissy girl pet now no more lil weenies not more leg humping the transformation is complete
1495226 our intention is to really put more value at that price point and offer some amazing proposition to companies
1495227 we expect to hold the price point and add more and more value at that price point
1495228 we want to have commercial relationships with lots of companies and it matters more that we have that than exactly how much dollar per user were getting
1495229 we can certainly hold that price point we can continue to put more capabilities there the cost of an additional application to us is tiny its hardly material there are certainly types of applications that we could add that would add cost and we would price appropriately but i dont expect the price to climb that wouldnt be my expectation
1495230 id like all the holes in the feature set to be filled but ill say generally were not in the model of trying to replicate the products that work really well for what they do
1495231 develop a scholarly creative partnership that has a high impact on science and the potential to do something good for patients unable to afford the treatment
1495232 is a very small field but has a very big impact
1495233 we want to explore ways in which we could develop a scholarly creative partnership that has a high impact on science and the potential to do something good for patients suffering from disease and unable to afford the treatment not only will we set up a foundation for the pursuit of knowledge and science in the areas of ophthalmology nanotechnology and modern science but also models of delivery of science and knowledge to everyone in the population by taking knowledge in one area and applying it to another area we find that we achieve scholarly breakthroughs
1495234 the manifestation of some diseases within the eye like age related macular degeneration are very similar to what happens in cancer the eye is a very isolated part in the body if we can understand that particular part well we can apply it to other diseases in humans and animal population
1495235 nano medicine is a medical modality that uses nano particles for detection of diseases and treatment nanotechnology has a lot to offer in terms of diagnostics and therapeutic agents for treatment of eye disorders such as age related macular degeneration and other retinal disorders there are a number of reasons why nano particles do a much better job when compared to traditional pharmaceuticals in simple terms nano particles have a greater capacity to detect diseases and pick them up early at the cellular stage diseases like breast tumors and prostate cancers and various other diseases if detected early can be fully cured other nano therapeutic products can be used to treat excruciatingly painful diseases like bone cancer for which there is no cure
1495236 our university has throughout its history addressed the frontiers of knowledge and science we are a land grant university created in the u s through a series of legislations in the u s in the 1800s to promote the development and transfer of knowledge to help the working classes and all sections of society what we have seen at sankara nethralaya is one of the finest examples of what a land grant concept is
1495237 work recognised worldwide as some of the most exciting work in science going from basic research to clinical work in serving others and reaching out to the community in truly exceptional ways is going on here
1495238 excellent service they do by way of patient care and their tremendous track record of publications in clinically relevant journals
1495239 the collaboration is very natural and its a nice two way partnership
1495240 if you looked at the research methodology being employed at sankara nethralaya to treat eye diseases that is certainly a challenging model i hope we can find ways of applying this at the university of missouri
1495241 when we began putting more emphasis on life sciences and nano medicine we identified faculty in the area of philosophy and ethics to address the ethical issues that could arise during these processes we felt that science had not paid enough attention in the past to the ethical issues of looking at any type of genetic technology and to examine the trade offs that may occur between the ability to violate a part of the body at the same time to save a life utilising genetic modification today in order to save lives of future generations of children
1495242 nanoscience is often referred to as a disruptive science it has the very powerful ability to break down the traditional boundaries that existed between physics chemistry mathematics biology and biomedicine nano science brings all the expertise together under one roof

1495259 when barack won the nomination i just started bawling i started calling all these people and everybody was talking to me like i was crazy theyre like well he hasnt won yet but im like yes he has because hes gotten this far so what gives me tears is if barack obama wins kids are going to say that a black man can be president too

1495360 it was more of the former and not the latter

1495430 what a mockery that after five years in detention aafia is suddenly discovered in afghanistan
1495431 aafia was tortured for five years until one day us authorities announce that they have found her in afghanistan which shows how they abused their power and tortured an innocent woman without committing any crime

1495436 iran is ready to provide a clear response to your proposal at the earliest possibility while simultaneously expecting to receive your clear response to our questions and ambiguities as well
1495437 such mutual clarification can pave the way for a speedy and transparent negotiating process with bright prospect
1495438 it is more of the same from the iranians obfuscation and delays
1495439 it was not the type of response the international community was looking for

1495449 they want to turn the year 2008 into a year of mourning for china
1495450 there are a number of hurdles to be crossed the next stage is the nsg
1495451 we want to go quickly to the nsg we would like this to be done as soon as possible in september
1495452 well there has not been a clear enough discussion on the agreement yet but we believe this agreement is good for india good for the world and good for non proliferation the us mulford said is very heavily engaged in a major diplomatic offensive at all levels we continue to move forward and are working very closely with the government of india to coordinate this process we are working out the language we want to submit to the nsg
1495453 japan is leading international efforts for nuclear disarmament from this perspective we need to be satisfied that the indo us civil nuclear cooperation initiative will not undermine disarmament
1495454 japan has been requesting india to sign the npt and ratify the ctbt in this there is no change in our position and we will continue to ask that
1495455 we seek cooperation of the international community we are aware of japan s sensitivity in view of that i reiterated our firm commitment to total disarmament and strict adherence to conditions of non proliferation as enshrined in various treaties
1495456 conducive to strengthening nuclear non proliferation measures to apply to india
1495457 that once india identifies its civilian nuclear activities those that will go under safeguards these will remain permanently under safeguards and a larger number of nuclear facilities would be put under safeguards in perpetuity

1495465 although downside risks to growth remain the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern
1495466 if there is a subtle shift in the feds risk assessment it is that while acknowledging the downside risks to growth it notes the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern

1495471 dont call it a comeback i been here for years
1495472 im still in the start beck against tampa camp i need to see what hes got in a live game and i dont want any excuses
1495473 relative freedom and was permitted to walk all over the yards
1495474 i was a partisan from october 6 1943 until the middle of february 1944
1495475 hidden by friends of the a l peoples army group
1495476 fought against the germans as a partisan in the forest
1495477 i was one of 34 prisoners alive out of 150 000 who had been put there
1495478 almost 3 000 prisoners died in mauthausen after the americans liberated us on may 5 1945
1495479 the terrible words transport for soap were first heard at the end of 1942 it was in the polish general government and the factory was in galicia in belzec from april 1942 until may 1943 900 000 jews were used as raw material in this factory
1495480 the rest the residual fat stuff was used for soap production
1495481 after 1942 people in the general government knew quite well what the rif soap meant
1495482 wiesenthals reports and statements at that period prove beyond any doubt that he had no notion of eichmanns whereabouts
1495483 all the information supplied by wiesenthal before and in anticipation of the eichmann operation was utterly worthless and sometimes even misleading and of negative value
1495484 the nazi who never was how a witch hunt by judge press and investigators branded an innocent man a war criminal
1495485 a pole in chicago who performed duties with the gestapo in the ghettos of czestochowa and kielce and handed over a number of jews to the gestapo
1495486 the persecution of frank walus to catch a nazi the u
1495487 reports received by wiesenthal against walus actually were rumors in other words simon wiesenthal had no evidence against walus he denounced him anyway
1495488 i know there are thousands of people who wait for my mistake
1495489 wiesenthal makes periodic statements that he is about to catch him perhaps since wiesenthal must raise funds for his activities and the name mengele is always good for a plug
1495490 only sustained his self confirmatory myths and gave scant satisfaction to those who apparently needed a definitive answer to mengeles fate
1495491 self image of a tireless dogged sleuth pitted against the omnipotent and sinister might of mengele and a vast nazi network
1495492 had all these reports placing mengele in almost every country in latin america except the one he was in namely brazil
1495493 gone far beyond the buffoonery and false boasts in prior years
1495494 11 million who were murdered in the holocaust six million jews and five million non jews
1495495 the gentiles will not pay attention if we do not mention their victims too
1495496 chose five million gentiles because he wanted a diplomatic number one that told of a large number of gentile victims but in no way was larger than that of jews
1495497 what wiesenthal and the los angeles center that bears his name do is to trivialize the holocaust
1495498 today when i see the rise of antisemitism here in europe the popularity of le pen of david duke of the holocaust revisionists then i am convinced more than ever about the need for our new wiesenthal center beit hashoah museum of tolerance
1495499 he is a man of considerable ego proud of testimonials and honorary degrees
1495500 records of the u s n rnberg war crimes trials interrogations 1946 49
1495501 new documents raise new doubts about simon wiesenthals war years
1495502 i escaped on october 18 1943 from the lemberg lvov hard labor camp where i was kept as a prisoner during my two years of labor at the railroad works and went into hiding until joining jewish partisans on november 21 1943 who operated there it was while fighting in the partisan ranks against the nazis that we managed to collect and bury for safekeeping considerable amount of evidence when the partisans were dispersed by the germans i fled to lemberg on february 10 1944 and again went into hiding on june 13 1944 i was found during a house to house search and was immediately sent to the famous lacki camp near that city
1495503 i have never stated that there were no extermination camps on german soil this quote is false i could never have said such a thing
1495504 i succeeded in putting a number of nazis on trial who had perpetrated horrendous crimes in the nazi era including adolf eichmann franz stangl gustav wagner
1495505 it seems that material provided by professional nazi hunter simon wiesenthal is wrong but repeated anyway in the media
1495506 the fact they have come this far is a good positive sign
1495507 as each week goes by i get more confident the eggs will last
1495508 with these guys foreplay might take years one has to be patient
1495509 once weve gained the confidence of the people weve got more chance of doing more things
1495510 theres some bloody dead fish you have to swallow to get into government to do the kinds of things you want to do
1495511 is this what she meant when she said hard hats on is this the new dirty tactics low level that we can expect
1495512 if shes going to do everything from rort the electoral law to get journalist and author nicky hager to listen into our emails to go out there and get young labour affiliates to be bugging our personal conversations well thats her style of politics
1495513 we dont know where these recordings came from theyre lashing out and trying to divert people from the focus that senior national mps have been caught out telling the truth
1495514 i have absolutely no idea who the person is that was speaking to mr english and dr smith
1495515 who knows whether these tapes are actually sort of completely real they could well have been doctored no one really knows this stuff
1495516 the national party was very happy to use that particular recording at the time
1495517 caught out obviously planning not to tell the people about their true intentions
1495518 im so much better than those hicks they are aiding global warming those deniers they

1495522 i played wii baseball at tonys and then we went and played real baseball at the school i do my laundry sometimes
1495523 i hate to interrupt this male bonding but dinner is ready
1495524 i just have to dress the salad and well be ready to eat
1495525 can we eat in here im watching wheel of fortune
1495526 how about we eat at the table but leave the t v on
1495527 she didnt want me to come to the earlier ones
1495528 good lord bless these sinners as they eat their dinners
1495529 and sweet lets eat oh my i cant stop i might pop
1495530 i bet most are made by machines but some people probably still make arrows
1495531 thanks for coming on sometimes that wheel just prevents people from getting started
1495532 rick has a sister does she play with you guys
1495533 sometimes we asked her if she wanted to play baseball but she was doing something else
1495534 he doesnt need to be interested in girls at this age yet
1495535 shut up thats it say goodbye to wheel of fortune sam
1495536 i had a reason michelle my life hasnt been filled with things i shouldnt have done
1495537 you know somebody saw something and just kept on walking
1495538 she doesnt know i got off work early and was driving by and thought id surprise you
1495539 he wasnt in school today i think he stayed home sick
1495540 but when one gets sick the other tends to get sick too at least thats how it was in my family
1495541 i didnt see her but we dont have any classes together
1495542 lets stop by and see if they need you to pick up their homework
1495543 rick and joan werent in school today and i was wondering if it was going to be a while if you might need sam to pick up their homework tomorrow
1495544 just a twenty four hour bug or something sometimes it can just be something you ate
1495545 thats not the story i wouldve thats not the story i thought you were going to tell there have been worse times than that he is not mad at you about that he probably doesnt even remember
1495546 sometimes it seems like the only thing im capable of remembering

1495549 we are giving jobs to people to scorers to administrators to groundsmen and more chances to young players if anyone can convince me of doing something wrong and against the country i will quit the icl right away
1495550 the door should be open to everybody if players like mahendra singh dhoni and sachin tendulkar emerge from the league dont they deserve to play for the country
1495551 the ipl is an event ours has a bit more substance more emphasis on our kids on the local indian players performing well and being as good as they can be and getting ready for the greater challenges in our hyderabad team five man of match awards last season were bagged by indian players the icl is promoting domestic talent more than the ipl we started first and i guess we had the first crack at the best of the young talent in this country
1495552 there is a bit of hypocrisy sachin tendulkar played in lashings with an icl player dinesh mongia will the bcci ban tendulkar its time to sit down and have a rethink you cant be hypocritical and say the players can play in english leagues but they cant do it here and you cant ban icl players from playing in the counties and leagues
1495553 i still believe that at some stage the icl will be recognised and it would be in the best interests of all the young cricketers they have to be ready when it happens and part of my job is to ensure that everyone would like to play in the ranji trophy again especially the longer version
1495554 more people are getting exposed to the game and i think they will say i have seen ipl lets see how icl respond
1495555 the players motivation has only got stronger they know if they dont perform here and if they are dropped they cant go back to play under the bcci you can be rest assured that icl performances are going to get even better this season
1495556 if we can replicate what happened last season i would say we are doing well
1495557 if the cricket is interesting and of good quality the icl would be a success
1495558 there were some people in the courtroom that were taken aback by it
1495559 those were the only words i heard him utter in the courtroom
1495560 he shook his head in response to questions from the judge some shakes of his appeared to be in the affirmative some of them appeared to be in the negative
1495561 then we can look to consider whether in the psychiatrists opinion the accused is fit to stand trial and whether we are proceeding at that point or whether there are fitness concerns that need to be canvassed by the court

1495566 our main concerns are that coal fired powered stations are worse in terms of co2 production even than oil or gas fired power stations
1495567 it would symbolically be very unfortunate if the uk were to approve a coal fired power station without imposing very strict requirements that some technology should be adopted that would allow it to capture the carbon dioxide it emits

1495848 no tiene nada que ver con el supuesto informe de la sigen
1495849 el hecho de que mi renuncia est relacionado con el informe de la sigen es absolutamente mentira de hecho ya hay comunicados de prensa y por mi propio conocimiento que no existe ning n informe de la sigen mi renuncia es de car cter personal durante el d a me han preguntado sobre el particular pero creo que tengo el derecho de reservarme mis cuestiones personales pero quiero reiterarles que no existe ning n informe de la sigen recuerden que los que pedimos que sta sindicatura intervenga en esta cuesti n de la universidad fuimos el rector y yo para que tenga intervenci n directa en este asunto
1495850 reuniones existen permanentemente la universidad es una organizaci n pol tica y cada uno toma las cuestiones y toma sus decisiones personales
1495851 la universidad es mucho mas grande que los conflictos y las personas
1495852 con respecto al informe de la sigen nosotros vamos a solicitar un examen exhaustivo porque nos interesa y seguramente se tomar el tiempo que necesite para hacerlo bien
1495853 yo tengo la misma opini n que tienen los miembros de la comunidad acad mica pero no se muy bien qu ha pasado hace dos a os que estoy trabajando en mi departamento de antropolog a entre otras cosas como por ejemplo la organizaci n del congreso antropol gico que hace m s de un a o lo venimos preparando
1495854 as que no conozco mucho los entretelones del tema y conozco lo que sabe todo el mundo del autopago y ese tipo de cuestiones que derivaron en una cr tica creo que justificada de todo el mundo porque parec a destinar de manera desproporcionada fondos a una cuesti n casi individual de un peque o grupo
1495855 con la renuncia de montini no estoy de acuerdo depende de qu manera se aproveche esta crisis como una oportunidad para mejorar la administraci n recuperar credibilidad y tratar de llevar adelante estos a os que restan y hacer una gesti n que satisfaga un poco la comunidad local que hoy por hoy est sintiendo que esto no va demasiado bien
1495856 ha habido sobre esto cr ticas pol ticas gente que conoce mas del tema que hizo cr ticas de tipo formal o legal pero yo puedo decir que mi opini n es pol tica y me parece que destinar esa masa de dinero en el momento en el que se hab a declarado la emergencia econ mica y encima hacerlo a escondidas en pleno enero cuando la universidad estaba cerrada no fue una idea feliz ahora no se si detr s de esto hay cr ticas m s graves si es que el pago no se hizo como deb a y digamos en forma absolutamente acreditada hay que esperar ese famoso informe de sigen que anda por all dando vueltas
1495857 we had a practice match at the weekend involving the 1st and 2nd xv squads and that went well

1495865 fue dif cil pero tuvimos que sacarle a montini el apoyo pol tico y pedirle la renuncia
1495866 nosotros en la agrupaci n pol tica interna le solicitamos la renuncia por cuestiones internas de funcionamiento que tiene que ver no solo con el autopago sino con otros problemas internos que hubo en la unam fue dif cil pero tuvimos que sacarle el apoyo pol tico
1495867 la agrupaci n le pidi un gesto pol tico al vicerrector y ste dio ese gesto pol tico
1495868 no se debe al autopago hay otros problemas internos de funcionamiento del consejo superior que motivaron esta medida
1495869 si bien conozco el tema yo no puedo comentarlo en profundidad porque prometimos hacer un silencio del tema hasta que se trate ma ana en la reuni n extraordinaria del consejo superior
1495870 yo no vi ese informe y reitero la renuncia no tiene que ver con el informe de la sigen ni siquiera con el autopago la renuncia del vicerrector tiene que ver con un pedido puntual y fuerte de la agrupaci n convergencia que lo llevo a la conducci n y no tiene que ver en absoluto con el auto pago
1495871 la agrupaci n sigue apoyando al rector aldo caballero lo que se manifest es que el rector tiene parte de culpa en este otro tema pero no es el responsable directo pero institucionalmente por el bien de la universidad se lo seguir sosteniendo al rector y apoyando en todas las decisiones
1495872 la gesti n de ambos tiene muchas debilidades la intenci n de la agrupaci n que los llev a la conducci n es cambiar en estos dos ltimos a os de gesti n ese perfil queremos impulsar una gesti n m s fuerte y m s comprometida con la universidad y ese fue uno de los motivos del pedido de renuncia cre amos que el vicerrector no ten an conducci n muy clara hacia la universidad hubo varios temas que se fueron sum ndose hubo uno que fue el detonante y eso motivo este pedido con decisi n si no aceptaba ten amos previsto otras medidas para provocar su destituci n
1495873 sacarle el apoyo pol tico a una persona es duro nosotros entendimos la situaci n pero esto fue institucional nosotros sabemos que el funcionamiento de la universidad y el manejo de la conducci n pol tica de la universidad va a mejorar con esta actitud el vicerrector la entendi en definitiva lo que hicimos fue aceptar el ofrecimiento que l mismo hizo en varias oportunidades

1495927 i admired him for his internal honesty and his willingness to stand up very intensively for his own views
1495928 of course nothing is eternal but i hope every generation will have a person such as him

1495931 i dont know him so why should i go and pay last respects to him
1495932 why should chicagos taxpayers have to foot the bill when a debt goes unpaid
1495933 itd be nice for him to come and join the rest of the legislative leaders and put aside whatever feeling he has towards any of us and come and get something done for the people of illinois
1495934 theres no substitute for the real leader and wed like him to participate and we sure would like to have him there id be happy to cut his apples for him and get him a cup of coffee
1495935 they are going to talk about what they can do to make the gaming element more palatable

1495937 blagojevich said its time to put politics aside to pass the spending program
1495938 but her committees finance reports have been some of the sloppiest accounting statements of the more than 3 600 committees registered with the state

1495941 the arrest of radovan karadzic is immensely important for the victims who had to wait far too long for this day

1495947 he wants to make the legislation better but there may not be a possibility to make it better
1495948 the only presumption for those who attend fundraisers is that they share the same values as the governor
1495949 the bill you are talking about is about political reform but the bill we are concerned about is the capital bill for things such as bridges and roads things the people of this state desperately need
1495950 we all support him this is what we discussed in the meeting
1495951 were all hurting for work if we get this bill passed more people will be working
1495952 nobody puts a gun to your head they just suggest
1495953 they invite us because they are going to get the credit not us
1495954 thank you for bringing the church into the 21st century for moving things forward
1495955 i would rather be on the inside its never okay to be relegated to the fringe by someone
1495956 if jesus were here rather than be with the powers that be on the inside hed be outside on the fringe
1495957 for some of the bishops is a big concern for others it is not
1495958 we are praying that despite the troubles we leave more comforted and with a feeling that we are one church
1495959 if it is the end i do not think anyone has told most of the people here
1495960 scripture has been used to denigrate women justify slavery and not welcome divorced people
1495961 its not a matter of if but when people will accept homosexuality
1495962 we are in a serious crisis to hide facts from us i think the council needs to be more pro active
1495963 one can only speculate what decisions go on on the fifth floor of city hall
1495964 the longer they wait to give us the bad news the less time we will have to react to that bad news and to take the appropriate actions
1495965 unfortunately things are predicted to get worse before they get better and even with the management improvements weve already mandated this year there is likely to be major shortfall in our budget for next year
1495966 to act responsibly we need to have the latest revenue data in order to craft a responsible budget for next year
1495967 i dont look at this lightly that oh because the supreme courts done it were just gonna dismiss it and all of a sudden people can arm themselves
1495968 its an honor to have the president of the united states here
1495969 we had a great event today its great that he made the time to come here today its the second time in the second term it says a lot about our community
1495970 how often does the leader of the free world come to your town
1495971 hopefully well be able to show them a little bit about what tony snow did on a trip like this and hopefully give them a little bit of comfort along the way if we can
1495972 sen john mccain aspires to be the leader of this party and we intend to make sure that the light can fully shine on him as it should as he heads into the last 90 days before the election
1495973 hopefully well be able to show them a little bit about what tony snow did on a trip like this and hopefully give them a little bit of comfort along the way if we can
1495974 this is not mayor daleys debt this is the people of the city of chicago
1495975 now they dont want their taxes to go up 48 million do they no we just say just pay your debt
1495976 if youre struggling with poverty and all that we have programs you can work on we have all these programs that you can work on you come in and say im on welfare im doing this and that we can put you on a program
1495977 i would think that three tickets now seems to be working all right and with the economic conditions that our constituents are facing i dont think adding this additional burden to their already beleaguered economic existence is a good idea
1495978 it is going too far in terms of our approach of collecting revenue from scofflaws because there are a lot of people with two tickets who are willing to pay their tickets who feel they didnt have adequate notice
1495979 government has to be fair to all our citizens especially if we are going to take property and booting a car is taking property
1495980 its not surprising that the amount generated continues to grow because parking and traffic enforcement has been a point of emphasis of the city
1495981 we strongly encourage the city to go after to the fullest extent possible any violators as long as the city affords due process and fair hearings
1495982 it seems they are just taking it to the next level
1495983 even when you are parking legally you just cant park downtown i am going to have to rent a space at a garage because im afraid to park anywhere
1495984 there are areas that are more congested than others and areas where people are more likely to park on the street because they dont have garages or other off street parking
1495985 that is why all these cameras are being installed the reality is that people blow through these intersections and they are going to be caught and they are going to be fined it has become a big revenue source absolutely
1495986 have decided it is a lot smarter making their money on volume and keeping the price low
1495987 if they stick to that pattern they can generate a lot of money with very little political flak
1495988 he said there used to be a sign on that pole and it hasnt been there for two years my logical question was how can you write a ticket and he told me he doesnt want to but his boss tells him he has to go out every day and write tickets
1495989 i just think of all the suburbanites coming here for cubs games
1495990 they dont know how to contest a ticket they just pay it
1495991 yes it is a significant source of revenue but our responsibility is to collect in an equitable manner
1495992 people are given an opportunity to exercise their rights to dispute the ticket that doesnt mean mistakes arent made if they are made we work to resolve the issue to the best of our ability
1495993 those numbers have been consistent for 10 years and the numbers dont lie
1495994 most people who contest a parking ticket prevail and if people do not agree with the decision of the administrative law officer they have the ability to appeal to the circuit court
1495995 louis g atsaves at least daley now admits that those cameras at intersections are not for safety they are for revenue nothing like prying more money out of the poor citizens he allegedly represents
1495996 people are given an opportunity to exercise their rights to dispute the ticket that doesnt mean mistakes arent made if they are made we work to resolve the issue to the best of our ability
1495997 dear burt while you always had quite a flair for the dramatic you never had much regard for the truth apparently you cant be bothered to read anything carefully maybe that is why you like oreilly make half your crap up glad to hear you finally got sober
1495998 already a master or mistress of the shined leather brogue comey shows facility with more casual summer styles as well simple with a dose of sophistication
1495999 telepsychiatry is currently one of the most effective ways to increase access to psychiatric care for individuals living in underserved areas through video conferencing that can provide psychiatric services to patients living in remote locations or otherwise underserved areas
1496000 the internet has opened the possibility of delivering telepsychiatric care economically to places and areas that need but do not have specialist or culturally appropriate care
1496001 this project will compare the acceptability and effectiveness of depression treatment for low income hispanic patients provided by a psychiatrist through internet videoconferencing using a webcam with treatment as usual provided by the primary care provider
1496002 the work of these finding answers grantees will help us to identify what works in terms of ensuring that all americans receive the care they deserve

1496006 a highlight of the convention will be the launch of the first green star rating tool for sa for office buildings
1496007 the challenge to the sa commercial and industrial development industry is to see how quickly and effectively they are able to embrace the need for green accreditation

1496012 many unloading yards are not designed to carry heavy equipment
1496013 an important advantage of our lightweight and flexible mobicon system is that it utilises all parts of the yard and operates on pavements and in restrictive areas where conventional container handling equipment cannot go this mobile container handler can turn in tight spaces and is also able to travel under awnings inside buildings and up to docks with this system there is no need to couple and uncouple trailers from prime movers during the unloading of containers
1496014 second winning the nobel prize does not automatically qualify you to be commander in chief i think george bush has proved definitively that to be president you dont need to care about science literature or peace

1496018 oh dear god are you telling me that we have enemies who want to kill us and will pounce when were weak
1496019 mandatory spay neuter laws have had a mixed result in reducing the number of unwanted pets placed an undue and unenforceable burden on police and animal control officials reduced vaccination compliance for rabies and unintentionally restricted access to health care for pets
1496020 the idea that mandatory spay neuter will change a gangbangers behavior or that dog bite injuries will vanish is absurd
1496021 people all over the country have tried to find homes for these surplus animals and they are doomed to failure because these homes dont exist and the only answer is legislation if education and providing low cost and free spay and neuter hasnt work and it doesnt work then we must have legislation and compel people to have their pets spayed and neutered otherwise the overpopulation problem is going to get worse and worse from coast to coast
1496022 i dont believe a mandate is a good idea or will be effective and may do more harm than good
1496023 one female cat and her off spring can produce 420 000 cats in just seven years one female dog and her off spring can produce 67 000 puppies in just six years
1496024 ab 1634 may result in more animals being abandoned or surrendered the result would be an increase in the general fund costs the bill is also unclear in its definition of the term complaint there is a concern the complaint may be unsubstantiated read the full report

1496028 princess is pregnant again what am i supposed to do
1496029 the dogs been tied outside for more than three years
1496030 today when i saw it it was covered with flies the poor thing its dead now
1496031 even with low cost spaying the cost is quite expensive it sure would be nice if just once in a while the vets would take a payment plan so owners wouldnt have to come up with all the money upfront
1496032 redemption the myth of pet overpopulation and the no kill revolution
1496033 the goal is to reduce the number of homeless dogs and cats on city streets and help prevent random unprovoked attacks
1496034 its about time chicago started to catch up with california
1496035 in other cities where this has happened people wont come to the city and show their dogs they will boycott the shows
1496036 a normal drill uses compressed air to get the drill bit hammering you also need a medium to get rid of drill cuttings and water
1496037 for every ten metres one bar of pressure is required to get the water out obviously with deep drilling you need more pressure to hammer down 10 bars at 100 metres 20 bars at 200 metres so theres no penetration after a certain depth
1496038 dear burt while you always had quite a flair for the dramatic you never had much regard for the truth apparently you cant be bothered to read anything carefully maybe that is why you like oreilly make half your crap up glad to hear you finally got sober

1496041 the football team has moved forward the train has left the station
1496042 he needs to jump on the train and lets go or if we cant get past all the things that happened then i mean i have to keep the train moving
1496043 he was great about it i mean the question that brett favres ability to compete he was all for competing he had no problem with any of that he wouldve came in here competed for his job and im sure it would have been a hell of a fight
1496044 my whole intent was was he coming into the locker room to play for the green bay packers and you know where is your mind at that was the first question i asked him and we could never get back to that point
1496045 ill practice my butt off if it comes to that and i think we all know what the end result will be but this probably isnt going to work
1496046 and i truly understand that if i was in mikes shoes id basically see the same way he sees it im sure and i think if he was in my shoes hed see it my way i think we both agree on that
1496047 they want to know if im committed but i want to know if theyre 100 percent committed the probel is that theres been a lot of damage done and i cant forget it stuff has been said stories planted that just arent true can i get over all that i doubt it
1496048 then they tried to buy me off to stay retired so they can say they welcome me back but come on the way theyve treated me tells you the truth they dont want me back so lets move on i dont know where its headed well see

1496062 weve been experiencing a lot of break ins to vehicles some of which were windows that were broken out in other cases windows vehicles were left unlocked and value items are being taken
1496063 theyre taking ipods taking stereos out of cars cameras money
1496064 so i guess in broad daylight theyre feeling safe and they must have cased the area and know theyre not being seen from anywhere
1496065 you cant be seen from the highway its hard to patrol this area because its just a short little road and theres no businesses that are right directly in the path that can also view people coming in and out of here
1496066 this vehicle is locked up but its got a lot of property laying on the seats and on the floor and all over the place
1496067 i cant really tell what it is but it looks like hes got a jacket over top of it to try and hide it a little bit
1496068 well i died but at least 3 of those guys are dead and i know more or less where the others are hiding out
1496069 press this button and stick to something so you cant move read interact any more

1496071 an odd thing about me is that i dont concern myself with copyrights i want people to enjoy my images
1496072 after you have a life changing experience i dont get upset about the little things any more ill always be taking more images anyway
1496073 hey where did you get that is it yours did you write that on your own

1496078 the players they want it resolved even talk to brett about it he feels bad about it its time for them to talk about somebody else
1496079 mike and i both agreed last night that me being out there is a distraction and will continue to be a distraction we all know the reason im here is because the commissioner reinstated me so we have a lot of things to figure out its simple and complicated both at the same time
1496080 the problem is that theres been a lot of damage done and i cant forget it
1496081 and listening to him talk about that you respect his opinion and frankly i told him i said ill take responsibility because i have a voice in the building i never thought he truly was going to play i thought he was emotionally driven for other reasons
1496082 was smart enough to know that the odds were stacked against him

1496085 it is the cross that gives god his credibility the only god i believe in is the one nietzsche the nineteenth century german philosopher ridiculed as god on the cross in the real world of pain how could one worship a god who was immune to it in the course of my travels i have entered a number of buddhist temples in different asian countries i have stood respectfully before a statue of the buddha his legs crossed arms folded eyes closed the ghost of a smile playing around his mouth serene and silent a remote look on his face detached from the agonies of the world but each time after a while i have had to turn away and in my imagination i have turned instead to that lonely twisted tortured figure on the cross nails through hands and feet back lacerated limbs wrenched brow bleeding from thorn pricks mouth dry and intolerably thirsty plunged in godforsaken darkness the crucified one is the god for me he laid aside his immunity to pain he entered our world of flesh and blood tears and death he suffered for us dying in our place in order that we might be forgiven our sufferings become more manageable in light of his there is still a question mark against human suffering but over it we boldly stamp another mark the cross which symbolizes divine suffering
1496086 akiva we did 2 big jobs today my guys are exhausted but not to worry well start early tomorrow and ill bring the big truck and an extra guy so we only have to make 1 trip

1496096 after the saturday night prayer and havdala the house would shrink back to its weekday size the guests would disappear and my husband would return to his bed this was the schedule every week since our marriage
1496097 why didnt you ever tell anyone about this wondrous miracle
1496098 i know that a bride is like a queen and the groom is like a king therefore i assumed that this happens in every jewish household on every shabbat after the wedding
1496099 since he was reinstated yesterday im surprised hes not out but i heard a statement he didnt want to be a distraction so i understand him not coming out todya
1496100 wed like to see him play at least people i talked to but were happy with the team either way

1496102 blight was tescos brief art noise project they once opened for dks where they took the stage with 48
1496103 graham mcculloch tesco rode out on a moped and gunned the engine there was smoke going off then in our second show we did a fake glam rock thing where everyone was dressed in drag i had the rock amp roll nurse miniskirt with a silver glitter wig and lipstick before we went on tesco wrestled fred smith of beefeater both dressed as cavemen we were trying to do comedy stadium rock

1496108 local bands that i feel 2007 could be their breakthrough year include minipop audrye sessions the hundred days maldroid scissors for lefty built for the sea and immigrant
1496109 lullaby land tunes that teach your body to sway like branches in the breeze
1496110 audrye sessions arent afraid to keep it sweet and lush the quintets pop ballads combine the passion and complex instrumentals of a velvet teen rock lullaby with muse like danceability
1496111 this band has more promise than most rings and liars combined

1496116 time to go to work and im getting ready cellphone in my right breast pocket pda in my right one cd player in the one underneath considering that im wearing glasses and a wristwatch and i carry a usb flash drive in my bag thats quite a number of devices do i need all of them recently i started thinking about this because my cellphone is showing its age and so is my cd player given the way portable cd players have gone out of fashion i might as well give in and get myself an ipod or something of the kind now my pda is capable of playing mp3 files but i really want something that supports some lossless format which by the way means a hard disk with luck ill manage to get rid of my usb key the less unconvenient of my portable devices on the other hand it looks like i wont be able to eliminate any of my other gizmos and even attaining all my desires is not going to be easy there arent that many media players out there that support lossless formats the ipod looks like the best one but its a bit too proprietary for my taste assuming i was considering changing my pda which im not pda cellphone combinations are either unpleasantly bulky as phones or inconveniently small as pdas my pda is a diskless palm one not the most convenient set up to move data around in terms of both storage and ease of use on the other hand ill probably be able to watch photos and videos on three different devices something about which i couldnt care less what am i to do
1496117 i have no clue what i am doing but i learn from those who do
1496118 not that i have already obtained all this or have already been made perfect but i press on toward the goal
1496119 i am leading this thing oh my goodness what the hell am i doing excuse my swahili god what were you thinking
1496120 act like a bitch and you will be treated like a bitch
1496121 i just made it up honestly i dont know what i was thinking
1496122 my husband did not wrap up the nomination in 1992 until he won the california primary somewhere in the middle of june right we all remember bobby kennedy was assassinated in june in california you know i just i dont understand it
1496123 i regret that if my referencing that moment of trauma for our entire nation and in particular the kennedy family was in any way offensive i certainly had no intention of that whatsoever
1496124 now no one believes miss hillary is hoping something bad will happen to barack obama like assassination so she can win the democratic nomination but referring to assassinations with a black man running for president is in really bad taste
1496125 the emancipation proclamation had little impact on the texans due to the minimal number of union troops to enforce the new executive order however with the surrender of general robert e lee in april of 1865 and the arrival of general gordon grangers regiment the forces were finally strong enough to influence and overcome the resistance
1496126 my name is yoliswa dlamini my friends call me kunu i live with my grandmother and two brothers mcondisi and fanafana i turned 14 years on the 2 february i never knew my parents my father died when i was still a baby my mother left me when i was a month old my grandparents took care of me when i was about seven my grandfather died my grandmother doesnt work and she struggled to put a meal on the table for me and my brothers when i was about 10 years old i heard about this place where children received a free meal everyday the idea of a guaranteed meal every day seemed very appealing to me so i went i received more than just a free meal today about 4 years later i am thankful that i have not ended up like many of the other girls i see around me in the community i am thankful that i dont have to sell my body for sex just so i can get some money to buy a meal i am thankful that i am in school and have the opportunity to receive an education i am thankful that i can be all that god wants me to be

1496129 we dont have a lot of time on this earth we werent meant to spend it this way human beings were not meant to sit in little cubicles staring at computer screens all day filling out useless forms and listening to eight different bosses drone on about about mission statements

1496131 dundee united manager craig levein has today been fined 5000 by the general purposes committee for comments made following the rangers v dundee united match on may 10 2008

1496133 if its not a level playing field and if we dont get the decisions blatant important decisions then what is the point of turning up
1496134 at a meeting today with the sfa and the ssfra the spl undertook to carry out a benchmarking exercise across european football to establish appropriate fees going forward
1496135 contrary to speculation earlier today the clydesdale bank premier league fixtures this weekend will go ahead as planned
1496136 there was lots of talk about me leaving in the summer but im still here and im happy with that
1496137 it is not a problem for me to stay here and thats what people have to understand
1496138 there was no point in me changing club for a team that was a similar size to celtic but one which does not always make the champions league or have 60 000 fans behind you
1496139 to me there is no point when i have all that at celtic
1496140 i have a new child and things are settled with my football and thats good
1496141 he seemed like a person who was happy to have a job was committed to doing it well and didnt stand out in any way in terms of having anger issues or having any other issues
1496142 we are very thorough in our assessments and there was nothing we could have foreseen
1496143 it crosses your mind oh no here we go again
1496144 if csaba says he doesnt need me for his team if i am not playing i want to leave hearts
1496145 if you are not playing you must change club csaba hasnt said anything to me so far he wants to watch me in games first and then talk
1496146 i hope this can be a big season for me but it depends how the coach looks at me he has been here a couple of weeks and i believe he trusts me he also has mikoliunas on the right side beslija has come back so these are his choices i will work hard in training and then take a decision
1496147 you can use all the excuses you want but there should have been enough left in the team to handle this
1496148 no disrespect to kaunas they set their stall out well in both games and there are things we just have to take on board its a huge disappointment for everyone
1496149 its a blow in every aspect including the financial side and everything that comes with it
1496150 we just have to face it and get on with it
1496151 there was always a hope that we could pick ourselves up for this game and there was also a matter of pride of playing in europe again
1496152 he did very well as captain last season and the fact he has got a seasons experience under his belt was another big plus
1496153 he showed all the leadership qualities you require from a captain and hopefully being given the role again will act as an extra incentive for him continue to do well
1496154 if im being honest it was a relatively straightforward decision to keep grant on as captain and i see no reason why he cant do the job as well it not better this time round
1496155 normally we read the script but this time it was not necessary the name dan brown was enough

1496162 its a darn shame that music going to waste like that
1496163 i think evolution selected music and dance as ways that people could come together and defuse any interpersonal tensions that arise from large groups
1496164 one suggestion is that music and dance helps humans to get along we see that there is the release of soothing brain chemicals when people sing and dance together
1496165 and the others werent purely vicarious they were instructional when an episode was over you knew what was cool to do at a club or a concert and although many of the dancers on those shows were incredible a lot of them were average they were us the camera would actually cut away from the professionals to linger on the amateur dancers dancing with the stars
1496166 people would sit around and sing songs with a piano player now theres been a professionalization of singing as well
1496167 so much because we can laugh at people who dont abide the new social norm you dont perform in public unless youre really good increasingly he said weve come to think that way about all social entertainment
1496168 export traffic from asia to the us is likely to decline further with the housing market slowing down even further after fanny mae and freddie mac have failed to save the mortgage market

1496172 i need to play with the team they are all expecting that i get back to my old role and they are helping me by passing me the ball
1496173 manu luis and chapu nocioni will be our three key offensive players carlos delfino and me as well as some others will have to help them score during some part of the matches
1496174 they want to beat us and we are the defending champions that motivates them but we will be ready
1496175 we are pleased to have both rodney stuckey and arron afflalo signed through the 2009 10 season
1496176 both players will continue to grow and mature within our system and we look forward to the contributions they will bring this season and beyond
1496177 we are very excited that we have reached an agreement with lou williams
1496178 he is not only a very talented player who exemplifies our up tempo style of play but he is also a young man who exhibits great character and qualities off the court as well we look forward to having him in a sixers uniform for many years to come
1496179 were happy that lou is back as he has proven to be an integral part of the team
1496180 hes made great strides as a player and were very confident hell continue to excel with us for years to come
1496181 its a great mixture of olympic gold medalists with some really tremendous young talent
1496182 i liked the color and its midsummer and i thought we needed a little hollywood glamour
1496183 she and i have been asked that question a thousand times and we are sorry that we dont have any funny stories to tell you about it
1496184 in 2004 we were kind of disassociated with everyone because we were staying on a cruise ship and not with everyone in the olympic village
1496185 this year were going to be a little more open to it were going to try to have a little more fun and enjoy it and theres people that we want to go out and see
1496186 i want to go see track and field thats something thats amazing to see in person and im the kind of person who wants to get out and about to a lot of different things we can get out more and go do those things and i think this year were really going to live the experience up go out and enjoy it
1496187 now that we are almost there it was a great thing to do
1496188 it really built something it built a family type of atmosphere where everyone got to know one another on the court and off it that isnt something that happens overnight
1496189 if we have a close game its going to be talked about and were the only team like that so we have to approach it different
1496190 for me its just to get back out there and play for my country play the game of basketball that i love at its highest level and not being injured and going out there and playing against the best competition and playing with the best competition
1496191 how many people can say in their career they played with lebron james kobe bryant carmelo anthony chris paul and so forth at one time not many people will ever be able to say that so im happy and thrilled about it
1496192 what were good at is really pressuring guys and we just kinda let them run their offense let them move the ball around if you let a team do that especially a team that knows each other the way that this team does theyre gonna eat you up and they moved it around until they got the shot they wanted
1496193 he can get to the basket at will and his jumpers falling too been probably our most consistent guy night in and night out for this team him and lebron
1496194 but if you dont make shots and you still win by double digits youre still happy imagine if we make shots
1496195 we won the ball game we found a way to win
1496196 im in search of the perfect cup of coffee and something to kill this hangover

1496223 ex officer gets 3 years in attempt to kill wife
1496224 we did this record on our own paid for it ourselves with no expectations of what was going to happen with it if it was even going to be finished let alone released
1496225 i still see myself as more of a music fan than a professional musician
1496226 to get to play with wilco as a wilco fan
1496227 i mean were not wilcos peers at all you know
1496228 that kind of vocal based music is what ive most listened to since i was a tot i mean ive gone through periods of writing that werent as harmony based but just in terms of recording this lp the process kind of determined what the band is almost we were just laying down all these ideas straight to tape some songs never having played live and we just determined it made sense to have the whole record come from this same place and have a lot of similar singing things going on
1496229 scarves of red tied round their throats to keep their little heads from falling in the snow
1496230 to me one of the pitfalls of revivalism is that youre speaking outside your own experience
1496231 and we get inspiration from everywhere but we are mindful of expressing ourselves and our own ideas some people may interpret it as old or new but its just coming from us
1496232 ive found that if i tried to write something specifically new sounding it somehow diluted what i was doing if you are not the lucky dude with the right sensibility that youre totally brand new and everyone hears it as new then the best thing to do ive found is to write songs you think are ok and not really worry about sounding old or new
1496233 but i really feel like this current group of people feels like the creative beings that should be doing this ive never been part of a creative synergy thats this strong ever
1496234 casey and i are both wearing keys that go into the death switch

1496240 este es un mundo libre y todos pueden expresar sus sentimientos sobre las cosas malas que pasan all pero pienso que los atletas han estado trabajando duro para este momento
1496241 por eso no creo que ser a correcto pedirles que boicoteen algo que deber a ser resuelto de manera diferente
1496242 es una gran oportunidad ir a unas olimpiadas y formar parte de un equipo hay que divertirse y disfrutar el momento porque eso sucede una vez en la vida
1496243 constantemente espiada por la polic a secreta del presidente nicolae ceausescu la securitate que la vigilaba como si se tratara de un tesoro nacional consigui cruzar de noche la frontera h ngara luego pas un tiempo en austria para refugiarse finalmente en estados unidos
1496244 yo no usar a la palabra sacrificios porque cuando decides dedicar tu tiempo a algo tienes que renunciar a otras cosas
1496245 me dediqu a la gimnasia porque me gustaba no lo hice para ganar medallas en las olimpiadas los triunfos en los juegos ol mpicos sucedieron por el trabajo duro
1496246 eso sucedi hace 32 a os en ese momento no sab a que yo hab a sido la primera en obtener el 10 perfecto con 14 a os de edad uno s lo va y compite con la esperanza de hacer un buen trabajo y de no cometer errores
1496247 estaba un poco confundida porque no sab a lo que hab a sucedido una de mis compa eras me explic que la pizarra de resultados no pod a mostrar el 10 perfecto el resultado que pod a desplegar para mostrar que era un 10 era 1 00 la pizarra no fue creada para mostrar un 10 porque nadie cre a que esa calificaci n era posible

1496250 the defense was really being pushed to get ready to go
1496251 there is nobody in the country that is going to be able to push the tempo on our defense more than what they have already seen
1496252 we were able to get in some meetings and some work off the field
1496253 los documentos de la corte indican que ella apenas fue arrestada el mes pasado al este de afganist n donde dispar contra un grupo de soldados que la interrogaban

1496268 fico muito satisfeito e emocionado ao receber elogios do reina um goleiro experiente vitorioso e campe o da eurocopa pela espanha sei da responsabilidade que defender uma equipe tradicional como o liverpool mas estou me adaptando muito bem ao clube e espero continuar tendo oportunidades no time
1496269 nosso objetivo terminar o primeiro turno colado no l der que hoje o gr mio para atingirmos isso temos passar pelo vit ria n o podemos deixar o gr mio e o cruzeiro distanciarem

1496272 estou muito contente por chegar a um clube como a juventus e n o uma frase feita aqui o futebol importa acumulei tanta experi ncia em equipes pequenas e faz tanto tempo que estive no arsenal que me alegra voltar a jogar em um time de alto n vel
1496273 quem perde de 4 a 0 deveria se esconder e n o se expor
1496274 o s o paulo e outros clubes consultaram o departamento de registros da cbf e receberam um comunicado formal da entidade pois todos estavam aguardando este registro embora o andr lima tenha sido registrado no ltimo dia til antes da abertura da janela ele s foi aproveitado no dia 3 quem perde de 4 a 0 deveria se esconder e n o se expor
1496275 o s o paulo muito zeloso nessas quest es e quem registra a cbf v rios jogadores de v rios clubes foram inscritos no mesmo dia o s o paulo seguiu a determina o da cbf e n o entrou com medida judicial para tentar inscrever algu m antes
1496276 eu acredito que temos diversos times concorrendo s rie a sete ou oito equipes t m grandes chances de chegar e creio que ser assim at o final a n o ser que aconte a como com a ponte preta que perdeu o wanderley e o cear que perdeu o luiz carlos isso pode complicar
1496277 acreditem em mim o assunto est encerrado cristiano jogador do manchester e vai continuar aqui neste ano
1496278 isso ainda bom porque tem cinco ou seis clubes que n o est o distanciando vamos nos agarrar nisso tentar em cima disso criar nimo interesse

1496280 this is a tire gauge its a simple device and it will help you get better mileage out of your car john mccain and his supporters 520 shoes think youre too dumb to know how to use one of these
1496281 he who joyfully marches to music in rank and file has already earned my contempt he has been given a large brain by mistake since for him the spinal cord would surely suffice
1496282 obama is a mean mean boy who called us mean things we didnt do anything and he is mean
1496283 i run it contantly fucker sounds like a harrier taking off you can hear it for miles my liberal neighbors are always whining about how much it sucks and its making the kids deaf but i dont care fuck them and their kids
1496284 they lied about paying for the war with iraqi oil money
1496285 martin luther king never inspired others with i have a nightmare
1496286 recent instances of mps employing their children have raised public concern and dented public confidence
1496287 mps must have the resources to do their work effectively and they must command the confidence respect and trust of the public
1496288 there is no justification whatsoever for having these weapons i would suggest that a minority of people had hidden them with the intention of causing harm to police officers and possibly to the horses or dogs that we are using on patrol and if you look at the equipment we have seized it is clear the plan was to use these items for criminal purposes
1496289 these claims made by police are ridiculous were eating food at the camp what do the police think we are cutting up our potatoes with one wonders if assistant chief constable gary beautridge will be raiding his own kitchen
1496290 yesterday we were disappointed with the police now we are disgusted
1496291 we have seen a really high level of political policing they are confiscating things we need to use on the camp such as wood for the toilets and pipes for running water its ridiculous you name it the boys in blue have taken it from us its a blatant campaign they have been using to put people off coming here because there is reluctance among the authorities to allow us to have a real discussion on climate change
1496292 the redevelopment of blackfriars underground station is part of network rail works
1496293 once the works are complete customers will get a new upgraded station with step free access increased capacity and better interchange facilities between the tube and national rail services
1496294 the question is not so much about the technology but what one does with it we have quite definite laws about where cctv can be used but of course with uavs you have much greater ability to gather material in private spaces and this would lead to concern
1496295 if they are used to simply hover to gain random information then that would obviously be a matter of worry and a civil liberty issue
1496296 closely involved with the development of procedures and regulations which allow uavs to operate in national and nato airspace but the committee indicates that the ministry should do more
1496297 in the response to our report we expect the mod to set out why it supports the astraea programme only in an observer role and its future plans with regard to this programme
1496298 satellite images can be affected by clouds and lack of light with uavs you can avoid that by choosing the height at which you fly there is now also google earth but these are often old images out of date there is tremendous potential in material gathered by uavs
1496299 there will obviously be implications for privacy human rights etc that is something the government will have to address and i imagine that there will be protests from some quarters but you certainly cannot blame police and intelligence services for wanting to use them
1496300 i am looking at a number of measures and i am not going to be drawn on that today because we have not concluded what exactly we need to do it is helping people that is important i want to look at a range of options
1496301 claims by labour that brown is best able to steer the country through the economic crisis are simply not believed by voters labours reputation for economic competence has been torn to shreds
1496302 labour now finds itself facing a serious and respected opposition for the first time winning the next election will be harder than winning the last three whoever leads
1496303 mr cameron remains relatively popular and is thought more capable than brown but not all the stardust has transferred to his party
1496304 i think the prime minister is very focused on what we need to do to recapture peoples enthusiasm
1496305 the situation in the polls is that we are not doing very well to say the least
1496306 she wanted it really to be kept a secret for a long time
1496307 and i think women should because they should be able to announce what theyre having and when its time to make the announcement
1496308 you won a large sum of 1000000000 99 and you will win it but you have to give out all of your personal information blah blah blah

1496317 ive always been a trivial pursuit fan and i can really see tv audiences becoming obsessed with this addictive format

1496353 there were even a lot of people in the logging business who had never heard of paul bunyan
1496354 but when it got to the wholesaler and lumber dealer and the manufacturer who was buying the lumber for factory purposes they didnt know anything about paul bunyan and there was all kinds of confusion

1496359 technology will not stop people being greedy stupid or starting wars it wont necessarily make people happy but it provides a basis if people want to use it for improving human comfort and creating wealth
1496360 there are limits on what an individual can do in terms of brain power this naturally pushes people towards specialisation but specialisation works only if you can get access to all the individual areas of thought because people can connect sources of information so much more easily through new communications technology the process of knowledge discovery will get faster and faster
1496361 my point is that most of the technologies such as wind turbines or using hydrogen as a fuel that produce carbon less energy are technologically not particularly challenging in principle and have been known for a long time some for centuries
1496362 the devil is in the fine details of design and performance
1496363 stopping them then so we dont have to fight now

1496386 kadangkala ia dapat mengajak seseorang secara individual seorang pendeta atau pengerja kantor gereja dan berkata ada dosa dalam hatimu dan ia selalu benar
1496387 kenyataan bahwa gereja china adalah gereja yang berdoa sekarang ini dapat dikatakan merupakan pengaruh dan teladan dari tokoh ini yang berdoa

1496394 the most unusual thing about booger was that he has a unique ability to reason
1496395 there are things you can do individually though to save energy making sure your tires are properly inflated simple things but we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tuneups youd actually save just as much
1496396 our contemporary western society in spite of its material intellectual and political progress is increasingly less conductive to mental health and tends to undermine the inner security happiness reason and capacity for love in the individual it tends to turn him into an automaton who pays for his human failures with increasing mental sickness and with despair hidden under a frantic drive for work and so called pleasure
1496397 of defining mental hygiene as the prevention of symptoms symptoms as such are not our enemy but out friend where there are symptoms there is conflict and conflict always indicates that the forces of life which strive for integration and happiness are still fighting
1496398 many of them are normal because they are so well adjusted to our mode of existence because their human voice has been silenced so early in their lives that they do not even struggle or suffer or develop symptoms as the neurotic does
1496399 uniformity and freedom are incompatible uniformity and mental health are incompatible too man is not made to be an automaton and if he becomes one the basis for mental health is destroyed

1496456 good afternoon let me begin by saying that although this has been billed as an anti war rally i stand before you as someone who is not opposed to war in all circumstances the civil war was one of the bloodiest in history and yet it was only through the crucible of the sword the sacrifice of multitudes that we could begin to perfect this union and drive the scourge of slavery from our soil i dont oppose all wars my grandfather signed up for a war the day after pearl harbor was bombed fought in pattons army he saw the dead and dying across the fields of europe he heard the stories of fellow troops who first entered auschwitz and treblinka he fought in the name of a larger freedom part of that arsenal of democracy that triumphed over evil and he did not fight in vain i dont oppose all wars after september 11th after witnessing the carnage and destruction the dust and the tears i supported this administrations pledge to hunt down and root out those who would slaughter innocents in the name of intolerance and i would willingly take up arms myself to prevent such a tragedy from happening again i dont oppose all wars and i know that in this crowd today there is no shortage of patriots or of patriotism what i am opposed to is a dumb war what i am opposed to is a rash war what i am opposed to is the cynical attempt by richard perle and paul wolfowitz and other arm chair weekend warriors in this administration to shove their own ideological agendas down our throats irrespective of the costs in lives lost and in hardships borne what i am opposed to is the attempt by political hacks like karl rove to distract us from a rise in the uninsured a rise in the poverty rate a drop in the median income to distract us from corporate scandals and a stock market that has just gone through the worst month since the great depression thats what im opposed to a dumb war a rash war a war based not on reason but on passion not on principle but on politics now let me be clear i suffer no illusions about saddam hussein he is a brutal man a ruthless man a man who butchers his own people to secure his own power he has repeatedly defied un resolutions thwarted un inspection teams developed chemical and biological weapons and coveted nuclear capacity hes a bad guy the world and the iraqi people would be better off without him but i also know that saddam poses no imminent and direct threat to the united states or to his neighbors that the iraqi economy is in shambles that the iraqi military is a fraction of its former strength and that in concert with the international community he can be contained until in the way of all petty dictators he falls away into the dustbin of history i know that even a successful war against iraq will require a us occupation of undetermined length at undetermined cost with undetermined consequences i know that an invasion of iraq without a clear rationale and without strong international support will only fan the flames of the middle east and encourage the worst rather than best impulses of the arab world and strengthen the recruitment arm of al qaeda i am not opposed to all wars im opposed to dumb wars so for those of us who seek a more just and secure world for our children let us send a clear message to the president today you want a fight president bush lets finish the fight with bin laden and al qaeda through effective coordinated intelligence and a shutting down of the financial networks that support terrorism and a homeland security program that involves more than color coded warnings you want a fight president bush lets fight to make sure that the un inspectors can do their work and that we vigorously enforce a non proliferation treaty and that former enemies and current allies like russia safeguard and ultimately eliminate their stores of nuclear material and that nations like pakistan and india never use the terrible weapons already in their possession and that the arms merchants in our own country stop feeding the countless wars that rage across the globe you want a fight president bush lets fight to make sure our so called allies in the middle east the saudis and the egyptians stop oppressing their own people and suppressing dissent and tolerating corruption and inequality and mismanaging their economies so that their youth grow up without education without prospects without hope the ready recruits of terrorist cells you want a fight president bush lets fight to wean ourselves off middle east oil through an energy policy that doesnt simply serve the interests of exxon and mobil those are the battles that we need to fight those are the battles that we willingly join the battles against ignorance and intolerance corruption and greed poverty and despair the consequences of war are dire the sacrifices immeasurable we may have occasion in our lifetime to once again rise up in defense of our freedom and pay the wages of war but we ought not we will not travel down that hellish path blindly nor should we allow those who would march off and pay the ultimate sacrifice who would prove the full measure of devotion with their blood to make such an awful sacrifice in vain

1496551 big deal ive been tying my shoes since i was four normal people can all tie their shoes
1496552 any normal person wouldnt think this was a big deal
1496553 my problem lies in reconciling my gross habits with my net income
1496554 im having fun tracking my money its quite remarkable how you can cut your spending without changing your lifestyle very much just watching the money helps
1496555 sometimes it isnt that we arent going to buy something its just that we are going to wait until the money is in the account i dont feel deprived because ill get it soon just not today its something to look forward to and theres a whole world of deals out there this week i realized that just by shopping around i can get four shirts for what i used to pay for one
1496556 my father didnt tell me how to live he lived and let me watch him do it
1496557 i looked after most of the accounts but i didnt want to talk to june about everything she didnt know the extent of our debt i didnt want her to worry since she didnt realize the seriousness of our problem it was easier to put it out of her mind
1496558 we used to be so worried we couldnt sleep we had no idea where the money went we would use the overdraft constantly what a false sense of security i was buying things to make myself feel better but we werent talking about why we were spending
1496559 we never talked about money in a way that got to the root of the problem id say we have to cut back but we werent talking about changes when i dug into the details of our spending i saw where we were going wrong i showed it to sheila and she helped to get us talking about more than the details we started talking about why we spend money and how we feel about money things we hadnt talked about before
1496560 money used to be a very sensitive topic coaching helped us build awareness about our attitudes toward money it has changed the way im thinking and spending ray and i talk about money every day now we make choices together like whether to go to the pne or entertain friends we talk about the consequences of overspending on things because it means well have less money for something else
1496561 our goal is a worry free retirement we arent going to be rich but we want to be comfortable and rich is relative anyway
1496562 it makes me feel better because we have a plan for now and for the future we werent feeling good about ourselves before
1496563 sheila helped us get away from feeling deprived and move towards feeling fortunate i am fortunate beyond words true happiness isnt in the things i dont have its what i do have
1496564 when you know where your money is you feel richer because you know how much you have i got my hair done the other day and its nice to be able to spend without guilt and worry because we check the accounts i know the money is there
1496565 picturing our future helped us get realistic about what we can expect if we can stick to our budget we can pay down debt and contribute to rsps sheila crunched some numbers and helped us plan how much we need to contribute now to have 500 000 saved and that along with my pension will be enough for us to live well if we stick to our plan we can have a holiday every year we wont have a lot of excess cash but well enjoy life
1496566 changing the way we think about money has really changed our life id like to be as confident as ray but im hopeful it seems like a huge amount of debt to pay off but im glad its not more if we had continued to spend like we were it wouldnt be manageable now we know we can manage the debt we have and well pay it off we feel like we are in control and that makes you feel better about yourself
1496567 this is taking too long ill never make it who am i kidding i may as well give up now

1496604 the idea for this movie is what happens when a bunch of actors get stuck out in the jungle in a real world situation because us actors most of us are what wussies
1496605 it is just the most enormous thing that has happened in traumatic brain injury research
1496606 in anbar they love the marines if anyone tells you different they are lying
1496607 the iraqi people are very happy americans are helping them go from dark to light
1496608 we could call it a victory and walk away tomorrow if the economy picked up significantly
1496609 the marine corps doesn t determine when it will happen that s a decision made by iraqi government officials
1496610 their biggest concern is that we re going to pull out that we re not going to be around anymore they like to have us around
1496611 so that they will keep the security in the city
1496612 from a security point of view if pic provincial iraqi control happened tomorrow very very little would change because we re already there
1496613 when you re down here in anbar and driving around they don t have to stop when a military convoy approaches
1496614 my efforts primarily are connecting the central government to the people of anbar and at the same time convincing the people of anbar it s not a neglect of them by the government but just a new government learning how to be a government
1496615 there s a certain level of frustration that things aren t moving quick enough but in general they are satisfied that things are moving in the right direction
1496616 we get up to 15 000 visitors a day during high season
1496617 it s open year round but during the colder months weather might make it inaccessible
1496618 so as things become more expensive off base and they would anticipate their cola would go up in fact their cola goes down because they begin shopping on base and we attribute commissary prices as greater part of the market basket
1496619 our recommendation is that we fix those proportions so that military members are no longer penalized for making wise financial choices
1496620 if they want their child to go to the local public school they would just
1496621 if however they wish to put their child in a different public school or a private school they could take their impact aid dollars and use them to either offset private school tuition or to get them into a different public school
1496622 the other two children are still too scared of me
1496623 apparently he was quite a character i can only imagine what kind of names his best buddies called him
1496624 even though sgt mchale was stop lossed he continued to bust his butt
1496625 when the work was through have a shot of jameson for him
1496626 he was a good leader and a good friend to everyone who met him
1496627 how does one sum up in a few short minutes the many memories built upon more than 60 years of friendship
1496628 that the important things in life are the signs of love and friendship that we leave behind when we go away
1496629 i am impressed and sad that we lose friends in our town
1496630 i met a lot of friends on both sides now all we will have left is the memories
1496631 our study suggests that compounds such as sulforaphane from broccoli may help counter processes linked to the development of vascular disease in diabetes
1496632 in future it will be important to test if eating a diet rich in brassica vegetables has health benefits for diabetic patients we expect that it will
1496633 it is encouraging to see that professor thornalley and his team have identified a potentially important substance that may protect and repair blood vessels from the damaging effects of diabetes
1496634 after hearing what my coach has been saying now i am 100 certain
1496635 we have a great relationship he is like my second father i really dont have a problem this is the first miscommunication that i have ever had with my coach and i hope it never happens again i have been conditioning myself all year in case i plan to run the double i have been doing 200m and 100m over the season i am used to the heats i dont think it will take too much out of me
1496636 i will request that the b sample gets tested as i have never taken drugs in my life and i dont know about this drug
1496637 it was just too much of a risk for me to run in london and i apologise to the british fans for not running there
1496638 but i promise i will make it up to them in gateshead
1496639 religious people were indifferent or even hostile to science scientists and ecologists could see little relationship between their world and the world of faith
1496640 we are all culpable each one of us has a smaller or greater contribution to the deliberate degradation of nature
1496641 there is hardly a religious leader in the world now who is not preoccupied by the problems of pollution and climate change
1496642 religious leaders are in a better position to make an impact on their congregations than politicians or celebrities
1496643 much of easterlys critique is directed to self constructed claims and assertions rather than drawn from the report
1496644 in all my reforms the goal is not to denigrate government but to make it better not to deride government but to restore its good name
1496645 he should be thinking about who can help him govern successfully so he can get re elected
1496646 how were the benefits of growth distributed in europe vs us
1496647 the sec seems the natural entity for this job no need to inflate the fed any further right now

1496649 the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed
1496650 this mornings christian science monitor reports that the army is preparing to offer a staggering 150 000 retention bonus to service members who are proficient in arabic
1496651 its one of the reasons we tend to hold asset managers
1496652 there is a limited number of them and they are attractive takeover targets k there wont be many independents left
1496653 it gave us appeal in the minds of potential acquisitors
1496654 they kept their own identity they kept their own investment style and also portfolio management team
1496655 mackenzie has great credibility as far as we are concerned
1496656 the process covered half a dozen or so potential buyers
1496657 we have 50 million of annualized revenues and we have 30 million in cash so there was not a problem with the company back then or even today
1496658 mackenzie has got roots there whereas saxon was trying to grow roots in that area

1496679 i covered the bottom of the crockpot with onion slices placed the chicken on top added a a pint of water and the tomato sauce next i tossed the whole garlic cloves and freshly picked herbs left as whole stems of leaves on top of the chicken and set the pot to cook on high for 3 hours

1496700 the fireworks were an extra big deal that year and celebrities like evel knievel all seemed to have specials celebrating it as a six year old it was awesome
1496701 we need to focus on preventing domestic violence but the government has largely ignored preventative work and instead has passed more criminal justice legislation and even this hasnt been implemented properly
1496702 why have they still not implemented the domestic violence restraining orders that were promised four years ago this labour government is letting down domestic violence victims
1496703 two women are killed every week by a current or former partner this is a huge statistic and one that we need to start addressing and addressing fast if were to save lives and protect young women in the future
1496704 it is essential that women receive the right education and information so they can understand the techniques of control frequently used by abusive men
1496705 its all too easy for women to excuse their partners possessive and jealous behaviour but in so doing they run the risk of the abuse increasing in frequency and severity over time by understanding the signs early a woman is forewarned and forearmed
1496706 refuges campaign is a warning siren to all women no matter what their age or background everyone has the right to live free from control and violence dont ignore the warning signs
1496707 as the data show we are all competitively sensitive to what our peers earn and spend individuals are demonstrably happier and less stressed as their incomes rise with a rising national economy and rich people surveys show are generally happier than those lower down the income scale but human psychology being what it is the initial euphoria of a higher standard of living soon wears off as the newly affluent adjust to their better status in life any gain in human contentment is transitory
1496708 fortunately this psychology also works in reverse sharp financial adversity brings deep depression but people not otherwise psychologically incapacitated rebound with time their smile returns

1496853 the company has successfully been able to raise capital for its infrastructure needs and doesnt even claim that this deal will make capital more affordable if thats the case from the public interest perspective what is the need for this transaction
1496854 the other week i was driving along listening to a distressing story on npr about a man in china who was trapped under a collapsed building from the earthquake
1496855 what possessed the dems to nominate such a nitwit like franken
1496856 it all seems odd to me its just the 52 to 38 on party id seems a bit high maybe 4 6 off or so
1496857 and as he abandons his old identity for the new breeding disenchantment among his formerly passionate left of center supporters and equally doubts among the center he courts he risks becoming nothing at all a candidate who is everything and nothing in the same moment
1496858 every attempt to regain authenticity only casts a new infinitely repeated image through the hall of mirrors that is his political life and our media experience of that life
1496859 those reflections set the authenticity of john mccain in high relief
1496860 obama is the talented salesman who seduced one state after another saying iowa this is our moment virginia this is our moment texas this is our moment and then tells europe people of berlin people of the world this is our moment how many times can barack obama sell the same moment to everyone before he becomes mel brooks in the producers great line who is barack obama his campaign as it reupholsters him before our eyes says we can never know perhaps because barack obama does not know himself
1496861 it also reveals an obama of unapproachable arrogance and inestimable self regard he appears confident voters will appreciate his superiority regardless of where he journeys or what he becomes to meet his political ambitions
1496862 john mccain is a complete and well formed man barack obama is completing himself as he moves to fit what he perceives to be a right of center country he distances himself from the simple and authentic passion of a young candidate who once pledged change we can believe in
1496863 obama is the talented salesman who seduced one state after another saying iowa this is our moment virginia this is our moment texas this is our moment and then tells europe people of berlin people of the world this is our moment
1496864 i wonder about this ap isos poll it has 52 dem 38 rep 10 ind at its bottomline
1496865 its a bit embarrassing but there have been no reports of any casualties
1496866 these errors did not affect the outcome of the election of directors
1496867 utterly failed to explain how cardinals alleged conduct could reasonably be regarded as violating any of the laws
1496868 we are pleased to be able to offer our services to the government and look forward to working with secretary paulson and his team as they work to restore stability to the global capital markets and confidence in the u s housing market
1496869 we are committed to improving our financial results and believe these proactive steps are necessary to manage through the current challenging environment
1496870 we remain very bullish on our growth prospects as the market for natural and organic products continues to grow and our company continues to evolve
1496871 however the challenging economic environment appears to be negatively impacting our sales
1496872 in short and simple terms we would be plunged into a depression that would make the great depression of the 1930s in which i spent my childhood look like boom times
1496873 industries would fail banks would collapse government revenues would dry up universities would have to close health care even as limited as it now is for roughly 75 million americans would virtually cease in short something like what the south suffered at the end of the civil war would plague the country
1496874 even at todays price as you know 14 airlines have gone out of business while others are hovering on the brink of bankruptcy and most have curtailed service and laid off personnel
1496875 at double or triple todays price none could fly unless nationalized a whole range of other industries would be quickly drawn into the quicksand ironically war would push america into a form of socialist economy
1496876 so the lights are on late in washingtons federal reserve sec and treasury department trying to figure out how socialism your tax dollars and credits can once again bail out these big time gamblers with our money reckless self enriching capitalists get on your knees and thank the rescuing washington socialists for without them you would surely be in chains
1496877 that there were no weapons of mass destruction in iraq intelligence they received in plenty of time to stop an invasion
1496878 over the next few days the habbush letter continued to be featured prominently in the united states and across the globe
1496879 foxs bill oreilly trumpeted the story sunday night on the oreilly factor talking breathlessly about details of the story and exhorting now if this is true that blows the lid off al qaeda saddam
1496880 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1496881 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1496882 the allegation that the white house directed anyone to forge a document from habbush to saddam is just absurd
1496883 ron suskind makes a living from gutter journalism he is about selling books and making wild allegations that no one can verify including the numerous bipartisan commissions that have reported on pre war intelligence
1496884 the way of the world a story of truth and hope in an age of extremism
1496885 ignored the iraq intelligence chiefs accurate disclosure that there were no weapons of mass destruction in iraq intelligence they received in plenty of time to stop an invasion
1496886 they secretly resettled him in jordan paid him 5 million which one could argue was hush money and then used his captive status to help deceive the world about one of the eras most crushing truths that america had gone to war under false pretenses
1496887 operation created by the white house and passed to the cia seems inconsistent with
1496888 intended to influence united states political processes public opinion policies or media
1496889 it is not the sort of offense such as assault or burglary that carries specific penalties for example a fine or jail time
1496890 it is much broader than that it pertains to the white houses knowingly misusing an arm of government the sort of thing generally taken up in impeachment proceedings
1496891 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from cia ever involved in any such effort
1496892 in fact the source in question failed to persuade his british interlocutors that he had anything new to offer by way of intelligence concessions or negotiations with regard to the iraq crisis and the british on their own elected to break off contact with him
1496893 there were many iraqi officials who said both publicly and privately that iraq had no wmd but our foreign intelligence colleagues and we assessed that these individuals were parroting the baath party line and trying to delay any coalition attack the particular source that suskind cites offered no evidence to back up his assertion and acted in an evasive and unconvincing manner
1496894 the administration profoundly altered basic democratic ideals of accountability and informed consent
1496895 it should be noted that the intelligence sources who are quoted in this book in no way disclosed any classified information none crossed the line
1496896 tendency of the white house to ignore advice it didnt want to hear advice that contradicted its willed certainty political judgments or rigid message strategies
1496897 was a trained kgb agent who wants you to think hes your friend
1496898 step back in large meetings when they were together like those at the nsc national security council because people were addressing and deferring to cheney cheney said he understood that hed mostly just take notes at the big tables and then he and bush would meet privately frequently to discuss options and action
1496899 complex strategies developed over decades for how to protect a president
1496900 after the searing experience of being in the nixon white house cheney developed a view that the failure of watergate was not the break in or even the cover up but the way the president had in essence been over briefed
1496901 they key was a signaling system where the president made his wishes broadly known to a sufficiently powerful deputy who could take it from there if an investigation ensued or a foreign leader cried foul the president could shrug this was never something hed authorized the whole point of cheneys model is to make a president less accountable for his action cheneys view is that accountability a bedrock feature of representative democracy is not in every case a virtue
1496902 well along in petulance seasoned by a touch of self defensiveness
1496903 moving on its own natural arc the country is in the process of leaving bush his bullying impulse fused permanently with satisfying vengeance in the scattering ashes of 9 11
1496904 the high purpose his angry words carried after the attacks and in two elections since is dissolving with each passing minute
1496905 was sent to new york on a project for the book
1496906 detained by federal agents in manhattan he was interrogated and his notes were confiscated violations of his first and fourth amendment rights
1496907 we came up several possible designs based on what they were saying
1496908 in creating our flagship vista range we literally went back to the drawing board to re imagine the potential of a true premium quality loudspeaker both in terms of extraordinary audio performance and visual elegance without question the resulting products are our best performing and best looking ever these four models offer our discriminating customers an opportunity to enjoy the very best in audio quality whether for music or home theater while adding sophistication and style to the d cor of any room in their home
1496909 when banks issue merchants credit card accounts they may have to get a tin initially but they dont keep it which is a sound privacy practice
1496910 only collect the data you need and only keep the data as long as you need it
1496911 weve seen this constant stream of data breaches where various kinds of businesses and institutions suffer some kind of data intrusion or lost files the social security number in particular is found to be the most important piece of information for an identity thief
1496912 goes contrary to the whole effort to limit relying on it
1496913 our top priority is the safety and security of our customers
1496914 work closely with our merchants and figure out a way to make reporting the necessary data pretty seamless
1496915 originally legislation was looking like it was going to be targeted at casual sellers
1496916 the aggregate amount of sales reported to the irs isnt going to match the individual sellers tax returns
1496917 once we establish this precedent there could be other governmental purposes where it could be appealing to try and force private intermediaries to track their customers behavior
1496918 reflects that borrowers loans are significantly more expensive if they go through a broker in the subprime market than if they had gone directly to a lender
1496919 it is not going to stop borrowers from being duped into signing onto a loan or loans that they dont understand
1496920 these practices will continue in substantially the same volume regardless of whether the fbi has fingerprints
1496921 identity theft involving fingerprints is becoming a major concern among data security professionals
1496922 consumers who sign up for a gym for women deserve to get what they paid for or they should get a chance to get their money back
1496923 oh dont worry about it everyone in our industry goes through that
1496924 pick your favourite one i want to give you a small gift
1496925 well partner big to big and acquire big to small or big to medium
1496926 so you could see us partner with an ibm or a microsoft or an intel and well acquire more like a webex my favorite kind of company to acquire is one with 100 engineers who have a hot product they are just about to release
1496927 these errors did not affect the outcome of the election of directors
1496928 theres nobody getting rich writing software that i know of
1496929 success is a lousy teacher it seduces smart people into thinking they cant lose
1496930 microsoft looks at new ideas they dont evaluate whether the idea will move the industry forward they ask how will it help us sell more copies of windows
1496931 microsoft has had clear competitors in the past its a good thing we have museums to document that
1496932 spam will be a thing of the past in two years time
1496933 go watch this its the best play ive watched in years
1496934 the rain didnt help me that much i didnt win the match did i i was struggling with the wind a little bit and the light was tough but that was not an excuse this is probably the hardest loss of my career so far

1496937 im going to try to win at the olympics and the us open and have a good end to the season thats it
1496938 i felt angry and unhappy because there was a lot of personal things on there

1496943 oh my how did you find out but yep a representative from the japan foundation has approached me not too long ago although the offer is just too good to miss there are a lot of factors to consider if i were to accept it
1496944 pglm is not designed as a two men and a suitcase production as that would be ideal for a travelling show and the musical without the set is a different story
1496945 if the organiser can plan pglm for a longer run that would be more economically viable for us
1496946 honestly it is expensive to start the entire production all over again and for a production to break even it has to run for at least two months
1496947 yes ive something planned for next year but it is still at an infancy stage
1496948 its more of a record of our journey and the book can be used as a manual for fellow theatre practitioners for their future productions
1496949 if you cannot make a corporate night available for me because tickets were almost completely sold out as of last friday can you do an encore performance for celcom
1496950 we are always looking at ways to reward our customers for their continued loyalty to celcom so what better way to reward them by giving them an opportunity to watch this acclaimed show live and in person
1496951 the response p ramlee the musical has received from the public is a testament to the quality of its production and celcom is excited to be able to organise this exclusive engagement for our valued customers
1496952 everybody on a championship team doesnt get publicity but everyone can say hes a champion
1496953 the tomtom gps is working i consult that six times a day
1496954 the tomtom gps from my car is rather confused to find itself in the middle of the pacific
1496955 i would very much want to make it energy efficient self sufficient
1496956 its hard to tell from the reader comments its a self selecting sample
1496957 but something i set out to do is draw people to the web site in hopes that theyll stick around long enough to get the environmental messages
1496958 i did have to work up to this kind of thing it was incremental i didnt go from an office job to rowing across an ocean
1496959 my first thought was that is the best idea ive ever had of course my second thought was that was without a doubt the worst idea ive ever had
1496960 when d3 comes out blizzard will be making major changes to battle net all players will have a universal battle net account for all games they will start selling a 6 key chain with a digital face that updates every 10 minutes or so with a new 11 digit number that 11 digit number will be your password this will make it nearly impossible to keylog or bruteforce accounts
1496961 is likely to have profound effects on chases operations and financial results
1496962 ask yourself what you can offer that your competitors cant a better price greater expertise more convenience
1496963 then play up that edge to your target audience through direct and guerilla marketing
1496964 its always more effective to market to the person you know
1496965 people will be happy to share their information with you
1496966 maybe a person doesnt make a purchase on that first visit but spends 1 200 a year in the store
1496967 you can afford to spend money to capture their information for your database
1496968 in their mind they are thinking what if its junk
1496969 youll be hard pressed to find a reputable firm to do a site for less than 5 000

1496977 whos better to spew out incite than a college senior
1496978 i also want to obtain a deeper understanding of how advertising firms
1496979 another reason you should hire me is your web site is very unfriendly and may sway some clients into not working with you people use websites of companies such as yours for research and your website thinks that it is witty but comes off very dull and cheezy
1496980 i need real world experience and after reviewing your web site i get the impressing that your company believes in maintain a lax work environment while efficiently meeting the needs of its customers right

1496986 the tsa is well aware that the removal of shoes is not our most popular policy in fact it probably ranks up there with root canals and doing your taxes
1496987 last year tsa tested a shoe scanner from general electric in orlando today were testing shoe scanning technology at los angeles international airport if all goes well these tests could lead the way to quelling of one of our most unpopular policies
1496988 kindness in words creates confidence kindness in thinking creates profundity kindness in giving creates love
1496989 money can never buy you love or happiness you cannot go into a store and pay a person to be your friend i mean you could but i would rather meet them under a big apple tree

1496994 we are addressing it and we expect to begin the adjudication process before classes start on august 20
1496995 although i will say the pitch that i originally did once we decided what we were going to do said
1496996 saya pernah berkata kepada tiara hanya orang gila yang akan menerima tawaran menjayakan watak p ramlee dalam masa sebulan sebelum ia dipentaskan
1496997 tetapi sebaik saja mendengar tepukan gemuruh penonton semangat untuk terus memberikan persembahan terbaik semakin mendatang sudah tentu saya tidak ingin menggagalkan usaha keras rakan sepasukan yang lain
1496998 cara dia membawakan watak p ramlee cukup menarik dia bisa menghadirkan rasa suka dan duka dalam lakonannya
1496999 apabila p ramlee berhijrah ke kuala lumpur dia tidak mempunyai pasukan sokongan yang bagus kepak beliau bagai sudah patah dengan keadaan demikian kerjayanya semakin suram ketika di singapura dia mempunyai ramai rakan yang membantu termasuk saya sendiri yang kadangkala bersengkang mata untuk menyalin semula skor muzik yang digubahnya
1497000 prop dan lakonan semua bintang utamanya cukup bagus semua pelakon lama bagai hidup semula di depan mata apabila saya menontonnya
1497001 saya menyukai ceritanya yang cukup hidup dan tidak membosankan pada masa yang sama saya turut berasa sedih apabila teringat kenangan waktu kami masih muda
1497002 persembahan yang cantik saya tahu setiap kali teater membuka tirainya orang akan mempersoalkan tentang kesempurnaan memang teater mengejar kesempurnaan tetapi susah untuk mencapai kesempurnaan itu
1497003 saya harap apabila penonton yang menonton pada hari ini dapat menghebahkan kepada semua orang bahawa teater kali ini berbeza daripada yang pertama dahulu saya dapat merasakan lakonan musly yang membuatkan teater ini berbeza
1497004 saya lihat sambutan penonton pada hari ini pun saya dah rasa macam nak menangis yang istimewanya apabila melihat lakonan musly dia seorang yang tekad tekun dan bekerja keras bayangkanlah dalam masa enam minggu sahaja dia dapat menghayati watak p ramlee dengan baik
1497005 kira kira 80 peratus kumpulan produksi bergantung dengan dia dari segi dialog aksi bahasa tubuh dan pergerakannya banyak membantu prtm selebihnya diberikan oleh orang lain
1497006 saya kira dalam 200 peratus yang dia bagi lebih kepada prtm selepas balik dari pementasan di singapura
1497007 saya rasa prtm musim kedua ini sedikit mencabar kerana jualan tiket yang tidak sehebat musim pertama dahulu
1497008 jadi ia perlu mengambil masa yang panjang untuk mencapai tahap seperti dahulu
1497009 susah saya nak cakap sebab muzikal ini banyak bereksperimentasi dengan muzik banyak susunan muzik yang berubah dan prtm dah jadi seperti cerita baru
1497010 kita dah buat lain jadi prtm kali ini tidaklah dikatakan musim kedua selain itu koreografinya juga baru
1497011 skrip tu dia tambah sendiri dan banyak memberi cadangan dengan adlin untuk menghidupkan watak p ramlee hes so p ramlee dia sebati macam p ramlee
1497012 orang gila sahaja berani terima tawaran melakonkan watak p ramlee dalam masa enam minggu namun saya teruja ketika mendapat watak tersebut
1497013 bukan mudah untuk saya membawakan watak ini namun kerana sifat cinta yang mendalam terhadap karya karya p ramlee saya jadikan ia sebagai cabaran untuk memberi persembahan yang terbaik
1497014 saya rasa bersyukur kepada allah dan gembira kerana semua orang menghargai karya seniman agung p ramlee
1497015 kejayaan hari ini bukan terletak pada saya seorang rakan rakan seperjuangan dalam teater ini banyak membantu saya tanpa mereka semua saya rasa tidak sempurna pementasan ini
1497016 perasaan saya tiada siapa yang tahu dan apa yang saya harapkan kini adalah sokongan dari semua pihak saya memilih untuk melibatkan diri dalam teater ini bukanlah bertujuan untuk disanjung dan dipuja tetapi untuk membudayakan masyarakat hari ini tentang p ramlee
1497017 kerjasama yang diberikan oleh semua pihak ternyata memberi satu pengalaman baru buat saya untuk membuat lebih baik lagi untuk pementasan ini seandainya penonton menganggap saya adalah jelmaan p ramlee itu adalah penerimaan mereka kepada saya
1497018 apa yang buat saya gembira adalah segala perit jerih saya semuanya berbalas apabila menerima segala kritikan dan komen positif dari orang ramai
1497019 the miracle of ralstons survival has inspired him to greater adventures including skiing off the summit of denali one of the worlds most challenging mountains in june and to become a conservation activist to help protect the wild lands of utah and colorado
1497020 i set a two visit rule that is if someone came to check us out and i knew they came from another church id invite them out and have what has become affectionately known as the talk during the talk id make sure i mentioned a few things heres a sampling
1497021 i just want you to know that were not a church were a mission to denver i dont feel any compulsion to feed you spiritually but i will look after your spiritual formation i believe you wont grow unless you live like jesus lived and try to do what he did with people this mission probably has nothing to offer you however im interested in finding out if god brought you to us and what your part in serving this city might be
1497022 i bring this up more as motivation for us in the states nothing holds us back no one is threatening our existence if the evangelical movement dies out in the next 25 years which it is on pace to do its going to be no ones fault but our own
1497023 oh we might not get paid oh we might not get the respect of our peers oh we may have to work a normal job oh our denominational leaders may belittle us
1497024 as the father has sent me i now send you
1497025 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1497026 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaida something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1497027 the notion that the white house directed anyone to forge a letter from habbush to saddam hussein is absurd
1497028 we know now that those estimates were wrong but they were the estimates we all relied on
1497029 regardless military force in iraq was used because saddam hussein defiantly failed to comply with the 17 un security council resolutions iraq was subject to
1497030 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from cia ever involved in any such effort
1497031 it is well established that at my direction cia resisted efforts on the part of some in the administration to paint a picture of iraqi al qaida connections that went beyond the evidence
1497032 the notion that i would suddenly reverse our stance and have created and planted false evidence that was contrary to our own beliefs is ridiculous
1497033 if they go in the other direction i think theyre probably going to have to start firing people

1497134 our love waited 40 years for this day 4 13 1968 6 17 2008
1497135 i changed my last name to roberts in 1975 to make a statement about same sex marriage so weve been fighting this fight for years
1497136 we went to an attorney and said is there anyplace in the world where we can get married he said you pay me and ill check it out he checked all the countries he could find and came back and said basically no he said why dont one of you adopt the other i said no i wont accept that because thats hierarchical and our relationship is equal
1497137 we were very open about our sexuality because we knew that if we were closeted it would destroy us either physically or mentally
1497138 in 1975 we went all the way to the corporate office of ibm about discrimination in the workplace for gays and lesbians we were in milwaukee a very conservative city but as a result of that the next year we were transferred after both being promoted to headquarters located in atlanta as a gay couple it was the first transfer in the history of the corporation treated the same as that of a married couple
1497139 then two years later we were transferred again as a gay couple to san francisco we kept working on this all our careers and finally in the late 90s ibm announced that they would do domestic partner equal benefits so it was a long haul and it cost us professionally but it was well worth it were very proud of the accomplishments that ended up by our work
1497140 we knew that we had to be the best employees that we could be because otherwise they couldve terminated us for non performance
1497141 i think we pissed off a lot of people at ibm but we were exceptional employees for example at one time during my career i think ibm had a total worldwide employee count of 300 000 and at that time i was one of the top seven systems engineers in the united states they couldnt get rid of us so that gave us the opportunity to fight for equal rights
1497142 i have to be careful because there are friend and foe out there
1497143 so i have to be more cautious i wish i could go out there with a ballcap and glasses
1497144 then it felt like you were doing something that you shouldnt be doing but you knew it was right this time we have permission to do it
1497145 it was amazing but we knew then that there was something missing
1497146 but theres a chance it could be taken away in november everybody needs to get out and vote
1497147 we wish all the best to everyone here today but the question on the table is one of basic democracy
1497148 theres something special about the union of a husband and wife
1497149 one judge elected george w bush does that bother you
1497150 there have been some good performances over the last few weeks
1497151 i felt we were really good against southampton we got a great win against porto and the feyenoord game was excellent the different formation worked well against feyenoord weve used it in a few games now and the boys looked comfortable with it the shape was good and against certain opposition especially in europe it could be really useful
1497152 and the midfield were able to get good balls into the strikers and into me as well you dont want to go overboard about the result because it was just a pre season game but there was a lot of heart to be taken from that performance
1497153 that might be true but at celtic we play every game to win it its what expected
1497154 i always like playing against premiership sides you always want to test yourself against that quality of opposition some people say the premiership is the best league in the world and it will be sides of that standard that well come up against in the champions league this season
1497155 it was a big lesson for me and for them
1497156 they had two shots in the second half and scored once we had three times as many chances and didnt kill them off do that in the premier league and opponents will kill us
1497157 wherever ive coached in the world the players have said i like scolari because he is a true man and speaks honestly to you i will remain that way until my last day at chelsea if i need to say something to a player i will say it to his face i said some things in that meeting that the players had not heard from me before
1497158 trust in certain positions and those i cannot rely upon
1497159 i talk to them in training every day and tell them im always here to help
1497160 they have been affected by what happened last year but i will help lift their heads
1497161 chelsea want to be at a higher level than they are now
1497162 ive known ars ne wenger for 10 years and i like martin oneill
1497163 i like the way he is on the sidelines and the players like him too i have also heard the players saying many good things about harry redknapp at portsmouth
1497164 i know juande ramos and rafael ben tez a little and ferguson because when i was with portugal we talked about cristiano ronaldo and whether he was coming to the national team or not whether he was injured or not
1497165 ive met roman two or three times no more and hes a normal quiet reserved person
1497166 when we first spoke about the job we met only once all he wanted to know was how i play football what system i use if i thought chelsea had a good team and who id want to buy what they need is a coach to develop young players and i think i am that coach if were doing well and winning things we can introduce one or two more players into the first team i need that strong base that winning mentality and then i can bring young players in im sure if i am still at chelsea in two years time there will be three or four young players in the first group
1497167 if he has anything to do with this i gotta know
1497168 and what if things get out of hand going after him could have serious repercussions for all of us
1497169 i hope youre not thinking about doing anything stupid here
1497170 boy you sure picked the wrong guy to jump now turn around and go home to your mother
1497171 my mother tried to kill me you pathetic meat bag
1497172 so youre not afraid of firearms but maybe you ought to reconsider that cos this weapon can blow a hole through your head boy believe me ive seen it first hand
1497173 your gun isnt the one i should be afraid of
1497174 hmm i really like these weapons machine guns are so mechanical and cumbersome shotguns are heavy and inaccurate but pistols theyre small and they get the job done you can even silence them
1497175 well im glad youre enjoying yourself but we need to get him out of here help me get him in the car
1497176 nice car these fbi agents sure dont skimp do they
1497177 i have done this because i believe you have something that is of great value to me
1497178 what i dont i dont know what youre talking about
1497179 what what the hell are you doing were on the same side
1497180 oh i seriously doubt that derek told me all about your little vendetta against the machines thats how i know you took her and i hope for your sake shes still in one piece
1497181 im going to make this easy on you give her back to me or my friend here will do what he does best
1497182 listen i have no idea what youre talking about but whatever has happened whoever has been stolen from you i can help you find her if you let me go i swear youll have my word as an fbi agent that ill do whatever it takes to find your friend
1497183 liar you are the one behind this all theres no other explanation for her disappearance its you youre behind it and you will tell me what youve done with cameron
1497184 ill give you three guesses but youre only gonna need one
1497185 maybe we ought to ask the metal he might know where johns disappeared to
1497186 no hes gone too i think they went out together
1497187 i know what its like to be in your position i was tortured once by this guy here no less so believe me when i tell you i understand your pain now do yourself a favour and tell me what i want to know
1497188 you youre crazy ive told you over and over i have no idea who this cameron is or what happened to her
1497189 youre lying again why must you continue to play difficult why can you not just admit to what youve done why wont you give her back to me
1497190 john ive tried a variety of techniques hes resisted each one and i doubt anything else i do would work
1497191 my god youre one of them you work with the machines
1497192 i work with this one and technically he wasnt a machine to begin with but the other one im looking for cameron shes the real deal and a special one at that so im going to ask you for the last time where is she
1497193 how can i answer a question that i dont possess the answer to
1497194 say another word and ill put one right in your eye socket
1497195 fine kill him then but its not going to help anyone
1497196 john what the hell are you doing hes a federal agent are you crazy
1497197 i cant make it stop mom no matter what i do i cant make it stop
1497198 no john he doesnt okay cameron left you that is the only explanation she abandoned you
1497199 maybe because she knew that staying with you would hurt you more in the long run maybe she wanted you to have a chance at a normal life
1497200 but ill never have a normal life she was the only mom i loved her i no
1497201 we have reached tipping point with regards to dissent and have to now say enough is enough
1497202 it will be hard to change this culture in our sport but weve got to be consistent in our attempts to do so
1497203 captains are being asked to make our job easier but what if theyre the ones causing dissent in the first place
1497204 but having been involved in the pilot i know the programme can succeed its up to everyone involved to make that happen
1497205 i am not jose mourinho so why should people compare me with him
1497206 maybe if mourinho says he will win and then afterwards he doesnt that might cause problems because the manager is not playing its the players out on the pitch so if you say that and they make a mistake then you have to say its their fault
1497207 i want to make chelsea loved around the world like barcelona and manchester united its a surprise when people say chelsea are unpopular because when we went to china they cried for chelsea they loved chelsea its a big surprise people dont like us in england but chelsea is a club that is a growing name before it was real madrid barcelona manchester united milan our history is not the same and you cant make history in two three or even 10 years but maybe in 20 or 50 years chelsea will be on that level
1497208 i remember the great clubs that won the european cup back to back and that is the gauntlet that we have thrown down to ourselves
1497209 we want to become a really great team if we can get back to that final again and win it again then we can start talking about being a really great team
1497210 as of now we are a team that has been successful but we still have a lot more to give the manager has spoken to us about it but he didnt need to as the players understand clubs like madrid and milan and bayern have won it many times and if we can get our name up with them then we know we are a very great team you will be one of the best if not the best teams of your era and there can be no better incentive than that
1497211 ryan giggs told the players after the final that he had had to wait nine years for his second champions league final and i thought straight away that i have not got nine years to wait
1497212 i want to get there and touch that trophy as soon as possible i was sat in the dressing room after the final with michael carrick and owen hargreaves and we said to each other that this was too good to be true and that we wanted to achieve it again as soon as possible we all said that we had to get back there again
1497213 we have to do what we did last season but better
1497214 we have young players like anderson nani wayne rooney and cristiano ronaldo these guys are all young and talented and all have much to give they wont reach their peak for a few years yet and so they have more to give us i am sure as players that they will be looking at what they did last season and think that they can improve on it and the club will facilitate that
1497215 we will try to be wiser we need to show people we are still the gunners and can win the title
1497216 it was difficult for me personally to see my team mates losing points when he was injured after the chelsea game but it was not just me everything changes players have to play in what is not their right positions and it is really difficult when you have to change things
1497217 i am very happy because until now i have not been playing for five months so it is great to be back we have been getting better and better we are playing quite well and have won against a top team like real
1497218 we showed everyone we can still play well even if we have lost some players now we have to win the title we play to win everything and we will try to do it
1497219 samir nasri is a very good player and we are lucky to have signed him i have played alongside him in the french team and i know he will find his place in the arsenal team i think he can do it and will show everyone he can play very well
1497220 everyone the fans as well are all very happy he is a very good player and it is important for us to keep him

1497437 this very thing that you have spoken i will do for you have found favor in my sight and i know you by name
1497438 do not be afraid mary for you have found favor with god and behold you will conceive in your womb and bear a son and you shall call his name jesus he will be great and will be called the son of the most high and the lord god will give to him the throne of his father david and he will reign over the house of jacob for ever and of his kingdom there will be no end
1497439 behold i am the handmaid of the lord let it be to me according to your word
1497440 for i am the least of the apostles unfit to be called an apostle because i persecuted the church of god but by the grace of god i am what i am and his grace toward me was not in vain on the contrary i worked harder than any of them though it was not i but the grace of god which is with me
1497441 for we are his workmanship created in christ jesus for good works which god prepared beforehand that we should walk in them
1497442 do not fear the king of babylon of whom you are afraid do not fear him says the lord for i am with you to save you and to deliver you from his hand
1497443 when i am afraid i put my trust in thee
1497444 do not fear only believe and she shall be well
1497445 trust in the lord with all your heart and do not rely on your own insight in all your ways acknowledge him and he will make straight your paths
1497446 may grace and peace be multiplied to you in the knowledge of god and of jesus our lord his divine power has granted to us all things that pertain to life and godliness through the knowledge of him who called us to his own glory and excellence by which he has granted to us his precious and very great promises that through these you may escape from the corruption that is in the world because of passion and become partakers of the divine nature
1497447 when the water in the skin was gone she cast the child under one of the bushes then she went and sat down over against him a good way off about the distance of a bowshot for she said let me not look upon the death of the child and as she sat over against him the child lifted up his voice and wept
1497448 and god heard the voice of the lad and the angel of god called to hagar from heaven and said to her what troubles you hagar fear not for god has heard the voice of the lad where he is arise lift up the lad and hold him fast with your hand for i will make him a great nation then god opened her eyes and she saw a well of water and she went and filled the skin with water and gave the lad a drink and god was with the lad and he grew up he lived in the wilderness and became an expert with the bow
1497449 so he the king of syria sent there to dothan horses and chariots and a great army and they came by night and surrounded the city when the servant of the man of god rose early in the morning and went out behold an army with horses and chariots was round about the city
1497450 fear not for those who are with us are more than those who are with them
1497451 then elisha prayed and said o lord i pray thee open his eyes that he may see so the lord opened the eyes of the young man and he saw and behold the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about elisha
1497452 i say to you rise take up your pallet and go home
1497453 seek the lord and his strength seek his presence continually remember the wonderful works that he has done his miracles and the judgments he uttered
1497454 trust in the lord and do good that you may dwell in the land and live secure find your delight in the lord who will give you your hearts desire commit your way to the lord trust that god will act psalms 37 3 5
1497455 for i know the plans i have for you says the lord plans for welfare and not for evil to give you a future and a hope jeremiah 29 11
1497456 behold i send you out as sheep in the midst of wolves so be wise as serpents and innocent as doves
1497457 if we are sheep we overcome if wolves we are overcome
1497458 the man moses was very meek more than all men that were on the face of the earth
1497459 my grace is sufficient for you for my power is made perfect in weakness
1497460 conduct ourselves wisely toward outsiders making the most of the time
1497461 let our speech always be gracious seasoned with salt so that we may know how we ought to answer every one
1497462 always be prepared to make a defense to any one who calls us to account for the hope that is in us yet do it with gentleness and reverence
1497463 for it is not you who speak but the spirit of your father speaking through you
1497464 finally all of you have unity of spirit sympathy love of the brethren a tender heart and a humble mind
1497465 what is my perceptions of god am i like balaam do i follow in his ways his teachings his error
1497466 you shall not go with them you shall not curse the people for they are blessed numbers 22 12
1497467 stand in his way as his adversary numbers 22 22
1497468 then balaam said to the angel of the lord i have sinned for i did not know that thou didst stand in the road against me
1497469 go with the men but only the word which i bid you that shall you speak numbers 22 35
1497470 but i have a few things against you you have some there who hold the teaching of balaam who taught balak to put a stumbling block before the sons of israel that they might eat food sacrificed to idols and practice immorality revelation 2 14
1497471 have you ever asked god for something knowing that his word or his church does not allow it
1497472 pride goes before destruction and a haughty spirit before a fall proverbs 16 18
1497473 let your light so shine before men so that they may see your good works and give glory to your father who is in heaven
1497474 be you therefore perfect even as your heavenly father is perfect
1497475 yet in such a way that god is understood to be perfect as god and the soul to be perfect as a soul
1497476 for this is the will of god your sanctification that you abstain from unchastity
1497477 but i say walk by the spirit and do not gratify the desires of the flesh for the desires of the flesh are against the spirit and the desires of the spirit are against the flesh for these are opposed to each other to prevent you from doing what you would
1497478 examine yourselves to see whether you are holding to your faith test yourselves do you not realize that jesus christ is in you unless indeed you fail to meet the test
1497479 ask and it will be given you seek and you will find knock and it will be opened to you for every one who asks receives and he who seeks finds and to him who knocks it will be opened
1497480 finally brethren whatever is true whatever is honorable whatever is just whatever is pure whatever is lovely whatever is gracious if there is any excellence if there is anything worthy of praise think about these things
1497481 to the pure all things are pure but to the corrupt and unbelieving nothing is pure their very minds and consciences are corrupted
1497482 let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in thy sight o lord my rock and my redeemer
1497483 is the activity under consideration pleasing to my heavenly father
1497484 would i feel comfortable inviting jesus to participate with me in this activity
1497485 thou dost keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on thee because he trusts in thee trust in the lord for ever for the lord god is an everlasting rock
1497486 all things are lawful for me but not all things are helpful all things are lawful for me but i will not be enslaved by anything
1497487 you have been told o man what is good and what the lord requires of you only to do right and to love goodness and to walk humbly with your god
1497488 clothe yourselves all of you with humility toward one another for
1497489 1 peter 5 5 6 achieving excellence entails doing more than just what is required but to reach out beyond good enough
1497490 who is this uncircumcised philistine in any case that he should insult the armies of the living god
1497491 you come against me with sword and spear and scimitar but i come against you in the name of the lord of hosts the god of the armies of israel that you have insulted today the lord shall deliver you into my hand i will strike you down and cut off your head this very day i will leave your corpse and the corpses of the philistine army for the birds of the air and the beasts of the field thus the whole land shall learn that israel has a god all this multitude too shall learn that it is not by sword or spear that the lord saves for the battle is the lords and he shall deliver you into our hands
1497492 but one thing i do forgetting what lies behind and straining forward to what lies ahead i press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of god in christ jesus
1497493 but by the grace of god i am what i am and his grace toward me was not in vain on the contrary i worked harder than any of them though it was not i but the grace of god which is with me
1497494 i have fought the good fight i have finished the race i have kept the faith
1497495 prize of the upward call of god in christ jesus
1497496 no seas culero pls pon esta imagen en el blog
1497497 the survivors there in the province who escaped exile are in great trouble and shame the wall of jerusalem is broken down and its gates are destroyed by fire
1497498 do you not know that your body is a temple of the holy spirit within you which you have from god you are not your own you were bought with a price so glorify god in your body
1497499 he who dwells in the shelter of the most high who abides in the shadow of the almighty
1497500 finally brethren whatever is true whatever is honorable whatever is just whatever is pure whatever is lovely whatever is gracious if there is any excellence if there is anything worthy of praise think about these things
1497501 renounce irreligion and worldly passions and to live sober upright and godly lives in this world
1497502 do not love the world or the things in the world if any one loves the world love for the father is not in him for all that is in the world the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the father but is of the world and the world passes away and the lust of it but he who does the will of god abides for ever
1497503 i will no longer talk much with you for the ruler of this world is coming
1497504 be sober be watchful your adversary the devil prowls around like a roaring lion seeking someone to devour
1497505 though we live in the world we are not carrying on a worldly war for the weapons of our warfare are not worldly but have divine power to destroy strongholds we destroy arguments and every proud obstacle to the knowledge of god and take every thought captive to obey christ
1497506 the lord is faithful he will strengthen you and guard you from evil
1497507 no temptation has overtaken you that is not common to man god is faithful and he will not let you be tempted beyond your strength but with the temptation will also provide the way of escape that you may be able to endure it
1497508 fear not stand firm and see the salvation of the lord which he will work for you today for the egyptians whom you see today you shall never see again the lord will fight for you and you have only to be still

1497518 en el mundo de la prensa ha aparecido un nuevo medio que es el virtual
1497519 el problema que tiene la sociedad y no s lo los medios ahora mismo es poder distinguir lo verdadero de lo falso

1497532 in an era of films shot against green screens and fixed in post where have the iconic creatures gone
1497533 screamland is a love letter to old hollywood using monstrous metaphors while not whitewashing over any of the ugly bits the characters fall into unattended convention signings failed romances and dot com busts is only the beginning of the story
1497534 beautiful brilliant brutally hilarious and hilariously brutal i wish my first comic was this good
1497535 cover it up hide the truth let more kids get autism but we sure wouldnt give those shots to our kids
1497536 im taking norway to court to see that im getting everything i have a right to
1497537 he has no id papers he cannot come and go as he pleases he has no economic or social rights in this country instead he is in virtual house arrest without the means to support himself or his family
1497538 the suggestion that he cannot get medical care is untrue everyone in norway whether they are here legally or not has the right to emergency funds from social services and emergency medical assistance in krekars case he doesnt qualify for emergency money because he has a wife that works earning an income for the family
1497539 krekar is being treated well many other countries intern people who are to be expelled
1497540 i was wondering where you were i thought that was you i didnt think you were this bold

1497544 i had 13 birdies and an eagle over two rounds at the classic after hitting my first shot into the driving range
1497545 smith got on in two and had a 20 foot putt for eagle
1497546 my second shot went right of the bunker and i hit a good chip that went eight feet past
1497547 repatriation is pretty much a death sentence in some of these cases
1497548 ive seen patients bundled onto the plane and out of the country and once that person is out of sight hes out of mind
1497549 what that does for us it puts a strain on our system where were unable to provide adequate care for our own citizens
1497550 an alternative choice for the care of the unfunded latin american nationals
1497551 weve done flights to lithuania poland honduras guatemala and mexico
1497552 but out of about a dozen cases a year we probably fly only a couple back
1497553 i can think of three different scenarios that would have led to a fatal outcome if they had moved her
1497554 the good outcome today is due to the treatment that the hospital provided reluctantly and sadly enough only in response to legal and public pressure
1497555 he didnt talk he didnt understand anything he stayed curled up in a ball but he was alive
1497556 i said sure what can come of such a case
1497557 then it took on a life of its own they probably regret they ever called me
1497558 the question to be answered is if the patients condition is terminal
1497559 we arrived for a visit and he said to me you are montejo
1497560 the real problem is if we find an underlying problem and now we have six of them six patients who showed up in renal failure and that we are now seeing three times a week for dialysis
1497561 a community hospital is going to give care but is it the right thing we have a lot of american citizens who need our help we only make about 3 percent over our bottom line if were lucky we need to make capital improvements and do things for our community
1497562 or the government should step in and otherwise exercise its authority for deportation or whatever it wants to do
1497563 and if the rehab worked then luis might have become a functional person and nobodys charge
1497564 once you take that step for how long are you going to do that a year 10 years 50 years
1497565 informed us of how expensive it was becoming to care for luis given that there was no insurance and that he is illegal and that the state wont assume responsibility for his charges
1497566 if a hospital in florida asks if we can take care of a guatemalan patient the tendency is to say yes
1497567 this case is not simply a case as some would try and paint it of money this is a case about care for a man in this country illegally who has reached maximum medical improvement at our hospital and is ready to be discharged and whose home government
1497568 your honor this is a case about a hospital that has failed to do its job properly
1497569 why are you sad when you have basically everything that could be offered to you
1497570 as aquinas once stated the good is not the enemy of the perfect
1497571 we went to see him at the hospital and his bed was empty
1497572 that facility could have taken care of me any day
1497573 telling everyone that he was from miami florida and showing them his toy cat
1497574 that he would be staying with his new friends in guatemala and that i was leaving
1497575 its the same as the classic fall on the stairs right
1497576 you go to my home you fall on my stairs and then you sue me i am responsible
1497577 how could i possibly have given him what he needs
1497578 he was lying in the hallway on a stretcher covered in his own excrement
1497579 so we cleaned him up and we brought him home
1497580 its a letter that says listen dont take action to dump this individual because youll be risking legal action
1497581 should they win we would like them to take those damages and pay his hospital bill
1497582 they chose the wrong way to deal with it the right way would have been through the legislature there is no program in place to appropriately distribute care to undocumented persons who are catastrophically injured and there should be but you dont stick a brain injured immigrant on a private plane and spirit him out of the country in the predawn hours
1497583 the first striking thing was his disposition he was very very happy
1497584 then the second thing he was well cared for what i did was i got down over him and hugged him but also smelled and there were no bedsores nothing was malodorous
1497585 i said his quality of life is better than it would be in an american nursing home
1497586 but i hazarded a guess that his longevity of existence was probably severely curtailed
1497587 there was no real compelling reason to think of bringing him back to florida
1497588 we needed to focus on getting help to him or him to help in guatemala
1497589 for many years i am caring for him like he is a baby changing his diaper washing him but this is worse i am worried to leave him alone at all
1497590 the day my mother is no longer whats going to happen to me
1497591 i headed north like a peasant with a heavy bundle on his back bent over determined to better himself
1497592 other people had things so i thought why not me but now i regret it maybe god was punishing me for my illusions
1497593 thats the usual story of patients that are released from the national orthopedic hospital
1497594 in cases like that if you cut the medical care youre hurting that person
1497595 youre doing just the opposite of what the medical system should do that goes against every international convention of human rights and health to send him to guatemala was to send him to very poor living and health conditions and probably he will die because of that and thats not fair
1497596 it would be possible to set up a good health care arrangement for him because in private practice we have all types of specialties that he needs
1497597 i am sending you some little things luis i hope that you like them
1497598 that we miss you and love you a lot may god continue to bless you
1497599 the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
1497600 mr president former secretary of state colin powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
1497601 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
1497602 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
1497603 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective

1497654 did not start on 9 11 they began when the cold war ended a decade earlier
1497655 had caused the economic disaster or whether time was right that they had saved the world there was no denying that these unelected american officials were shaping the globalization debate
1497656 joe has been a technician on practically the whole project there might have been some misunderstandings in the norwegian media about his role it is me who is the producer joe s role is to know which buttons to push to create the sound that i want
1497657 i had nothing to say to them i just played the album loud and thought that if they they dont like it its their problem i am so sure about what we have done this time that i dont think about changing a single thing the door is closed and we are so much on the right path that we are not turning eother left or right on this but they thought it was really good
1497658 first it felt like a soccer team was trying to break down my door
1497659 when i think about what has been put down in terms of practicing travelling and twelve hour shifts its the moment before i check into a mental hospital i am completely drained in mind and body
1497660 one of tammies sisters witnessed it she was going to the site of the vigil and she came and told us there was another attack
1497661 later on in the evening we had officers stop that white van or one similar and we found four additional males in there and a handgun
1497662 the tragedy is that everyday is a blessing and to have this come at this time really is tragedy upon tragedy

1497845 we are satisfied that google is putting in place adequate safeguards to avoid any risk to the privacy or safety of individuals including the blurring of vehicle registration marks and the faces of anyone included in streetview images
1497846 although it is possible that in certain limited circumstances an image may allow the identification of an individual it is clear that google is keen to capture images of streets and not individuals
1497847 further there is an easy mechanism by which individuals can report an image that causes them concern to google and request that it is removed

1497854 i can attest to the fact that he did visit troops in iraq only four or five days earlier that there was no notice of it that i confirmed that it happened but they had no video of any type and no reporters and that hes been to walter reed so lets at least get that off the table
1497855 the sense that you know barack is not one of us hes just not a normal guy who would go see the wounded troops

1497877 and the shot that landed lindsay in the tabloids and back in rehab what kind of rehab is lindsay lohan looking forward to one hint its first class all the way thats coming up
1497878 unlike the troubled relationships of some young superstars britney spears and her mother lynne lindsay lohan and her mother dina kanye and his mother thrived in each others company

1497888 back together one more time for the last time with special guest appearances by antigua
1497889 we must stop fighting among ourselves if you see people fighting among themselves that means they are not clear on what they are supposed to do politics is not just a game but about what should be done
1497890 once you have identified what should be done then you find out who can do it the problem with our politics in uganda is that we are pre occupied with finding out who should do it instead of what should be done therefore those who spend a lot of time on the who should do it are confused and that is not politics
1497891 we did launch it fourth term bungokho is the founding sub county of the bamasaaba we as bangokho want him to stand again
1497892 after the peace talks i thought i would set an example my returning is not a betrayal of the lra cause it is time to come back home
1497893 my word to you is that you are welcome back to uganda help us convince the others to come back home the choice you have made is a correct one wherever you go home will always be the best
1497894 i have always said this country is ours and everybody has a right to live here if we have any problems we can solve them here i can assure you that after the grant of amnesty you will be free people feel free and you are welcome to start life afresh
1497895 i will use my presence here to convince those still in the bush to return home i will be the commissions ambassador
1497896 we were surprised when we received the information that some of these ex rebels were being kept by security agencies if you receive amnesty that means you are free if there are any other charges then they should be taken to court let this not confuse the public that when you get amnesty you get detained
1497897 define repository as part of the users author researcher learner workflow
1497898 i agree with this idea in the sense of take account of things users need to do but not in the sense that we can reduce the myriad functions of an he institution to a small set of flow charts and design repositories to fit those familiar processes and tools is a much better way of expressing it than workflow
1497899 im also wary of comments elsewhere from the likes of peter murray rust on this he warns my interpretation that we need to be careful of doing this as if it complicates the workflow it just wont happen
1497900 disagree the repository is a back end data provider that should not be part of the researchers learners workflow but the service which sits on top of the repository should be part of the workflow
1497901 i think the rrs you envisage sounds fantastic and would be a good thing what worries me is the function creep taking us a few miles on from some of the more basic simpler few keystrokes approach to repositories
1497902 seriously though the system youve sketched out is quite complicated not so much in the individual parts of it though several of those parts are quite substantial but in the design vision required to connect up all those features in a way that would be easy and natural to use can you identify a subset of parts that would make a useful version 1
1497903 the irony of the negative click philosophy is that it has led you to produce a visionary but significantly more complex system
1497904 allow the user fine grained disclosure access control to repository objects
1497905 the current repository technology is library cataloger centric items are uploaded usually by a cataloger not the author and most of the meta data is added by a subject specialist in this model the author as depositor is at best just an initiator for a deposit process
1497906 its not so much the repository itself that needs web2 0 but the range of the services which exploit that data
1497907 the repository should be able to participate in an interactive web it should be entirely possible for someone else to build a remote web 2 0 service around resource exposed in my repository this does not preclude me building such a service if i think i have sufficient mass of interested users etc but if i need to do this because only i can then i have probably just built another silo this is what i meant by my assertion that in general technorati offers us a better model than slideshare someone can build a better more focussed domain specific etc version of technorati if there is demand for this without needing to move or copy the resources in their source repositories blogs in this case
1497908 imo ideally a repo would be susceptible to all sorts of flickrish rss web api type manipulation sword like and who knows what else leading to total personalisation potential of the user experience otoh providing implementers and users with an acceptable out of the box ui that might include basic implementations of some voguish features and widgety ways to configure them cf flickr or wordpress is no bad thing either
1497909 i agree that persistence more or less as you define it here should be a core property of what i think of as a source repository
1497910 the repository library should provide support in the publishing process
1497911 a system to help streamline the editorial publication process is fine if we can persuade academics to use it but im not sure id start by building it on the repository maybe you could but there are other approaches as well
1497912 i see the point about the benefits but if we are solving problems our end users dont feel need solving then we have a much more difficult job on our hands and perhaps not substantially different from our current problems with getting researchers to put things into our repository
1497913 the availability of research via open access would increase if the same systems that provide open access also provided or were integrated with tools which support the authoring process
1497914 this is a variation of what peter murry rust proposed back in 07 google docs mixed with a cris
1497915 my experience is that feature requests of this sort are exactly the ones which end up in the

1497930 we cannot sign an alliance with other parties the best we can do is to cooperate in order to remove hindrances to democracy in this country
1497931 if we dont cooperate to democratically remove this oppressive regime ugandans may have to resort to other means to liberate themselves
1497932 jeema is willing to do whatever it takes in realising the prime goal of this cooperation which is liberating uganda from the nrm regime

1497938 sales have been rather robust this summer its kind of a combination of things i think certainly the gas prices lend into it traverse city is also a very cycle savvy community
1497939 we have a complete service department the interesting phenomenon there is its been quite busy in that some of the parts selling are vintage which would be an indicator of people grabbing their old iron horse out of the garage and getting it refurbished putting it into use instead of their automobiles
1497940 the indication of sales of fenders and racks means that guys in suit coats and ties are coming to work and dont want to have that black stripe up their back when they get there

1498023 for the most part certainly people are having to shop differently
1498024 foods that are typically less expensive like snack foods chips cookies sometimes those things are actually less expensive then some of our staple products especially now with the price of milk and eggs and cheese
1498025 however with the new market the new market conditions that were experiencing here were having an inflation factor of probably 7 percent per year
1498026 weve scaled down where we can and then we have to go back to the commissioners for additional funding from the county building construction fund
1498027 what was intended to be a four bay 15 000 square foot station has been scaled back to three bay 10 000 square feet
1498028 where we are now we wont reduce the level of service but it would restrict our ability to grow as the community grows out that way
1498029 you can imagine what 7 percent would do to you so were hoping we dont experience any unexpected delays in that

1498033 the ruling helps ensure that no public official will ever again take retirement funds except for their intended beneficiaries
1498034 basically the ruling is telling the governor and legislative leaders that in the future if you have a budget crisis like the one we faced back in 2001 that you cant raid the pension fund
1498035 its not within your power to do it even if theres a budget crisis
1498036 the city puts out a lot of information that residents can use to monitor the performance of local government so much information that unless you know exactly what youre looking for you will quickly drown in it

1498058 when you look at canadian society the way it has changed over the last 40 years it has changed dramatically especially when it comes to gender relations and these womens groups are largely responsible for that

1498236 untuk allah kitab nya rasul nya imam imam kaum muslimin dan kaum muslimin umumnya
1498237 nasehat adalah sebuah kata yang mengungkapkan suatu kalimat yang sempurna yaitu keinginan memberikan kebaikan kepada orang yang dinasehati makna tersebut tidak bisa diungkapkan hanya dengan satu kata sehingga harus bergabung dengannya kata yang lain
1498238 nasehat adalah sebuah kata yang jami luas maknanya yang berarti mengerahkan segala yang dimiliki demi kebaikan orang yang dinasihati ia merupakan sebuah kata yang ringkas namun luas maknanya tidak ada satu kata pun dalam bahasa arab yang bisa mengungkapkan makna dari kata nasehat ini kecuali bila digabung dengan kata lain
1498239 maksudnya adalah bahwa tiang yang menyangga urusan agama ini adalah nasehat dengannya agama ini akan tegak dan kuat
1498240 boleh jadi kalimat ini bermakna mubalaghah melebihkan suatu perkara maksudnya bahwa sebagian besar agama ini isinya adalah nasehat ini serupa dengan hadits bisa jadi pula bermakna sebagaimana lahirnya lafal tersebut yakni tidak lain agama ini adalah nasehat karena setiap amalan yang dilakukan oleh seseorang tanpa ikhlas maka hal itu bukan termasuk bagian agama
1498241 hakekat idhafah penyandaran nasehat kepada allah sebenarnya kembali kepada hamba itu sendiri karena allah tidak membutuhkan nasehat manusia
1498242 dan termasuk dalam makna nasehat bagi mereka adalah shalat di belakang mereka berjihad bersama mereka menyerahkan shadaqah shadaqah kepada mereka tidak memberontak dan mengangkat pedang senjata terhadap mereka baik ketika mereka berlaku zhalim maupun adil tidak terpedaya dengan pujian dusta terhadap mereka dan mendoakan kebaikan untuk mereka semua itu dilakukan bila yang dimaksud dengan para imam adalah para khalifah atau para penguasa yang menangani urusan kaum muslimin dan inilah yang masyhur
1498243 dan bisa juga ditafsirkan bahwa yang dimaksud dengan para imam adalah para ulama dan nasehat bagi mereka berarti menerima periwayatan mereka mengikuti ketetapan hukum mereka tentu selama mengikuti dalil serta berbaik sangka husnu zh zhan kepada mereka
1498244 aku menyampaikan amanat amanat tuhanku kepada kalian dan aku ini hanyalah pemberi nasehat yang terpercaya bagimu
1498245 maka shalih berkata hai kaumku sesungguhnya aku telah menyampaikan kepadamu amanat tuhanku dan aku telah memberi nasehat kepadamu tetapi kamu tidak menyukai orang orang yang memberi nasehat
1498246 memberi nasehat itu hukumnya fardhu kifayah yang telah cukup bila ada sebagian orang yang melakukannya dan gugur dosa atas yang lain
1498247 nasehat adalah suatu keharusan menurut kemampuan masing masing apabila si pemberi nasehat tahu bahwa nasehatnya akan diterima dan perintahnya akan dituruti serta aman dari perkara yang tidak disukainya yang akan menyakitinya adapun jika dia khawatir akan menyebabkan bahaya yang mencelakakan dirinya maka dalam hal ini ada kelapangan baginya wallahu alam
1498248 dan ia nasehat terbagi menjadi dua ada yang fardhu wajib dan ada yang nafilah sunnah dianjurkan

1498278 i think there has been significant improvement in this gold sector i noticed on the wall separating this area of sadr city from the rest of the city there are still signs of heavy fighting and the general conditions in sadr city are poor and that basic services are not widely available
1498279 however ill say that these units that are coming in are making a dramatic improvement and you can see that in the amount of traffic a lot of the shop owners are moving back in the security situation has improved greatly at least this area where we have coalition forces
1498280 to keep me from becoming conceited because of these surpassingly great revelations there was given me a thorn in my flesh a messenger of satan to torment me three times i pleaded with the lord to take it away from me but he said to me my grace is sufficient for you for my power is made perfect in weakness therefore i will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses so that christs power may rest on me that is why for christs sake i delight in weaknesses in insults in hardships in persecutions in difficulties for when i am weak then i am strong

1498437 we have to understand first of all that the serb population left their homes before the croatian army took over so it is very difficult to defend the view that the croatian army drove out the serbs this was very different from prijedor visegrad and other places that are synonyms for the bosnian genocide

1498467 the people who can affect the price of oil would prefer a republican presidential candidate watch the price of oil if it goes down which it may very well it could help john mccain quite a bit
1498468 its not only obamas youth eloquence and energy that have stolen hearts across the atlantic obama has raised expectations of a chance for the nation to redeem itself in the role that europe has loved respected and relied upon
1498469 the 200 000 plus crowd confirmed his rock star status and his more cooperative sounding rhetoric was what the crowd wanted to hear
1498470 mr obamas weeklong tour of war zones and foreign capitals is noteworthy because it is so unusual to see a presidential candidate act so presidential overseas
1498471 how can you given the passion that you feel about this issue turn down the idea that you could be in the administration as a vice president or as an energy czar or as both
1498472 president clinton played to the center not the left in selecting ruth bader ginsburg and stephen g breyer
1498473 sen obama is not just tacking gently toward the center hes lurching right when it suits him hes zigging with the kind of reckless abandon thats guaranteed to cause disillusion if not whiplash
1498474 im thrilled with this obamas strength in the northeast the west coast and the great lakes
1498475 however you feel about her politics i feel that sen clinton received some of the most unfair hostile coverage ive ever seen
1498476 if theres anything we need to rescue us from the last eight years its brains good judgment and experience obama has the first two gore has all three
1498477 in victory and in defeat michelle obama had always been there dressed as brightly as her husbands smile
1498478 as the equal rights amendment faded as a cause and conservatism made a comeback republican spouses became ever more careful to stay three steps behind their men and the times
1498479 i have fundamental differences with john mccain on the issues and always have i dont have any problem criticizing john mccain
1498480 obama is something special a man who makes difficult tasks look easy who seems to touch millions of diverse people with a message of hope that somehow doesnt sound pollyannaish
1498481 ive been covering presidential campaigns since 1960 i have always said i have never seen the media as much entranced by a candidate than when they were in my very first campaign in 1960 when they were for jfk but im telling you right now the enchantment with obama beats the jfk syndrome
1498482 my message to democratic lawmakers is this if youre really for increased american energy production then prove it by putting it in writing
1498483 but if you feel you have the better arguments why not give a straight up or down vote for drilling
1498484 because the misrepresentation is being made that this is going to reduce the price at the pump
1498485 a full amendment process that grants the minority the right to offer its alternatives
1498486 theyll have to use their imagination as to how they can get a vote
1498487 i have said and in fact supported a congressional resolution that said we should suspend putting more oil into the strategic oil reserve

1498490 perhaps third party developers should attempt to integrate more tabs and or filters within a friendfeed client why not have tabs or filters for each of the following blogging activity news activity social networking activity multimedia activity shopping activity comment activity and more
1498491 the interface should allow users to properly and intuitively manage display and sort comments
1498492 finally the person or people who decide to make the ultimate friendfeed client should find ways to extend friendfeeds uses honestly now who knew that twitter was going to be a popular service to track packages and calculate mpg rates who knew that it would turn the everyday person into a reporter who knew that it would be one of the most dominant marketing tools today who knew that it would change the world friendfeeds third party developers should apply all this knowledge to their creations

1498503 we believe that our data add to those from previous studies showing a causal relationship between h pylori infection and gastric cancer and also support the use of h pylori eradication to prevent the development of gastric cancer
1498504 preventing gastric cancer by eradicating h pylori in high risk regions should be a priority
1498505 this result adds to our understanding of the relationship between h pylori and stomach cancer and to the debate on how we should treat people with this infection
1498506 nelle ultime settimane si sentito molto parlare della situazione drammatica della campania e del problema rifiuti che esploso a napoli e nei comuni limitrofi
1498507 la risposta molto semplice esiste un piano rifiuti che la giunta saitta della provincia di torino ha proposto e che il consiglio provinciale ha approvato e modificato in questi anni che risponde al problema rifiuti sono previsti due termovalorizzatori uno nella zona nord e uno nella zona sud della provincia e si chiesto un sacrificio ai nostri cittadini chiedendo a tutti il massimo impegno per la raccolta differenziata raggiungendo risultati in termini percentuali molto alti e proprio perch i cittadini della provincia di torino hanno dimostrato impegno e sacrificio ad accettare le discariche e i termovalorizzatori impegnandosi a fondo sulla differenziata che oggi respingo la proposta di far arrivare rifiuti dalla campania non per mancanza di sensibilit ma il rischio che le quantit in arrivo possano far saltare lequilibrio e gli obiettivi previsti molto alto meglio non rischiare per non trovarci poi noi fra sei mesi a dover rispedire i nostri rifiuti in qualche altra regione
1498508 the nissan 1400 bakkie forms the cornerstone on which nissans commercial reputation was built in south africa
1498509 the nissan 1400 is truly an icon in south africas motoring history and will be remembered for years to come as a true champion of africa
1498510 its a vehicle that has stood the test of time and one that has been with us through all the memorable historic events in south africa
1498511 nissan always knew that the 1400 bakkie enjoyed a solid reputation in the market place but looking back the unprecedented production run and loyal cult following that developed is a truly momentous story
1498512 the nissan 1400 bakkie has been a reliable partner to so many people in south africa and after nearly 40 years of production there are very few south africans who havent had some kind of encounter with the vehicle
1498513 many of its drivers talk about the 1400 bakkie as if it is a friend that you can rely on and trust anytime and anyplace we want to hear these incredible stories after all what better way to say farewell to this trusted workhorse than to hear the stories of those who have been so well served

1498518 theyre seeing bioblend as a natural expansion of their petroleum product lines
1498519 and most importantly theyre getting the products into the hands of their customers which is where the high performance and environmental benefits are recognized
1498520 weve always been on the leading edge of alternative fuels and green engineering the bioblend line just works perfectly with our traditional distribution patterns and with our companys philosophy
1498521 but nobody in our area was carrying these types of products our customers with elevator installations were immediately converted to bioblends hydraulic oil because its biodegradable in 28 days weve been very impressed with the rust penetrating oil and the 2 cycle oil also and our customers like the fact that bioblend products are american made

1498525 if the saudis need to buy 200 million worth of communications equipment for security they can but if we need to spend 1 million we have to squeeze and save
1498526 the opposition in this country does not believe we should be cooperating with the us in the war on terror

1498529 yemen has dealt with some of those affiliated with al qaeda because they say they are prepared to cooperate with the government and help fight other extremists
1498530 its yemens way but when it is necessary to confront them we are ready
1498531 there was a deal with the jihadis but its not working any more
1498532 now there are just fanatics who want to be hired by al qaeda people who have come back from iraq or afghanistan and have no skills who are not integrated into society and have no education they are brainwashed jihad is all they know
1498533 most young people have no prospects in life those fanatics offer them the illusion that they can take power and implement authentic islam and if they get killed they go to paradise its a win win situation for them
1498534 how the welfare state robs americans of money and spirit

1498536 i cannot undertake to lay my finger on that article of the constitution which granted a right to congress of expending on objects of benevolence the money of their constituents
1498537 the concept is still good connecting the dots of the bits and pieces of possible information is a good thing it just shouldnt be in a counterintelligence database
1498538 something like that a lot of people dont see as an opportunity i see as an opportunity to make something

1498550 it doesnt make me laugh at all sometimes theres someone you may be trying to become friends with or you may even be thinking about going out with the person but because of all that it can never get off the ground thats just a nuisance
1498551 they trusted in him and defied the kings command and were willing to give up their lives rather than serve or worship any god except their own god
1498552 i think it is very beautiful for the poor to accept their lot to share it with the passion of christ i think the world is being much helped by the suffering of the poor people
1498553 the idea of turning one billion people into consumers is terrifying
1498554 times view for the mehtas this is a very difficult time and our heart goes out to them itll be everyones prayer that the child is born without any serious complications and grows up healthy if the baby is normal the mehtas must not be blamed for seeking abortion after all they approached the court on the basis of medical evidence that suggested a congenital heart block at least they had the courage and the honesty to take the legal route instead of aborting illegally the mehtas for their part must put the legal battle behind them and focus on whats ahead there have been cases where children have been born out of extremely complicated pregnancies and gone on to lead normal lives also advances in medical science bring new hope every day
1498555 this was a court battle that had everything law medicine ethics religion and human drama

1498583 this is a clear case of abuse of power by the secretary general since what is meant is compliance with a fundamental decision of the un security council resolution 1244 comparing the text of the resolution with that of the un secretary generals report one can clearly see that his wording in a number of cases differs markedly from provisions of resolution 1244
1498584 does anyone think this culture will voluntarily transform to a sustainable way of living
1498585 the death of this great man one of the greatest thinkers writers and humanists of the 20 th century is an irreplaceable loss to russia and the entire world
1498586 the passing of solzhenitsyn is a heavy loss for all of russia as he was a literary giant and public activist who gave his life to serving his motherland and his people
1498587 weve become orphans unlike him we lack his moral vision we are not as diligent nor do we have the same moral integrity in fulfilling our missions in life for me solzhenitsyn was an example of courage mr lyubimov uses the word
1498588 it is an example for all of us to remember how held loved the truth his courage in expressing his point of view and we should live with his sense of internal dignity
1498589 the reason for such policies is clear the latvian and estonian governments are keen on preserving the current ethno exclusivist non democratic r gime that keeps them in power if russians get the right to vote in latvia and estonia the nationalist clique will lose their jobs their ideology is russophobic by nature they are attempting to glamorise those who killed russians that is the basis of our law suit

1498610 i thought i was very clever finding this place by following the map and working out how to get there but it turned out that brad wasnt listening to me and pretending that his gps couldnt find the place he said he did it to keep me occupied so i didnt bug him i think he just likes annoying me got there around 5 and thought it was shut it was open until 10pm and we only had to pay half price this was because of the summer august school holidays late opening times at this place you get to drive around and look around at the animals from the car most of the animals are just wandering around brad was very happy with that as he is too lazy to walk most of the time you arent allowed to get out of the car and for the non aggresive animals you can keep the windows open as soon as we drove through the gate i saw a rhinoceros as it was the biggest thing there i was very excited turns out we could buy food to feed the animals but we didnt realise earlier a zebra scared me by sticking his head through the window looking for food it was very cool i patted his nose it was dry saw some wolves tasmanian white wallabies white tigers cheetahs lions there was only one male lion for a bunch of females had to keep windows shut for those ones the coolest animals there were the wild african dogs they looked very pretty with big elephant ears and bright orange black coats they were very sneaky a pack of them surrounded a car in front of us while a couple of them stood in front so it wouldnt drive off the rest of them pulled off the mudguard and ran off the guy wasnt happy but the dogs were they were playing with it as we drove off one of them stood just outside our window and i really wanted to touch him but i didnt and a reindeer came to our window and licked my hand twice it wasnt a reindeer it was a deer some kind of deer then there were about 5 giraffes there was a big queue to see them the car in front of us had a sunroof open so the giraffe stuck his head through the roof and they feed them food wish we had some food to feed them giraffes are my favourite animals so i wanted one to come up to my window so i could pet him instead one came to brads window and brad got to pet his nose brad said he was very bristly i wasnt happy as i wanted to pet the giraffe as well so when a giraffe walked by i patted his leg he got scared and jumped and almost knocked the mirror off the car and the woman yelled through a megafone at me not to touch the giraffes legs and the rhinos scared me because if they charge at the car then they could easily turn it over as they were twice the size of the car which was pretty cool after driving through the park and looking at the animals we went to see all the rides and games they had in the other part of the park saw some reptiles and poisonous frogs which looked bright and interesting tried to win a soft toy by throwing a ball into some cups sucked so much the girl took pity on me and gave me 5 extra throws still only won a small one saw the sea lion show which was cool only the sea lions refused to jump or do tricks in the water which was funny one of them was very fat and looked like a worm he was doing funny tricks on the ground it was very cool and exciting wish i could have a pet giraffe on my farm

1498618 solzhenitsyn is no longer in fashion because of recent political upheavals simply put this man by his nature stands apart from all fashion although he is best known as a political writer hes closer to a religiously inspired moralist he critiqued the soviet dictatorship from a spiritual point of view not in the name of an alternative political ideology measured against the yardstick of solzhenitsyns ethical criteria neither the west nor the new russia has any worth for these reasons solzhenitsyn might be considered merely a grumpy old man or a perennial dissident no matter his attitude toward life one of coherence commands respect it was forged under trying circumstances and has certain things in common with the christian humanism of st augustine st thomas aquinas and edmund burke solzhenitsyn is a venerable prophet whose message exists beyond the passage of time the enthusiasm for him personally during the cold war was as strange as the disinterest in him today

1498626 living in the potters house this year has taught me so much about living for god and with others through living at the house i became connected with an amazing summer leadership training opportunity offered by the cco called the ocean city beach project ocbp the ocbp is designed to be a time of intense learning and development for students with a heart for the world and a passion for god twenty five college students from across the mid atlantic region and four cco staff will pursue life and god together ocbp is designed to better equip us as leaders and as disciples of christ for our time in college and the years beyond while at beach project i will be participating in bible studies worship a local job outreach to the community and getting to know the other students and staff i hope to bring what i learn this summer back to edinboro so i may better serve on the leadership team and prayer team of our campus ministry

1498628 we shall remember him as an strong and courageous man whose extensive literary output and public activity will forever remain an example of his selfless service to the people his motherland and the ideals of humanism
1498629 aleksandr solzhenitsyn rightfully has a place in the pantheon of world literature his indomitable spirit unshakeable ideals and a life filled with trials and tribulations made him a direct heir of fyodor dostoyevsky
1498630 first of all one realises the magnitude of solzhenitsyns personality he was an outstanding writer philosopher publicist and political warrior but not only that his personality left an indelible imprint on 20th century russian and world history it reminds me of the old russian proverb what is written by the pen cannot be cut down by the axe therefore no axe wielded with whatever power can cut down what was written by the pen of solzhenitsyn
1498631 for russians aleksandr solzhenitsyns departure from life means parting with a whole era where he had the role of a prophet and spiritual visionary solzhenitsyns stance changed the outlook of a whole generation of people blinded by the outward appearance of the soviet r gime
1498632 aleksandr solzhenitsyn was necessary as a symbol in todays world where guideposts have disappeared and one sees nothing but the degradation of moral values

1498646 achieved a 3 2 year on year rise in profits and jordanian based property developer mawared is hoping that it can also use the moroccan market to increase its profits from 2008 onwards
1498647 earlier this month the developer signed a massive joint venture with the largest state fund in morocco to develop projects in the likes of fez and tarfya in southern morocco the developments combine residential real estate and leisure based commercial properties into mainly tourism and international property buyer focused centres
1498648 mawared are not only banking on the fact that emaar have proved that property in morocco remains profitable but quite possibly they are banking on the impressive numbers coming out of the moroccan tourism market as well
1498649 the tourism sector generated in the region of 5 27 billion euros in 2007
1498650 a very significant and long term strategic part of this plan is to improve tourism numbers so that they reach an annual sustainable average of 10 million by 2010
1498651 since property became such an important part of the nations agenda for economic diversification and expansion foreign direct investments into property in morocco have reached 0 91 billion u s dollars from 245 million dollars back in 2002 whats more there has been an almost 33 increase in the numbers of jobs in the construction industry in the same period
1498652 analysts say indian workers who make up about 80 of the uaes construction workforce are shying away due to high inflation and the decreasing value of dirhams against a strong rupee fuelled by increasing disposable income and falling barriers qatar real estate market growth is sustainable
1498653 forecasts the current growth rates in the real estate market in qatar to be sustainable
1498654 the demand led price growth has been a reflection of the buoyant economic conditions in qatar until 2003 qatar gdp grew at a rate less than 8 p a
1498655 demand is outstripping supply in all the spheres of qatar real estate residential and commercial office retail hospitality and industrial segments residential demand for both freehold and leasehold residential units outstrips the supply in qatar however markaz expects the shortage ratio to narrow down going forward as it expects doha major housing market to see more supply of housing units by 2010 building permits issued to the residential sector have surged by 27 on a yoy basis in 2005

1498671 kebijakan globalisasi ekonomi sebagaimana dijalankan oleh bank dunia imf dan wto sesungguhnya jauh lebih banyak menciptakan kemiskinan ketimbang memberikan jalan keluar the international forum on globalization 2004 8 pada dasarnya globalisasi yang dimotori as merupakan proses menjadikan sistem ekonomi kapitalis ala amerika serikat sebagai sistem dominan di dunia dengan mengintegrasikan perekonomian lokal ke dalam tatanan perekonomian global melalui privatisasi pasar bebas dan mekanisme pasar pada semua perekomian negara negara di dunia ini berarti penghapusan semua batasan dan hambatan terhadap arus perpindahan barang modal dan jasa yang bersandar pada kekuatan pengaruh amerika serikat wto bank dunia dan imf tiada lain hanyalah alat untuk memaksakan kekuatan amerika serikat itu atas nama pasar bebas wto afta apec bank dunia imf negeri negeri muslim dipaksa membuka keran privatisasi yang luar biasa termasuk dengan menjual asset asset publik mereka kepada swasta asing baik dengan alasan untuk membayar utang maupun agar kompatibel dengan aturan aturan internasional di indonesia lembaga lembaga kreditor internasional tersebut melalui berbagai skema pinjaman luar negeri memainkan peran penting mendorong agenda privatisasi melalui keluarnya berbagai produk regulasi seperti uu sumber daya air uu migas uu penanaman modal hingga privatisasi bumn hasilnya saat ini investasi sektor minyak dan gas bumi misalnya sebanyak 85 4 persen dari 137 konsesi pengelolaan lapangan minyak dan gas bumi migas di indonesia dimiliki oleh perusahaan asing ini merupakan fakta bahwa penjajahan atau imperialisme merupakan metode baku thariqah negara kapitalis untuk menguasai negara lain yang berbeda hanya terbatas pada bentuk dan pola penjajahannya peran politik internasional sebuah negara sangat dipengaruhi oleh kekuataan negara tersebut negara yang lemah pasti tidak memiliki peran yang penting dalam konstelasi internasional negara itu hanya menjadi pengekor atau bahkan ditindas oleh negara yang kuat faktor utama yang membuat sebuah negara kuat adalah ideologi mabda nya tanpa ideologi atau menjadi pengikut ideologi asing sebuah negara akan menjadi lemah faktanya semua negara adidaya atau yang pernah menjadi negara adidaya pasti merupakan negara yang dibangun di atas satu ideologi tertentu misalnya uni sovyet sebelum runtuh dengan ideologi sosialisme komunisnya as dengan ideologi kapitalisme sekularnya dan khilafah islamiyah pada masa lalu dengan ideologi islamnya ideologi adalah faktor utama yang membuat sebuah negara menjadi kuat sehingga mampu berperan secara dominan dalam percaturan politik internasional sementara negara negara muslim saat ini justru meninggalkan islam sebagai ideologi sehingga secara ekonomi dan politik mereka di bawah hegemoni baca jajahan as dan sekutunya karena itu untuk kembali berperan dalam konstelasi internasional serta membebaskan diri dari penjajahan militer politik dan ekonomi maka umat islam harus kembali menegakkan khilafah islamiyah yang menjadikan islam sebagai ideologi sekaligus dasar negaranya negara semacam inilah yang akan menerapkan hukum islam mengemban ideologi islam ke seluruh dunia dan bahkan menjadi satu satunya negara adidaya di dunia tidak hanya ideologi islam umat islam juga memiliki sumber sumber kekuataan yang bisa mendukung terwujudnya khilafah islamiyah sebagai negara adidaya dunia jika seluruh wilayah kaum muslim di dunia bersatu di bawah naungan khilafah islamiyah mereka akan memiliki posisi geografis yang sangat menguntungkan sebagai negara adidaya kaum muslim secara geografis menempati posisi yang strategis pada jalur laut dunia mereka mengendalikan selat gibraltar di mediterania barat terusan suez di mediterania timur selat balb al mandab yang memiliki teluk teluk kecil di laut merah selat dardanelles dan bosphorus yang menghubungkan jalur laut hitam ke mediterania serta selat hormus di teluk selat malaka merupakan lokasi strategis di timur jauh dengan menempati posisi yang strategis ini kebutuhan masyarakat internasional akan wilayah kaum muslim pastilah tinggi mengingat mereka harus melewati jalur laut strategis tersebut di samping itu mereka akan sulit menaklukkan negeri negeri islam karena pintu pintu strategis laut dikuasai oleh kaum muslim faktor sumberdaya alam negeri negeri islam dianugerahi oleh allah swt sebagai negeri negeri yang kaya raya dengan sumberdaya alamnya contohnya adalah kekayaan sumber pangan negara yang memiliki sumber pangan yang besar jelas akan memperkuat posisi negara tersebut karena akan terhindar dari ketergantungan pada negara lain negeri negeri islam dikenal sebagai wilayah yang subur untuk bercocok tanam pangan sumberdaya alam lainnya yang penting adalah bahan mentah saat ini dunia islam mengendalikan cadangan minyak dunia 60 boron 40 fosfat 50 perlite 60 strontium 27 dan tin 22 dengan potensi ideologis dan faktor faktor penunjang tersebut khilafah islam jelas akan menjadi sebuah negara adidaya yang sangat kuat di sinilah letak pentingnya kaum muslim menegakkan khilafah islam tersebut di tengah tengah mereka ketidakadaan khilafah islam yang berdasarkan ideologi islam membuat kaum muslim mundur dalam peran internasionalnya bahkan tidak mampu menghadapi penjajahan barat bagaimanapun barat dengan kekuatan negaranya yang dibangun atas dasar ideologi kapitalisme yang mengglobal juga harus dilawan dengan kekuatan negara yang dibangun di atas ideologi yang juga mengglobal negara tersebut adalah khilafah islam yang akan menghimpun potensi kaum muslim dan menyatukan dunia islam secara ril karenanya hanya melalui khilafah islam inilah umat islam akan mampu memayungi dunia dengan segala kebaikannya melalui penerapan yang membawa rahmat bagi seluruh umat manusia sekaligus mengakhiri imperialisme as dan sekutunya yang membawa bencana dan kesengsaraan umat manusia melalui penerapan kapitalisme sekulernya maha benar allah yang telah berfirman tiadalah kami mengutus kamu muhammad melainkan untuk menjadi rahmat bagi semesta alam

1498675 waktu itu blog masih sepi banget belum meriah kayak sekarang jadi lucu juga kalo inget pengalaman awal ngeblog tiap hari saya ngomong sendiri posting sendiri semuanya sendirian tanpa ada interaksi dengan para blogger lain serasa lagi ngeblog di kuburan hehehe motivasi awal ngeblog tadinya hanya untuk mendokumentasikan momen momen penting anak saya semacam jurnal pribadi yang merekam semua tingkah laku anak saya dan juga kehidupan sehari hari saya
1498676 blog saya dilirik oleh penerbit gradien yang berlanjut pada tawaran untuk diterbitkan menjadi buku gokilmom butuh waktu hampir 1 tahun hingga akhirnya saya memutuskan untuk menerima tawaran dari penerbit gradien tantangan terbesarnya mengalahkan rasa gak pede saya saya kuatir go public hehehe kebayang aja deh kalo jurnal pribadi dibukuin serasa ditelanjangin di muka umum karena isi buku gokilmom itu kan semua kisah nyata yang diambil dari blog saya saya harus bergumul ama rasa takut dan cemas kalo kalo buku gokilmom bakalan gagal di pasaran waktu itu yang terpikir di benak saya ya ampun plis dong ahhh siapa juga sih yang mau baca curhatan emak emak gokil nan slebor
1498677 aku suka menulis cerita cerita lucu bout masa kuliah dan ngekos terus aku kirimkan ke majalah ada yang dimuat dan banyak ditolak hihi semuanya aku posting di blog sebagai arsip dan dikomentari gila gilaan sama penghuni blog boleh terus mikir seru juga nih kalau dibukukan kan belum ada tuh kisah nyata anak anak kos cewek adanya novel vanya nya hilman jaman duluu banget jadilah kukumpulkan menjadi sebuah naskah kutawarkan ke beberapa penerbit tepatnya ada 4 dan alhamdulillah semua nolak euy terakhir aku tawarkan ke gradien tanpa berharap banyak dan melanjutkan proyek menulis yang lain
1498678 nggak ada angin dan hujan tau tau mas khun ang tek khun ceo gradien mediatama red sms tanyain aku udah kelar nambahin cerita lagi belum soalnya naskahku kurang 80 halaman waaaks itu sih bukan nambah mas ternyata email mas khun nyasar ke spam jadi nggak kebaca jadi deh ngebut nulis dan pakai revisi ala skripsi lho beberapa kali lho jadi biarpun judul dan isinya dodol buku ini cukup serius lho pembuatannya sumpah
1498679 jaman sekarang semua serba susah capek sekolah capek kerja capek ngurus anak dan berjuta susah lainnya kebutuhan akan buku buku ringan pelepas stress yang enak dibaca jadi meningkat
1498680 salah satu kekuatan blook isinya kumpulan kisah nyata yang bisa terjadi di kehidupan setiap orang baca blook bisa kayak cermin pribadi ehhh kok sama ya ama gue ya ampunnn nih orang mirip banget nih kelakuannya ama gue semacam itulah jadi blook bisa lebih mudah melekat di hati pembaca selain itu menurut saya blook bisa dapat respon positif dari masyarakat raditya dika thanks to him hehehe
1498681 seleb shock hahahhaa narsis saya kumat deh belon lagi saya jadi kelimpungan nerima email yang bertubi tubi sampe akhirnya saya bingung mau bales apa wong saya kan cuma orang biasa yang kebetulan menulis blook
1498682 alhamdulillah senang banget nggak nyangka aja misalnya blook anak kos dodol akd ini sekarang cetakan kelima sejak diterbitkan bulan april 2008
1498683 blook lain juga gitu macam gokil mom lemotnya pritha dan muka marketplace nya aca juga diterima pembaca dulu kan penulis blook dipandang sebelah mata di dunia penulisan mungkin karena dalam penulisannya cenderung sesuka hati dan kadang menabrak rambu rambu penulisan seperti gaya bahasa dan gaya penulisan yang ajaib hehe namanya saja menulis diary sapenake dhewe kata wong djokdja hehe seenak penulisnya saja menurutku blook lebih disukai pembaca karena berdasarkan kisah nyata pengalaman pribadi penulis yang membumi ya kehidupan sehari hari yang kocak gitu jadi lebih menyentuh kalbu
1498684 raditya itu blook anak muda yang segar bugar empat sehat lima sempurna sementara blook saya versi kambing betina yang udah beranak pinak hahahaha
1498685 menurutku sih masih banyak celah pasar buat blook secara pengalaman orang tuh beda beda kan coba baca ulang blogmu dan temukan kekhasannnya satu tema besar itu yang dikembangkan misalnya kamu tuh fotografer atau freelancer serabutan pasti banyak pengalaman kocak dan seru kan kumpulkan dan tulislah dengan gaya bahasamu sendiri ciri khasmu jadi blookmu nanti bakalan beda dari blook lain yang sudah ada selamat mencoba
1498686 saran saya pilih tema tulisan yang akrab di kehidupan sehari hari masyarakat sesuai dengan target pembaca anda dan pakai gaya tulisan yang mengalir tapi tidak bertele tele jangan lupa penggunaan bahasa yang ringan

1498866 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1498867 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1498868 the notion that the white house directed anyone to forge a letter from habbush to saddam hussein is absurd
1498869 we know now that those estimates were wrong but they were the estimates we all relied on
1498870 regardless military force in iraq was used because saddam hussein defiantly failed to comply with the 17 un security council resolutions iraq was subject to
1498871 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from cia ever involved in any such effort
1498872 it is well established that at my direction cia resisted efforts on the part of some in the administration to paint a picture of iraqi al qaeda connections that went beyond the evidence
1498873 the notion that i would suddenly reverse our stance and have created and planted false evidence that was contrary to our own beliefs is ridiculous

1498882 the white house directed and cia allegedly went along with burying that information so that the war could go ahead as planned this is a complete fabrication in fact the source in question failed to persuade his british interlocutors that he had anything new to offer by way of intelligence concessions or negotiations with regard to the iraq crisis and the british on their own elected to break off contact with him
1498883 there were many iraqi officials who said both publicly and privately that iraq had no wmd but our foreign intelligence colleagues and we assessed that these individuals were parroting the baath party line and trying to delay any coalition attack the particular source that suskind cites offered no evidence to back up his assertion and acted in an evasive and unconvincing manner

1498900 het ministerie heeft zijn teleurstelling uitgedrukt dat de duitse overheid zijn goedkeuring gaf aan een duits bedrijf om de deal met de iraanse gasbedrijf te ondertekenen
1498901 het besluit van de duitse overheid is tegen de geest van sancties die de vn veiligheidsraad op iran
1498902 het is zeer verontrustend dat precies duitsland dat lid is van de eu 3 frankrijk groot brittanni en duitsland een positie inneemt die de internationale pogingen voor het versterken van sanctie tegen iran schade berokkent
1498903 overheids bronnen zeggen dat zij meer van duitsland verwachtten wegens de unieke relatie van het land met isra l

1498965 my message to democratic lawmakers is this if youre really for increased american energy production then prove it by putting it in writing sign the discharge petitions house republicans are circulating that will force votes on energy legislation speaker pelosi refuses to bring to the floor and sign onto the american energy act our all of the above plan to increase conservation innovation and american energy production instead of doing the speakers bidding by voting against bringing it to a vote if you arent willing to put it in writing youre fooling no one youre siding with the speaker of the drill nothing congress and radical special interests that favor higher gas prices at the expense of energy strapped american families
1498966 this cynical strategy is disgustingly dishonest without any real solutions to help americans who are struggling with record high gas prices it appears the democratic leadership has hit on a new plan deceive deceive the press deceive its members and deceive the american people democratic members have a pass from their leaders to talk about drilling at home while the liberal democratic leadership which is beholden to special interests that want higher gas prices plays rope a dope back in washington ensuring there is no vote to help the american people before november its cynical dishonest and wrong and it wont work

1499092 in a study that was undertaken to address concerns that colorectal cancer researchers found that in fact higher plasma folate levels are associated with a lower risk of colorectal cancer specific and overall mortality
1499093 our review of the literature convinces us that studies show that fatty streak lesions in the arteries that are a precursor to atherosclerosis and heart disease begin in childhood and advanced lesions are not uncommon by age 30 why not nip things in the bud
1499094 multiple risk factors besides cholesterol are associated with markedly increased incidence of epa was effective in reducing the incidence of cad events for patients with this dyslipidemic pattern suggesting that epa may be especially beneficial in patients who with abnormal tg and hdl c levels
1499095 turmeric treated mice were less susceptible to developing type 2 diabetes based on their blood glucose levels and glucose and insulin tolerance tests they also discovered that turmeric fed obese mice showed significantly reduced inflammation in fat tissue and liver compared to controls they speculate that curcumin the anti inflammatory anti oxidant ingredient in turmeric lessens insulin resistance and prevents type 2 diabetes in these mouse models by dampening the inflammatory response provoked by obesity
1499096 when a person develops a sore or a boil it erupts drawing to it immune system cells that fight the infection then it resolves and flattens into the skin often leaving behind a mark or a scar a similar scenario plays out in the blood vessels however when there is a defect in the resolution response the ability of blood vessels to recover from inflammation atherosclerosis or hardening of the arteries can result some natural mediators that cool this inflammation are derived from omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids
1499097 cox 1 and cox 2 activity was significantly reduced in the pomegranate fed animals compared to control particularly for cox 2 indeed cox 1 activity was reduced by about seven per cent following ingestion of the extract while cox 2 activity decreased by about 26 per cent
1499098 luteolin consumption reduced lps induced il 6 in plasma 4 h after injection furthermore luteolin decreased the induction of il 6 mrna by lps in hippocampus but not in the cortex or cerebellum taken together these data suggest luteolin inhibits lps induced il 6 production in the brain by inhibiting the jnk signaling pathway and activation of ap 1 in microglia thus luteolin may be useful for mitigating neuroinflammation
1499099 it was found that probiotics have an anti inflammatory potential seen as a decrease in serum crp levels and as a reduction in bacteria induced production of proinflammatory cytokines in peripheral blood mononuclear cells
1499100 the new study looked at luteolin loo tee oh lin a plant flavonoid known to impede the inflammatory response in several types of cells outside the central nervous system those cells that were also exposed to luteolin showed a significantly diminished inflammatory response jang showed that luteolin was shutting down production of a key cytokine in the inflammatory pathway interleukin 6 il 6 the effects of luteolin exposure were dramatic resulting in as much as a 90 percent drop in il 6 production in the lps treated cells inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 6 are very well known to inhibit certain types of learning and memory that are under the control of the hippocampus and the hippocampus is also very vulnerable to the insults of aging if you had the potential to decrease the production of inflammatory cytokines in the brain you could potentially limit the cognitive deficits that result
1499101 whereas the early hunter gatherers had a dietary omega 6 omega 3 ratio of 2 1 to 3 1 this ratio is now 15 1 to 17 1 in north america today it is believed that these dietary changes might be related to increases in inflammatory related diseases including depression and cardiovascular disease at higher levels of depressive symptoms as the omega 6 omega 3 ratio increased there was a marked increase in proinflammatory cytokine levels compared with the study participants who did not have syndromal depression the 6 participants who had depression had significantly higher omega 6 omega 3 ratios and higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines
1499102 specific recommendations to improve postprandial glucose and triglycerides are as follows select high fiber carbohydrates with low glycemic index including vegetables fruits whole grains legumes and nuts at all 3 meals consume lean protein
1499103 high consumption of caffeine containing coffee is associated with higher adiponectin and lower inflammatory marker concentrations
1499104 limited in vitro data support the inverse association between vitamin k and interleukin 6 and this may influence the association between vitamin k and other cytokines such as osteoprotegerin
1499105 vitamin k status measured by plasma phylloquinone concentration and phylloquinone intake was inversely associated with circulating inflammatory markers as a group and with several individual inflammatory biomarkers
1499106 moderate exercise sped up how fast wounds heal in old mice
1499107 may be the result of an exercise induced anti inflammatory response in the wound
1499108 whereas the early hunter gatherers had a dietary omega 6 omega 3 ratio of 2 1 to 3 1 this ratio is now 15 1 to 17 1 in north america today compared with the study participants who did not have syndromal depression the 6 participants who had depression had significantly higher omega 6 omega 3 ratios and higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines
1499109 diets with high n 6 n 3 pufa ratios may enhance the risk for both depression and inflammatory diseases
1499110 the intensity of this general inflammation can be measured by blood tests for markers like c reactive protein crp which is produced by the liver during periods of inflammation people with increased levels of crp seem to have a greater risk of heart disease from damage to their blood vessels chronic inflammation may also be connected to cancers of the esophagus stomach colon and liver
1499111 the studies uncovered a surprising link between inflammatory diseases and cancer that may change how these diseases are treated in the future
1499112 compared with those who said they didnt eat fish those who ate at least 10 5 ounces of fish per week had 33 lower c reactive protein and 33 lower tumor necrosis factor alpha another indicator of inflammation levels as well as much lower levels of other signs of inflammation
1499113 brushing your teeth may be one of many ways to help keep your mind healthy and lower the risk of alzheimers disease
1499114 this research group recently identified a new class of aspirin triggered bioactive lipids called resolvins the activity of which may in part explain the beneficial effects of omega 3 fatty acids
1499115 these data suggest that dietary fish oil supplementation has a markedly protective effect in suppressing eib in elite athletes and this may be attributed to their anti inflammatory properties
1499116 an anti inflammatory diet and fish oil supplements are both helpful for people with rheumatoid arthritis ra but combining them has an even greater effect the anti inflammatory diet improved joint pain swelling and overall ability to function by 14 while the western diet did not improve symptoms or functioning benefits were observed with the addition of fish oil bringing total improvement to 17 in those eating a western diet and 37 in those eating the anti inflammatory diet furthermore the need for anti inflammatory medications was significantly reduced for those receiving fish oil on both diets although the group eating the anti inflammatory diet had greater medication reduction medication usage increased for those on the western diet plus placebo
1499117 vitamins can improve blood flow and prevent the long term development of atherosclerosis or available in tablets or capsules three times per day or as directed on the product label whole turmeric is more effective than isolated curcumin its major constituent look for products standardized for 95 curcuminoids be patient the full benefit takes two months to develop dont use turmeric if you have gallstones or bile duct dysfunction
1499118 the higher the pulse pressure the greater the risk of having an elevated crp
1499119 the findings suggest that a wide pulse pressure is associated with higher levels of inflammation
1499120 being seen as a risk factor for adverse cardiovascular events
1499121 an active lifestyle even if begun only in middle age spurs alzheimers disease in another study published in the same issue of the annals of neurology researchers find that a particular chemical in the blood may be linked to alzheimers and other dementing diseases the chemical is called hs crp it is a sign of inflammation the bodys protective response to injury or infection
1499122 chronic inflammation inflicts devastating effects especially as humans grow older the pathological consequences of inflammation are fully documented in the medical literature regrettably the dangers of systemic inflammation continue to be ignored even though proven ways exist to reverse this process
1499123 hs crp a marker of low level inflammation has been found to be a strong predictor of myocardial infarction and stroke in men and women as well as subsequent clinical events in patients following major cardiac events a structured program involving a low fat mediterranean diet and a supervised three times weekly exercise program for three months values of hs crp dropped 31 percent after the three months body fat was reduced by 5 percent exercise capacity improved 36 percent
1499124 inflammation is necessary to manage with damaging agents and is crucial for survival but in our opinion the pro inflammatory status of ageing might be one of the mechanisms which relate cancer to ageing the most appropriate inflammatory genes have been selected to survive and to reproduce paradoxically inflammatory age related diseases including cancer are the marks of the same evolutionistic trait centenarians are characterized by a higher frequency of genetic markers associated with better control of inflammation the reduced capacity of centenarians to mount inflammatory responses appears to exert a protective effect towards the development of those age related pathologies having a strong inflammatory pathogenetic component including cancer all in all centenarians seem to carry a genetic background with a peculiar resistance to cancer which is also an anti inflammatory profile
1499125 chronic inflammation of the intestine or stomach can damage dna increasing the risk of cancer researchers have long known that inflammation produces cytokines immune response chemicals that encourage cell proliferation and suppress cell death which can lead to cancer
1499126 interleukin il 6 c reactive protein and macroalbuminuria are significant predictors of congestive heart failure independent of obesity and other established risk factors
1499127 the research also proved that obesity without inflammation does not result in insulin resistance when an animal or a human being becomes obese they develop steatosis or increased fat in the liver the steatosis leads to liver inflammation and hepatic insulin resistance
1499128 increased circulating levels of inflammatory and endothelial prothrombotic compounds are related to the presence and severity of ed
1499129 inflammation associated with the progression of tumors actually plays a key role in the metastasis of prostate cancer
1499130 depressed patients have elevated inflammatory markers such as interleukin 6 and c reactive protein in fact the levels of proinflammatory cytokines correlate with the severity of depressive symptoms in studies in addition administration of cytokine antagonists can effectively reverse depressive symptoms in patients
1499131 those with a higher white blood cell count a sign of inflammation were more likely to die of cancer the study also suggests that aspirin may have a greater protective effect against cancer for those with high wbc
1499132 hardening of the arteries in the legs is strongly associated with biological markers of inflammation which may be a warning sign of heart trouble
1499133 our hypothesis is that low grade chronic inflammation is mediating primary aging
1499134 inflammation burns out white blood cells faster and the effort of replacing them wears down the telomeres
1499135 increasing evidence supports a role for inflammation in the development of atherosclerosis thickening and hardening of the arteries
1499136 infectious diseases cause chronic inflammation in the blood that decades later leads to heart attacks strokes and cancers the classic killers of old age
1499137 infections provoke an immune response from the body part of this response is inflammation inflamed tissues swell redden and leak fluids full of chemical signals to the immune system
1499138 women with rheumatoid hormone replacement therapy hrt show greater improvements in disease activity inflammation bone mineral density and radiological progression than women not receiving hrt treatment with hrt also led to better control of inflammation
1499139 2 physiological signs of systemic inflammation high white blood cell wbc count and low serum albumin levels were associated with long term incidence of lesions characteristic of arm specifically higher wbc count at baseline was linked to 2 early signs of arm an increase in large retinal drusen and rpe depigmentation as well as progression of arm lower serum albumin was associated with a late sign of arm exudative macular degeneration
1499140 crp level was significantly lower in patients using glibenclamide 5 56 and 8 3 mg l respectively the data showed that metformin decreases the level of circulating crp a marker of inflammation more than glibenclamide
1499141 increasing levels of crp were associated with a stepwise gradient in odds for
1499142 the c reactive protein increased to an average of almost twice their baseline levels when the women took oral estrogen replacement but not when they were on the
1499143 c reactive protein is considered an emerging risk factor and risk marker for coronary heart disease the levels of c reactive protein were about halved when the pooled plus simvastatin results were compared with simvastatin alone the combination produced about a 34 8 reduction compared to an 18 2 reduction if the statin was used as monotherapy
1499144 some 93 of the 89 patients who did not use compared with 42 among patients in the lower four categories similarly 94 of the 67 patients who did not use statins and were in the highest crp category had exercise induced ischaemia compared with 44 in the lower four categories
1499145 low grade systemic inflammation is associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus in middle aged men inflammation could be one mechanism by which known risk factors for diabetes mellitus such as obesity smoking and hypertension promote the development of diabetes mellitus
1499146 the study found that men with systolic blood pressure the top number in a blood pressure reading at or above 140 millimeters of mercury mm hg and elevated levels of inflammation sensitive plasma proteins isp were four times as likely to have a stroke as were men who had normal blood pressure and normal isp levels moreover the inflammatory proteins predicted stroke risk for 10 or more years
1499147 previous studies have suggested that aspirin and other nsaids might protect against alzheimers disease by reducing inflammation in the brain
1499148 baseline levels of the inflammatory biomarkers c reactive protein crp and interleukin 6 il 6 are independently associated with a two fold increase in risk of healthy postmenopausal women developing coronary heart disease chd
1499149 those who suffered sudden cardiac death had higher levels of a substance called c reactive protein crp
1499150 statins block the vasoconstrictive blood vessel narrowing effect of the a beta protein a critical protein involved in combining statin with estrogen may maximise post menopausal cardiovascular benefits estrogen alone increased the median level of c reactive protein from 0 27 to 0 46 mg dl equivalent to a 70 percent rise on the other hand simvastatin decreased c reactive protein levels from 0 29 to 0 28 mg dl oral estrogen combined with simvastatin increased c reactive protein levels by 29 percent from 0 28 to 0 36 mg dl
1499151 the study also found that statin use was associated with a lower risk of memory problems or dementia regardless of total cholesterol level the authors say more research is needed to understand exactly how statins seem to protect the brain but they suspect that the drugs may work by improving muscle function and reducing inflammation
1499152 the studies reflect scientists growing interest in the idea that a common condition inflammation may underlie many chronic and debilitating diseases like alzheimers heart disease osteoporosis and diabetes and that drugs that fight inflammation may have a role in preventing or delaying those diseases or at least slowing them down originally the effect was attributed to aspirins ability to prevent blood clots which can cause heart attacks or strokes but now researchers think part of the protective effect may come from aspirins ability to quell inflammation in the arteries helping to prevent blockages
1499153 the immune system and inflammation may be factors causing type 2 diabetes women who had high levels of immune system substances called c reactive protein or interleukin 6 or both in their blood were more likely to develop type 2 diabetes both c reactive protein called crp and interleukin 6 or il 6 are considered indicators for inflammation
1499154 cholesterol lowering drugs called statins apparently work by reducing levels of a chemical known as c reactive protein this protein causes inflammation promotes blood clotting and weakens fat encased blockages inside arteries causing them to burst
1499155 half of all heart attack patients have normal cholesterol levels a blood test can detect high levels of c reactive protein a sign of inflammation
1499156 the texas heavyweight texas junior and texas tag team champions will now be state champions not in name but because theyll be traveling champions going into other regions of the state defending their belt

1499158 the old guard of promoters did not want over exposure other than their own television production but when wwf now wwe went cable that changed everything forever and coupled with the emerging internet age and tape sales the ability to kayfabe was no longer a controlled situation
1499159 times have changed drastically in the way of doing business which is to communicate effectively between wrestling dates to build up excitement and enhance brand
1499160 the old guard was excellent in working the system back then and it resulted in sell out shows everywhere especially true in the 60s and 70s
1499161 nwa southwest has raised the bar higher aspiring both fans and talents to be able to participate in state and world title matches of 60 years legitimacy
1499162 we will begin the process immediately of positioning the best talent in each region against the best in other regions and then give all involved a real opportunity to shine and compete for state national and world levels of competition
1499163 the best of the best will become champions and from there will come opportunities for vie for north american and world gold
1499164 a web site is a powerful tool executed professionally and correctly as it can build a huge and loyal new generation of fans to nwa
1499165 from the standpoint of communicating we have media technology far superior to anything the old territory had available our mission statement is simple create a new generation of nwa fans in texas and oklahoma by creating a total wrestling package we realize delivering a depth of quality stars is as important as creating strong media coverage and we see our talent level arguably close to the old stars that many will come to realize

1499167 the iraqi government now has tens of billions of dollars at its disposal to fund large scale reconstruction projects
1499168 it is inexcusable for u s taxpayers to continue to foot the bill for projects the iraqis are fully capable of funding themselves
1499169 it is time for the sovereign government of iraq using its revenues expenditures and surpluses to fully assume the responsibility to provide essential services and improve the quality of life for the iraqi people
1499170 first the relative shortage of trained budgetary procurement and other staff with the necessary technical skills as a factor limiting the iraqi governments ability to plan and execute its capital spending
1499171 third violence and sectarian strife remain major obstacles to developing iraqi government capacity
1499172 this substantial increase in revenues offers the iraqi government the potential to better finance its own security and economic needs

1499254 we still see many more overweight patients than underweight but its a challenge

1499256 its vital women know that pregnancy is no time to be starving yourself
1499257 during the nine months it is in the womb the baby is growing faster than it ever will in later life
1499258 what we expect is that whenever possible women should have a physical before they get pregnant that way they can be evaluated for risk factors such as being overweight or underweight
1499259 being overweight can lead to complications such as diabetes and being underweight can lead to problems such as low birth weight
1499260 we recommend to women that rather than going on a diet while pregnant they should consult a registered dietician and have a plan tailored to fit their needs
1499261 ex libris group was a very successful investment for francisco partners we were pleased to be part of the companys impressive growth over the last two years
1499262 the management team did a fantastic job in our acquisition of endeavor information systems in december 2006 and its subsequent merger into the ex libris group we believe the company is very well positioned to continue its growth in the future with its strong and comprehensive product base
1499263 the period of our affiliation with francisco partners was one of expansion for ex libris on many fronts including product suite customer base geographic breadth and revenue
1499264 it was a pleasure having the opportunity to work with the francisco partners team and to benefit from their experience

1499269 i obviously didnt like the way i finished the event last week but i was so glad that i was in a position to compete for the championship to get back into contention to have an opportunity where every putt counted and mattered
1499270 i needed to feel the pressure and i needed to play well on a tough golf course heading into this week so i take a lot of positives out of last week
1499271 i had a good week last week with the short game but it wasnt great
1499272 right now my season with just a couple wins is just ok but if i were able to come through on sunday and win this event it would make an ok year a great one
1499273 the ninth hole is kind of like a short par 4 really
1499274 i hit a 3 wood in there tuesday youve got 17 and that was a 5 wood today
1499275 the greens are pretty severe a lot of slopes big slopes and big humps right in the middle of the greens
1499276 so when youre using that much club going into a green that can be quite tricky because if you just get on the wrong side of a slope its no guaranteed two putt
1499277 there are not going to be a lot of 2s on any of those par 3s

1499281 for children who lived in a home with a man who married underage girls or agreed to an arranged marriage of an underage daughter the safety plans include a requirement to keep the children away from that man
1499282 in the cases of the eight children listed in todays court filing the mothers have refused to sign the safety plans
1499283 at that time well present evidence that we believe indicates that these children continue to be in imminent harm
1499284 a pervasive pattern of spiritual marriages between older men and girls 17 and younger
1499285 i was waiting to go to practice and i was just crying uncontrollably
1499286 its all weve talked about the past almost two years leading up to this and even though im doing this for both of us i definitely feel like im a part of me is missing not having him here
1499287 oh yeah its very hard i want nothing more than to be there but at the same time i could be dead so thats the alternative in plain english
1499288 she also knows that michael wants her to do a very good job so i think that gives her motivation to get the job done here and not be more of a distraction
1499289 she will do whatever it takes she will it will be tough she will follow a few times but when she is on that block in that relay on the weekend youll see
1499290 i feel like im going out there to beijing and doing this for michael and making michael proud
1499291 in many ways weve seen the enemy and it is us
1499292 were not willing to pay for better services yet we fully expect them
1499293 they cant raise fares because they have no pricing control
1499294 its not that they dont have the courage it would be business suicide to fall out of lockstep
1499295 the three biggest enemies to airlines today are fuel costs the internet and southwest a smart lean mean flying machine
1499296 one thing worse than high fares is no fares because youve lost airline service
1499297 it might be better to tolerate higher fares now so we dont end up with fewer carriers and less competition in the marketplace
1499298 the map is the most precise depiction yet of the limits and the future dividing lines that could be drawn across the arctic region

1499300 for children who lived in a home with a man who married underage girls or agreed to an arranged marriage of an underage daughter the safety plans include a requirement to keep the children away from that man
1499301 in the cases of the eight children listed in todays court filing the mothers have refused to sign the safety plans

1499303 a pervasive pattern of spiritual marriages between older men and girls 17 and younger
1499304 china has focused on strengthening security and protection around olympic venues and at the olympics village so beijing is already prepared to respond to any threat
1499305 to ensure the security and safety of everyone at the games
1499306 yeah matt do something about it come on oh wait
1499307 everything we do is about trying to achieve a medal at the olympics
1499308 although last year was the first year i ran the 10 000m i was frustrated to just miss out on a medal at the world championships
1499309 but that experience gave me the motivation to keep training hard and go that one step better in beijing
1499310 i am really excited about it and i think the experience of osaka will stand me in good stead the 10 000m is what i have focused all my training on
1499311 the race at the world championships came down to who could handle the heat best it was over 37 degrees and there was really high humidity it became more of a slog who could last out that was an unusual situation for a championship but i think beijing will be the same
1499312 the ethiopians have been the ones to watch for a number of years
1499313 you have got to be at your absolute best on the day at the olympics i have these new running shoes which weigh less than 100 grams so that might help me run a bit faster it is exciting
1499314 oh my god this is the most action in a game in wnba history why isnt anybody watching this right now
1499315 you can look forward to the same action and hype and adventure and the wonderful cliffhangers that the first season had a lot of us are working much more closely together a lot of the main four cast which is kind of what i think the audience missed about the second season and what we all missed was that we didnt get the chance to work with each other so were all crossing paths this season its so action packed and it leaves you with wonderful cliffhangers its a really tremendous season
1499316 one cool thing about this season is i get to play kind of two different characters for a second we hop back and forth a little bit from the present to the future
1499317 were only up to episode eight so im not sure if shes going to continue to do it in the future id love to know but i dont
1499318 its a very different world its kind of as you can imagine a world gone a little bit awry shes a very different person
1499319 whenever theres a villain theres always someone bigger and badder and meaner sylar is not the only villain obviously
1499320 there are many things out there that are much worse than sylar
1499321 im still playing a teenager even younger than myself and claire is still going through turmoil with all parents and shes trying to break away and she starts to in this season shes gotten to the point and remember getting there too where it was just like youd ask but you knew what you were going to do regardless of what the answer was you think okay you can say no i hope you say yes because that would make this whole thing a lot easier but im going to do what i want to do and im determined to head down this path that im aiming for
1499322 something happens to her thats actually quite frightening to her and it plays a very big part in who she becomes in the future and what happens to her and i wish i could babble about it now because i have a lot to say about it but i cant but its something that yes manifests further with her ability that weighs heavily on her emotionally and mentally as a person and i think it would anyone that would be going through a situation like that
1499323 this is the only reality there is if you can get it down on paper in words notes or color so much the better
1499324 vad schyssta ni r jag trodde inte att vakter var s dana
1499325 visst r det konstigt trots kunskap om att det f rekommer verv ld fr n ordningsvakter tar polisen f r givet att i valet mellan tre nerslagna m nniskor och sju utan en skr ma r det de slagna offren som r de skyldiga
1499326 vad r v rst att bli kr nkt och misshandlad att felaktigt d mas i domstol eller den m nga g nger hatiska attityd jag f tt som knivhugg i ryggen och slag rakt i ansiktet detta av samh llets etablissemang som samtidigt gl mmer att det kan vara deras son eller dotter som r kar ut f r n got liknande n sta helg jag t nker inte l ta mig bli klappad p huvudet
1499327 l t oss alla hoppas att r ttsv sendet tvingas att lystra och b rja skydda oss folket mot or ttf rdigat v ld fr n deras egna tj nstem n hur l nge kan de blunda f r det uppenbara
1499328 sammantaget anser jag mig ha tillr ckligt underlag f r att kunna konstatera att det inte i obetydlig utstr ckning f rekommer obefogat v ld verv ld och ojuste beteende fr n ordningsvakters sida i samband med ingripanden mot krogg ster
1499329 det finns tillr ckligt underlag f r att h vda att det tycks f rekomma att vissa ordningsvakter i inte obetydlig omfattning talar helt eller delvis osanning n r de h rs i m l r rande krogv ld
1499330 det st r emellertid klart att de krogg ster som uts tts f r l gner fr n vakter samtidigt uts tts f r avsev rda risker i fr ga om r ttss kerheten i de bed mningar som domstolen har att g ra
1499331 det som framkommit om r ttss kerhetsproblem n r vakter h rs i domstol r oroande det r sj lvfallet helt oacceptabelt om enskilda d ms oskyldiga p grundval av falska eller tillr ttalagda vittnesm l fr n krogvakter jag vill d rf r rekommendera rikspolisstyrelsen polismyndigheterna klagarmyndigheten och domstolsverket att verv ga vilka tg rder som kan beh va vidtas
1499332 det fungerar inte s det vore d den f r karri ren
1499333 en vakt som p dagen skyddar ledande politiker jobbar p h kte r polisaspirant vaktar milit ra objekt eller k r v rdetransporter kan p kv llar och n tter jobba sida vid sida med kriminella
1499334 systemet har m lmedvetet f rslappat dem man kan hitta b de halvd va och sovande n mndem n p vissa f rhandlingar
1499335 d ins g jag att det var k rt hur fan ska man klara sig ur detta va fan det var ju han som sparkade mig jag har ju inte gjort n got vem ska tro p mig vad g r jag h r tankarna springer friskt i skallen
1499336 jag l rde mig tidigt av ldre kollegor hur man skulle skriva sig fri n r man beg tt vergrepp p omh ndertagna eller gripna
1499337 dessa reportrar har n ra relation till de reportrar som jobbar f r en webbtidning som gs av en krogkoncern p stureplan reportrar som l ter sig mutas med bl a middagar sprit eller vip behandling p koncernens krogar
1499338 det har gl mts bort att den grupp vakter som beter sig illa r en f rsvinnande liten minoritet som f r v ldigt mycket uppm rksamhet
1499339 vid huvudf rhandlingen blev det pinsamt uppenbart f r mig hur vakterna h ll ihop och skapade en ber ttelse f r att motivera misshandel verv ld och kr nkande spr kbruk
1499340 om jag h ll tyst och inte anm lde vakten skulle jag f g hem n r jag ist llet ville anm la det jag varit med om blev jag h nad och gripen
1499341 vi minns nog alla hur kv llspressen snabbt var ute f r att s nka sj din l ngt innan r tteg ng delvis kanske detta drev kan f rklaras av att sj din r kvinna m jligen kan hennes partif rg ge henne fiender men det sj din varit med om kan h nda vem som helst
1499342 det skulle inte hj lpa om jag satte gud fader sj lv i vittnesb set polis och vakter f r alltid r tt det r min advokats ord jag ska upp inf r domstol i dag talad f r v ld mot tj nsteman och v ldsamt motst nd
1499343 det r ett samh llsproblem om osanningar i r tten fr n personer som r satta att uppr tth lla lag och ordning leder till att oskyldiga d ms d rf r granskar vi nu detta
1499344 min h ndelse utspelade sig inte p krogen utan p en fotbollsmatch d r man anv nder sig av samma typ av ordningsvakter bevisligen
1499345 att inte polisen tar promilletest i h ktet r rent r ttsvidrigt tycker jag de kan h lla folk i h kte helt utan grund f r att sedan skylla p fylla
1499346 det h r till ts ske i v rt samh lle idag s fort n gon druckit vin befinner sig utan n ra v nner och bekanta omkring sig d f rsvinner all trov rdighet respekt och r ttvisa mot en hederlig medborgare vi betalar skatt f r det h r r ttsv sendet som d mer oskyldiga
1499347 fr n en trevlig kv ll med mycket skratt till en kv ll full av v ld vem har gett vissa vakter denna makt och r ttighet att kunna upptr da p detta s tt
1499348 anm la puh varf r f r att sen l ggas ner och f det bekr ftat att ingen bryr sig
1499349 m dde d ligt psykiskt l nge efter detta och drar mig f r att g p krogen igen har faktiskt inte gjort det blir r dd n r jag ser vakter och arg k nns som om dom r labila anabola stinna monster som bara vill f utlopp f r sina inre aggressioner men att ge sig p f rsvarsl sa tjejer r s j vla fegt
1499350 jag f r panik o b rjar skrika vansinnigt sl pp ut mig
1499351 det m ste g att f lla en ordningsvakt f r misshandel om han hon gjort sig skyldig till det polisen och klagare m ste ta folk p allvar n r de blivit misshandlade av krogvakter vi kan ju inte ha ett samh lle d r personer fritt kan misshandla m nniskor utan att blir f llda f r det
1499352 f rst efter ett tag slutar man sl man sl par in mig tillbaks p krogen och n r polis kommer till platsen uppger vakterna att jag hade slagit dem hotat dem och att jag varit mycket v ldsam poliserna k per hela deras l gn
1499353 d puttades jag av polisen och kallades f r en juggehora jag plockade fram mitt presskort och sade att jag kommer att rapportera om detta fall och kr vde veta polisernas identitet
1499354 jag fr gar vad fan de sysslar med jag m ste ju hem och ta mitt nattinsulin de drar mig in i cellen jag spj rnar mot s gott jag kan
1499355 i anm lan stod det sedan att han omh ndertagits p en helt annan plats p stureplan och att han varit s full att han varit en fara f r sig sj lv och andra n got blodprov fick han inte l mna vilket man kan tycka borde vara en r ttighet man kan ju ven undra om en stupfull argumenterar f r att f l mna blodprov
1499356 hela familjen blev slagen och satta i tv olika celler utan att ha r tten att g p toa utan fick kissa p golvet och sova p det familjen blev kraftigt kr nkt fr n b rjan till slut i 11 timmar
1499357 han kom emot mig med h nderna och mamma gick emellan han slog henne ver munnen s kraftigt att hon ramlade omkull sedan sparkade han p henne
1499358 man k nner sig maktl s de skriver att jag v grat l mna urinprov fast jag tydligt minns att inget ens bett mig om det de ljuger ihop en historia till sin f rdel
1499359 tycker att det r synd att man inte kan k nna f rtroende f r s kallade tj nstem n
1499360 jag har aldrig varit i klammeri med r ttvisan s jag visste inte vad jag hade att f rv nta mig en sak r var s ker jag vet att jag inte gjort n got
1499361 detta utl ser ett raseriutbrott och kommer v ldigt ov ntat och hastigt till uttryck i form av ett angrepp mot delar av min kropp

1499366 large gender differences in the propensity to choose challenging tasks appear to be driven by gender differences in risk aversion and in confidence about the ability to perform a new and potentially difficult task
1499367 however the authors examine an environment in which women and men perform equally well and in which issues of discrimination or time spent on the job do not have any explanatory power
1499368 large gender differences in the propensity to choose challenging tasks with men choosing the hard task on average 50 percent more often than women for any given performance level

1499381 it was saturday morning at the cabin luke and his cousin adam went snorkeling about 100 feet off the dock and noticed a large fish hanging out in a rocky area
1499382 luke came back all excited and told his mom i am going to catch that big fish today
1499383 with no fishing boat available and the rocky area too far for casting from the dock luke put on his snorkel gear and while carrying his fishing pole in his right hand snorkeled out to the spot where he had seen the fish
1499384 in about 6 feet of water luke happened to find a rock to stand on dropped his line and seconds later snagged the fish
1499385 he snorkeled back to the dock as fast as he could with bending pole in hand and fish on the line
1499386 we guessed the smallmouth bass to be about 20 inches in length and 3 pounds
1499387 seibel is a straight shooter you know he wears the company shoes but hes going to tell it like it is more times than not

1499389 baj la bolsa por ventas puntuales de acciones selectivas el volumen de negociaci n es bajo no ha habido noticias que muevan el mercado

1499391 con trazos super antiguos pero que eran los que despertaron en muchos el af n comiquero que ahora cultivan con los trazos estilizados
1499392 claro eres muy chiquita para tener historia con esa canci n

1499397 he said wed be ok once the storm passed over
1499398 but when we got here and saw people boarding up the windows my wife got a little nervous
1499399 the winds were blowing too hard out of the north
1499400 i think post storm is the time communities really need to come together and people need to be surrounded by their peers
1499401 thats what im trying to allow here allow people to tell a good story or a bad story but everybody has a story that has to be told
1499402 that intersection has flooded all my life but with the new drainage project kicked in it didnt flood

1499412 im disappointed because im hurt i got left hand hurt and my right hand i know im going to get suspended but not like for five days maybe three or two games i agree with that but five games i think is a lot
1499413 i thought i might get suspended but i wasnt sure for how long
1499414 five days is a long time i was surprised it was that for that long still everything is in the beginning stages im not an expert on it
1499415 this is my 20 something year in the big leagues and i still dont understand what common sense they have when they make those decisions
1499416 we just dont know how he is going to respond so its a difficult situation ive got to be a realist and i cant see danny playing this weekend because hes not even headed a ball yet as a forward you have to head the ball and until he can do that i cant play him
1499417 we didnt want him to join in the training session because we want to make sure he recovers hell be fine for saturday
1499418 hes out of contract and back home so its a chance for us to have a look at him
1499419 wasnt a brilliant actor he made 23 films all of which are pretty bad
1499420 to get to a point where we never tell them to stop

1499425 the nation knows that the cornish pasty yorkshire pudding haggis and fish and chips are great british dishes but all too often the faggot is left off that list
1499426 its unfair because faggots were a british delicacy long before any of the others
1499427 the great british faggot is full of flavour and a great belly warmer at this time of year
1499428 this is a fundamentalist religion which can never evolve democratic states

1499440 f brica da lactogal encerra em dezembro afectando 80 trabalhadores
1499441 tap pede sugest es aos trabalhadores para reduzir custos e recuperar da crise financeira
1499442 the variation stems fundamentally from the greater result from our holdings which is due to the impact a sharp increase in the price of raw materials had on inventories
1499443 ive always said in order for us to be really what we need to be we need other guys to be able to close games i didnt know we would be forced into that
1499444 its going to be important that some guys step up
1499445 ive closed a few games before so that definitely helps did it a little bit in college
1499446 it was the second floor and it was really crazy we were like oh hi but she was so sweet she was very nervous
1499447 we dont expect it so for us its so cool to be nominated

1499454 ive always have my laptop with me and a pen
1499455 i think it would be so cool to meet rihanna
1499456 if he was about to be charged no one who knew him well was aware of that and i dont believe it
1499457 fbi officials believe they cant risk the embarrassment of losing track of hatfill even for a few hours and then being confronted with more anthrax attacks
1499458 we moeten onze positie op cuba en in andere landen herstellen
1499459 ik ben van mening dat de weg van de dialoog de enige is die op lange termijn vruchten kan afwerpen
1499460 we hadden dat probleem met de kroonprins veel eerder moeten uitvechten
1499461 het is te laat om nu nog iets te kopen
1499462 de europese prijsvechters die jarenlang hun winsten spectaculair zagen toenemen zijn nu de eerste die in het rood duikelen
1499463 zij hebben veel last van een afname van het aantal passagiers
1499464 het is maar zeer de vraag of speculatie de oorzaak is van de hoge olieprijs de oproep onderstreept slechts de crisis
1499465 even op en neer voor een avondje praag zit er in de toekomst niet meer in en voor het tweede huisje in frankrijk pakken we niet meer het vliegtuig daarvoor wordt vliegen simpelweg te duur
1499466 asperges uit peru tijdens de wintermaanden zullen hier niet meer zo goedkoop zijn
1499467 de toename van het aantal ouderen in het westen zorgt voor minder mobiliteit de inrichting van toestellen wordt daarop aangepast niet voor niets introduceerde klm onlangs een mogelijkheid tussen
1499468 als ik moet zorgen dat ik niet leef om te kunnen leven waar dient het dan allemaal toe
1499469 er is geen wet tegen buitenlanders ze komen hier met een stapel geld en kopen huizen appartementen en bedrijven op de rechten van geboren russen worden met voeten getreden
1499470 verder is het voor nog eens tien procent van de bedrijven de vraag hoe ze het jaar financieel afsluiten
1499471 het aantal ondernemingen in deze sector daalt al enige tijd ten gevolge van schaalvergroting
1499472 nu de gasprijzen zo sterk zijn gestegen hebben tuinders nauwelijks geld over voor investeringen in nieuwe en energiezuiniger technieken
1499473 europa amerika en australi hebben de olympische spelen gegijzeld zij haalden 85 procent van alle medailles
1499474 als de welvaart eerlijk zou zijn verdeeld zou je naar rato van het aantal inwoners moeten winnen azi heeft zestig procent van de wereldbevolking maar wint maar negentien procent van de medailles
1499475 tussen individuen uit bepaalde landen waar de omstandigheden beter zijn topsporters zijn breder opgeleid en hebben een hoge welstand de echte armen die het ver schoppen zijn toevalstreffers
1499476 als je meer investeert dan je concurrent maak je meer kans op een medaille
1499477 nederland investeert niet slecht maar niet genoeg om mee te doen
1499478 meer investeren en er meer uithalen ging op van 1980 tot 2000 nu is een mondiale sportieve wapenwedloop gaande meer investeren is niet genoeg je moet meer investeren dan je concurrent
1499479 nu is het zo dat defibrillators vooral in bedrijven winkelcentra en sportverenigingen hangen terwijl tachtig procent van de hartproblemen zich priv voordoet ik snap wel waarom ze bij bedrijven hangen die denken hier zijn veel mensen hier is de kans groot dat er iets gebeurt en dus is zon ding handig ik denk niet dat ze het als een morele verplichting zien het is ook zeker goed dat bedrijven defibrillators hebben maar zon apparaat wordt meer waard als het in een woongebied hangt een ambulance komt vaak toch later en als de eerste hulp dan kan worden geboden met een defibrillator uit de buurt is de pati nt daarmee gebaat
1499480 het moeilijke is dat nog maar twintig procent van de nederlanders weet wat het is maar dat verandert wel langzaam
1499481 wij denken dat die apparaten een toegevoegde waarde kunnen hebben er is altijd wel iemand in de buurt die er dan naartoe kan gaan en die sneller is dan de ambulance daar red je dan weer een leven mee
1499482 het hoort tot de goede gewoonten van de nederlandse pers geen kritiek te leveren op het gedrag van leden van het koninklijk huis nu moet de prins het ons niet te moeilijk maken
1499483 niet de slinkse wegen kende om al wat hij deed en kon in de etalage van de publiciteit te zetten
1499484 waardoor zal cuppen het meest in herinnering blijven door wat zijn grote talent was scherpzinnig en geestig schrijven
1499485 zon kerel met een houten been wil jij natuurlijk niet je kunt beter met mijn broer piet trouwen die heeft nog geen meisje
1499486 ik heb er geen zin in om als spion door het leven te gaan
1499487 helaas kon ik niet voorop lopen als het orkest een rondgang maakte dat zou een raar gezicht zijn geweest daarom ging ik tussen de muzikanten lopen of ik nam de solex de mensen vonden het prima
1499488 maar we blijven nazaten van de onverschrokken naerebout een vermaarde loods
1499489 daar woonde ik naast een hoge muur hier is het veel opener en er zijn meer kinderen om mee te spelen
1499490 ik ben protestant en mijn man is katholiek ik wil dat mijn zoontjes opgroeien in een neutrale omgeving
1499491 ik wil niet dat mijn kinderen opgroeien met de vraag wie is wat het gaat niet meer om protestanten en katholieken er komen steeds meer immigranten die kunnen de aandacht wegnemen van onze tweedeling
1499492 in enniskillen mixen de mensen wel maar ergens anders zal dat een stuk moeilijker zijn ze zouden het juist moeten proberen in belfast want daar is het nodig
1499493 for as the sufferings of christ abound in us so our consolation also aboundeth by christ
1499494 be careful for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be known to god
1499495 see then that ye walk circumspectly not as fools but as wise redeeming the time because the days are evil
1499496 god and mathematics both strike terror into the heart of the common humanity but the connection must surely run deeper you neednt subscribe to a personal deity to be awestruck by the astonishing patterns in the universe or to observe that they seem to be mathematical every spiral snail shell or circular ripple on a pond shouts that message at us
1499497 what are the laws of nature are they deep truths about the world or simplifications imposed on natures unutterable complexity by humanitys limited brainpower are mathematical patterns really present in nature or do we invent them or if real are they merely a superficial aspect of nature that we fixate on because its what we comprehend
1499498 because we cannot experience the universe objectively we sometimes see patterns that do not exist
1499499 one of the simplest and most elegant sources of mathematical pattern in nature is symmetry symmetry is all around us we ourselves are bilaterally symmetric there are symmetries in the structure of the atom and the swirl of galaxies
1499500 imagination is an activity of brains which are made from the same kind of materials as the rest of the cosmos
1499501 symmetry is deep elegant and general it is also a geometric concept so the geometer god is really a god of symmetry
1499502 moreover there are workmen with thee in abundance hewers and workers of stone and timber and all manner of cunning men for every manner of work
1499503 beloved i wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health even as thy soul prospereth
1499504 jeff why did you wait so long to tell me that you were coming to speak at the omaha net ug how can i get out of my pilates class at the last second

1499506 a wise man will hear and increase learning and a man of understanding shall attain until wise counsels
1499507 ask and it shall be given you seek and ye shall find knock and it shall be opened unto you for everyone that asketh receiveth and he that seeketh findeth and to him that knocketh it shall be opened
1499508 children have been the missing face of the aids pandemic and this must change
1499509 results will be measured in lives saved and lives improved
1499510 an estimated 270 000 children under the age of 15 died of hiv related causes in 2007 and 15 million children have lost one or both parents to aids
1499511 millions more have experienced deepening poverty school drop out and discrimination as a result of the pandemic gender based violence exploitation of young girls and raping babies because people believe its a cure of aids is also a continuing problem
1499512 for every person who is newly put on treatment there are nearly three new infections in people
1499513 and so the gap between those who are in need of treatment and those who are accessing treatment is getting wider and wider so we need to intensify prevention in the long term to stop this epidemic but also in the meantime we need to expand treatment three million people on anti retroviral therapy is good news but there are double as many who do not have access to treatment
1499514 for the lord is good his mercy is everlasting and his truth endureth to all generations
1499515 blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of sinners nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful
1499516 behold god is mighty and despiseth not any he is mighty in strength and wisdom then he sheweth them their work and their transgressions that they have exceeded he openeth also their ear to discipline and commandeth that they return from iniquity if they obey and serve him they shall spend their days in prosperity and their years in pleasures
1499517 we are looking into the bill but have no comment beyond that since we just got it
1499518 any intelligent fool can make things bigger more complex and more violent it takes a touch of genius and a lot of courage to move in the opposite direction
1499519 its an exciting time for him to be a parent for the first time
1499520 we certainly have had our work cut out for us
1499521 with the depth that we have weve been able to piece it together
1499522 fortunately getting some people back from their injury has helped us in that regard
1499523 we will never use injuries as an excuse for anything
1499524 were going to go into this game expecting and planning with positive expectancy to win the game
1499525 total visitor expenditures dropped by 3 4 percent during this period indicating that visitors spent more on their hotel rooms and significantly less on other items during their stay
1499526 the market today is far more complex and the loss in air seats and rapid rise in fuel costs is clearly reflected in the second quarter results
1499527 once weve gained the confidence of the people weve got more chance of doing more things
1499528 theres some bloody dead fish you have to swallow to get into government to do the kinds of things you want to do
1499529 is this what she meant when she said hard hats on is this the new dirty tactics low level that we can expect
1499530 if shes going to do everything from rort the electoral law to get journalist and author nicky hager to listen into our emails to go out there and get young labour affiliates to be bugging our personal conversations well thats her style of politics
1499531 we dont know where these recordings came from theyre lashing out and trying to divert people from the focus that senior national mps have been caught out telling the truth
1499532 i have absolutely no idea who the person is that was speaking to mr english and dr smith
1499533 who knows whether these tapes are actually sort of completely real they could well have been doctored no one really knows this stuff
1499534 the national party was very happy to use that particular recording at the time
1499535 caught out obviously planning not to tell the people about their true intentions
1499536 thats what you sort of do when you have been in opposition for a long time because government programmes get rolled out and get entrenched and people rely on them
1499537 look weve been very upfront with our agenda weve been talking at the weekend a lot about how to get new zealand moving again how to deliver infrastructure theres no hiddenness about the fact we wanted to use some debt to finance that theres no secret agenda we have an agenda that says we are going to do the right thing by new zealand
1499538 accountability and self reliance love of country working hard without making excuses
1499539 i will do everything in my power to prevent iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon everything
1499540 only casts a new infinitely repeated image through the hall of mirrors that is his political life and our media experience of that life
1499541 a proud citizen of the united states and a fellow citizen of the world
1499542 people of berlin people of the world this is our moment
1499543 the young law professor stood apart in too many ways to count
1499544 the art in the development of science and the science in the making of art
1499545 i could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a king of infinite space
1499546 in many places primates are quite literally being eaten to extinction
1499547 we knew from our own observations that there were a lot of gorillas out there but we had no idea there were so many
1499548 california deserves more from its legislators than pursuing flawed legislation state employees are facing pay cuts californias services are being scaled back and anxiety is rising in sacramento to find funds
1499549 rather than tackling real problems affecting californians they chose to waste time money and state resources it is shameful that legislators pursued personal agendas in spite of the facts
1499550 caregivers are not well served by court battles and legal fees rather they would have been far better off if state officials worked together with our industry to raise awareness about video game ratings and the parental controls available on all new game consoles both of which help ensure that the games children play are parent approved
1499551 it is unfortunate that the state is stubbornly pursuing an appeal that is likely to lead to even more court awarded fees
1499552 rnl bio is commencing its worldwide services with booger as its first successful clone
1499553 the air new zealand cup remains our premier domestic competition and we want to ensure it maintains its status as a true national championship that engenders provincial pride and rewards those players that perform in their club competitions
1499554 it is our belief that these changes and the management mechanisms will deliver on those aspirations and eliminate the sustainability issues that have challenged us with the current format
1499555 some of these ideas have been suggested or promoted previously and have been well supported in some of our research with rugby fans so we are excited at the prospect of putting them into action
1499556 we are very committed to ensuring that club rugby has its own time and space as we see the regeneration of the base of the game as critical to our long term future
1499557 not only does she share a few more of her alternative framing ideas

1499565 i think it will give so many people black latin asian even white people that feel forgotten hope i did not think i would see it in my lifetime and im only 34
1499566 with barack obama his becoming president is them becoming president because michelle was there from the beginning without michelle he wouldnt be there

1499628 here in america as elsewhere there will always be tremulous little people of dim intellect and hyperactive imagination burning for explanations to all lifes vicissitudes they grow impatient with learned analyses of the present they are defeated by histories that illuminate the past no species of scholarship or analysis could ever satisfy them for they need that wondrous explanation that will quiet all their fears thrill them with villains to revile and never tax their feeble powers of intellection

1499635 for centuries prior to the coming of christ the high priest represented gods people once a year as he entered the holy of holies to make atonement for their sins the holiest man from the holiest tribe offered the holiest sacrifice in the holiest place for the holiest people on earth to attempt to draw near to god in any other way or by any other means would result in certain death leviticus 16 2 now jesus has entered a holier place the heavenly sanctuary having atoned for our sins and having torn down the veil separating us from god

1499659 the worlds climate warmed from 1680 up to 1940 but since 1940 its been cooling down the evidence for warming is because of distorted records the satellite data for example shows cooling
1499660 theres been warming no question ive never debated that never disputed that the dispute is what is the cause and of course the argument that human co
1499661 temperatures declined from 1940 to 1980 and in the early 1970s global cooling became the consensus by the 1990s temperatures appeared to have reversed and global warming became the consensus it appears ill witness another cycle before retiring as the major mechanisms and the global temperature trends now indicate a cooling
1499662 the accepted global average temperature statistics used by the intergovernmental panel on climate change show that no ground based warming has occurred since 1998 there is every doubt whether any global warming at all is occurring at the moment let alone human caused warming
1499663 the two main scientific claims of the ipcc are the claim that the globe is warming and increases in carbon dioxide emissions are responsible evidence for both of these claims is fatally flawed
1499664 the blind adherence to the harebrained idea that climate models can generate realistic simulations of climate is the principal reason why i remain a climate skeptic from my background in turbulence i look forward with grim anticipation to the day that climate models will run with a horizontal resolution of less than a kilometer the horrible predictability problems of turbulent flows then will descend on climate science with a vengeance
1499665 models used by the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc are incoherent and invalid from a scientific point of view
1499666 valencio listed off the numbers of unionists murdered in colombia like he was reading a report on the weather channel
1499667 our overwhelming conclusion is that a free trade agreement will not help the colombian people
1499668 colombia continues to be the most dangerous country on earth for trade unions and civil society activists we have also observed that colombia has no juridical framework that permits free collective bargaining
1499669 from what we have learned 95 percent of colombian workers do not have an enforceable collective agreement
1499670 we cannot accept a free trade agreement until this changes
1499671 it is easier to form a paramilitary gang than it is to form a trade union in this country
1499672 trade and investment and will help solidify ongoing efforts by the government of colombia to create a more prosperous equitable and secure democracy
1499673 in colombias current climate increased foreign investment will not lift all boats
1499674 colombia is offering canada an fta because it really wants the u s congress to reconsider its opposition to such a deal
1499675 we are not clear where this legislation will go in canada
1499676 colombia imposes tariffs averaging 11 percent on industrial goods 17 percent on agricultural and 15 to 20 percent on cotton yarns and paper products
1499677 the proposed agreement would benefit companies and workers in a wide range of industries including the automotive sector steel chemicals public infrastructure development oil drilling mining and advanced manufacturing such as mining machinery and equipment
1499678 when the station first opened in 1998 there were only 16 000 residents in gungahlin so with a doubling of the population it is now time for a full time police presence
1499679 this new staffing arrangement will be in place from january next year so regardless of the outcome of the election this is the outcome we are going to see on the ground
1499680 i think whatever strategy we come up with it has to recognise all of the key threats and the most important of those are habit loss and fragmentation and the issue of disease
1499681 dogs and car hits to koalas are consequent to the loss of habitat and exposure of those populations to those threats theyre not the key threats in themselves
1499682 these populations are sick anyway they are doomed to extinction many of the smaller ones so ignoring the impact of disease is foolish
1499683 its obviously important that we address habitat issues and action to protect koalas from dog attacks and motor vehicle strikes is critically important
1499684 but ignoring the impact of disease is foolish given the levels that were seeing
1499685 what weve got to be focusing on and what is causing the greatest stress for koalas is the destruction of their habitat
1499686 now this government has shown that its not willing to protect their habitat and we saw that from premier anna blighs announcement earlier this year where she was releasing another 70 000 home sites to be cleared
1499687 we may have have a situation where wild dogs are and again that is something that we definitely need to control so that koalas and other native wildlife are protected from that
1499688 we are certainly not aware of statistics that point to increases in accidents or claims amongst this category and without that facts it looks nothing more than a revenue grab
1499689 you may well find a better price and in some cases a far better price
1499690 we certainly encourage you to switch to the best price available
1499691 interestingly our experience is that when circumstances are tough like that other people step into the breach people who are not so pushed by finances and make up for others so thats been our experience in the past
1499692 first time that weve ever heard from a government department that therell be the possibility of no flow in the mary river

1499700 there were many iraqi officials who said both publicly and privately to the cia that iraq had no wmd
1499701 efforts on the part of some in the administration to paint a picture of iraqi al qaida connections that went beyond the evidence
1499702 this is all about prepaing teachers for not only the explicit teaching of literacy and ensuring that their literacy teaching standards are the best possible but also giving them a view of the behaviour management issues and other challenges that face teachers on a daily basis
1499703 managing a large group of young people is difficult at the best of times and dealing with all the individual behaviours and the unexpected things that happen in the classroom is probably the most difficult aspect of being a teacher
1499704 regardless of whether a private person says i can fix it and do it quicker or the state says yes were going to get our act together and move on it now it needs to be done now
1499705 there needs to be action this is a high conflict point near the ettamogah pub its a tourist attraction there is a lot of local traffic as well and yet youve got something that is substandard
1499706 the fact that it hasnt been fixed to date is really quite astounding
1499707 i think this is an issue for the premier and a warning shot across everyones bows to re examine as life becomes more challenging as information gets to us quicker whether those who are charged with high office actually have enough time not only to do their job but to think about what they are doing
1499708 what we are asking for today is respect what the latino community wants today is respect how do you tell the community that c sar ch vez isnt good enough when this city has a 60 percent latino population
1499709 particularly in a market thats softening that can leave people very much exposed to a situation where theyve borrowed one hundred per cent of the purchase price but the value of the property actually falls
1499710 banks and financial institutions are actually protected against that through compulsory mortgage insurance it doesnt protect the individual

1499716 i am not going to talk about a recession wayne swan if he was consistent with his previous conduct no doubt would be trying to talk up a recession
1499717 ive been talking about the economys strengths all year wayne swans only just started to mention them

1499724 i feel very privileged to represent moms around the world i think that that was really a benefit for me in this competition because there are so many people just like myself who have a dream and set it aside to be able to raise kids which is so noble but as some point as a mom you have to realize you dont want to lose yourself within that you have to continue to fight for who you are because if youre not the strongest that you can be then youre kids wont have what they need for a foundation so its so great to be able to represent moms and to help them believe in themselves

1499730 theres no doubt about it we picked up several from different parts of the planet took them aboard our recon vessels and probed them all the way through theyre completely meat
1499731 thats impossible what about the radio signals the messages to the stars
1499732 they use the radio waves to talk but the signals dont come from them the signals come from machines
1499733 so who made the machines thats who we want to contact
1499734 they made the machines thats what im trying to tell you meat made the machines
1499735 thats ridiculous how can meat make a machine youre asking me to believe in sentient meat
1499736 im not asking you im telling you these creatures are the only sentient race in that sector and theyre made out of meat
1499737 maybe theyre like the orfolei you know a carbon based intelligence that goes through a meat stage
1499738 nope theyre born meat and they die meat we studied them for several of their life spans which didnt take long do you have any idea whats the life span of meat
1499739 spare me okay maybe theyre only part meat you know like the weddilei a meat head with an electron plasma brain inside
1499740 nope we thought of that since they do have meat heads like the weddilei but i told you we probed them theyre meat all the way through
1499741 oh theres a brain all right its just that the brain is made out of meat thats what ive been trying to tell you
1499742 youre not understanding are you youre refusing to deal with what im telling you the brain does the thinking the meat
1499743 thinking meat youre asking me to believe in thinking meat
1499744 yes thinking meat conscious meat loving meat dreaming meat the meat is the whole deal are you beginning to get the picture or do i have to start all over
1499745 thank you finally yes they are indeed made out of meat and theyve been trying to get in touch with us for almost a hundred of their years
1499746 first it wants to talk to us then i imagine it wants to explore the universe contact other sentiences swap ideas and information the usual
1499747 thats the idea thats the message theyre sending out by radio hello anyone out there anybody home that sort of thing
1499748 they actually do talk then they use words ideas concepts
1499749 they do but what do you think is on the radio meat sounds you know how when you slap or flap meat it makes a noise they talk by flapping their meat at each other they can even sing by squirting air through their meat
1499750 omigod singing meat this is altogether too much so what do you advise
1499751 officially we are required to contact welcome and log in any and all sentient races or multibeings in this quadrant of the universe without prejudice fear or favor unofficially i advise that we erase the records and forget the whole thing
1499752 it seems harsh but there is a limit do we really want to make contact with meat
1499753 i agree one hundred percent whats there to say hello meat hows it going but will this work how many planets are we dealing with here
1499754 just one they can travel to other planets in special meat containers but they cant live on them and being meat they can only travel through c space which limits them to the speed of light and makes the possibility of their ever making contact pretty slim infinitesimal in fact
1499755 so we just pretend theres no one home in the universe
1499756 cruel but you said it yourself who wants to meet meat and the ones who have been aboard our vessels the ones you probed youre sure they wont remember
1499757 theyll be considered crackpots if they do we went into their heads and smoothed out their meat so that were just a dream to them
1499758 a dream to meat how strangely appropriate that we should be meats dream
1499759 good agreed officially and unofficially case closed any others anyone interesting on that side of the galaxy
1499760 yes a rather shy but sweet hydrogen core cluster intelligence in a class nine star in g445 zone was in contact two galactic rotations ago wants to be friendly again
1499761 and why not imagine how unbearably how unutterably cold the universe would be if one were all alone
1499762 16 let the word of christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing with grace in your hearts to the lord
1499763 7 the fear of the lord is the beginning of knowledge but fools despise wisdom and instruction
1499764 5 open rebuke is better than secret love 6 faithful are the wounds of a friend but the kisses of an enemy are deceitful
1499765 17 iron sharpeneth iron so a man sharpeneth the countenance of his friend
1499766 4 the heart of the wise is in the house of mourning but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth 5 it is better to hear the rebuke of the wise than for a man to hear the song of fools
1499767 13 now the god of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing that ye may abound in hope through the power of the holy ghost 14 and i myself also am persuaded of you my brethren that ye also are full of goodness filled with all knowledge able also to admonish one another
1499768 16 all scripture is given by inspiration of god and is profitable for doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction in righteousness 17 that the man of god may be perfect thoroughly furnished unto all good works
1499769 1 i charge thee therefore before god and the lord jesus christ who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom 2 preach the word be instant in season out of season reprove rebuke exhort with all long suffering and doctrine 3 for the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers having itching ears 4 and they shall turn away their ears from the truth and shall be turned unto fables 5 but watch thou in all things endure afflictions do the work of an evangelist make full proof of thy ministry
1499770 164 seven times a day do i praise thee because of thy righteous judgments 165 great peace have they which love thy law and nothing shall offend them
1499771 17 all unrighteousness is sin and there is a sin not unto death
1499772 11 and that knowing the time that now it is high time to awake out of sleep for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed 12 the night is far spent the day is at hand let us therefore cast off the works of darkness and let us put on the armour of light 13 let us walk honestly as in the day not in rioting and drunkenness not in chambering and wantonness not in strife and envying 14 but put ye on the lord jesus christ and make not provision for the flesh to fulfill the lusts thereof
1499773 14 be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness and what communion hath light with darkness
1499774 16 this i say then walk in the spirit and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh 17 for the flesh lusteth against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh and these are contrary the one to the other so that ye cannot do the things that ye would 18 but if ye be led of the spirit ye are not under the law 19 now the works of the flesh are manifest which are these adultery fornication uncleanness lasciviousness 20 idolatry witchcraft hatred variance emulations wrath strife seditions heresies 21 envyings murders drunkenness revellings and such like of the which i tell you before as i have also told you in time past that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of god 22 but the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace longsuffering gentleness goodness faith 23 meekness temperance against such there is no law 24 and they that are christs have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts 25 if we live in the spirit let us also walk in the spirit
1499775 1 i beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of god that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto god which is your reasonable service 2 and be not conformed to this world but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind that ye may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of god
1499776 1 be ye therefore followers of god as dear children 2 and walk in love as christ also hath loved us and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to god for a sweetsmelling savour 3 but fornication and all uncleanness or covetousness let it not be once named among you as becometh saints 4 neither filthiness nor foolish talking nor jesting which are not convenient but rather giving of thanks 5 for this ye know that no whoremonger nor unclean person nor covetous man who is an idolater hath any inheritance in the kingdom of christ and of god 6 let no man deceive you with vain words for because of these things cometh the wrath of god upon the children of disobedience 7 be not ye therefore partakers with them 8 for ye were sometimes darkness but now are ye light in the lord walk as children of light 9 for the fruit of the spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth 10 proving what is acceptable unto the lord 11 and have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness but rather reprove them 12 for it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret 13 but all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light for whatsoever doth make manifest is light 14 wherefore he saith awake thou that sleepest and arise from the dead and christ shall give thee light 15 see then that ye walk circumspectly not as fools but as wise 16 redeeming the time because the days are evil 17 wherefore be ye not unwise but understanding what the will of the lord is 18 and be not drunk with wine wherein is excess but be filled with the spirit 19 speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing and making melody in your heart to the lord 20 giving thanks always for all things unto god and the father in the name of our lord jesus christ 21 submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of god
1499777 4 but ye brethren are not in darkness that that day should overtake you as a thief 5 ye are all the children of light and the children of the day we are not of the night nor of darkness 6 therefore let us not sleep as do others but let us watch and be sober 7 for they that sleep sleep in the night and they that be drunken are drunken in the night 8 but let us who are of the day be sober putting on the breastplate of faith and love and for an helmet the hope of salvation
1499778 1 what shall we say then shall we continue in sin that grace may abound 2 god forbid how shall we that are dead to sin live any longer therein 3 know ye not that so many of us as were baptized into jesus christ were baptized into his death 4 therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death that like as christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the father even so we also should walk in newness of life 5 for if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection 6 knowing this that our old man is crucified with him that the body of sin might be destroyed that henceforth we should not serve sin 7 for he that is dead is freed from sin 8 now if we be dead with christ we believe that we shall also live with him 9 knowing that christ being raised from the dead dieth no more death hath no more dominion over him 10 for in that he died he died unto sin once but in that he liveth he liveth unto god 11 likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin but alive unto god through jesus christ our lord 12 let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof 13 neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin but yield yourselves unto god as those that are alive from the dead and your members as instruments of righteousness unto god 14 for sin shall not have dominion over you for ye are not under the law but under grace 15 what then shall we sin because we are not under the law but under grace god forbid 16 know ye not that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey his servants ye are to whom ye obey whether of sin unto death or of obedience unto righteousness 17 but god be thanked that ye were the servants of sin but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you 18 being then made free from sin ye became the servants of righteousness 19 i speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh for as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity even so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto holiness 20 for when ye were the servants of sin ye were free from righteousness 21 what fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed for the end of those things is death 22 but now being made free from sin and become servants to god ye have your fruit unto holiness and the end everlasting life 23 for the wages of sin is death but the gift of god is eternal life through jesus christ our lord
1499779 15 for so is the will of god that with well doing ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men 16 as free and not using your liberty for a cloke of maliciousness but as the servants of god 17 honour all men love the brotherhood fear god honour the king
1499780 19 what know ye not that your body is the temple of the holy ghost which is in you which ye have of god and ye are not your own 20 for ye are bought with a price therefore glorify god in your body and in your spirit which are gods
1499781 22 let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water 23 let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering for he is faithful that promised 24 and let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works 25 not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some is but exhorting one another and so much the more as ye see the day approaching 26 for if we sin willfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins 27 but a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation which shall devour the adversaries 28 he that despised moses law died without mercy under two or three witnesses 29 of how much sorer punishment suppose ye shall he be thought worthy who hath trodden under foot the son of god and hath counted the blood of the covenant wherewith he was sanctified an unholy thing and hath done despite unto the spirit of grace 30 for we know him that hath said vengeance belongeth unto me i will recompense saith the lord and again the lord shall judge his people 31 it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living god
1499782 1 arise shine for thy light is come and the glory of the lord is risen upon thee 2 for behold the darkness shall cover the earth and gross darkness the people but the lord shall arise upon thee and his glory shall be seen upon thee 3 and the gentiles shall come to thy light and kings to the brightness of thy rising
