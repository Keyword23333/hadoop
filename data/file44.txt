440146 we hereby generously vow to sacrifice our time and effort to secure happiness and freedom from worry for the little people
440147 we are willing to bear the burden for them nay we are determined to bear the burden and the burden of thinking for them and nothing will get in our way that shows how much we care
440148 were tired of pretending after 70 years of careful preparation we believe the country is finally ready to deal with the truth there is no need for us to play games anymore if we can send a man to the moon we can meet our peoples needs here at home it is time for us to stand up for happiness now equal happiness for all the workers and little people 1973 2006
440149 our leaders were frankly exhausted by answering questions about how much taxes they really wanted and about how much government control over life and business they really wanted and how much they deeply care for and want to help people and especially the children they decided that it was time to play it straight and i am confident that the voters will welcome our proposals if not we will have to consider all and any necessary means to ensure true and equal happiness for all it is time to make comrade jeffersons dream a reality
440150 that is an ugly and vicious slur on our intentions we are totali carei an give us a chance to show the people how much we totally care
440151 we caringly and compassionately totally care about every tiny detail of your life so we want to know about it
440152 the person who gives up his individual self and becomes an automaton identical with millions of other automatons around him need not feel alone and anxious any more but the price he pays however is high it is the loss of his self
440153 this loss of identity then makes it still more imperative to conform it means that one can be sure of oneself only if one lives up to the expectations of others if we do not live up to this picture we not only risk disapproval and increased isolation but we risk losing the identity of our personality which means jeopardizing sanity
440154 doing a brisk walk can burn up to 500 calories per hour
440155 varying your pace throughout the exercise session stimulates the aerobic system to adapt
440156 the more power the aerobic system has the more capacity you have to burn calories
440157 they give you the best bang for the buck because they use the most muscle groups at once
440158 what makes an exercise functional is how you perform the exercise
440159 the knee should remain over the ankle as much as possible
440160 think of how you sit down in a chair only the chairs not there
440161 start by working on getting in and out of a real chair properly
440162 a lunge is a great exercise because it mimics life it mimics walking
440163 the trailing leg is the one you need to sit down on
440164 im very much into planking exercises almost yoga type moves
440165 anytime you have the pelvis and the core abdominals and back in a suspended position you have to rely on your own adherent strength to stabilize you
440166 for someone who is at a more beginning level start by pushing from the kitchen counter height then work your way to a desk a chair the floor with bent knees and finally the floor on your toes
440167 crunches can be excellent but if theyre not done correctly with the back arching they can actually weaken the abdominals
440168 its really important that the twist comes first because then its the obliques that are actually getting you up
440169 crunches work the ab muscles theyre not to be mistaken as exercise that burns the fat over the abdominals
440170 done with good technique all exercises do what theyre supposed to do
440171 there is enough evidence that high consumption of soda and carbonated beverages is associated with somewhat lower bone mass in children and thats a real concern and people should be aware of it
440172 phosphate is in milk but milk also contains calcium and vitamin d in soft drinks there is just phosphoric acid and no calcium extra overzealous drinking may lead to a phosphoric acid imbalance and if theres not enough calcium the body goes to the bones to restore the balance
440173 moderation is really important if you really like soft drinks you dont need to take them out of your diet completely but limit yourself to one or two glasses
440174 the standard recommendation is a half an hour a day for adults and an hour a day for kids but anything is better than nothing
440175 try to walk at least a half a mile a day and engage in a weight bearing exercise of some sort
440176 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills

440214 the declining price of computation communication and storage have as a practical matter placed the material means of information and political production in the hands of a significant fraction of the worlds population

440216 the vast majority of blog posts are context for newspaper articles connected consumers on myspace spend much of their time discussing and connecting with bands consumers arent creating content theyre creating content for goods

440233 i have said in the past and ill repeat again that the best reparations we can provide are good schools in the inner city and jobs for people who are unemployed
440234 lets not be naive sen obama is running for president of the united states and so he is in a constant battle to save his political life
440235 in light of the demographics of this country i dont think its realistic to expect him to do anything other than what hes done
440236 what steps should we take as a nation to alleviate the effects of racial exclusion and racial discrimination
440237 i fear that reparations would be an excuse for some to say weve paid our debt and to avoid the much harder work
440238 if we have a program for example of universal health care that will disproportionately affect people of color because theyre disproportionately uninsured
440239 if weve got an agenda that says every child in america should get should be able to go to college regardless of income that will disproportionately affect people of color because its oftentimes our children who cant afford to go to college

440248 he has three plus pitches and he had good command of them all
440249 he pounded the strike zone and made us chase hes definitely one of the better pitchers weve faced all year
440250 hopefully well get the offense going to have the chance to give the guys at the back end of the bullpen some days off
440251 i know mark murphy talked to me about it in the past how important it was for brett to continue to be part of the organization after he was done playing
440252 and frankly its good for brett brett needs to stay a part of football obviously hes a part of the green bay packers
440253 the commissioner will take no action today on brett favres reinstatement request discussions are continuing between the packers and brett
440254 there isnt a perfect solution to this but mark murphy is at least trying
440255 we know what they want and where i stand his solution although awkward and unsettling for most may be the best in the end
440256 you could hand me a billion dollars and im still going to be on the field
440257 it doesnt matter to me but everyone has different situations has different views on money money is not more important than football to me right now

440279 we have a lot of faith in him to get people out
440280 that was his ballgame and you want him to get those outs its a growing and learning experience to put him in those situations and get big outs in a tight ballgame there its his game win or lose
440281 you get put in those situations it would be easy to fold
440282 but were all competitors in here so its kind of what weve grown up doing is trying to bear down in situations when its the hardest
440283 i dont think its going to change any of our approaches
440284 in this game you can have everything going great and in a matter of five or six pitches it just kind of flip flops on you

440311 im mostly known for making sculptural work since the late 1980s but i guess ive gone through lots of transitions in the last 20 or so years
440312 i suppose i can say these abstract paintings that ive just been working on are kind of accidental
440313 i mucked around with the paint that was hanging around my studio and i kind of got more involved with it from that point
440314 whatever it is that i start doing is usually because i get fascinated by something when i showed them to other people they reacted positively and i thought well im going to keep doing them
440315 i enjoy the challenge of making them work somehow and its a very abstract or intuitional way of working and some take longer than others
440316 most of the paint is found or given to me or bought at the tip and some of it is new so its a mish mash of what i find
440317 i suppose you are an easy target to be criticised when you chop and change a lot because people can then say that this person never stays in one spot
440318 that might affect their viewing without even seeing the work im aware of that and i dont care
440319 shes so amazing ive got every album shes made i havent had an artist ive done that with for a while i feel like im a kid again with music i feel new again i feel that hunger to write great songs again its the best thing and its all thanks to stevie
440320 i dont come from a musical background in my family so its always been a process of self discovery when ive found artists on my own or someones given me a cd but the timing has to be right
440321 dale her stylist booked it but didnt realise it was hollywood florida so we couldnt go
440322 ive been writing and writing instead of zoning out when i have time off im going straight to the piano writing lyrics all the things i used to do
440323 ive got my confidence back i realise this is what im meant to do when im writing and being creative i feel as if i can do anything
440324 being on your own is so isolating though i feel very independent again i feel really creative i really enjoyed collaborating on this album delta but i want to get back to the piano and write songs by myself again get back to what i do
440325 its starting to hit but its such a big place its going to take a while
440326 i feel like a new artist over there at the moment most peoples journeys arent as disjointed as mine normally you release a record and tour it that isnt the way my life has gone i just have to go with it
440327 i have a commitment from the us company its the first time i can spend time here go and build the foundation commit to it and give it a great shot i finally feel im in the position to give the us some consistent attention
440328 i dont have any expectations im just excited i get to sing all the time theres nothing but open ears of people wanting to listen its actually a beautiful feeling you only get to discover an artist once
440329 because ive experienced that before i can enjoy it this time because i was so nervous when i started out in australia now i can come here and i know how it all works i can just sing and enjoy it
440330 weve been playing that a lot as weve gone around the us and its getting a good reaction
440331 i still believe that song is meant to see the light of day here i feel itll be a special time but the time isnt right now i want to start with in this life and build from there ive discovered recently that its all about slowly building a lifetime as an artist
440332 we had the choice to go into arenas and put on a big show but its not how i feel i need people to see me at the moment live performance is what i do best thats been my forte my whole life
440333 the music industry has all these other things like doing interviews thats something you have to learn im good at evolving to get better at these things i make mistakes and i learn
440334 its so intimate and i feel the need to connect with people on that level its not as big a room theres a lot of freedom to be the artist i am remind the people of the songs theyve got to know
440335 i like performing before i used to be so s scared i hated it so much i almost cried
440336 now i crack jokes and have a great time and its something i really enjoy and ive had the same band for a few years and we have a really nice dynamic and i feel like that makes me feel stronger as well
440337 i dont know the whole thing feels like im on the upside of it whereas before i felt more like a slave to it touring really helped the fact that people showed up was a good confidence builder
440338 that was exciting we had a heckler in melbourne who was positive but really inappropriate he ended up getting thrown out halfway through and i could hear im not f drunk from the back of the room in the middle of the most poignant moment of the set
440339 then in adelaide a girl passed out clearly im like the beatles i would like to think she fainted from the song but it was very hot in there probably wasnt the rousing chorus outro i was in the middle of
440340 i do feel like this one is a little more hopeful
440341 well i feel like the whole thing is weird cliff notes to a woody allen film anyway its kinda the sex and death and nervous energy and fear of exotic diseases album
440342 im afraid of people i love dying and i always think that if things are going well i wont be around to see it i hate that
440343 we ran out of petrol in the middle of nowhere it was pretty scary
440344 we were south of jackson it was me and band member bree
440345 he changed more the way songs sounded rather than the arrangements
440346 at the end of the day i think the hard work will pay off for us it is crucial that we work hard and remain passionate about our work its a struggle and we all work jobs
440347 the measure for us will be if it helps us really do this for a living we are coming to an age where in five or 10 years time we want to have families and id love for our music to enable us to bring those families up
440348 you spend so much time and energy in your business and you want to see a future i dont think thats an unreasonable ask we know theres more work ahead and well have to work even harder but were prepared to do that
440349 the decision to close followed the direction of our clients the editors fishing guidebook

440352 there is no constitutional requirement for a president to issue a new executive order whenever he wishes to depart from the terms of a previous executive order rather than violate an executive order the president has instead modified or waived it
440353 no one disputes that a president can withdraw or revise an executive order at any time
440354 but abrogating a published executive order without any public notice works a secret change in the law
440355 because the published order stays on the books it actively misleads congress and the public as to what the law is
440356 on rare occasions national security can justify elected officials keeping some information secret
440357 but it can never justify lying to the american people about what the law is maintaining two different sets of laws one public and one secret is just that deceiving the american people about what law applies to the governments conduct
440358 my bet is the authorities wont let them out until after the olympics

440392 all western claims to moral superiority are vitiated by the wests history of racism and colonialism
440393 there are no objective standards by which we may judge one culture to be better than another anyone who claims that there are such standards is an evil oppressor
440394 like any physical attribute if the human intellect is not yoked to and governed by the higher intelligence it runs amok and eventually goes crazy its taken some time to get there but currently the spiritually bereft intellect is basically in charge of most of the worlds influential institutions which of course means the world is in deep stew as far as definitions of the antichrist go i think this would do ok
440395 there is no god and we are his angry clowns
440396 he alone is the reality wherefore renouncing vain appearances rejoice in him

440424 offered encouraging words friday for a bipartisan energy plan that would permit oil drilling within 50 miles of floridas west coast
440425 my attitude is that we can find some sort of compromise
440426 if it is part of an overarching package then i am not going to be rigid in preventing an energy package that goes forward that is really thoughtful and is going to really solve the problem
440427 like all compromises it also includes steps that i havent always supported
440428 i remain skeptical that new offshore drilling will bring down gas prices in the short term or significantly reduce our oil dependence in the long term though i do welcome the establishment of a process that will allow us to make future drilling decisions based on science and fact
440429 we are not going to drill our way out of this problem we have 3 percent of the worlds oil reserves we use 25 percent of the worlds oil

440475 una de las hijas del guerrillero ernesto che guevara habl ante estudiantes de la universidad cat lica de asunci n donde defendi el comunismo critic a las empresas transnacionales y denost contra el ego smo era su derecho estaba usufructuando lo que disfrutamos los paraguayos la libertad de expresi n
440476 surge la pregunta de si la hija de un l der dem crata paraguayo o los mismos estudiantes que la escucharon con deleite podr an ir a hablar ante los estudiantes de la universidad de la habana para defender el capitalismo criticar a las empresas p blicas denostar contra el parasitismo o criticar la falta de derechos humanos en el paraguay de hoy se pueden propagar las m s diversas ideas sin ser condenado por subversivo o por contrarrevolucionario en cuba definitivamente no
440477 si los paraguayos queremos abandonar el pa s disconformes con lo que pasa e ir a vivir en otro lado nadie nos impedir a hacerlo los cubanos ni siquiera tienen esta libertad y deben salir de su pa s a escondidas desafiar el mar en embarcaciones precarias a riesgo de perder la vida en el intento aleida guevara por lo visto no pudo notar esta diferencia los estudiantes universitarios de la isla deben tener el derecho de escuchar opiniones contrarias a las que vienen recibiendo desde su infancia
440478 seg n aleida guevara los cinco millones de ni os de su pa s a quienes llam revolucionarios defienden el r gimen castrista es probable que as sea pues el afrentoso adoctrinamiento se inicia ya en el primer grado el fascismo tuvo su opera nazionale balilla un organismo primero partidario y luego estatal que reun a a los varones desde los seis hasta los dieciocho a os en tanto que el nazismo tuvo su juventud hitleriana en el que se ingresaba a los diez a os no hay diferencias entre los dos inhumanos m todos la movilizaci n pol tica de los ni os es com n a los sistemas totalitarios
440479 es obvio que los ni os italianos y alemanes de los a os treinta habr n amado a sus respectivos dictadores como los cubanos de hoy aman al suyo seg n la visitante porque no tuvieron la libertad de compararlos con otros l deres o elegir otros sistemas si a los ni os se suman los adultos resulta que diez de los once millones de cubanos apoyar an al gobierno de los hermanos castro ese masivo respaldo del cual hay serios motivos para dudar implicar a que el gobierno es bueno el argumento falla porque aun cuando sea cierta tal afirmaci n la bondad de un r gimen no depende de su popularidad sino de que en l se respeten los derechos y las libertades de las personas si lo decisivo fuera la adhesi n popular habr a que inferir que el fascismo y el nazismo fueron encomiables pues parece que tuvieron el amplio apoyo de los italianos y de los alemanes respectivamente

440533 what do you think about gun control give me the short answer
440534 if you try to take our firearms we will kill you
440535 archaeology doesnt object as history doesnt nudging the special relationship into the post ironic
440536 i would say that excavation is the better of the two methods because excavation is more focused than field survey and therefore has the potential for revealing a greater number of artifacts
440537 survey is an excellent fast method to get an overall picture of what may be below the surface however it is not very reliable when it comes time to interpret artifacts excavation although more time consuming provides accurate contexts from which artifacts can be interpreted
440538 in survey we can see a much broader picture but in excavation we are limited to a very small space
440539 each method is able to produce results that contribute something significant and unique to ones understanding of the past
440540 one is not necessarily any better than the other rather the information obtained from survey and excavation culminate in a heightened understanding allowing for a more intricate historical interpretation
440541 until a person actually participates in field survey they will never know how tedious it is one constantly focuses on the ground in front of them scanning the ground for artifacts
440542 during the survey i became very easily distracted and i think this is one of the reasons why i did not find many artifacts
440543 the patient frustration of scraping away dirt with a trowel for hours on end and finding nothing cannot be fully understood without hands on experience
440544 i thought i would be able to deal with the tediousness of excavation but after the first hour i found that very difficult
440545 disappointingly we were not given guns and whips but instead little triangularly shaped excavating implements called trowels if i ever felt emasculated at any point in my life it was never more intense than when holding that little trowel in my hand and scraping away at the bottom of a square shaped trench
440546 another one of the difficulties faced by the archaeologist that cannot be adequately learned through reading but must be experienced first hand are environmental or climate factors in our case it was cold very cold
440547 had it not been so cold i wouldve been much more thorough in my scouring of the ground
440548 we experienced extreme cold combined with wind and some snow which served to discourage the expedition
440549 as for me i learned what i subconsciously already knew archaeology is technical precise and nerve wrecking for the sake of my nerves and for the sake of the data being collected i think i am much more suited for armchair archaeology and cups of tea
440550 there is something embedded in the archaeological process that lends adventure to every bucket of dirt the excitement is almost oppressive even if all we uncover or observe is dirt that very dirt was once tilled built upon and tread over by figures in antiquity
440551 it is one thing in theory to examine the stratigraphy in a photograph or see pictures of the trenches it is completely different when your hand is in the dirt and you see the differences in the soil right in front of your eyes archaeology is often misrepresented and misunderstood but if someone actually takes part in it they begin to understand what it is truly about
440552 its not archaeology if you dont get your hands dirty

440583 be clear that restricting dynamism at the os level will not impact dynamism at the programming level
440584 why shouldnt the average developer begin to think in terms of lightweight asynchronous services
440585 after all thats the migration path were seeing on the web
440586 this allows existing development tools to be easily repurposed while a lot of the complexity is hidden from the developer that is using it we essentially see declarative programming replacing imperative programming at the os level

440638 the administration of justice took on more of the characteristics of civil law not surprising since it was drafted by members of congress many of them lawyers who had served in the armed forces during the war under the uniform code greater latitude was given to peremptory challenges and the finding of guilt required a two thirds majority in all but capital cases

440690 this is a wonderful charity i am so proud to be part of bringing joy and hope
440691 well i dont agree with mccain on everything but i trust him
440692 i do this because i love making and performing music not because i want to see some magazine comment on what designer dress i have borrowed for an event or the latest happenings in my personal life i want people to discover my music and hopefully fall in love with it
440693 its extremely exciting i cant believe its taken this long but ive already started putting the set list together and there are so many songs to play i have been inspired by some intimate shows i have done recently here and internationally and by playing theatres i can be closer to all the people who have taken my record home
440694 you dont feel that connection when people take your albums home theres
440695 i would have liked to tour earlier but im just glad i can finally mtell people the dates when they ask me when im touring next there are lots of songs from over the years people know to sing along with and im going to do some fun covers but i dont want to spoil the surprise
440696 it was only once we started talking about the idea that it sank in how many singles theres been from what about me right through to loud and in pieces all these songs mean so much to me and showcase a journey that ive been through with my songwriting and recording my career in general its great to have the new songs on the album as they are just a taste of what weve got planned for next year
440697 we are delighted and pleased to have two such exciting artists as jack and alicia who were inspired by our film to join together their extraordinary talents in creating a unique sound for quantum of solace
440698 when i got back the albums first mix i was in tears because it was the kind of music i wanted to make it was familiar yet modern
440699 the whole thing was a trip im still figuring out how i want to write about it and talk about the last few days that were so amazing i had an extraordinary tour you share experiences with other artists that is almost unfathomable it was about bringing people together and empowering them and making them feel good about themselves it was an amazing time in vancouver i had to stop the show and say excuse me excuse me do you realize what were doing it was like oh my god we are doing this together i hope people feel empowered about it and they got the information they need to achieve what they needed in their life
440700 i was inspired by their humour by their sensitivity by what they wrote about by their energy by tegans zest for her work and her life and the way she looked at things also just the passion for their own work is inspiring i must say that it also changes your own perspective on yourself
440701 unfortunately sometimes ill look on youtube and think oh my god why did i think that looked good why did i wear that so i cant really look at myself and live in the moment and let it go because youll never be who you think you are in your mind in your mind youre much taller laughs and your hair is long and flowing you look completely different
440702 i had done two special projects at last and body acoustic which were great to do but i wanted to get back to making my regular work again and writing
440703 i always love working in a community of artists its always a petrie dish it doesnt always come out the way you like but this one did when i got back the first mix of high and mighty i was in tears because it was the kind of music i wanted to make it was familiar yet modern
440704 i tried not to make every vocal the same i tried to find the character of the story teller i especially loved in raging storm to sing in octaves in one song and the low octave in the next song lay me down it had intrigued me to bend over backwards to find these different characters it was tricky it was like a big old puzzle but we got it together
440705 i was taking pictures like that because at a certain time in history as women we were sold a bill of goods
440706 but this woman in the picture is still holding onto her disco ball her joy shes still having a party wherever she goes and shes going to keep her joy no matter what i thought using props like gnomes and the disco ball and the broom were pretty funny
440707 there was never a compelling offer put on the table
440708 to this day i cant tell you why they did that

440731 its hard being a triple jumper if i had won the 100 at the trials life would be a lot easier than it is right now to break down the barriers for triple jumpers so we get the same opportunities and success as sprinters that would be awesome not just for me but for us as jumpers
440732 my favorite event in gymnastics was vault i was good at it because i was fast
440733 i think thats what kind of got me going with the jumping stuff that feeling of running as fast as you can and flying through the air i definitely think it has a ton to do with my success now
440734 when i think back on that its pretty amazing because i dont think the expectation after that surgery was that i would be anywhere close to doing what i am doing
440735 so having that perspective is great for me to have

440925 the real risks of potential complications such as scarring permanent disfigurement infection dyspareunia and altered sexual sensations should be discussed in detail with women seeking such treatments

440936 according to a government report last year the city of dillton reduced its corporate tax rate by 15 percent at the same time it began offering relocation grants and favorable rates on city utilities to any company that would relocate to dillton within 18 months two manufacturing companies moved to dillton where they employ a total of 300 people therefore the fastest way for beauville to stimulate economic development and hence reduce unemployment is to provide tax incentives and other financial inducements that encourage private companies to relocate here
440937 hes been in excruciating pain for the last 10 days
440938 i think for our own benefit its going to make it a little easier to answer some of these questions once we are briefed by our medical staff but you have to be concerned
440939 hes dealt with a lot of pain this season and hes played when he hasnt felt right
440940 hes caught a lot of heat from people for that and these are the same people who show others lots of patience i have a problem with that
440941 although the multimineral zorba pill was designed as a simple dietary supplement a study of first time ulcer patients who took zorba suggests that zorba actually helps prevent ulcers the study showed that only 25 percent of those ulcer patients who took zorba under a doctors direction developed new ulcers compared to a 75 percent recurrence rate among ulcer patients who did not take zorba clearly then zorba will be highly effective in preventing recurrent ulcers and if health experts inform the general public of this fact many first time ulcers can be prevented as well

440953 the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
440954 mr president former secretary of state colin powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
440955 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
440956 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
440957 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective
440958 governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government

440961 we cannot dedicate we cannot consecrate we cannot hallow this ground the brave men living and dead who struggled here have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract

440963 they pick the most dangerous enemy they can find and its themselves
440964 the tools of conquest do not necessarily come with bombs and explosions and fallout there are weapons that are simply thoughts attitudes prejudices to be found only in the minds of men
440965 for the record prejudices can kill and suspicion can destroy and a thoughtless frightened search for a scapegoat has a fallout all its own for the children and the children yet unborn

440968 the world ignored hitlers words and paid a terrible price
440969 we must remember always that accusation is not proof and that conviction depends upon evidence and due process of law

440974 gosh i dont climb the 30 foot speaker stack anymore you do what you can do you know but the basic idea is to try to deliver something other than a corpse basically which is what i find at most rock shows you basically get a funereal experience disguised as fun
440975 i do everything my mom used to tell me to do im just 50 years too late
440976 emotionally ive been kind of lucky maybe that i didnt really begin to get worldly success until later in life
440977 im still experiencing for the first time things that my contemporaries were experiencing when they were in their late 20s and finally making it in rock n roll
440978 its kind of like an eden you know so i dont wear clothes a lot here
440979 in fact theyre even starting to play some of the stuff at commercial radio
440980 im still not that big a deal but this is the most if you want to say as far as numbers and all that im more popular now than ever
440981 im wary of titles the music that i was playing in the 60s and 70s bears little or no resemblance to whats called punk music at the turn of the century or in this new century
440982 its pop music thats all its pop music done with a certain kind of hair gel
440983 athletes who make the unacceptable choice to cheat should recognize that there will be consequences those consequences can be severe including the loss of medals and results were in full support of this action in other matters like this in the past weve worked with the ioc to make certain medals will be returned and well do so again
440984 patience accomplishes its object while hurry speeds to its ruin
440985 so the biggest question now is when is manny going to get a haircut
440986 es ist schade den dritten qualifying durchgang um eine hundertstelsekunde verpasst zu haben aber wir hatten erwartet dass es so eng wird
440987 wir k nnen dennoch gl cklich sein besonders angesichts der tatsache dass ich es gestern lediglich geschafft habe neun runden zu fahren dies bedeutet dass wir heute gute arbeit geleistet haben
440988 nun k nnen wir in bezug auf die benzin menge f r das rennen tun was wir wollen und hoffentlich werden wir eine gute strategie finden ich habe an diesem wochenende noch einen longrun zu fahren aber ich denke dass wir einen guten kompromiss zwischen der geschwindigkeit im qualifying und rennen finden k nnen da wir ein gutes setup f r das auto haben
440989 ich hatte auf dem weicheren reifen zu k mpfen da er mir keine haftung verlieh
440990 ich rutschte mehr herum und hatte kein gef hl f r das auto zuvor war ich in einem sehr gut ausbalancierten auto sehr gl cklich gewesen aber danach bin ich mir nicht wirklich sicher was passierte ich bin entt uscht denn selbst wenn der dritte qualifying durchgang sehr schwierig zu erreichen gewesen w re konnte ich im zweiten qualifying durchgang die zeit meines ersten qualifying durchgangs nicht mehr erzielen
440991 ich denke dass wir uns heute gut davon erholt haben dass wir gestern mit vettel nicht ausreichend fahren konnten
440992 bourdais leistete gute arbeit aber er bekam den letzten qualifying versuch nicht richtig hin im gegensatz zu seinem teamkollegen war er nicht in der lage den vorteil der zus tzlichen haftung aus dem weicheren reifen zu holen

440996 that was a very good qualifying session for me and im obviously delighted we made a good start in first practice yesterday the team did a good job overnight and we made the right choice over set up it wasnt easy today because we had a very tight choice over tyres so we had to make a close decision for every lap but in the end my engineers stayed cool and got it right in q2 the car felt perfect then on the very last lap it was a bit trickier again because the tyres didnt behave quite as well but im happy with p5 we are in a great situation for tomorrow
440997 im glad to be in the top ten but that was a difficult qualifying session and p9 is disappointing since this morning i have struggled for grip and balance and unfortunately we werent able to find the answers in time i had the same problems in qualifying so we will have to investigate that tonight im happy for timo who has done a good job this weekend and it is clearly important for us to score as many points as possible for the constructors championship overtaking is very difficult here but tomorrow is a very long race and we will see what we can achieve

441001 old photostat copies from the 20s and 30s are shiny like that so this is why youd think this is not a real document
441002 you can see where theyre dipping the pen in to get more ink
441003 is such a good sound and it brings us all together which is what black history month is supposed to be about doran b2
441004 you see we have done it you can even see the mountains
441005 how long can i stare at the cute girl in the coffee shop before she gets creeped out and leaves
441006 how many times can you change your order at starbucks before the barista gives you the finger
441007 take out some of that ping pong aggression on their north korean brethren

441009 old photostat copies from the 20s and 30s are shiny like that so this is why youd think this is not a real document
441010 you can see where theyre dipping the pen in to get more ink
441011 i would say its probably a souvenir copy done at the time and signed at the time
441012 no hanging system for textiles and no possibility of this in the current store
441013 the overcrowded nature of all of our current storage facilities makes it dangerous to handle artwork other than when absolutely necessary
441014 i want to put a sense of urgency into everyone i meet
441015 americans are used to flipping a switch and having air conditioning turn on
441016 but it costs money and energy to have that luxury
441017 you can tell what time of year it is by which blocks light up left to right
441018 he literally needs to give them a new life rather than allow them to be smelted or turned into landfill
441019 he can look at material and recognize atypical applications for it that is what distinguishes his creativity
441020 he always goes back to the fact that he was headed down a different path before the accident
441021 the accident took away his actions and allowed him to realize he could do even more because the predictability was gone and he had to be creative and inventive
441022 people come in here and are like joe there is something missing
441023 but i like that i like breaking rules duchamp was a rule breaker
441024 people see what i am doing as plumbing as solar as furniture
441025 duchamp took those guys who said what was and wasnt art and put them on their heads
441026 its a railing its a banister its a drying rack and i like the way it looks
441027 an outdoor sculpture made from salvaged steel hose likely used in the petrochemical industry
441028 duchamp opened a myriad of doors for artists to rethink their relationship to the real world and the ordinary forms we pass by every day
441029 old photostat copies from the 20s and 30s are shiny like that so this is why youd think this is not a real document
441030 you can see where theyre dipping the pen in to get more ink
441031 i would say its probably a souvenir copy done at the time and signed at the time
441032 you have so many great items there i like the bathtub alarm and the cold pack from there for the giveaway id like the velcro id bracelet blue thank you
441033 the sound of father pauls new choir is an order of magnitude better than the old one

441038 i would say its probably a souvenir copy done at the time and signed at the time
441039 by the end of the week i felt physically sick of myself i was totally consumed of myself to the point that i couldnt take it anymore
441040 i suddenly thought that if i cant take it what would everyone visiting the show think
441041 hopefully though they will be able to cut off that tracey bit and just see the work
441042 hopefully they will feel the highs and lows going up and down with each room and will have a different emotional experience in each one
441043 the bed was a fantastic seminal piece of work and the tent everyone i have ever slept with 1963 1995 1995 was great and another seminal piece for me but there was a lot of work done before that its not all about me and hopefully people will discover some of my other work
441044 the last kind of artist i would ever want to be is an impressionist so it is really the polar opposite to this show and i think thats great
441045 it would be nice if everyone who went to see the impressionists also came here and vice versa
441046 edinburgh is definitely ready for this exhibition people here are less cynical maybe they are very straight with you and say what they think and i have had a lot of people saying they really like my work
441047 held a tinkle while at a new coffee shop for an hour because i didnt feel comfortable asking the hot barista where the restroom was
441048 a vacation is having nothing to do and all day to do it
441049 i am convinced that here in this country the re election is bad but when you are down i hvent met any dictator whos been against it neither any social democrat who has resigned not even fidel castro has resigned
441050 i am no longer performing here tonight my brother i have been dropped from the programme
441051 they told me that they now only want the musicians whom they started this programme with two years ago
441052 but it is very unfair because this is supposed to be a fundraising show where musicians are supposed to be treated fairly
441053 i was surprised to hear the organisers saying that some of us upcoming groups were no longer part of the programme
441054 i had come prepared to make a contribution to this worthy cause and little did i know that i was never going to take part
441055 imagine i was practising vigorously for this particular show and had to incur a lot of expenses just preparing for this gig only to be told on the last minute that i had been dropped
441056 they want to play on their own established musicians because from the information i have gathered some of them were responsible for removing us from this programme
441057 some of the big guys musicians who benefitted by acquring housing stands from a show we performed in last year are the same people who have removed us from the programme
441058 i wanted to take part in this event not because i was going to earn anything as you know that it is a charity show all i wanted was to make a contribution to my community
441059 we were attending a meeting when mashakada expressed his desire to cut the number of performers to a limited number
441060 he carried a copy of the programme to his home and the following day we were told that we had been removed from the list of performers
441061 i was one of the victims but dr moyo who wanted variety during the show intervened on my behalf and that is how i finally got to take part
441062 but the truth is that i wasnt supposed to have performed especially after alick macheso had performed because one cannot perform after michael jackson
441063 from our side we wanted everyone to play but time was very limiting
441064 we received very overwhelming interest from various musicians who wanted to play during the gala and we appreciate their show of interest but time was not just enough for them all so had to finally settle for those who played on that night
441065 we however appreciate their continued support and we hope next time around we would make efforts to make sure that they play
441066 it was after the musicians and us had sat down and decided that the number be curtailed to a manageable number but no harm was ever meant against those who were left out
441067 all those who did not perform were not on the programme that had been advertised the original programme comprised macheso zakaria manyeruke chipanga and myself
441068 the people who also started with this programme were five so we had to stick to that number its not bad for upcoming musicians to play but in this case time did not permit them to take part
441069 also another issue is that when fans start seeing a lot of small bands performing at a big show where big artistes have been advertised as the performers they begin to suspect of double booking saying we would be performing somewhere on the same night that is why we were there by 7 pm
441070 but we made efforts to squeeze some of them when we would get some time that is why takesure muronzi had to start the programme while pio farai macheka had to play after everyone of us had played because we actually looked for them to play later and only discovered macheka alone was still around
441071 nobody has up to now tried to prove by calculus the existence of louis xiv yet all in their right mind agree that his existence is as certain as pythagoras theorem what i have said of a historical event can be applied equally well to a great number of questions in religion in ethics in politics therefore let us remain convinced that there are truths other than those of geometry and realities other than those of sensible objects
441072 let us therefore cultivate with fervor the mathematical sciences without wishing to extend them beyond their range and let us not imagine that one could attack the problems of history with mathematical formulas or that one could sanction the principles of morality by theorems of algebra and calculus
441073 i still remember the embarrassment of an excellent teacher of quantum mechanics whom i asked in class as to why certain very useful polynomials are called hermite polynomials he answered that probably because of their mysterious character they were found to resemble those elusive figures called hermits

441117 im totally disappointed it looked quite good at the end of yesterdays practice and also this morning but on my last lap in q1 i had four cars in my way most of them at least tried to give me room but it still cost me time towards the end of the lap i had one car in front which was on an out lap he saw me and accelerated he then overtook sebastien bourdais before the last corner and then sebastien was right in my way i was hoping it was so obvious he would be penalised right away and i could still get into q2
441118 it was a very tight battle at the front with marginal time differences we expected to see mclaren on the front row robert did a very good last lap and secured fourth which means he will be starting in between the two ferraris certainly nicks result is disappointing he complained several times about traffic on his last and important fast lap and missed getting into q2 we should be very happy if he scores a point from this grid position
441119 i struggled with the option tyre as it gave me no grip and i was sliding around more and had no feel for the car i was very happy in a well balanced car earlier on but after that im not really sure what happened i am disappointed because even if q3 would have been hard to reach i could not match my q1 time in q2
441120 it was a difficult qualifying for me aside from plenty of traffic i didnt really manage to find the right balance on my last set of option tyres both factors compromised my run we now need to go through the data and work out whats happening in order to get the most out of the car for tomorrow
441121 it looked quite good at the end of yesterdays practice and also this morning but on my last lap in q1 i had four cars in my way most of them at least tried to give me room but it still cost me time
441122 towards the end of the lap i had one car in front which was on an out lap he saw me and accelerated
441123 he then overtook sebastien bourdais before the last corner and then sebastien was right in my way i was hoping it was so obvious he would be penalised right away and i could still get into q2
441124 this was certainly one of my best qualifying sessions so far this season
441125 a shame to miss out on q3 by one hundredth but we expected it to be tight
441126 we can be happy though especially given i only managed nine laps yesterday it means we did a good job today
441127 now we can do what we like in terms of fuel load for the race and hopefully find a good strategy ive yet to do a long run this weekend but i think we can find a good compromise between qualifying and race pace and we have a good set up on the car
441128 i struggled with the option tyre as it gave me no grip and i was sliding around more and had no feel for the car
441129 i was very happy in a well balanced car earlier on but after that im not really sure what happened
441130 we had a difficult start to this weekend but weve improved throughout the sessions and learnt a lot of things along the way
441131 we therefore werent looking too bad for qualifying i made a mistake on my fast lap in q1 and lost two and a half tenths in one corner so my q1 time did not show the true potential of our car
441132 we then had a good chance of making it into q3 but a hydraulic problem meant i couldnt go out at all in q2 which was disappointing its pretty interesting here tyre wise as both are very soft on this track but the harder ones were better for me today
441133 aside from plenty of traffic i didnt really manage to find the right balance on my last set of option tyres
441134 i got the most out of the car today and its encouraging to see we were only three tenths away from the top ten as it has been a while since we were that close im on the dirty side of the grid which is a disadvantage but i am sure we can have a good race tomorrow from here nonetheless
441135 choosing which tyre to run was a really tough decision today and it was a difficult qualifying session
441136 with that went the chance to progress to q2 and the time from my previous run puts me in 18th place on the grid the lap was going quite well but a mistake at turn 11 meant that i had to abort the lap i have to settle for 18th place today and turn my focus now to the race
441137 p12 is where we hoped to be today so yes we have moved a little closer to the middle order again
441138 unfortunately both cars will be starting from the dirty side of the grid so holding position into the first corner will be key
441139 im happy to have qualified in p12 today after a good lap on the final run in q2 pushed me a few places up the grid
441140 weve definitely made some progress with the new developments to the car and in particular the new rear suspension is working well and this has enabled us to improve the car step by step over the weekend
441141 i got the most out of the car today and its encouraging to see we were only three tenths away from the top ten as it has been a while since we were that close im on the dirty side of the grid which is a disadvantage but i am sure we can have a good race tomorrow from here nonetheless
441142 choosing which tyre to run was a really tough decision today and it was a difficult qualifying session
441143 i felt the supersoft option tyre was working slightly better with the car so i stayed with that for my final run
441144 that was a pretty good qualifying session quite straightforward it would have been nice to have had a bit more pace in q3 but q2 and q1 went well for us im disappointed im on the wrong side of the grid an odd number is always better but we definitely have a chance to get something from where we are so well see how we go tomorrow
441145 i was losing a little bit of time in each of the sectors and i couldnt deliver that last little bit of lap time because i was bringing the mid corner speed too low its tough from thirteenth for sure but the hungarian race can be unpredictable so lets see
441146 a respectable qualifying from mark in a very tight field were close to our nearest rivals in renault and toyota which should make for an interesting race tomorrow david isnt far off the back of that group he unfortunately didnt have a good second run in q2 but well be fighting hard tomorrow
441147 it would have been nice to have had a bit more pace in q3 but q2 and q1 went well for us
441148 im disappointed im on the wrong side of the grid an odd number is always better but we definitely have a chance to get something from where we are so well see how we go tomorrow
441149 conditions today were tough but actually that was the maximum we could do the target was to do a 1min 21 7 or 21 8 and we did a 21 6 so that was the most we could get out of the car the balance was not too bad but unfortunately the grip level is still very poor i think were not particularly quick round here and we have to accept that but we are still quite close we are to the others
441150 i think we expected to slip back a bit from our closest rivals due to not running the seamless shift and that proved to be the case giancarlo pretty much got the most out of it he could but unfortunately adrian couldnt get a decent lap together so was a way off his optimum time we know our race pace is better than our qualifying pace and although this makes life difficult at this track we have to get two cars to the end and do a professional job

441156 my sister in law julie says that the primary school in her suburb is excellent its a half hour drive away from our place but they teach philosophy and they have a great kindergarten teacher shes been there for years
441157 but in the school just around the corner from your place the kindergarten teacher might turn out to be newly graduated full of energy skill love and enthusiasm and your child might totally adore her and have the best possible introduction to schooling
441158 same the best i can say to you is make it easy for yourself and zachery send him to the school nearest to where you live youll save yourself untold hours delivering him and picking him up not just from school hell be going to birthday parties and sleepovers at his friends houses

441160 and can you imagine how much less traffic there would be on the roads if every child could walk to school the benefits for the environment that our children and grandchildren will inherit choosing a school or a teacher is a lucky dip anyway so make it easy for yourself

441232 when you get good athletes like williams theyre going to be good in just about any sport you shove them into and i think he could be good enough in rugby union to one day become an all black
441233 if he puts the work in and stays humble and things went his way with injury and that theres no doubt he could go as far as he wants
441234 if sonny bill plays the game hell probably be playing at 13 or on the wing just to try and get a feel of the game
441235 and to have a bloke like tana who is probably the best in that position in the last two decades you couldnt have a better bloke to try and get you on your feet and running in rugby union
441236 any team that gets him would be rubbing their hands together and really looking forward to playing with him
441237 so sonny bill should steer away from no 8 for me it would be a big no no
441238 its a position you need to grow up playing youre a key linkman at no 8 and you make probably the most crucial decisions on the field with the nine halfback and 10 five eighth
441239 hed make a good no 6 thats a better position to learn the game but if it were over to me id put him in the centres thats his position i reckon
441240 players like sonny and gaz mark gasnier and craig gower last year theyre at the top of their sport at home and i dont think the transition will be hard at all
441241 elvs or not theyre quality players and theyll adapt and flourish

441246 the game was a mirror of last week in sydney they didnt allow us to build pressure and as a consequence we were unable to get into the game it was one of those days when you try to create pressure and intensity and nothing works
441247 tactically we played very well and learnt a lot from last week
441248 we changed the game plan and we executed it well which was pleasing it was a big lineout game for us

441259 my brother and i get into an argument with a taxi driver about getting our change back he got on his mobile phone and all of a sudden at least 15 greeks with baseball bats batons and chains appeared out of nowhere
441260 they demanded we hand over our wallets i think they look for any excuse to hook into tourists
441261 my brother was able to run and seek help and so only received minor cuts and bruising but in trying to reason with these thugs they punched kicked and belted me with their weapons for a 10 minute period
441262 i tried to run but it was very late at night and we were in a secluded part of the island with no one else around to help i was bashed so severely that my eye socket was smashed to pieces requiring major surgery when i returned to london where i am currently living
441263 my whole eye orbit had to be reconfigured with three metal plates and 12 screws the experienced surgeon who operated on my eye told me that i was lucky to be alive and just as lucky to still have my eye
441264 thats the thing thats frustrating and disappointing at our end the door was open for a long period of time we had some fruitful discussion and i felt we were making some headway bulldogs chairman george peponis and i gave him a lot of time and an opportunity to talk about a range of issues
441265 a week is a long time in rugby league let alone four more years
441266 from day one ive thought it seems like hes troubled i would like to understand why he has done this if he had a change of heart then certainly we would want to sit down and listen to him we would want to see him back in the nrl and we would want to see him happy if sonny was to say hes sorry for what he did and admit that he made a mistake we would definitely be a party to hearing him out
441267 if sonny bill were to play overseas certainly the door would be closed on his returning to the nrl at any time in the future let me repeat its far more fundamental than a question of contracts and money this is about someone who has walked out on his teammates two days before a big game
441268 walking out on your teammates mid season without notice flies in the face of why kids are encouraged to take up team sport certainly the door would be closed in my view for any return to the nrl for someone who has done something like this
441269 they just said the french hospitality is second to none youve got to remember he does have a dream at the end of the day he wants to be an all black he wants to represent his country
441270 he wants to reach the greatest heights in another sport were in a different age youve had michael jordan who wanted to be a baseballer youve got anthony mundine a great rugby league player becoming a boxer were in an era where people want to transcend the sport theyre in some people maybe want to enslave people so these people dont go and fulfil their dreams
441271 i think you have been misinformed here as i have not been instructed by sonny bill williams or his agent to provide any legal advice
441272 tana umaga is one of my clients but i have not been instructed to provide any legal advice to tana in this regard either
441273 he said ive spoken to sonnys management group and he made sure to keep me in the loop of what was going on
441274 i was sitting in my office early in the week and he came up the stairs hed been doing an extra training session over and above what the other guys were doing he walked in with sweat dripping off him and said whats happening with the team this week im ready to go im ready to go give me a shot at it
441275 im just glad to get off the nudie run at the end of the year

441278 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
441279 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
441280 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
441281 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
441282 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
441283 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
441284 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
441285 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
441286 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
441287 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
441288 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
441289 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
441290 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
441291 im not barack obama but you can be sure he approved this message
441292 hes not from central casting when it comes to candidates for president of the united states hes new to washington yes hes african american
441293 theres no doubt that when it comes to our treatment of native americans as well as other persons of color in this country
441294 weve got some very sad and difficult things to account for
441295 are good schools in the inner city and jobs for people who are unemployed
441296 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
441297 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
441298 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
441299 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
441300 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis

441306 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
441307 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
441308 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
441309 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
441310 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
441311 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
441312 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
441313 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
441314 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
441315 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
441316 this is not true only the black out arts festival was cancelled all of the other events are still happening this is the problem in the black gay community too much gossip and ridiculous behaivor without any fact checking to make sure that what you are saying is actually true did it even occur to any who wrote this to actually check and make sure that any of this was actually the case pride in the city is happening just not one section of it if you are going to spread this kind of stuff please get your facts correct david watkins chairman board of directors pocc
441317 from what ive heard most of the other events will also be canceled
441318 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
441319 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
441320 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
441321 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
441322 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
441323 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
441324 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
441325 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
441326 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
441327 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
441328 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
441329 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
441330 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
441331 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
441332 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
441333 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
441334 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
441335 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
441336 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
441337 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
441338 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
441339 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
441340 who are open to doing something on the production side
441341 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
441342 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
441343 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
441344 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
441345 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
441346 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
441347 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
441348 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
441349 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
441350 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
441351 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
441352 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
441353 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
441354 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
441355 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
441356 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
441357 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
441358 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
441359 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
441360 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
441361 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
441362 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
441363 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
441364 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
441365 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
441366 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
441367 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
441368 skyrocketing gas prices is the most important issue on the minds of my constituents in georgia and all over the country
441369 there are several issues that need to be addressed with respect to the issue of skyrocketing gas prices
441370 supply and demand dictates the price of everything in our economy weve got to have the capability of providing the kind of supply that is demanded by americans
441371 weve got to continue down the road of researching and developing more alternative fuels
441372 weve also got to implement conservation practices from an individual and household standpoint
441373 another common sense solution republicans have offered and ive supported is an immediate federal gas tax holiday
441374 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
441375 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
441376 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
441377 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
441378 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
441379 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
441380 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
441381 and when it is done if it is done it is well that it be done well

441405 i believe that when the rest of the report drops it will show the civil rights section was compromised in terms of their core historic mission which is representing minorities
441406 i am hearing preliminarily those class of cases were not prosecuted which if true is a remarkable turn of events
441407 he took multiple phone calls from domenici concerning iglesias urging that he be replaced and has admitted that president george w bush spoke with him about the problems with iglesias
441408 gonzales has even admitted that one of the reasons that iglesias was fired was because sen domenici had lost confidence in iglesias
441409 while these allegations are troubling under any analysis a thorough and independent investigation is necessary to determine whether criminal laws have been violated
441410 under the broad language of the federal statute regarding obstruction of justice it would be hard to imagine that corruptly influence would not extend to firing of the united states attorney in the middle of a public corruption case because he lost confidence of a senator who sought to manipulate the indictments for crass political advantage
441411 mcnulty also may have sought to conceal an important phone call from sen domenici regarding u s attorney iglesias instructing then justice department liaison to the white house monica goodling to delete reference to that call from his senate testimony
441412 lam alerted the justice department that fbi agents would at her direction search foggos home in connection with the duke cunningham case and the following day former gonzales chief of staff kyle sampson e mailed the white house from the attorney generals office that we have a real problem with carol lam and urged that she be dismissed at the conclusion of her term
441413 given the wide publicity of the cunningham political corruption case it is reasonable to conclude that gonzales mcnulty sampson and other senior justice department officials were aware of the underlying judicial proceeding being handled by carol lam
441414 there is no way he is going to right this ship thats sinking in five months
441415 the allegation is false i didnt withhold information from the deputy
441416 proceeded to say let me tell you what i can remember and he laid out for me his general recollection of some of the process
441417 he asked me if i had any reaction to his iteration
441418 i havent talked to witnesses because of the fact that i havent wanted to interfere with this investigation and department investigations
441419 i was not involved in seeing any memos was not involved in any discussions about what was going on
441420 i felt nothing was going to happen but i was told that the people who work in those offices are professional career people they are not politicos
441421 this is not going away with a new president the fact that the justice department is the agency that enforces individual rights and they were violating those rights is just a really awful situation what do you do when the watchdog isnt watching but is in fact violating the rights
441422 not one person in my neighbourhood has a building permit
441423 illegal building is simply a pretext for destroying palestinian families homes and lives
441424 the demolitions are part of a policy to stop the natural expansion of palestinian communities in and around jerusalem freeing up the maximum amount of land for use by israeli settlers
441425 the demolitions increase the pressure on palestinians to move into the west bank so that they will lose their residency rights in the city
441426 this is the first time a government has supported the rebuilding of an illegal palestinian home demolished by the israeli authorities
441427 we estimate that there have been at least 18 000 homes destroyed during the four decades of occupation
441428 most demolitions are of multi storey buildings that are home to several families meaning that well in excess of 100 000 palestinians may have been made homeless by israeli administrative policies
441429 its one thing to destroy a home supposedly built illegally by a palestinian but another to destroy one built with money provided by the spanish government
441430 it was an eye opener to realise that the principles of urban planning we are taught at the university are being used by the israelis but for exactly the opposite purpose from the one usually intended the planning rules here are designed not to improve the palestinians lives but to make them more miserable
441431 imagine your children leaving in the morning for school and returning later in the day to find their home their whole world has disappeared while they were gone

441433 68 olympics salute deserves no honor espn ignored the violent extremism behind the black power salute given by two medalists at the mexico city games
441434 the stench of self congratulation surrounding espns decision to honor smith and carlos is thicker than the air in a locker room after double overtime the argument that smiths and carlos critics must dine on their denunciations rests on an inch deep nostalgia and the triumph of celebrity culture
441435 in todays culture is it even worth trying to remind people that the black power salute was for those who brandished it most seriously a symbol of violence rhetorical political and literal against the united states it was the high sign for a racist militia the black panthers which orchestrated the murder of innocents and allied itself with americas enemies
441436 public enemy number 1 and set out a plan to kill their leaders and destroy their organization
441437 but even a more benign view of the salute shouldnt obscure the intense contradictions of espns decision to honor carlos and smith
441438 including jesse owens and jackie robinson to be uncle toms
441439 i do support the individuals who decided to make the sacrifice by giving up the chance to win an olympic medal i respect their courage we need to understand the reason and frustration behind these protests it was different in my day perhaps we lacked courage
441440 another important distinction that should matter is that this was 1968 not 1938
441441 but the question is not and never has been whether the olympic ideal can be achieved but whether it should be pursued by embracing those who spat on that idea it seems espn thinks the answer is no

441443 no intention of moving the bill through his committee unless the language is first altered to ensure that there is no possible way it could be construed as authorizing any type of military action against iran

441446 western europeans regard 10 to 12 years as extremely long term even for offenders sentenced to life
441447 we try to keep his spirits up by saying something will change in the law
441448 should suffer harsh criminal consequences for acting as a lookout in this case but to suggest that he ought to receive a sentence of life without the possibility of parole i find to be very very hard to swallow to the point where i can describe it as unconscionable
441449 he was convicted for the crimes of being poor and mexican
441450 hes just one of many there are so many people serving long sentences for nonviolent crimes hes a regular guy who was trying to make a living

441462 it started with my relationship with jude yes it increases your visibility yes being on the cover of a magazine appeals to studios but it plays against your work a lot of people still feel im not a proper actress
441463 i think people were hoping for a lot more than you get i think that caitlin was quite a sexual person and i know that she did well dabble a bit and besides female friendships can often be tactile and intimate
441464 it was a great school and it made me learn how to share and to understand women wed have the odd snog together
441465 it wasnt all the time but you know who hasnt dabbled

441470 preciso tomar esses novos resultados e dar lhes uma nova forma pois todos continuamos esperando que haja uma vacina capaz de solucionar todo o problema
441471 necess rio sentar se e reconhecer que prov vel que nos pr ximos 20 ou 30 anos n o se encontre uma vacina o que for ar a ado o de outros esfor os preventivos
441472 o v rus circula pelo sangue mas os anticorpos da vacina atuam e o matam
441473 este conceito n o pode ser transferido ao caso da aids pois significaria que hipoteticamente todos teriam que ser hiv positivo
441474 uma vacina que crie imunidade esterilizante ou seja que em contato com o v rus o mate uma possibilidade que atualmente n o vi vel
441475 o mundo cair em um problema como o da frica onde economicamente n o sustent vel
441476 o mundo vive um momento em que temos n o grandes mas importantes descobertas sobre como funciona o v rus e como produz dano
441477 provavelmente s o capazes de prolongar a vida de um paciente por cerca de 30 anos com excelente qualidade uma vez que o indiv duo infectado tome o rem dio quase perfeitamente
441478 claro que as companhias farmac uticas s vezes cobram pre os muito altos por esses rem dios mas as companhias de gen ricos n o desenvolvem rem dios novos
441479 contou com a prote o dos estados unidos at 2000 ano em que a cia interceptou conversas telef nicas que mostravam claramente que ele seguia dirigindo pessoalmente seu partido
441480 uma fonte bem informada dos servi os de intelig ncia americanos
441481 n o estou seguro de que tenha existido um documento escrito confirmando este acordo mas sei que holbrooke admitiu que garantias verbais foram fornecidas a karadzic nas mais altas esferas do poder
441482 em novembro de 2000 no momento das elei es gerais na b snia a cia ficou sabendo que karadzic seguia dirigindo o sds partido nacionalista s rvio fundado por ele no in cio dos anos 90 apesar do acordo estipulando que ele n o devia se envolver com atividades pol ticas
441483 em 2000 houve uma reuni o do sds na localidade de bijeljina leste da b snia dirigida pessoalmente por karadzic ele dava instru es aos militantes e designava os membros da dire o que deviam ser substitu dos al m das pessoas que deviam ser nomeadas
441484 karadzic esteve pessoalmente envolvido em todas as atividades do sds os americanos ficaram furiosos quando perceberam e decidiram ent o suspender a prote o informal
441485 praticamente n o h ocorr ncias de viol ncia sexual desde que os imigrantes fugiram por causa da onda de ataques xen fobos em maio em johanesburgo
441486 as pessoas conhecem a doen a mas n o querem falar dela
441487 fui infectada porque meu marido come ou a manter rela es sexuais com outras mulheres
441488 quando me disseram n o fiquei assustada nem tive medo porque nem sabia o que significava o hiv e o que mais me afetou foi que as pessoas n o queriam sequer se sentar a meu lado
441489 as coisas mudaram muito nos ltimos anos porque agora a sociedade aceita mais a doen a embora o processo seja muito lento
441490 ficam enfurecidos ao saber que t m a doen a e infectam outras pessoas porque algu m lhes infectou
441491 antes me preocupava muito porque via que estava doente e que n o tinha comida para dar aos meus filhos mas agora estou bem
441492 antes n o havia tanta delinq ncia e est vamos muito mais seguros
441493 mais se comprometeu com o fim da epidemia desde o in cio
441494 o n mero de pessoas infectadas por ano supera o das que iniciam tratamento
441495 das necessidades das comunidades homossexuais e o respeito a seus direitos
441496 que despreza e rejeita qualquer outra express o de masculinidade diversa
441497 as propostas de abstin ncia uso de preservativo e fidelidade n o s o suficientes para ter respostas com mais qualidade temos de dar um salto em conhecimento das culturas sexuais e construir respostas preventivas
441498 a regi o do mundo mais afetada pela epidemia da aids
441499 a mulher est em uma situa o de absoluta desigualdade com rela o ao homem
441500 nos dois ltimos anos a mortalidade relacionada com a aids caiu de 2 2 milh es para 2 milh es como resultado da amplia o progressiva do tratamento anti retroviral
441501 o caso de botsuana que chegou a 90 de cobertura da nam bia com 83 e de ruanda com 71 evidenciam que poss vel proporcionar acesso universal que salve milh es de vidas
441502 estamos fazendo muitos progressos mas devemos ser realistas ainda resta muito a ser feito
441503 conseguimos transformar uma doen a que era uniformemente letal em uma patologia cr nica com a qual podemos conviver
441504 a necessidade de a o de todas as partes envolvidas tanto em n vel universal como em n vel nacional regional e local
441505 cada minuto que perdemos cada coisa que n o fazemos se traduz em perda de vidas humanas em infec es e mortes que poderiam ser evitadas
441506 a situa o t o dram tica na frica e a epidemia est crescendo de forma t o r pida no sudeste asi tico e no leste da europa que s vezes nos esquecemos de olhar para a am rica latina
441507 quanto mais pessoas com o v rus forem tratadas haver menos gente a transmiti lo
441508 a situa o da vacina vai mal porque at o momento n o fomos capazes de encontrar um sistema que funcione mas isso n o quer dizer que devemos abandonar a id ia
441509 as na es do g8 est o deixando para tr s os compromissos assumidos anteriormente
441510 muito importante entender que isso seria uma trag dia se ocorresse sobretudo pela frica que onde a quest o tem mais impacto
441511 we started to talk about the situation in my country about the youth what we say and also what we see on television
441512 fire on the mountain is an awareness song bringing people back to reality that things are happening that things are not getting better but we can actually do things by getting conscious and trying to make an effort to change it and thats what the song is about
441513 that wasnt consciously done i just wanted to sing and say something but in saying it i wanted to be happy in my melody and my approach to it
441514 i wasnt that happy because i thought i was missing out on a lot of things and sometimes i had to go to school and it wasnt fun then because it was very cold and i had to wake up to have my bath with cold water and there wasnt even much food so it wasnt really fun for me
441515 now when i look back i say thank you to my parents i dont know another life apart from that
441516 when he gave me that new technology it changed my life
441517 believe me it feels good to have an identity like a passport
441518 i like to be relevant the people who i listened to while growing up they had something in their music that people reacted to positively or negatively
441519 music has a message in it no matter how it is be it popular music or funk or hip hop it has a message in it
441520 music pretty much controls the world too the way we think the way we dress the way we act
441521 even africans themselves are not usually that excited about where they come from because either they are blinded or they are just frustrated and let me tell you the truth theres a lot of frustration going on out there
441522 i always ask myself if you want to sing you better have an effect just like when you eat food its either good or bad its either delicious or really really stale i want to have something i want to do something to people just as much as it does to me
441523 i guess you could say my life did become before david and after david
441524 when i met him he had only just come out of institutions i was 52 and it changed my life completely it was a very immense journey
441525 david had a recital on saturday night at the melbourne arts centre it was his first solo concert in australia since shine and ive never heard him play better in australia
441526 everyone has the right to criticise a performance but to say his music is unemotional there was so much poetry beauty and excitement in his playing the other night and of course he had a standing ovation
441527 everybody smiles at each other when he finishes playing music just flows through davids soul hes worked with conductors overseas whove said that working with david is the greatest musical experience of their lives
441528 he doesnt fit any textbook medical term i always describe him as delightfully eccentric we need eccentric people we dont want everyone just the same
441529 and to be honest i cant see one coming up either
441530 that turned out to be a big joke suddenly david decided he didnt want to be semi retired he wants to play until he drops
441531 four weeks in all i could think was just hold on hold on tight because youre losing yourself
441532 you just start to get really tight your neck your glands
441533 in real life you probably go through a hard time emotionally every now and then but you dont do it from every angle 50 times 12 hours a day for four months
441534 taking naps and talking to other actor friends who had taken on hard roles
441535 i used to watch star trek when i was a little kid and wow here i am only my ichat screen is not as big as captain kirks
441536 i cant believe it came out the way it came out because i was nervous about it
441537 it was a little rough going because everybody was from all corners of the universe
441538 you know i always feel bad about my accent but hanging around with you guys youve all got a really strong accent so i dont feel so bad any more
441539 she tries to ditch me every once in a while but i keep popping up
441540 shed dress us alike and theyd say oh are they twins and shed say almost actually there isnt an almost either you are or youre not
441541 thats the last thing you want to be listening to at a party its a real downer
441542 oggi atterrato un tale un po fuori dal normale un tipo straordinario altroch era un po sul verdino piuttosto piccolino non vorrei esagerare ma quel piccolo spaziale era forte forse pi di superman riusciva a sollevare come fosse naturale una nave piena zeppa di caffe
441543 ma si trattava di un lampadario che faceva da calendario e di notte al buio no non cera pi
441544 theres community and theres marketplace never confuse the two blog to grow community but create tools to convert some of your people into customers should that be a business need
441545 we most certainly write it for pleasure above all else
441546 readers thinkers people who like to laugh people who like to share and learn
441547 well im reading this at almost 9pm so my day is nearly done
441548 in the american journal of medicine it is found that laughter increases secretion of catecholamines and endorphins which in turn increases oxygenation of the blood relaxes the arteries speeds up the heart decreases blood pressure which has a positive effect on all cardiovascular and respiratory ailments as well as overall increasing the immune system response
441549 its not enough to have you also need to hold whether love talents or possessions love must be enjoyed talents and possessions used take action

441551 mijo en esta vida tu puedes hacer lo que quieras puedes cumplir lo que tu corazon decea
441552 i believe that every individual can be what he or she wants to be with one important caveat they have to have the physical and to a lesser extent the requisite mental capabilities
441553 at the risk of sounding really corny i believe each person has their own
441554 as long as i am bringing smiles to faces its all good
441555 where has the time gone where am i going is that really what i want to be
441556 when you wake up in the morning and simply go through the motions without paying any real attention to much of anything
441557 a call or e mail from my husband at work for no particular reason and thank yous from the kids for just the regular ol day to day stuff are big boosters for me too
441558 youll go from a pr1 to a pr4 in no time

441565 lifting the ban would create new opportunities for american workers and businessmen
441566 but the leaders of the democratic congress have refused to allow a vote
441567 the president knows that the impact of any new drilling will be insignificant promising savings of only pennies per gallon many years down the road
441568 im always going to want to drive a race car
441569 to go out there and do the full time schedule and all the commitments that comes with that no way mark is an amazing guy he really is hes an incredible race car driver but to have the strength to push and go do all the other things it takes to be competitive and the commitments that come along with that i give him a lot of credit
441570 its definitely new and different for me but at the same time i really enjoy where im at in the sport and at hendrick and im just comfortable with the way things are going
441571 i certainly have no regrets and have accomplished more than i thought i ever would im not sitting here going boy i wish i was 21 again im pretty happy with where things are
441572 i start to get to where i can count on one hand the guys that i started racing with theres just not a lot of guys that are on a full time basis that are out there from when i started
441573 so that makes you feel a little bit older that means one of these days that im going to be the only guy that is still out there from when i started that could happen in the next couple of years

441578 i kept standing six feet one instead of five feet two
441579 the kind of guy who tries to win you over
441580 what phair and the rest of the world didnt expect
441581 was just how many women would hear guyville and think hey i live in a mans world too and thats a problem in situations where equality is assumed but men still dominate women occupy a strange space between the center and the margins they can express opinions but theyre not dictating the terms of the conversation
441582 phair found a way to live with her own psychic disparities

441598 lo que hemos hecho es conseguir un catalizador para el ox geno que no necesite una adici n de energ a extra de hecho con nuestro catalizador casi se consigue emplear el 100 de energ a requerida por la electrolisis en descomponer el agua en ox geno e hidr geno
441599 el xido de n quel no puede usarse en todas partes y mucho menos al aire libre por el peligro de corrosi n incluso el di xido de carbono en el aire reacciona con l para crear carbonatos
441600 pero nuestro catalizador usa materiales abundantes que no reaccionan con el medio ambiente
441601 como nuestro catalizador es ecol gico las m quinas que realizan la electrolisis pueden ser mucho m s baratas que las empleadas en la actualidad ya que no necesitan ninguna protecci n para evitar contaminantes medioambientales
441602 los fabricantes de c lulas solares pueden a adir electrolizadores super baratos a sus sistemas para lograr que funcionen las 24 horas del d a durante el d a descomponiendo el exceso en hidr geno y ox geno y durante la noche recombin ndolos en pilas de combustible para generar electricidad

441672 was inspired by partisan divisions inside the broadcasting board of governors
441673 to resist economic pressures to make additional cuts which could remove it from the top ranks of american journalism

441682 between them theyve put out something like a hundred books and in all those years of chatter all those forests laid to waste neither of them has been able to come up with one lifelike woman character
441683 certainly women arent their strong suit but the daughter in american a destructive force but shes also very human shes not nice but shes very real
441684 thats debatable and second even if its true it proves my point you can only point to one example to make your case and shes an example of woman at her most destructive
441685 maybe i can get you on charlies show you and one of the patriarchs

441688 for information about the rally or what else you can do to fight the genocide see with african union peacekeepers scheduled to leave darfur at the end of this month and the sudanese government mounting a military campaign against helpless and starving darfurians the horrific situation there may very well turn even worse for hundreds of thousands of people

441696 the great red zone that voted for bush is clearly ready for war the decadent left in its enclaves on the coasts is not dead and may well mount a fifth column
441697 although age is the driving force behind usage patterns of these technologies it is clear that a fundamental shift has taken place in all of our lives about what it means to communicate in the 21st century
441698 the great unwashed those people who have never sent a text message is getting smaller all the time
441699 we think thats do to the increased use of social networking and blogs are an integral part of using them
441700 two years ago asking people about blogs people were shaking their heads i think now its taking off because social networks are taking off rss feeds which make reading blogs easier have become an integral part of the way people communicate and exchange content people may have been doing it before but may not have realized it now theyre recognizing it for what it is
441701 the most important property of these junctions is that their conductance is at least an order of magnitude higher than comparable junctions made using thiol anchoring groups
441702 under our experimental conditions the junctions can be held stable for a very long time which when combined with the cryogenic temperatures used allows us to make detailed investigations
441703 what makes this work stand out is that the scientists have presented a new way to attach organic molecules to metal electrodes by forming a direct metal carbon bond and have proven conclusively that their devices have a strong metal molecule link
441704 this enables them to overcome a major barrier in molecular based devices
441705 they call me the seeker ive been searching low and high

441718 wir hatten einen schwierigen start in das wochenende haben uns aber stetig verbessert und dabei viel gelernt
441719 im qualifying sahen wir daher nicht so schlecht aus in meiner schnellen runde in q1 machte ich einen fehler und verlor in einer kurve zweieinhalb zehntel die zeit aus q1 zeigt also nicht das wahre potenzial auf wir hatten eine gute chance auf q3 aber ein hydraulikproblem hinderte mich am fahren in q2 das war entt uschend von den reifen ist es hier sehr interessant weil beide reifen recht weich sind aber der h rtere funktionierte bei mir heute besser
441720 nicht nur dass ich in viel verkehr steckte ich schaffte es einfach nicht auf dem letzten satz der weicheren reifen eine gute balance zu finden beide dinge st rten mein qualifying wir m ssen nun die daten analysieren um zu verstehen was passiert ist damit wir morgen das beste aus dem auto herausholen
441721 i think the fbi owes us a complete accounting of their investigation and ought to be able to tell us at some point how were going to bring this to closure
441722 its been seven years theres a lot of unanswered questions and i think the american people deserve to know more than they do today
441723 we need to know exactly how mr ivins was involved if he was involved how this relates to the case and information that so far has been withheld from the american people ought to be provided
441724 we are saddened by his death and disappointed that we will not have the opportunity to defend his good name and reputation in a court of law
441725 client has a history dating to his graduate days of homicidal threats plans and actions towards therapists
441726 i am not trying to prevent him from publishing this stupid book but if they publish it there will be consequences and there will be a libel action
441727 the falsehoods relating to our client and his friends the various statements that invade their privacy and statements about security precautions that remain in place
441728 unless you are prepared to take these steps i shall issue proceedings against you
441729 auf meiner letzten runde waren mir vier autos im weg
441730 die meisten haben wenigstens versucht mir platz zu machen aber etwas zeit kostet das immer
441731 gegen ende der runde hatte ich einen vor mir der auf der auslaufrunde war er hat gas gegeben als er mich sah und dann vor der letzten kurve sebastien bourdais berholt und der stand mir dann komplett im weg ich hatte gehofft dass das so offensichtlich war dass er daf r direkt eine strafe bekommen w rde und ich doch noch in q2 rutschen w rde
441732 tatsache ist dass nick mehrfach ber behinderungen geklagt hat auf der runde das hat ihn sicher das weiterkommen gekostet ob das vermeidbar war oder nicht kann ich gar nicht einsch tzen
441733 ich habe ihn hinter mir gesehen aber was h tte ich machen sollen ich habe auch versucht meine runde zu fahren da war ein ganzer pulk an fahrern ich war auch einer davon
441734 to reduce pressure on prices we need to increase the supply of oil especially oil produced here at home
441735 lifting the ban would create new opportunities for american workers and businessmen
441736 but the leaders of the democratic congress have refused to allow a vote
441737 the president knows that the impact of any new drilling will be insignificant promising savings of only pennies per gallon many years down the road
441738 a shame to miss out on q3 by one hundredth but we expected it to be tight we can be happy though especially given i only managed nine laps yesterday it means we did a good job today now we can do what we like in terms of fuel load for the race and hopefully find a good strategy ive yet to do a long run this weekend but i think we can find a good compromise between qualifying and race pace and we have a good set up on the car
441739 i struggled with the option tyre as it gave me no grip and i was sliding around more and had no feel for the car i was very happy in a well balanced car earlier on but after that im not really sure what happened i am disappointed because even if q3 would have been hard to reach i could not match my q1 time in q2
441740 conseguimos transformar uma doen a que era uniformemente letal em uma patologia cr nica com a qual podemos conviver

441748 he tried to reach through the window and put the cruiser in park
441749 she was only armed with a hammer we didnt want to get somebody hurt by trying to chase her
441750 a couple minutes later the englewood officers and the dayton officers were talking about the case when one of them looked up and saw a pink fuzzy slipper disappearing into the front seat of the englewood cruiser
441751 maybe she thought we had cleared the scene and shed be able to get back in her own car
441752 i will not give the administration an excuse for its failure
441753 im not going to be diverted for a political tactic from a course of action that has a big picture view a vision about an energy independent future that reduces our dependence on fossil fuels and focuses on those renewables that are protective of the environment
441754 a solid majority of americans want us to have more drilling for more american made energy and they arent going to take no for an answer
441755 speaker pelosi senators harry reid and barack obama are defying the will of the american people and theyre doing so at their own risk
441756 the true cost of this measure to venezuelan society is open to debate
441757 its possible that santander saw the clouds gathering on the venezuelan economy and is relieved to just get out
441758 but this move also destroys some of the pragmatism recently introduced into policies trying to stave off a crisis among the banks
441759 he figured out pretty quickly that a martial reputation would work to his professional benefit
441760 when he came on to the schwarzenegger 2006 gubernatorial campaign i told his junior staffers if you show up late to a meeting steve will waterboard you
441761 it shows theres a shortage of liquidity in the system
441762 what that tells you is that theres an increasing number of banks that the fed is classifying as unsound or inadequately capitalized
441763 it shows theres a shortage of liquidity in the system
441764 the voters are hearing my message of drill for american oil build nuclear it also shows that toms support is collapsing people are recognizing that his backing by extreme environmental groups is coming home to roost
441765 on july 9 1994 workers world party chairperson sam marcy sent the following statement to comrade kim jong il the central committee of the workers party of korea and the state funeral committee of president kim il sung
441766 dear comrade kim jong il the national committee of workers world party extends our deepest condolences on the passing of the great leader of the korean people comrade president kim il sung comrade kim il sung devoted his whole life to the korean peoples struggle for national self determination and the international working class struggle for socialist emancipation with his leadership the korean people defeated the japanese colonial occupation and soon after brought about the first defeat of the u s imperialist military machine for over 40 years since the armistice the u s military has continued to occupy the south of korea with troops and nuclear weapons this occupation has been the chief obstacle to peaceful reunification of korea and poses the chief danger of a new war on the peninsula
441767 workers world party values our close comradely relations with the workers party of korea very highly we are proud to have known kim il sung as a great leader and a comrade in the international communist movement with comradely solidarity sam marcy chairperson workers world party
441768 there can be no better way for the united states supreme court to exercise its new self appointed war powers than to house the prisoners whom it has taken a greater role in overseeing
441769 should the detainees need the use of restroom facilities they shall use the facilities inside the united states supreme court building
441770 boy those french they have a different word for everything
441771 opposes drilling in anwr and he warner is all over the place on offshore drilling
441772 i said i was going to cut the car tax and i did it
441773 i kept my word i do what i say i am going to do
441774 when he warner ran for governor he said he was for car tax relief
441775 but he warner became an opponent of car tax relief when he became governor
441776 that 300 foot long stone wall was the gift of philanthropist ellen browning scripps who hoped to make the beach a safe place for children to play and swim in 1931 the state deeded the land to the city of san diego with a few conditions including its exclusive use as a public park and childrens pool
441777 the outline of the pictish fort is now clearly defined by the circle of ancient trees here
441778 they give the place a magical atmosphere and it has been a very worthwhile few weeks work
441779 the fort here was a very high status residence probably home to an ancient prince or king
441780 this was home to the elite there are only three or four sites like this in aberdeenshire the north east is an area where you merely need to scratch the surface to come on archaeology and none are known outside aberdeenshire
441781 my name is ozymandius king of kings look on my works ye mighty and despair
441782 he was a bulls eye prophet if he told you something you could pretty much bank on it
441783 so nobody really thinks that bush or mccain have a real answer for the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky thats essentially the argument theyre making
441784 so what theyre saying is well we know were not very good but you cant risk electing obama you know hes new he doesnt look like the other presidents on the currency hes got a funny name i mean thats basically the argument hes too risky
441785 you are blind to your own deeply ingrained racism it is who you are because you are white
441786 wanted to know where the good press coverage was coming from
441787 obama is a certifiable moron this third rate fool couldnt competently work as a busboy at mcdonalds the affirmative action candidate

441791 trotz der massiven nutzung von regenerativen energien und der umsetzung von energieeffizienzma nahmen steht ab 2012 nicht mehr gen gend gesicherte kraftwerksleistung zur verf gung um die jahresh chstlast effizient zu decken
441792 nach neuen berechnungen wird die stroml cke noch gr er wenn die geplanten kraftwerke in hamburg moorburg mainz wiesbaden und der neue block im hessischen werk staudinger nicht gebaut werden k nnen dann fehlen k nftig 15 000 megawatt und die lassen sich nicht einfach durch den weiteren ausbau von erneuerbaren energien ersetzen
441793 wir m ssen uns entscheiden entweder wir bauen hocheffiziente kohle und erdgaskraftwerke oder wir m ssen die atommeiler l nger laufen lassen
441794 die vorhandenen und geplanten europ ischen kraftwerke reichen schon ab 2015 nicht mehr aus um eine verst rkte nachfrage aus deutschland zu decken

441796 whether or not hes peytons father will be the question
441797 but we will find out one way or the other
441798 the current u s international debt path is damaging to future u s living standards this damage has not materialized yet because interest rates have been at historic lows in recent years making u s borrowing extraordinarily cheap however it would be irresponsible for economic policy makers in the united states to bank on these low rates as soon as the interest rates begin to rise in the united states the full consequences of the u s international debt problem will have real bite
441799 if you are a family making less than 250 000 a year my plan will not raise your taxes period not income tax not payroll tax not capital gains tax not any of your taxes and chances are you will get a tax cut
441800 but by repeating their inflated 94 vote figure the mccain campaign and the gop falsely imply that obama has pushed indiscriminately to raise taxes for nearly everybody a closer look reveals that hes voted consistently to restore higher tax rates on upper income taxpayers but not on middle or low income workers
441801 this isnt a flip flop its a sex change operation
441802 i am very angry frankly at the oil companies not only because of the obscene profits theyve made but at their failure to invest in alternate energy to help us eliminate our dependence on foreign oil
441803 theyre making huge profits and that happens but not to say were in this so we can over time eliminate americas dependence on foreign oil i think is an abrogation of their responsibilities as citizens
441804 when we had katrina and rita the two worst hurricanes in at least in recent memory in 05 some three years ago there was not one case where we had a situation with oil or gas being spilled in the environment
441805 revealed that bush administration officials held a meeting recently in the vice presidents office to discuss ways to provoke a war with iran hersh explained that an idea was considered to dress up navy seals as iranians put them on fake iranian speedboats and shoot at them this idea was ultimately rejected

441811 i want to look you in the eye i will not raise taxes or support a tax increase
441812 things are just a little out of line back there i dont exactly know but its no big deal
441813 er this is the only one ive got however well have lots more in a few months time when we make more
441814 those who congratulated me when i successfully led the military operation against the ltte in the war front have been now carrying out a slandering campaign against me soldiers of the sri lanka army now moving forward in the war front against ltte are also to face same fate in future
441815 slandering campaign against me is tantamount to disgracing the soldiers who lost their limbs and lives in the war
441816 you mean a bunch of perverts are going to write depraved captions about me on the internet i think im going to be sick
441817 its an immediate sales bump for the book but not huge
441818 but it creates a good feeling among customers and an attachment to the bookstore if we throw a good party they will remember us
441819 we divide our wireless products into three markets wireless lan point to multipoint wimax and point to point backhaul
441820 wimax is the best point to multipoint technology in the market its a standard if the wimax forum could just focus on this and not confuse its focus with arguments about whether its a rival for lte or in mobile it would be a very good niche market indeed
441821 sitemeter is screwy and if you have sitemeter code on your blog then it cant be viewed by internet explorer if you take the code out of your template the problem is resolved

441861 effeminate men are held in much lower esteem than are masculine looking homosexuals
441862 in the gay world masculinity is a valued commodity an asset in the sexual marketplace
441863 this week i made a list of all the guys ive ever had sex with i wondered what was i attracted to i realized it had to do with exterior traits of masculinity and an appearance of self assuredness some of the guys had this hypermasculinity they were bodybuilders and so on

441887 we welcome the transparency from the government in providing this information which will be critical in enabling the solar pv industry to plan for future demand and jobs growth
441888 todays release of the figures is especially timely as hundreds of representatives from the solar pv industry including installers distributors and dealers are in melbourne to discuss the challenges and opportunities facing the industry nationally
441889 the rebate scheme particularly in the last two years has allowed the industry to build capacity and capability however the industry is now ready to transition to a nationally consistent gross feed in tariff this policy will deliver the long term certainty needed for investment and jobs growth
441890 these figures demonstrate that the australian solar pv industry continues to move from strength to strength and we look forward to working with government to discuss the transitional rebate arrangements until the gross feed in tariff policy is in place

441919 i am not going to apologise for something which the ioc is not responsible we are not running the internet in china
441920 let me make it clear the ioc is in favour of the broadest amount of internet access for the media that is the bottom line secondly there has been no deal at any time between the ioc leadership and the games organisers to accept any restrictions
441921 when beijing was awarded the olympic games the ioc promised the media the fullest access to the internet and bocog has said it will deliver
441922 there has been a heated debate and i understand your concerns but we have pressed the issue and there has been an improvement thats what counts
441923 in athens a week before the games the questions were will the venues be ready will the organisation be ready
441924 today the venues in beijing are ready and the organisation is ready
441925 we have absolutely no regrets about awarding the games to beijing and when you watch the opening ceremony the magic of the games and the flawless organisation will take over
441926 we are working with the international federations to step up the tests before games it is a deliberate action and i am glad to see that it has been successful
441927 we are expecting potential news about the ongoing balco investigation and we want to render justice with all the full facts being known
441928 internet explorer cannot open the internet site whichever site you were trying open operation aborted
441929 in hollywood it takes more than ambition to make it to the top no one is safe when passion becomes obsession

441931 prohibiting the export to iran of all refined petroleum products and imposing stringent inspection requirements on all persons vehicles ships planes trains and cargo entering or departing iran
441932 no intention of moving the bill through his committee unless the language is first altered to ensure that there is no possible way it could be construed as authorizing any type of military action against iran
441933 if the iranians dont accept a deal now because they think theyre going to get a better deal from the next president theyre mistaken
441934 who is in charge of the clattering train the axles creak and couplets strain for the pace is hot and points are near and sleep has deadened the drivers ear and signals flash through the night in vain who is in charge of the clattering train
441935 there were attacks that targeted senior officers and we thank god they failed and our colleagues are safe
441936 investigations are still ongoing to see who was behind the attacks and it is too early to point out motives although they appeared to be of al qaeda style
441937 on monday morning jul 21 we were startled by an explosion in the house of colonel issa al issawi who is known as the leader of the campaign against militants in fallujah and surroundings house
441938 to our surprise the explosion took place on the roof where at least four guards were posted
441939 one of them was warning his colleagues that the other was a suicide attacker and asking them to take cover then another policeman fired towards both of them
441940 all of us ran away and then the second bomb went off many policemen were killed and injured in the two blasts these have again ended our dreams of security
441941 col issawi has been a police officer for over 20 years meaning he is one of saddam husseins officers who agreed to continue although the country was occupied by the americans
441942 people of fallujah know that he helped al qaeda worked with the islamic party and now is the right arm of the american occupation
441943 we knew that many of the members of the awakening forces were members of al qaeda
441944 it was said that about 100 young men were executed inside fallujah police station by the awakening militias in january and february 2007 it became clear later that the executioners were fallujah police leaders following orders issued by the u s military from the headquarters next door
441945 it seems that we iraqis will all kill each other as long as this u s occupation is paying our leaders to widen the gap between us
441946 not one person in my neighbourhood has a building permit
441947 illegal building is simply a pretext for destroying palestinian families homes and lives
441948 the demolitions are part of a policy to stop the natural expansion of palestinian communities in and around jerusalem freeing up the maximum amount of land for use by israeli settlers
441949 the demolitions increase the pressure on palestinians to move into the west bank so that they will lose their residency rights in the city
441950 this is the first time a government has supported the rebuilding of an illegal palestinian home demolished by the israeli authorities
441951 we estimate that there have been at least 18 000 homes destroyed during the four decades of occupation
441952 most demolitions are of multi storey buildings that are home to several families meaning that well in excess of 100 000 palestinians may have been made homeless by israeli administrative policies
441953 its one thing to destroy a home supposedly built illegally by a palestinian but another to destroy one built with money provided by the spanish government
441954 it was an eye opener to realise that the principles of urban planning we are taught at the university are being used by the israelis but for exactly the opposite purpose from the one usually intended the planning rules here are designed not to improve the palestinians lives but to make them more miserable
441955 imagine your children leaving in the morning for school and returning later in the day to find their home their whole world has disappeared while they were gone
441956 its happened to my children four times its cruelty beyond words
441957 the ig will find enough evidence to refer the matter to a special prosecutor
441958 iglesias added that he also suspects that an upcoming ig report about the justice departments civil rights division will be highly critical
441959 i believe that when the rest of the report drops it will show the civil rights section was compromised in terms of their core historic mission which is representing minorities
441960 i am hearing preliminarily those class of cases were not prosecuted which if true is a remarkable turn of events
441961 he took multiple phone calls from domenici concerning iglesias urging that he be replaced and has admitted that president george w bush spoke with him about the problems with iglesias
441962 gonzales has even admitted that one of the reasons that iglesias was fired was because sen domenici had lost confidence in iglesias
441963 while these allegations are troubling under any analysis a thorough and independent investigation is necessary to determine whether criminal laws have been violated
441964 under the broad language of the federal statute regarding obstruction of justice it would be hard to imagine that corruptly influence would not extend to firing of the united states attorney in the middle of a public corruption case because he lost confidence of a senator who sought to manipulate the indictments for crass political advantage
441965 mcnulty also may have sought to conceal an important phone call from sen domenici regarding u s attorney iglesias instructing then justice department liaison to the white house monica goodling to delete reference to that call from his senate testimony
441966 lam alerted the justice department that fbi agents would at her direction search foggos home in connection with the duke cunningham case and the following day former gonzales chief of staff kyle sampson e mailed the white house from the attorney generals office that we have a real problem with carol lam and urged that she be dismissed at the conclusion of her term
441967 given the wide publicity of the cunningham political corruption case it is reasonable to conclude that gonzales mcnulty sampson and other senior justice department officials were aware of the underlying judicial proceeding being handled by carol lam
441968 there is no way he is going to right this ship thats sinking in five months
441969 the allegation is false i didnt withhold information from the deputy
441970 proceeded to say let me tell you what i can remember and he laid out for me his general recollection of some of the process
441971 he asked me if i had any reaction to his iteration
441972 i havent talked to witnesses because of the fact that i havent wanted to interfere with this investigation and department investigations
441973 i was not involved in seeing any memos was not involved in any discussions about what was going on
441974 i felt nothing was going to happen but i was told that the people who work in those offices are professional career people they are not politicos
441975 this is not going away with a new president the fact that the justice department is the agency that enforces individual rights and they were violating those rights is just a really awful situation what do you do when the watchdog isnt watching but is in fact violating the rights
441976 wizards of the coast has made the decision to pull down its gleemax social networking site in order to focus on other aspects of our digital initiatives especially magic online and dungeons amp dragons insider we continue to believe that fostering online community is an important part of taking care of our customers but until we have our games up and running at a quality level we can be proud of it will be the games themselves that receive the lions share of our attention and resources
441977 our plan is to shut down gleemax completely sometime in september
441978 the mistake that i made however was in trying to push us too far too fast i still think the vision for gleemax is awesome creating a place on the web where hobby gamers or lifestyle gamers or thinking gamers or whatever you want to call us can gather to talk about games play games and find people to play games with but ive come to realize that the vision was too ambitious weve made progress down about ten different paths over the past eighteen months but we havent been able to reach the end of any of them yet
441979 the correct strategy at this point is clear we need to focus were not going to abandon the vision but we are going to put large chunks of it on the backburner until we prove that we can succeed at the most important pieces those pieces are magic online and d amp d insider
441980 d amp d insider functionality has started to roll out but were still behind where we wanted to be
441981 wizards of the coast remains committed to online community but instead of trying to grow a new website for a brand agnostic community we need to focus on keeping our own house in order we have the two best games in the world and we need to take care of them before expanding into new digital arenas
441982 crew has learned that the white house has now completed its analysis of the missing email problem and confirmed that email is missing for as many as 225 days
441983 in addition the white house is about to begin selecting or has already selected a contractor to restore the missing email although it is crews understanding that the white house does not intend to use backup tapes predating october 2003
441984 it has already been established that e mails for the office of the vice president are missing for a critical week in september 2003 when the department of justice opened an investigation into the leak of valerie plame wilsons convert cia identity despite the obvious relevance of these new facts to the lawsuit the white house has refused crews request that is advise the court of these events and bring transparency to the process
441985 learned that not all email of the office of the vice president and the executive office of the president for certain time periods in 2003 was preserved through the normal archiving process on the white house computer system
441986 frankly i think its pretty clear that the white house doesnt want to acknowledge that yes we have missing email
441987 in order to run updated software reduce ongoing maintenance and enhance security assurance
441988 when workstations are at the end of their lifecycle and retired under the refresh program the hard drives are generally sent offsite to another government entity for physical destruction in accordance with department of defense guidelines
441989 we are pleased that despite the white houses plea for reconsideration the magistrate judge stood his ground and recommended that the white house be ordered to locate and preserve e mails that may be missing from backup tapes but were saved on individual workstations and portable media devices
441990 each of the judges recent rulings in our favor has brought us one step closer to ensuring that the documentary history of this administration is not forever lost
441991 false and appear designed to mislead the court into believing that both discovery and any additional interim relief are unnecessary
441992 the allegedly misleading and false statements were made in response to the courts attempt to determine
441993 as discussed above in greater detail the court has now determined that not all e mails sent or received during the relevant time period are contained on the back up tapes compelling the deposition of ms payton would therefore provide no remedial benefit and is thus unavailable here as a sanction
441994 it seems to me that the nature of the ultimate revolution with which we are now faced is precisely this that we are in process of developing a whole series of techniques which will enable the controlling oligarchy who have always existed and presumably will always exist to get people to love their servitude
441995 trade unions in revolt against raising the pension age to 62
441996 the left failed we need a new start from a workers position
441997 weve seen record growth in the number of solar rebate applications lodged since the government acted on budget night to better target the rebate to those earning less than 100 000
441998 an average of 522 applications have been lodged weekly since the budget with 794 in one week alone
441999 the law says the emergency powers may be used if there is an imminent threat of serious violence or substantial damage to property or if a serious narcotics offence could be committed
442000 to adequately track and prosecute terrorists we need to be able to monitor computers as well as be able to watch and listen with whatever means available
442001 peter costello has devoted his life to arguing for extreme industrial relations laws
442002 peter costello is a bloke who said workchoices didnt go far enough
442003 this is a great opportunity for us to return to workchoices we made huge gains in the last year before the election on this issue and by focusing on peter costello so we would relish the opportunity to go head to head with him the liberal party obviously has a very short memory
442004 peter costello has earned the right to make the decision about his future with his own family in the best interests of both them and the people of higgins
442005 i would be very happy for peter costello to stay on in the parliament and if he chooses to do so he will be immediately on the frontbench but thats his choice his decision and hell make it in good time

442011 thanks to the pamphlet we do not have to struggle to come up with the english translations of dishes any more which is usually time consuming

442137 n o estou seguro de que tenha existido um documento escrito confirmando este acordo mas sei que holbrooke admitiu que garantias verbais foram fornecidas a karadzic nas mais altas esferas do poder

442197 fui infectada porque meu marido come ou a manter rela es sexuais com outras mulheres
442198 quando me disseram n o fiquei assustada nem tive medo porque nem sabia o que significava o hiv e o que mais me afetou foi que as pessoas n o queriam sequer se sentar a meu lado
442199 as coisas mudaram muito nos ltimos anos porque agora a sociedade aceita mais a doen a embora o processo seja muito lento

442206 we are working with the international federations to step up tests before the games
442207 people have told me that i looked sad when i was i competing but i never complained
442208 people assume a lot of things about gymnasts that the girls work too hard its way too much for them they are too young to work so hard i never personally complained everybody else complained for me
442209 in any case it was not too hard it was what it takes to be an olympic champion also nobody says anything about boys at 12 13 years old working too hard its only the girls oh poor girls why are we treated differently
442210 i basically have my life today as a result of what i did as a child what did i miss out on yeah i missed not hanging out at shopping malls i guess but that is not a big deal because you dont get a medal for that
442211 when i look back i am happy that my mum took me to the gymnastics club i didnt join gymnastics to become a famous athlete or celebrity it just happened i did more than i expected of course
442212 what is different is that they can make a living from gymnastics and people stay longer in the sport also you dont have to do four events you can specialise in one so that shortens their workout we had to do compulsory as well dont forget
442213 but the hard work is the same there is no magic pill you have to work and train hard
442214 people asked what was the secret of romanian gymnastics we just worked twice as hard as everyone else now everyone does it which is why they are much better
442215 it is still there it is considered number two to soccer with our results in the seventies and everything we did the people are still proud got recognised through gymnastics
442216 weve had the miniatures ready to go for about a year now and i think the graves have been ready even longer than that
442217 our original plan was to hold these back and release everything with the rule book but after talking it over amongst ourselves weve decided to just put it all out there right now

442240 we heard this bloodcurdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy repeatedly like 40 or 50 times
442241 when he was attacking him he was calm like he was at the beach
442242 there was no rage or or anything he was just like a robot stabbing the guy
442243 was cutting his head off and pretty much gutting him
442244 we put our bodies up against the door waiting for him to come out and he went back and brought the head to the front and pretty much displayed it and dropped it on the ground in front of us
442245 dropped the head and went back and started cutting the body back up
442246 we want to make sure that the process is followed as aggressively as possible a full legal process and the perpetrator is definitely dealt with the full force of the law

442248 dan hati hatilah kalian terhadap perkara baru yang diada adakan karena sesungguhnya setiap yang diada adakan adalah bidah dan setiap kebidahan adalah sesat
442249 barangsiapa mengerjakan satu amalan yang tidak ada perintah kami atasnya maka amalan itu tertolak
442250 dan berpeganglah kamu sekalian dengan tali agama allah dan janganlah kalian berpecah belah dan ingatlah nikmat allah atas kalian ketika kalian dalam keadaan saling bermusuhan lalu dia mempersatukan hati hati kalian sehingga akhirnya kalian menjadi bersaudara dan ingatlah ketika kalian di tepi jurang neraka lalu allah menyelamatkan kalian daripadanya demikianlah allah menerangkan kepada kalian ayat ayat tanda kekuasaan nya mudah mudahan kalian mendapat petunjuk
442251 ikutilah apa yang telah diturunkan kepada kalian dari rabb kalian dan janganlah kalian mengikuti wali wali selain allah sedikit sekali dari kalian yang mau mengambil pelajaran
442252 katakanlah hai muhammad jika kalian betul betul mencintai allah maka ikutilah aku niscaya allah akan mencintai kalian dan mengampuni dosa dosa kalian dan allah maha pengampun lagi maha penyayang
442253 kalau kalian mentaatinya nabi muhammad niscaya kalian akan mendapat petunjuk
442254 sesungguhnya telah ada dalam diri rasulullah muhammad suri teladan yang baik bagi orang yang mengharapkan allah dan pahala hari akhirat dan banyak mengingat allah
442255 dan apa yang dibawa oleh rasul itu kepada kalian maka ambillah dia dan apa yang dilarangnya maka tinggalkanlah
442256 maka tidaklah patut bagi laki laki mukmin dan perempuan mukminah apabila allah dan rasul nya telah menetapkan suatu keputusan akan ada bagi mereka pilihan lain tentang urusan mereka dan barangsiapa yang mendurhakai allah dan rasul nya maka sesungguhnya dia telah tersesat dengan kesesatan yang nyata
442257 maka demi rabbmu mereka pada hakekatnya tidaklah beriman hingga mereka menjadikan kamu hakim dalam perkara yang mereka perselisihkan kemudian mereka tidak merasa keberatan dalam hati mereka terhadap putusan yang kamu berikan dan menerima dengan sepenuhnya
442258 saya wasiatkan kepada kalian agar bertakwa kepada allah mendengar dan mentaati penguasa walaupun yang memimpin kalian adalah seorang budak belian dan sesungguhnya barangsiapa di antara kalian yang masih hidup sepeninggalku niscaya akan melihat perselisihan yang banyak maka hendaklah kalian berpegang dengan sunnah jalan atau cara hidup ku dan sunnah para al khulafa ar rasyidin yang mendapat petunjuk dan gigitlah dia dengan geraham kalian dan hati hatilah kalian terhadap perkara baru yang diada adakan karena sesungguhnya setiap yang diada adakan adalah bidah dan setiap kebidahan adalah sesat
442259 kemudian dari pada itu maka sesungguhnya perkataan yang paling benar adalah kitab allah dan sebaik baik tuntunan adalah tuntunan nabi muhammad dan seburuk buruk perkara adalah yang diada adakan maka sesungguhnya setiap yang diada adakan adalah bidah dan setiap kebidahan adalah sesat
442260 sesungguhnya ucapan yang paling benar adalah dan sesungguhnya sebaik baik tuntunan adalah tuntunan nabi firman allah dan seburuk buruk perkara adalah yang diada adakan ingatlah bahwa muhammad semua yang diada adakan adalah bidah dan setiap kebidahan adalah sesat dan kesesatan itu tempatnya di neraka
442261 ikutilah dan janganlah berbuat bidah sungguh kamu sekalian telah diberi kecukupan dalam agama kalian dan setiap kebidahan adalah sesat
442262 barangsiapa yang berbuat satu kebidahan di dalam islam dan dia menganggapnya baik berarti dia telah menuduh rasulullah muhammad
442263 pada hari ini telah aku sempurnakan bagi kalian agama kalian dan telah aku cukupkan nikmat ku kepada kalian dan aku ridha islam menjadi agama kalian
442264 sesungguhnya apabila allah menyatakan dia telah menyempurnakan agama nya sebelum mencabut ruh nabi nya maka apakah lagi gunanya segala pemikiran atau pendapat yang diada adakan oleh pemiliknya sesudah allah menyempurnakan agama nya ini kalau pendapat mereka itu merupakan bagian dari agama ini menurut keyakinan mereka itu artinya mereka menganggap bahwa agama ini belum sempurna kecuali setelah dilengkapi dengan pemikiran mereka hal ini berarti penentangan terhadap al quran dan seandainya pemikiran tersebut bukan dari agama maka apa gunanya mereka menyibukkan diri dengan sesuatu yang bukan dari ajaran agama islam ayat ini adalah hujjah yang tegas dan dalil yang pasti tidak mungkin mereka membantahnya sama sekali selama lamanya maka jadikanlah ayat yang mulia ini senjata pertama yang dipukulkan ke muka ahlul bidah dan untuk mematahkan semua hujjah mereka
442265 barangsiapa membuat satu sunnah cara atau jalan yang baik di dalam islam maka dia mendapat pahalanya dan pahala orang yang mengamalkannya sesudahnya tanpa mengurangi pahalanya sedikitpun dan barangsiapa yang membuat satu sunnah yang buruk di dalam islam dia mendapat dosanya dan dosa orang orang yang mengerjakannya sesudahnya tanpa mengurangi dosanya sedikitpun
442266 barangsiapa yang membuat satu sunnah cara atau jalan yang baik di dalam islam
442267 kami mengutus mereka sebagai rasul rasul pemberi berita gembira dan pemberi peringatan agar supaya tidak ada alasan bagi manusia membantah allah sesudah diutusnya para rasul itu
442268 hai orang orang yang beriman janganlah kamu mendahului allah dan rasul nya dan bertakwalah kepada allah sesungguhnya allah maha mendengar lagi maha mengetahui
442269 ayat ini mengajarkan kepada kita bagaimana beradab terhadap allah dan rasul nya hendaknya kita berjalan berbuat dan beramal mengikuti perintah allah dan sunnah rasul nya jangan mendahului allah dan rasul nya dalam segenap urusan dan inilah tanda tanda kebahagiaan dunia dan akhirat
442270 hampir hampir kalian ditimpa hujan batu dari langit aku katakan rasulullah kalian mengatakan kata abu bakr dan umar begini begini
442271 kaum muslimin telah sepakat bahwa barangsiapa yang telah jelas tidak halal baginya untuk meninggalkan sunnah itu baginya sunnah rasulullah karena pendapat pemikiran seseorang
442272 saya telah melihat apa yang kalian lakukan dan tidak ada yang menghalangiku untuk keluar shalat bersama kalian kecuali kekhawatiran kalau kalau nanti shalat ini diwajibkan atas kalian
442273 apa yang dianggap baik oleh kaum muslimin maka dia adalah baik di sisi allah
442274 barangsiapa yang membuat buat sesuatu yang baru dalam urusan agama kami yang bukan berasal daripadanya maka semua itu tertolak
442275 allah menghalangi taubat setiap pelaku bidah sampai dia meninggalkan bidahnya
442276 barangsiapa yang berbuat bidah atau melindungi kebidahan maka dia akan mendapat laknat dari allah para malaikat dan seluruh manusia
442277 kalau kiranya allah mengetahui kebaikan ada pada mereka tentulah allah menjadikan mereka dapat mendengar dan jikalau allah menjadikan mereka dapat mendengar niscaya mereka pasti berpaling juga sedang mereka memalingkan diri

442385 weve been lost in a world of new music over the last few months and are very very proud of the record
442386 we started out in paris where jon brion inspired us to create first and think later
442387 we took the night train to berlin where everything came together in an avalanche of experimentation that took us all by surprise and where we made a pact with stuart price to ignore the rules of good taste
442388 weve hidden ourselves away in the depths of the english countryside recorded a new track in london at the last possible moment and now were in los angeles tying up the loose ends
442389 joomla 1 5 does not provide an upgrade path from earlier versions converting an older site to a joomla 1 5 site requires creation of a new empty site using joomla 1 5 and then populating the new site with the content from the old site this migration of content is not a one to one process and involves conversions and modifications to the content dump
442390 joomla 1 5 is so significantly changed from 1 0 that there is no upgrade path this is the reason that we are providing a migration path the concept is to build a new site and to migrate data from the old site extensions need to be installed and configured as if the site is new the core data migration does reconstruct menu items for core elements and also keeps core module records with configuration settings
442391 can i remove the footer link that says powered by joomla
442392 my family and i are devastated and hurt that we would somehow be implicated in the death of somebody we loved for years
442393 i believe unfortunately that rhoda mcfarland was in the wrong place at the wrong time i dont believe any church squabble couldve led to anything like this
442394 hes not a suspect hes just another guy that fits the description
442395 law enforcement people call us up saying weve got a guy who fits the general description and we say ok send us the information
442396 their tears are our smiles and in the end we will roar with laughter
442397 by freeing a murderer like de juana chaos the government has turned us into orphans
442398 i believe theyre going to come through in the clutch and keep getting better
442399 we dont ever try to project anything into the future we basically show up each day and play the game and just have faith that everythings going to be great at the end
442400 all the guys are doing our part one after the next
442401 we have a lot of faith in him to get people out
442402 that was his ballgame and you want him to get those outs its a growing and learning experience to put him in those situations and get big outs in a tight ballgame there its his game win or lose
442403 you get put in those situations it would be easy to fold
442404 but were all competitors in here so its kind of what weve grown up doing is trying to bear down in situations when its the hardest
442405 i dont think its going to change any of our approaches
442406 in this game you can have everything going great and in a matter of five or six pitches it just kind of flip flops on you
442407 its frustrating you have to stay focused especially against a team like this
442408 im looking for a fastball and i saw the fastball you have to do something with it
442409 you have to hope to hold it put up a goose egg and give it a chance
442410 if he feeds that ball there kouzmanoff might beat it out
442411 he had the instincts to take it himself and saved us there
442412 the street had been a one up over its fears over the past few weeks
442413 now that earnings season is largely over attention is turning back to oil and more fundamental reports
442414 the fed meeting will be carrying a lot of weight
442415 for a start if we were to see a more hawkish tone in the fed statement and the dollar began to strengthen for good wed see more of a sell off in the commodities
442416 but once that backstop comes off at the end of august then well see if financials do rally back or not
442417 people dont want to get back to the sector that burned them
442418 not going to university did give me an incredible driving force
442419 it makes me feel i am going to read absolutely everything so i can prove that i am not stupid
442420 hell be able to take the role and still make the character his own
442421 i want to personally make sure that every baby born here will not be hiv positive
442422 he was the leader of the world then he comes here in a small village poor and uncomfortable place to visit to see us to help us
442423 it is very satisfying we were quick throughout testing yesterday and today
442424 we were quickest on the softer tyre so we had planned to use it for q3 but the track temperature was up so it was having a big affect on the tyre it was the safer option to use the harder tyre as it does not grain as much i lost a little bit of time in the second sector so ive got a little bit in the bag
442425 i think our lap times from the first two qualifying sessions showed that we are pretty strong
442426 i definitely have the feeling we can push these guys tomorrow

442431 massa darf man nicht untersch tzen kimi hat es da vom sechsten platz aus sicherlich etwas schwieriger
442432 aber der dritte startplatz ist sehr oft vor allem hier in ungarn der bessere startplatz im vergleich zu p2 ich will da jetzt aber nicht unken wir machen das schritt f r schritt
442433 wir k nnen wirklich kein besseres ergebnis erzielen und das genie en wir auch das rennen ist eine ganz andere geschichte und ich w rde ferrari nicht abschreiben je mehr gummi auf die bahn kommt desto besser kommen sie in fahrt das hat man gesehen massa war sicherlich sehr konkurrenzf hig und wir m ssen sehen wie wir das morgen regeln k nnen
442434 new boss luiz felipe scolari has been giving his players a hard time in their first week back boosting their fitness before even thinking of tactics goal celebrations penalties arguing with the ref penalties falling over pouting at the ref penalties

442439 im very disappointed an race will not have any role in my campaign nor is there any place for it
442440 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck amanda carpenter
442441 he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
442442 this is a race about big challenges a slumping economy a broken foreign policy and an energy crisis for everyone but the oil companies barack obama in no way believes that the mccain campaign
442443 i must be crazy because thats all thats going on somewhere else who am i
442444 the real question is what miles will people pay on a round trip basis to take the trip they want to take we dont know

442478 islam does not distinguish between the american people and the american government since both are in a state of war with islam
442479 after all these are the people who elect the american governments and who even elected president george bush for a second term in office despite their awareness of his agenda against islam despite witnessing bushs many brutal actions against the muslims these people re elected him they are the ones who pay the taxes that enable the american government and army to wage war and spill the blood of muslims

442484 i was having a successful army career at that time my wifes father was running a very large handloom complex in north kerala they were having some marketing problems my wife leela thought if i quit the army and join the handloom industry with my experience in bombay and my knowledge of the textile commissioner and many people here would help it immensely
442485 gandhiji was my inspiration he said handloom and khadi will be the mainstay of the nation so when leela suggested this thing i took it up as a great opportunity to serve the people
442486 i was a part of a trade delegation to germany in 1957 at that time morarji desai was the commerce minister and he nominated me on that trade delegation trade was very crucial for germany and for india also we were the guests of the german federal government and we were put up in the best hotels in germany
442487 they provided us with the ultimate in luxury although it was a war ravaged country their hotels were all in good conditions and they were resplendent that inspired me why should india not have these kind of hotels i decided one day if i have an opportunity i will build hotels like these in india that was my dream in 1957 only after 1984 could i make it happen
442488 i go for advice to only those who are personally and intimately involved with me in business leela is my advisor i do not go to many other people in the hotel business i never went to anyone its only our intuition but i did go to vasantdada patil who laid the foundation stone for this mumbai hotel who was very sagacious he gave me great confidence until his death i wanted to get some permission from the maharashtra government and he did not have any problem with that
442489 my guidance is from old indian scriptures indian ethos indian culture or basic indian psyche once the wisdom comes from an elderly person or a child you must accept it with grace

442493 you keep imagining dads going to walk in any second dont you
442494 no reason not to start right away shouldnt be too much of a problem getting rid of all this most of its not worth keeping i might take some of the pictures and maybe the piano
442495 well you were never that keen on the piano stef and i always loved the way that one sounded i can get it shipped to the mainland somehow im sure as for the rest of the furniture auction and bonfire will just about do it
442496 we have to be realistic stef i can try and make you money on some of it but most is not the sort thatll sell its all too bloody old and battered but anyway the price well get for whatever furnitures still in one piece will be pence beside the amount youll get for the house itself
442497 but we mustnt get too sentimental most of this would never fit in your bedsit anyway dont worry
442498 an echoing banging of the iron doorknocker rattled down the hall
442499 the history folklore and traditions could ask you some questions
442500 im not really the right person to talk to i havent lived here for ten years
442501 well yes until i was sixteen but really youre best off trying in the village if you want to know anything like that
442502 im on my way there i saw your house from the road its the first house for miles coming from oldport thought id try me luck
442503 thank you for your time ill try in the village can i just ask your name
442504 if you do think of anything that might be interesting no matter what it is
442505 if shes asking about sinclare traditions shell have that david braithwaite character roping her into the branch burning and all that
442506 i thought you liked all that you researched it enough when we were kids
442507 which is exactly why i know its best to stay the hell away from it all look stef stop gabbing and grab a bin bag theres tonnes to be done before the place is fit to sell and im only here a week
442508 ive done a bit of research over the last few weeks
442509 its pretty impressive seems mainlanders have taken to idealising island life theyll learn soon enough but long after weve got the cheque and left them to it
442510 when i said sort out i meant just you know tidy up make space for me
442511 dad had shut himself off from everyone by the end hell he barely even spoke to either of us
442512 it was this damn village that he shut himself off from stef we were lucky enough to get out when we did make lives somewhere else dad couldnt hed been here too long knew no different
442513 you dont need to tell me what it was like
442514 that last year here convinced me i wanted to be anywhere but here but we were so young lewis we never really gave it a chance
442515 dad gave it too many chances if you ask me
442516 lewis that wasnt hoodwin that did that to him that was living without mum youd left by that point you didnt see those last few years he just couldnt cope he didnt even want me around by the end
442517 lewis when you come back to sinclare can you honestly tell me that it doesnt do something to you
442518 i dont care theres a life for me to live here
442519 it doesnt make any sense the further away we are from this place the better its messed up people say things do things we never fit in with the mechanics of this place

443290 i got there and i dont know what they were talking about with the smog
443291 it was great when i got there i know it rained for three days but it was definitely great to come in and not have to see what id been hearing about for months

443293 i might use my inhaler a little more than normal but i havent had to so far
443294 the best way you get ready for pollution is by staying out of it as long as possible

443393 if they did i think we should stand strong and indicate that is something that crosses a threshold crosses a red line for the united states of america
443394 will be forced to react not with diplomatic but with military technical methods
443395 makes it significantly more likely that one of the many islamist terror plots will succeed
443396 could help fend off any preemptive strikes against its nuclear facilities
443397 unfortunately mr blair has had to postpone his visit to gaza due to a specific security threat which would have made it impossible to proceed
443398 the story of security threats was only an israeli invention to prevent the visit
443399 the shin bet investigation had focused on taher who had turned toward radical islam in recent years the shin bet concluded that he had contacted al qaida through the internet and agreed to participate in terrorist activities inside israel offering details on the location of israel defense forces camps strategic installations and crowded public places that could be targeted
443400 were old and had been deactivated and there was no actual security breach
443401 our political establishment is doing what it now habitually does namely ensuring that the political and corporate elite who break our laws on purpose are immune from consequences
443402 the canadians have begun preparations for the 2010 winter olympics the trade delegation has been in contact with the person responsible for security arrangements in the organizing committee of the 2010 winter olympics with the help of the export institute a presentation will be prepared which will include details of israeli companies capable of supplying products or services for olympic security
443403 with the power out for more than 24 hours most alarm systems batteries would be run dry that gives csis the perfect opportunity to set up their next terrorist attack against non conservative leaning canadians
443404 in patients with serious respiratory illness without an identified etiology clinicians should think about viruses
443405 when we called other hospitals in the portland area we almost fell out of our chairs because they all had seen recent severe and fatal cases of adenovirus
443406 a so called boot camp flu sickened hundreds at lackland air force base in san antonio the most serious cases were blamed on the emerging virus and one 19 year old trainee died
443407 political leaders seem intent on suppressing and ignoring the strong evidence that biofuels are a major factor in recent food price rises
443408 it is imperative that we have the full picture while politicians concentrate on keeping industry lobbies happy people in poor countries cannot afford enough to eat
443409 we got quite a few reports it started with a gentlemen in the lake arrowhead reporting a fireball in the meadow bay area and then we started getting calls from all over
443410 fire crews in barstow and on i 15 near stateline came up on the radio and reported an object in the sky moving very fast across the northern sky and described it as yellowish green in color with streaks of debris it looked like it burned up before it hit the ground
443411 what is so surprising is that rapid almost sudden changes take place in the earths magnetic field

443427 to say that we are disappointed would be an understatement cycling has been overshadowed for some time with doping issues which have negatively affected the reputation of the sport whilst we have continued to operate within this environment we have always made our position clear on drug use and have acted accordingly
443428 two years ago it seemed impossible that a gallon of gasoline would go as high as goddamn ass balls

443446 hey guys i am genuinely concerned about this sundays weather forecast
443447 hot weather increases the rate at which glycogen is burned a 6 miler in the heat can be the equivalent of a 10 miler on a cool day
443448 life is a gamble sometimes you win sometimes you lose but for those without a choice the name of the game is survival
443449 indexing occurs when a camera is moved toward an object
443450 bracketing has an inclusionary dimension indicating that what is inside the frame or bracket is important whether a given bracketing is more important for what it excludes rather than what it includes and vice versa

443455 space is as essential to film as it is to painting
443456 a two dimensional design through vision on a flat surface and a three dimensional space within which the action of the film occurs
443457 time is as essential to film as it is to music
443458 motion is as essential to film as it is to dance
443459 motion is o significant in movies that it is rather more difficult not to be aware of
443460 im not proud of what i have done im committed to making wiser decisions and better choices
443461 im troubled quite frankly by the statement by mr price that hes not proud of what he did but hopes to make wiser decisions
443462 to rape in the name of god is evil in the way few things can be
443463 he just made a bad decision im asking for mercy today
443464 he used what god gave him to manipulate my 12 year old daughter
443465 its unfortunate that it wasnt possible at this time everyone acted in good faith and sought to negotiate an outcome that could be affordable and unfortunately that wasnt possible despite everyones best efforts
443466 the door was open for a long period of time we had some fruitful discussion and i felt we were making some headway bulldogs chairman george peponis and i gave him a lot of time and an opportunity to talk about a range of issues
443467 from day one ive thought it seems like hes troubled i would like to understand why he has done this if he had a change of heart then certainly we would want to sit down and listen to him we would want to see him back in the nrl and we would want to see him happy if sonny was to say hes sorry for what he did and admit that he made a mistake we would definitely be a party to hearing him out
443468 if sonny bill were to play overseas certainly the door would be closed on his returning to the nrl at any time in the future let me repeat its far more fundamental than a question of contracts and money this is about someone who has walked out on his teammates two days before a big game
443469 youve got to remember he does have a dream at the end of the day he wants to be an all black he wants to represent his country
443470 he wants to reach the greatest heights in another sport were in a different age youve had michael jordan who wanted to be a baseballer youve got anthony mundine a great rugby league player becoming a boxer were in an era where people want to transcend the sport theyre in some people maybe want to enslave people so these people dont go and fulfil their dreams
443471 i hit a few fairways a few greens and holed a few putts
443472 i holed a few putts and got to three under and tried not to kill any spectators on the next nine when i was hacking out of trees i managed to miss most people i think i only hit a couple
443473 i made a couple of bogeys and got up and down a hell of a lot and managed to scrape one under which left me in pretty good position today i played pretty good
443474 it was a bit degrading playing the first nine holes the way i did
443475 when youre five over its pretty ugly i didnt have my ball position right and wasnt making a very good downswing
443476 it was almost a complete role reversal from last week
443477 a weeks a long time in rugby and theyve proved that
443478 it was a very good performance from the all blacks
443479 they built pressure and profited from that and didnt allow us to build pressure
443480 they just grew in confidence and grew with momentum as the game went on they were two different games
443481 theres been a bit of pressure on the team and on the coaches so they did well tonight they came through
443482 im a new yorker i live and work in london i crave sex a lot but im putting that on hold so i can find a husband
443483 not going to university did give me an incredible driving force
443484 it makes me feel i am going to read absolutely everything so i can prove that i am not stupid
443485 i want to personally make sure that every baby born here will not be hiv positive
443486 he was the leader of the world then he comes here in a small village poor and uncomfortable place to visit to see us to help us
443487 hell be able to take the role and still make the character his own
443488 detecting information concerning terrorism narcotics smuggling contraband including child pornography and other import or export control laws
443489 in this series there have been quite a few obvious mistakes we have managed to turn around because of the referrals so we think it has been good for the game
443490 in the space of time we have been given i should be able to ask the umpire why he said not out they have given us time to ask a few people like the wicketkeeper and bowler and at the same time i can ask the umpire as well
443491 i thought you were talking to me and id have to take action against you for it
443492 she doesnt want that kind of action she wants love action
443493 no s que hago con una raqueta en la mano
443494 mi pelota no corre y la de la rival no la veo pasar
443495 esto es maravilloso no me siento mejor en ning n lugar esto es realmente lo m o
443496 voy solo a casa en micro pero a qu hora viajo saca vos los pasajes
443497 mi mam me llama a cada rato no s que es lo que quiere
443498 get this damn hat off my head right now or you will pay
443499 well if something happens to this one we know we can grow another one pretty easily
443500 we aim to make southampton solent university a leading university in the south of england but that doesnt mean changing our mission or ethos or the qualities that have already made us successful
443501 we shall remain a friendly accessible institution committed to teaching excellence engaging with the local community and preparing our students for success in the world of work
443502 the more packaging they take off the better really but its interesting to see what theyve really done
443503 theyve kind of said to the consumer really the ball is now in your court
443504 either choose the egg with the packaging or the egg without and wed really encourage people to vote with their feet and go for the egg without
443505 the next step is really to consider the recyclability of the packaging they are using for instance if they are using the foil its really worth recycling foil because you save an awful lot of energy over making it from virgin products
443506 this is a shared problem but i do say that without you fully on side we will fail your voice is more powerful than mine and your actions can be more effective
443507 unless moderates can establish themselves at the centre of their communities and faith extremists could grow in strength and influence
443508 in the future im clear that our strategy of funding and engagement must shift significantly towards those organisations that are taking a proactive leadership role in tackling extremists and defending our values
443509 i know this message will be challenging for some i make no apologies for that the scale of the threat means doing any less would be a dereliction of our duty
443510 if you dont do this we dont give you this these proscriptive methods i think is not helping
443511 the deliberate confusion surrounding the word extremism is a ploy by the government to use its financial muscle to socially engineer a new brand of islam which will be subservient to its foreign policy
443512 the time has come to isolate extremists in our society i think it is a small minority
443513 i am happy to note that the government is taking serious note of what is required in terms of supporting the muslim community
443514 im not going to lie it was a really tough time
443515 david and i got through it together no one said marriage was going to be easy
443516 but now weve come out stronger and happier its even better now than when we were first married
443517 they do their thing we do our thing they are a wonderful family
443518 this is a very shrewd move for beckham because what do you do when your soccer career is over you get involved in entertainment and movies
443519 and what do you do when your singing career is over you get involved in entertainment and movies so for both of them its very shrewd
443520 it seems theyve succeeded in getting everyone to know who they are but now everyones waiting to see what they will do
443521 i philip duke of edinburgh do become your liege man of life and limb and of earthly worship and faith and truth i will bear unto you to live and die against all manner of folks so help me god
443522 we have never withdrawn or indicated that we would withdraw from gemini
443523 the stfc informed the board that the stfc in shaping its programme for the next 3 years and beyond is planning to withdraw from the gemini observatory
443524 he was just heading home from the carnival when that happened
443525 as soon as she said manitoba i knew i immediately got sick to my stomach ive hugged him ive worked with him ive talked to him you never think youre going to go from being happy to never seeing him again
443526 he was such a sweetheart i cannot think of anybody who would not miss him
443527 to anybody who knew him he was that bright bubbly happy guy he was always out for fun i already miss him
443528 if i had 10 tims id be a happy small business man its a real tragedy i feel bad for his family
443529 everyone loved him everybody who knew him clung to him
443530 he cracked jokes left right and centre he never took anything seriously he lived for the moment
443531 he was going to do the pne again and was all excited
443532 he was planning to come live down here he was talking about getting a place
443533 i was like i hope to god theres another tim mclean
443534 he was a sweetheart he was tiny we all called him tiny tim he picked on me because i was smaller than him but it was all in good fun hed never even hurt a fly he wouldnt even kill an ant if it was crawling up his leg he was that guy who all the girls said he was their best friend
443535 theres really nothing to feel other than it shouldnt have been tim he did nothing wrong there was no reason why it should have been tim
443536 the name of the accused as it is quoted is not found in our current serving records nor does it appear or show up in our past serving cf member records
443537 i havent really been paying a whole lot of attention i dont watch videos a lot anymore but i think the music is becoming a lot more diverse with artists like nas lupe fiasco and common
443538 i think my film helped a little bit to create resurgence in hip hop on a certain level its hard to tell if the industry has changed
443539 were all sexual beings but like anything else there has to be some balance and discernment about when and where you show certain things for adults there is a place for music that is sexual and most adults engage in sex whether heterosexual or homosexual its a matter of who the images are being played for and if anybody is being exploited in front of a mass audience
443540 write letters march on the radio station march on the ceo of these huge corporate media companies that continue to perpetuate this music express your anger and unhappiness over it dont accept it realize we have power and we dont have to accept whats going on
443541 money isnt everything but in the past governments have seemed to forget this
443542 delivering the best possible quality of life for us all means more than concentrating solely on economic growth
443543 that is why sustainable development is such an important part of this governments programme
443544 all this depends on devising new ways of assessing how we are doing
443545 we should be thinking not just what is good for putting money in peoples pockets but what is good for putting joy in peoples hearts
443546 when politicians are looking at issues they should be saying to themselves how are we going to try and make sure that we dont just make people better off but we make people happier we make communities more stable we make society more cohesive
443547 put it this way if government doesnt measure it other people will and already are
443548 i know its difficult for us to believe as we take out our chequebook at the end of the year but it looks like at least at a certain level taxes are likely to increase the well being of the population
443549 we should try and discourage people from comparing themselves with other people and i think the tax system can help us in that way
443550 i dont see that we need to allow pictorial advertising which conveys very little information because it makes people feel poorer
443551 we already regulate alcohol to children we should also regulate and i think ban advertising of junk food to children
443552 there is no case in terms of health or wellbeing of children for advertising like this
443553 children that are more brand aware are more consumerist came across as less satisfied in other parts of their lives were unhappier
443554 in my view its not so much necessarily for government to say you therefore should be married but its perfectly reasonable for the government to say if you do these youll probably be happy if you do these youll probably be miserable you decide
443555 were talking about for a course of cbt a thousand 1500 with something that can change somebodys life
443556 it really is important that we should try and have a major nationally organised training programme for more therapists
443557 im sure lots of ministers would be nervous about that
443558 but it turns out that some of the key determinates of what make us happy are things over which we as individuals have relatively little control about prevalent levels of community safety theyre safe when they go out
443559 how do other people in general behave about the way in which our whole economy may be locked into a given path
443560 these are things that as individuals we cant determine but we can determine as a society together and that basically means government is in the game
443561 all about the beat why hip hop cant save black america
443562 of course obama and his people have to condemn the rap because it does say some vulgar things if youre running for president youre supposed to be an upstanding individual
443563 hip hoppers and black folks understand the game theyre thinking an obama who knows how to play the game is still better for me than a mccain
443564 there are a ton of people who clearly are looking for obama to denounce this in order to continue to view him as credible he for political purposes has to separate himself from anything controversially black
443565 im not aware of hip hop music sic affecting any election so far and i dont think that this is going to be one either
443566 but he knowing their thoughts said unto them every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation and a house divided against a house falleth
443567 they really need those external fund raising measures to get through to 2010
443568 the second quarter has been one of the fastest changing quarters ive ever seen
443569 es como una m quina del tiempo para la web
443570 i think the lesson really is that in considering a case of this complexity the police and those responsible for the prosecution need to keep an open mind as far as possible as to who might be responsible for the crime
443571 you had the sense that there was this real historical thing going on in the region even if it was not going to end well
443572 starting a business in a recession is like vacationing in the off season
443573 its a little less crowded and everything starts going on sale
443574 we had to appeal to the inner entrepreneur of each of our vendors
443575 we had to sell them on the fact that eric and i could do something that had never been done before
443576 he was a selfless leader and always strived to serve the poor throughout his life the kind of life he led and the kind of person he was his example should be emulated by todays politicians
443577 the party leadership will be apprised on the national campaign agreed upon by the unpa left parties combine the state assembly elections will form the backdrop for cementing the national campaign against price rise indo us deal farmers issue and others
443578 discourses on the uncordial atmosphere leading to the withdrawal of support from the upa government role of the new upa allies and the nda will also be carried out
443579 the countries in south asia need to work towards a collective response that leads to a quantum leap in agricultural productivity foodgrain output and farm incomes so that the spectre of food shortages vanishes from our region
443580 we should also envisage a network of intra regional and trans regional oil and gas pipelines
443581 as things stand perhaps to look at an inflation rate of 8 9 per cent will be a difficult thing but probably we will do it by march 2009
443582 you can get a much lower rate of inflation if there is confluence of favourable factors such as moderation in oil prices and so on otherwise if the oil prices remain at the prevailing rate that is best estimate for inflation
443583 as far as growth is concerned it will slow down it will slow down than what we have experienced in previous years but nevertheless i think we can still hope to have gdp growth of economy between 7 5 to 8 per cent
443584 the prime minister singh was relatively frank in expressing his concerns about recent incidents which have had an impact on the relationship and the prospects of the dialogue
443585 people of both india and pakistan are bound together in poverty and hopelessness both the countries are also bound by a common hope of a shared future
443586 saarc must make its voice heard in the councils of the world to ensure that there is an effective global response that protects the interests of oil consuming countries
443587 the unprecedented increase in oil and food prices risks jeopardising our developmental gains
443588 probably indians are slightly in front getting those two wickets of sachin tendulkar and rahul dravid were very crucial for us to keep them back for a while just need to keep them to a decent score that we can chase it down on the fourth or fifth day
443589 ideally if we had got a lead it would have been brilliant but i thought harbhajan bowled very well the previous day to pick up thilan samaraveera and tillakaratne dilshan that put us on the back foot
443590 exigimos que los diferentes medios de comunicaci n tengan el acceso m s completo posible a internet para cubrir los juegos ol mpicos
443591 estoy feliz de que se haya restablecido el acceso al sitio de la bbc de wikipedia y de otras p ginas de derechos humanos
443592 fly the ocean in a silver plane see the jungle when its wet with rain just remember till youre home again you belong to me
443593 i heard today that george bush said our kids died for a noble cause why dont we just go down to crawford and ask him what noble cause
443594 applying for dv does not consititute display dual immigrant intent
443595 i recommend all current dissatisfied customers cancel their service and move on to greener pastures
443596 no problem sir would you like the 2wire modem router
443597 when comcast started tearing down bittorrent connections it didnt tell anyone it was doing so
443598 when bell canada started throttling wholesale customers it also was an unannounced surprise
443599 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
443600 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
443601 we need oil drilling and we need it now offshore he has consistently opposed it he has opposed nuclear power he has opposed reprocessing he has opposed storage
443602 the republicans and the oil companies have been really beating the drums on drilling
443603 and so we dont want gridlock we want to get something done
443604 you have the power to call congress back into session at any moment to deal with issues of urgent national importance
443605 no one can argue that the issue of high energy costs and their impact on american families does not rise to this level
443606 the new direction congress led by democrats has offered real solutions to bring down energy costs
443607 but a majority of congressional republicans have voted no each time they should go home to their districts and explain their record of obstructing common sense proposals to address the pain at the pump being felt by american consumers and businesses
443608 anyone who drives an electric car falls in love with an electric car
443609 changes in precipitation patterns due to climate change coupled with increasing demand for water from both urban areas and agriculture could lead to problems in water allocation and quality
443610 more study of this complicated issue is needed if we are to make meaningful educated choices that may help us shape a better future for kansas food production
443611 no one has really looked at the other side of the equation about what it would cost us if we didnt do anything about it
443612 if the sox dropped the option years on his contract which they had agreed to do if they traded him boras said ram rez would not be a problem the rest of the season
443613 yeah sorry pal we know youre a good soldier so we cant help you manny wont play unless manny gets his way so he doesnt have to honor his commitment to us but you do
443614 we believe that this growth trend is primarily a result of market conditions forcing organizations to use customer retention and customer service as competitive differentiators
443615 the success of cdc respond shows there is robust opportunities in the enterprise complaints management market
443616 the new products demonstrate ongoing innovation and the impressive customer case studies including a major u k retail bank deployment of 32 000 licenses worldwide suggest cdc respond is headed for continued success
443617 we are very pleased to see such strong organic growth for cdc respond with the first half license sales for 2008 exceeding the whole year of 2007
443618 in a slower economy companies are looking at innovative technology solutions such as cdc respond to help them increase customer satisfaction and retention we believe that cdc respond is strategically well positioned as a leading solution provider in this space we have and are continuing to see strong traction and our second half pipeline reflects this we want to build on the strong momentum we generated over the last few quarters including record license sales in the united states and united kingdom including a multi million dollar transaction with a leading commercial bank in the united states
443619 it is about direct action outside the camp we will break the law or do whatever needs to take place to stop e on peacefully from profiting from climate change last year they made 4 2 billion in profit from creating climate change
443620 we are planning to shut the coal fired power station down and we are planning to come back when they create a new coal fired power station because we are the last generation that can do it and if we dont then there is no future for any of us
443621 this decision on kingsnorth is a political tipping point because if we dont say no to unabated coal here how can we say anything to china and india no one will respect the uks opinion
443622 the government would lose out on tax revenue but would benefit in many other ways
443623 this project would give the government a carbon benefit an infrastructure saving and a health benefit in one stroke
443624 its the closest thing we have to a silver bullet
443625 the staff love them they are already working for us

443627 when the import duties were first put in place it was a very different situation
443628 we need to turn the tables so were giving consumers incentives to buy more efficient lower cost cars than gas guzzlers

443630 if petrol is cheap no policy aimed at imposing fuel efficiency is going to go anywhere
443631 we need to make sure we dont cave in to populism on the petrol price front and let the price mechanism do its work once youve got the incentives there people will switch to a more efficient vehicle
443632 reform of the fbt is of much greater importance than import duty
443633 the government must remove the incentive to do that june run up the coast when people get in the car and do that few hundred kilometres to get it over the next threshold its a very strange and perverse way of structuring a tax incentive

443645 this is a very dynamic park there have been melting glaciers for the last three years but weve never seen anything like this in the 40 years the park has been in existence
443646 what happened in pangnirtung is what appears to be happening in the park
443647 weve lost huge chunks of our trails there were established foot trails that are completely gone now
443648 were getting more rain were getting earlier ice melting and later freeze ups

443650 all of this is dependent on these projects coming online and getting the power delivered

443652 we have to understand were trying to do something thats never been done before
443653 we shouldnt be beating ourselves up too much if we fall a little short on our deadlines its like this were building the car while we drive it and were trying to drive it very fast
443654 the criminally irresponsible failure of the congress to execute these extensions that have broad bipartisan support is jeopardizing the industrys capacity to deliver and hit its cost targets

443656 the program is demonstrating that california has created a really vibrant market for renewable energy
443657 theres a tendency to view the 2010 deadline as a litmus test for how well the programs working its important to set goals but in our view its far more important that we keep our eye on the ball which is reducing our dependence on fossil fuels

443706 changes in precipitation patterns due to climate change coupled with increasing demand for water from both urban areas and agriculture could lead to problems in water allocation and quality
443707 more study of this complicated issue is needed if we are to make meaningful educated choices that may help us shape a better future for kansas food production
443708 no one has really looked at the other side of the equation about what it would cost us if we didnt do anything about it
443709 i have received numerous reports on the destruction of the forest reserves and the abuse of tree planting permits
443710 the national forestry authority nfa has not responded to the complaints i made two weeks ago

443716 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
443717 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
443718 we need oil drilling and we need it now offshore he has consistently opposed it he has opposed nuclear power he has opposed reprocessing he has opposed storage
443719 the republicans and the oil companies have been really beating the drums on drilling
443720 and so we dont want gridlock we want to get something done

443724 you have the power to call congress back into session at any moment to deal with issues of urgent national importance
443725 no one can argue that the issue of high energy costs and their impact on american families does not rise to this level
443726 the new direction congress led by democrats has offered real solutions to bring down energy costs
443727 but a majority of congressional republicans have voted no each time they should go home to their districts and explain their record of obstructing common sense proposals to address the pain at the pump being felt by american consumers and businesses
443728 it is about direct action outside the camp we will break the law or do whatever needs to take place to stop e on peacefully from profiting from climate change last year they made 4 2 billion in profit from creating climate change
443729 we are planning to shut the coal fired power station down and we are planning to come back when they create a new coal fired power station because we are the last generation that can do it and if we dont then there is no future for any of us
443730 this decision on kingsnorth is a political tipping point because if we dont say no to unabated coal here how can we say anything to china and india no one will respect the uks opinion

443738 there was something stirring across the country because of what happened in selma ala because some folks are willing to march across a bridge so they got together and barack obama jr was born
443739 speaking metaphorically about the civil rights movement as a whole
443740 we only have a certain number of them and if they are all in iraq then its harder for us to use them in afghanistan
443741 heres something that you will rarely hear from a politician and that is that im not familiar with the hanford uuuuhh site so i dont know exactly whats going on there applause now having said that i promise you ill learn about it by the time i leave here on the ride back to the airport
443742 then theres the copy of life magazine that obama presents as his racial awakening at age 9 in it he wrote was an article and two accompanying photographs of an african american man physically and mentally scarred by his efforts to lighten his skin in fact the life article and the photographs dont exist say the magazines own historians
443743 ive made it clear for years that the threat from iran is grave
443744 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
443745 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
443746 we believe the employee free choice act is a bad bill and we have been on the record as opposed to it

443874 no municipality is really addressing the issue of inclusionary planning urban planning does not explicitly identify issues of diversity and how families and groups socialize and do business in a contemporary city that needs to be addressed so you can leverage the social capital that exists in the toronto area and have new recombinant urban forms
443875 the only thing now standing between the american people and these vast oil resources is the united states congress the sooner congress lifts the ban the sooner we can get this oil from beneath the ocean floor to your gas tank

443877 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
443878 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
443879 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
443880 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
443881 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
443882 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
443883 in 1991 then finance minister manmohan singh gave freedom to lakshmi goddess of wealth i want to ask you when are you going to give freedom to saraswati goddess of knowledge
443884 given our population we need to double the number of colleges and this is not possible through public sector participation alone we need a private sector to pitch in
443885 growth of human resource is the single most equalising factor for consistent growth of the economy private colleges deserve applause for their contribution in the education field
443886 today asia has become the engine of growth of the world economy and south asia is a part of this resurgence
443887 this growth must have a multiplier effect in our region we have rich varied experience in development which we must pool together to create a model of inclusive and sustainable regional development
443888 economic cooperation connectivity and integration will be the cornerstone of saarc in the years ahead we have already agreed to move towards a south asian customs union and a south asian economic union in a planned and phased manner
443889 india is now an open economy welcoming investment from everywhere
443890 the countries of south asia now need to work towards a collective response that leads to a quantum leap in agricultural productivity food grain output and farm income so that the spectre of food shortage and hunger vanish from our region
443891 saarc must make its voice heard in the councils of the world to ensure that there is an effective global response that protects the interests of oil consuming countries
443892 poblados en v as de desaparici n en la rep blica argentina
443893 con un programa de turismo rural que se inaugur a mediados de diciembre del a o pasado y explic que
443894 en irazusta se recuper un brazo de un arroyo que estaba estancado e inutilizado y a trav s de un sistema de bombas se lo convirti en un espacio de agua permanentemente renovable con una playa de arena y se gener un camping tambi n hab a una casa muy antigua que se restaur y se instalaron ba os y duchas y se recuper la estaci n del tren donde funciona la oficina de turismo y un museo relacionado con lo ferroviario ya que el pueblo est muy ligado al ferrocarril
443895 se generaron aspectos relacionados a la gastronom a se instal una casa de t construida en un vag n abandonado del ferrocarril un restaurante y la estaci n una biblioteca con servicio de computadoras y un museo
443896 todo se hace de manera absoluta con la participaci n el apoyo y el trabajo de la gente del lugar la participaci n de la gente no s lo es importante sino que es fundamental somos una asociaci n civil sin fines de lucro no tenemos fondos propios y cuando tomamos contacto con un pueblo analizamos las posibilidades los programas que pueden ser aplicables y luego salimos a buscar el sponsors en empresas privadas que quieran financiar el proyecto que en el caso de estos pueblos de entre r os fue american express
443897 en permanente contacto con la gente del lugar de manera tal de acompa ar y perfeccionar si hay cosas por mejorar u otros programas para incorporar
443898 por ejemplo este viernes viajaron a parera dos personas que vienen del exterior a hacer voluntariado social en argentina y les ofrecimos estos pueblos como una alternativa y van a conocerlos para ver c mo pueden acercar su ayuda
443899 en la realidad nuestro proyecto en estos lugares nunca se termina porque m s all de la inauguraci n formal el contacto el apoyo y la b squeda de alternativas y de posibilidades y oportunidades sigue siendo permanente
443900 est n relacionados con responde desde hace muchos a os el primer contacto fue cuando la asociaci n se conform en el 2000
443901 as es que se decidi darle la oportunidad a estos pueblos de entre r os
443902 se pide que cumplan una serie de condiciones y que nos cuenten qu es lo que quieren y con qu cuentan y fundamentalmente que nos hagan ver que hay una disposici n de una cantidad importante de personas del pueblo que tienen ganas de trabajar en funci n de ello y en la medida en que van apareciendo quienes auspicien se van generando las posibilidades para los pueblos
443903 por lo cual para este a o nuestra capacidad de acci n esta absorbida
443904 esto tambi n depende de las acciones de la gente porque por ejemplo se comunicaron desde un pueblo de corrientes que cuenta con el apoyo de la provincia para cubrir todo lo que tenga que ver con la parte edilicia que se necesite y entonces esto facilita mucho las cosas porque se puede conseguir un sponsor que con mucho menor inversi n puede aportar el resto de lo que se necesita y poner en marcha el proyecto la acci n depende de un mont n de factores
443905 la frase es un poco desafortunada y si bien la utilizamos preferimos pensarlo desde el otro lado estamos buscando pueblos que muestren que tienen ganas de superar una mala situaci n y recuperarse
443906 tambi n se ve cada vez m s el deseo de la gente de volver a sus lugares
443907 en los pueblos en que trabajamos siempre nos enteramos que alguien est volviendo y estamos muy esperanzados en que se pueda generar una reversi n de estos procesos porque la realidad es que siempre pensamos mucho en lo malo que es que la gente se vaya del pueblo pero tan malo como eso es ad nde va basta con ver el gran buenos aires el gran rosario el gran santa fe o cualquier otra ciudad para darse cuenta que muchas veces este deseo de acercarse a las grandes ciudades se hace con una gran carga de esperanza y despu s la realidad muestra otra cosa y la situaci n se hace muy complicada
443908 quien llega con intenciones de resolver un problema de trabajo o de falta de servicios sigue sin tener trabajo y sin tener servicios y suma otra problem tica como la inseguridad y fundamentalmente la falta de identidad
443909 sabemos que tambi n se trata de una cuesti n de migraci n natural que hace que los j venes quieran salir a buscar otras posibilidades mundos y aventuras pero lo que pretendemos es que la gente tenga otro perfil de pensamiento
443910 queremos que tengan la posibilidad de ver las cosas desde otro punto de vista y que toda esa energ a que pone en emprender una aventura que estad sticamente est m s condenada al fracaso que al acierto pueda ponerla para desarrollar algo en su propio lugar donde tiene una identidad donde es alguien y est ayudando a preservar algo que es muy importante que es su ra z ste es nuestro trabajo
443911 la experiencia de haber actuado en m s de 25 pueblos nos permite tener la certeza de que estas acciones son efectivas y que realmente se produce un cambio en la mentalidad de la gente y que es el valor agregado m s importante que tiene nuestro proyecto
443912 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
443913 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
443914 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
443915 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
443916 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
443917 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
443918 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
443919 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
443920 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
443921 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
443922 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
443923 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
443924 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
443925 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
443926 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
443927 this demonstrates a long term u s commitment to the people of our hemisphere it will further develop and promote cooperative relationships with friendly countries to ensure we continue economic development and the growth and promotion of democratic institutions
443928 we must work in a bipartisan manner to avoid any negative influence of nations that seek to increase false democracies and prop up existing dictatorships this is an important effort that will fund programs to improve education reduce poverty promote better healthcare and provide improved housing i commend members of the committee for approving this bill and urge senate leadership to bring the bill to the full senate for consideration
443929 this initiative aims to make the united states safer stronger and more prosperous by making our hemisphere more stable and more affluent
443930 our lack of engagement in latin america has created a vacuum that has allowed some to sell an anti american agenda which simply has no place in the region this type of commitment to the development of latin american nations and their institutions helps fill that vacuum and make our nation more secure a strong social and economic backbone is a foundation upon which democracies can prosper this will enable stable communities and a stable region
443931 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
443932 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
443933 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
443934 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
443935 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
443936 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
443937 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
443938 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
443939 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
443940 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
443941 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
443942 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
443943 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
443944 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
443945 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
443946 the space program is an essential cornerstone of floridas economy
443947 i understand that this is a challenging and uncertain time i believe we can and will transition smoothly into the constellation program and i look forward to working with the good people of nasa and all those involved in the space program as we begin to chart americas future in space flight
443948 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
443949 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
443950 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
443951 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u

443957 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
443958 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
443959 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
443960 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
443961 the price of gasoline is one of the most critical issues facing floridians right now its adversely affecting families and businesses alike we need a comprehensive solution to address this crisis
443962 this bill will do a great deal to put our nation on a path to cleaner renewable energy alternatives while also addressing current needs americans want and deserve real solutions to lower fuel costs our bill is a step in that direction
443963 while this allows the development of offshore oil and natural gas exploration by states wishing to do so this measure protects floridas moratorium in the gulf of mexico
443964 i asked that this bill include protections for floridas wishes and those protections are included in this bill
443965 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
443966 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
443967 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
443968 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
443969 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
443970 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
443971 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
443972 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
443973 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
443974 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy

443992 sudahlah basuhan air itu tak akan bisa merubah kondisi kejiwaanmu kau benar benar sudah hancur sekarang
443993 sepertinya aku harus banyak beristirahat terlalu banyak masalah yang aku hadapi sekarang hingga membuat pikiranku ini tak bisa menyelesaikan satu persatu permasalahan itu terlebih lagi masalah sayap yang tumbuh di punggungku ini benda itu makin lama makin bertambah besar apa yang harus aku lakukan dengannya apa aku harus memotongnya tapi
443994 kau terlalu lemah kau itu jenis manusia yang terlalu cepat menyerah pada cobaan
443995 kau seharusnya tahu dan menyadari bahwa aku ini dirimu kita adalah satu aku adalah sosok yang ada dalam dirimu aku muncul dari semua keraguan penentangan kebencian ketakutan kemarahan dan semua kejelekan sifat yang kau miliki
443996 manusia seperti halnya dirimu pada dasarnya memiliki kepribadian atau jiwa yang tersembunyi jauh dalam diri mereka tersembunyi di balik senyuman ramah atau tatapan kaku mereka kepribadian dan jiwa itu terkadang muncul secara tiba tiba biasanya menggebrak tak kenal waktu tempat maupun kondisi semua itu terbentuk dari hasil imajinasi maupun khayalan akan sesuatu yang sudah terkumpul sejak dulu dan setelahnya terpendam lalu terkubur serta masih menyisakan banyak pertanyaan dan pertentangan tentangnya
443997 itu yang sedang kau alami sekarang kau tahu darimana kau peroleh sepasang sayap itu sepasang sayap yang menurutmu mengerikan dan terus menjadi bebanmu itu
443998 ha ha ha terlalu banyak keluhan yang kau keluarkan dari berbagai cobaan yang diberikan tuhan kepadamu ya sebenarnya semua itu hanyalah cobaan yang diberikan tuhan dia menyisipkan cobaan cobaan dalam hidupmu itu dengan cara cara nya yang unik dan tak terpikirkan oleh para penyembahnya
443999 sebelumnya kau telah diberikan pekerjaan yang layak dan istri yang anggun kehidupanmu selalu diberkahi hidupmu dipenuhi akan keindahan keindahan duniawi yang diidam idamkan oleh semua orang dan seperti yang tertulis dalam kitab kitab suci yang diturunkan dari langit cobaan akan datang di waktu yang tak terduga dan sesungguhnya kau telah gagal menjalaninya kau terlalalu asik dengan kenikmatan kenikmatan dunia yang secara sengaja diberikan tuhan untukmu
444000 kau tak akan bisa mengerti tak akan pernah itu disebabkan karena kau terlalu sibuk dengan segala aktivitasmu dahulu jauh sebelumnya saat kau masih diberikan kenikmatan rutinitasmu hanyalah seputar kerja kerja dan kerja entah kau sengaja atau tidak tapi itulah yang sebenarnya terjadi kau diberi kenikmatan namun kau sendiri melupakan apa yang seharusnya merupakan kewajibanmu kau melupakan tuhan dan keluargamu kau melupakan istrimu dan kodratmu sebagai seorang suami juga kepala keluarga
444001 kau terus saja mengeluh dan mengeluh terlebih lagi setiap keluhanmu itu tidak beralasan sama sekali asal kau tahu keluhanmu itu adalah akibat dari kegagalanmu sebagai seorang manusia semuanya akibat keteledoranmu sendiri
444002 kau terus memohon kepada tuhan tak ada henti hentinya kau mengatakan bahwa orang orang tidak adil padamu bahkan dia juga kau anggap demikian rendahnya dirimu kau mengeluh tanpa sadar akan kesalahanmu sendiri hingga yang terakhir dalam mimpimu kau memohon untuk bebas kau menginginkan sayap dan sebagai akibat dari permohonanmu itu tuhan memberikanmu sayap yang sesuai untukmu lihatlah dengan jelas seperti inilah bentuk sayap yang kau miliki sekarang
444003 tidak mungkin semua itu tak mungkin terjadi padaku aku tidak percaya atas semua kebohonganmu itu
444004 pergi pergi dari sini menjauh dariku kau makhluk terkutuk pergi aku iblis pergi
444005 hei hei apa yang terjadi padamu wan kenapa kau berteriak teriak seperti itu sadarlah

444013 the gsm association which represents more than 700 mobile operators worldwide believes this could quadruple by 2012 if transfers by sms become the norm vodafone has entered a partnership with citigroup that would soon allow kenyans in the uk to send money home via text message the charge for sending 50 is expected to be about 3 less than a third of what some traditional services charge

444022 it has some of the very aggressive elements that ive outlined in my plan to move us in the direction of genuine energy independence
444023 i remain skeptical of some of the drilling provisions but i will give them the bills drafters credit that the way they crafted the drilling provisions are about as careful and responsible as you might expect for a drilling agenda
444024 what i will not do and this has been my position is to support a plan that suggests drilling is the answer to our energy problems
444025 if we have a plan on the table that i think meets the goals that america has to set and there are some things in there that i dont like obviously thats something that you know i would consider it because thats the nature of how we govern in a democracy
444026 we need oil drilling and we need it now we need it offshore
444027 we ought to start drilling for more oil at home including offshore opposes that
444028 that i think is the kind of bold step that we need the fact that they are willing to put in seven billion dollars to help the auto industry retool so that those new energy efficient cars are made in america
444029 there are a whole bunch of goods in this that have been proposed by the bipartisan group i remain skeptical of
444030 obviously this is very preliminary and these are early details but i wanted to send a strong signal that we cant allow partisan bickering or the desire to score political points to get in the way of providing genuine relief to people who are struggling
444031 its taking us longer than we would have liked to get a crossfire game profiling system out there
444032 our multi decade old 3d graphics rendering architecture thats based on a rasterization approach is no longer scalable and suitable for the demands of the future
444033 there isnt really a place for sort of a lot important numbers are one and 12 000 i believe that 16 for example is not an important number
444034 there are british passport holders who live in the u k who are being found in places like kandahar
444035 there is a link between kandahar and urban conurbations in the uk

444047 as part of our ongoing drive to tackle knife crime we have introduced a presumption to prosecute the maximum sentence for carrying a knife has been doubled to four years and people who are prosecuted for carrying a knife are now almost three times as likely to go to prison as in 1997 and for a third longer
444048 comcasts history of deception and continued blocking shows brazen contempt for the online consumer protections established by the fcc we commend chairman martin and commissioners copps and adelstein for standing up for internet users and working across party lines to protect free speech and the free market
444049 would you be ok with the post office opening your mail deciding they didnt want to bother delivering it and hiding that fact by sending it back to you stamped address unknown return to sender
444050 or if they opened letters mailed to you decided that because the mail truck is full sometimes letters to you could wait and then hid both that they read your letters and delayed them
444051 a clearly stated commitment of nondiscrimination would make clear that the commission is not having a one night stand with net neutrality but an affair of the heart and a commitment for life

444057 love rkns work but i cant really judge its authenticity i get the feeling that its highly authentic though based on stories ive heard from my parents and extrapolation west bengal gt south india
444058 does a fairly good job of capturing the ethos of middle class parsis
444059 the suggestion of mistry for the parsi slice of life is a good one
444060 genius of this book is that it captures in its very structure the multifaceted chaos that is india
444061 is the portraitist par excellence of the raj specifically the lives and
444062 agnisakshi captured the essence of the time when the struggle for india independence collided with the world of being a namboothiri woman in the era when such women were not allowed to step outside the homestead or have an education or any interests
444063 his novel scavengers son is somewhat difficult to take in places but brilliant precisely because of that

444065 who contends with related but different issues growing up indian in america
444066 does her angstiness truly reflect the average abcds life and view of the world
444067 fantastic author she writes about what feels like authentic urban pakistan
444068 writes awful prose and hes very shallow superficial obvious in his analysis that his book maximum city is still readable is i suppose a tribute to the fascinatingness whats the word i should be using here of his subject matter
444069 has nuggets of inspiration but falls well short of greatness
444070 is actually surprisingly good though her booker winning plot is somewhat contrived
444071 the only reason i actually finished reading a suitable boy was that vikram seth in my opinion did a nice job of capturing the atmosphere of upper middle class desi siblings squabbling in somewhat civilized fashion it was funny in parts too
444072 is a pretty good writer qua writer im always willing to read good prose stylists even if i dont particularly care for the subject matter naipaul anyone
444073 start with a strange and sublime address follow that with freedom song and or afternoon raag then do real time

444087 nasa has already completed a comprehensive look at possible systems
444088 nasa thinks it would be counterproductive to do that all over again as we are already under way developing a good system for the nation

444095 were going to get our moneys worth out of him i guarantee you that
444096 it is kind of ironic that it would happen at this moment
444097 just to be able to spend some one on one time with him afterwards for a couple of minutes i just had a couple of good questions for him and he told me some very interesting stories
444098 i thought it was very helpful as far as his advice on dealing with the media
444099 all the good organizational policies and principles that you read about ours are being tested at this time
444100 for as popular or unpopular it is for as difficult as it is i think the organization has stood strong they have been decisive and they are continuing to work through this everybody wants this resolved dont get me wrong no one thought it would get to this point but this is where we are
444101 i know packers president and ceo mark murphy had talked to me about it in the past how important it was for brett to continue to be part of the organization after he was done playing
444102 and frankly its good for brett because brett needs to stay part of football and obviously hes a part of the green bay packers

444113 this is a government that has come to the end of its road
444114 it doesnt make any difference who heads kadima they are all part to a string of failures by this government
444115 whoever thinks the problem of jerusalem and terror are specific and that destroying one house or another will help is burying his head in the sand the main question is does the government want jebl mukaber or sur bahir as part of israel or not
444116 it is in israels interest to rid itself of these neighborhoods and villages that were never jerusalem and that endanger the jewish and zionist nature of the city
444117 peres said that there must be a separation between the arabs of jerusalem and the jews and that it must be in the form of a wall
444118 whoever thinks its possible to live with 270 000 arabs in jerusalem must take into account that there will be more bulldozers more trucks and the carrying out of terror attacks
444119 now has come the time for us to attack them and they will no longer attack us from now on it is we who will march onto them bukhari

444142 weve seen evidence for this water ice before in observations by the mars odyssey orbiter and in disappearing chunks observed by phoenix last month but this is the first time martian water has been touched and tasted
444143 phoenix is healthy and the projections for solar power look good so we want to take full advantage of having this resource in one of the most interesting locations on mars
444144 were excited because surprises are where discoveries come from one surprise is how the soil is behaving the ice rich layers stick to the scoop when poised in the sun above the deck different from what we expected from all the mars simulation testing weve done that has presented challenges for delivering samples but were finding ways to work with it and were gathering lots of information to help us understand this soil

444187 i think that this and perhaps providing additional incentives to permit exploration off their coasts would be very helpful in the short term for resolving our energy crisis
444188 it would have long term consequences for our coastlines but no short term benefits since it would take at least 10 years to get any oil

444191 the problem is that the worldwide capacity to build rigs now has a backlog going out until about 2013 and we wont add enough rigs to even start to replace the very old rig fleet that we have
444192 i think its short sighted in my opinion to say its not going to make a difference

444209 behind every statistic are human beings whose lives have been taken away or have been irredeemably changed forever
444210 this is what our government either does not understand or does not want to talk about
444211 it is clear that the investigation has not been finalised against the national commissioner of police at this stage some nine months after the state presidents request
444212 we submit that the only explanation is that pikoli and his office had an ulterior motive in the investigation against the national commissioner of police and their refusal to the presidents request
444213 doubtful whether it will be possible to have a fair criminal trial
444214 it is difficult to overstate the significance of the governments failure to call the minister to give evidence
444215 she was pivotal to the events which led to mr pikolis suspension
444216 the inference is that governments case against mr pikoli is spurious at its core

444219 im excited about the opportunity with the chicago blackhawks organization in meeting with them i felt good about the direction their team is going it is an organization in the upswing and i was impressed with the people particularly dale tallon stan bowman and john mcdonough
444220 were very excited to have bill peters join the chicago blackhawks organization and becoming the head coach of the rockford icehogs
444221 he not only has a tremendous amount of experience working under stanley cup winning coach mike babcock with the spokane chiefs but hes made his own success at spokane culminating when his team captured the memorial cup this past spring
444222 bill will be tremendous for the blackhawks young prospects and will do a terrific job guiding them towards the goal and thats playing in national hockey league with chicago
444223 if i stopped a vehicle and found alcohol in the trunk i would ask whose is it and where did it come from if it was a cold case of beer i would probably make the leap that it was the drivers if it was a dusty wine cooler i may not

444225 theres been such hysteria surrounding childrens car seats and i think its a continued regression of parents into a state of learned helplessness in the past there were so many problems with installation people were totally incompetent at following instructions and performing the checks of installation now its the expiration issue britax says after six years technology has changed components degrade from the environment depending on how and where stored parts get lost or installed incorrectly or instructions and labels may not be available or not legible expiring because a label is not legible or because you are installing it improperly components degrading is really the only condition a consumer has some difficulty discerning however are you throwing out all the other weak links in the chain your cars seat belt while certainly thicker but not expirable how do you now they are wound up most of the time cant be good is the belts mechanism being checked too how about the safety features over all of the vehicle you have to use common sense most of all a thick child seat like the britax elite is so sturdy and when inspections reveal straps are not damaged or frayed does expiration make sense just because of a manufactured date frequent inspections are needed throughout the use of anything safety related something just doesnt seem right about this recommendation
444226 take a piece of straight plastic bend it slightly one way then the other repeat a few dozen times no the plastic hasnt degraded into basic elements it has been stressed and weakened considerably to the point it can no longer hold anywhere near the load it could before the same applies to metals this stress can also happen very slowly over years due to the tension from belts harnesses vibration and thousands of signifcant temperature cycles ranging from below zero to well over 100 degrees parts are lost or broken or irreplaceable clearly the plastic used in a child restraint doesnt disintegrate right at 6 years it still can degenerate very gradually over time especially if the item has been stressed from a crash or other unusual circumstances materials fail physical stress and temperature cycles are typical causes and it is no different for child seats than it is for a car piston or computer processor the expiration date of 6 years is certainly a conservative limit but it is not completely meaningless food doesnt magically go bad exactly on the expiration date either but if you let it go on for too long it spoils incidentally i have discussed this very topic with child restraint engineers who have designed these products they are indeed concerned about degradation and do lifetime tests for vibration stress and temperature to insure that the critical parts will meet the expiration limits yes they may last beyond those limits but like many products youre using them at your own risk beyond the manufacturers recommendations
444227 the fabric in a seatbelt can be stressed to failure just like any material used to manage energy fortunately fabrics for this purpose tend to be a more resilient than hard plastics to temperature and flexation vibration kevlar is a great example too it has uses far beyond what metals or plastics can do to manage certain types of energy a timing belt in a car has an expected lifetime they dont fail exactly at 80 000 miles or whatever but the risk of a failure increases the longer you go beyond that limit if you make it to 160 000 miles you consider yourself lucky if the seatbelt doesnt have a separate lifespan listed in the owners manual then hopefully it is designed to last the life of the vehicle if there are no unexpected stresses or failures that doesnt mean there is zero risk of failure fabrics may resist flexation and temperatures but they are not immune from wear they can fray due to friction are more suceptible to cuts and can be weakened by chemicals like beverages detergents etc some seatbelt retractors use pyrotechnics in pre tensioners others use fabric stiching designed to break at a certain tension as a force limiter these features are one use only the parts in a standard mechanically locking retractor can break under high stress ive seen a number of them stuck or broken at child seat inspections and the owner didnt even realize it you should definitely have a seatbelt inspected if it was used in a severe crash or it may not protect you the next time a good dealer or authorized repair shop should know when this applies mostly to newer vehicles in the last 10 years or so

444231 the new taxi and shuttle licenses provide excellent choice capacity and convenience for travellers we are delighted with the selection it is important to us to have highly regarded and credible operators with proven service standards
444232 auckland airport is continually striving to improve the travellers experience in 2007 alone there were over 550 000 taxis or shuttles leaving auckland airport this demonstrates the importance of ensuring customer needs are met we believe that the new international terminal forecourt environment due for completion in september 2008 will also help ensure that there is a smoother more convenient experience for arriving travellers
444233 the recent successes are the culmination of a tremendous team effort each and every stakeholder in the paveway iv community has played their part in getting to this point of maturity in the past 12 months we have completed an exceedingly challenging rapid development programme which included dynamic trials and culminated in a thorough operational evaluation at china lake
444234 the magnitude of the challenges which we have overcome should not be under estimated and the very strong alliance which we have formed with industry bodes very well for the future we can all be justifiably proud of our achievements paveway iv is a very capable weapon system indeed
444235 what is a safety campaign or recall safety campaigns call the consumers attention to products that need to be repaired modified or replaced after the manufacturing process many times a simple replacement part may be necessary to improve performance of the product its important to us that you have the latest news about products or accessories so we provide a list of current and past safety campaigns for evenflo products
444236 as you know we have our proposed policy out there it had come to our attention that some companies simply were not following the letter of the law
444237 for safetys sake and for the integrity of the system we just cant let that happen
444238 im sure no one in this crowd is involved in that but it does circumvent the safeguards that are built into the system when we say 51 of the plane must be put together by hand and not by the kit maker that is what it is all about as eaa president tom mentioned our regulations have essentially remained unchanged for 50 years
444239 the aim of the policy change is not to punish folks
444240 it goes back to the integrity of the system as well as being able to continue to support and encourage the homebuilt industry which has been a tremendous innovator that has had a spillover effect to other parts of the industry
444241 the trends unfortunately are increasing both in terms of accident numbers and in rates
444242 we have a partnership with tom and eaa to help bring these down
444243 the one area where i do believe we do need to do better on is runway safety
444244 ga general aviation pilot deviations continue to be the primary source of runway incursions and what is disturbing for me as a pilot is the number of controller instruction read back issues the pilot is told to hold short of a runway the pilot reads back the instruction correctly but proceeds to enter the runway anyway its something that is just extremely frustrating
444245 one thing this does point out is that human factors will always continue to be an issue in aviation
444246 i respect that you all may feel differently about proposed policy changes
444247 you need an increased awareness when you are mountain flying the way the wind moves over the ridges and down in the gullies and valleys means it can change unexpectedly and can be a bit of a challenge it is quite different to flying over an open field or the ocean
444248 on ne prendra plus nos douches ensemble mais jai besoin de toi si tu nes pas l je craque
444249 sydney airport has worked closely with the australian quarantine and inspection service aqis to ensure that horse movements are made in line with the governments response to the recommendations made by the hon ian callinan ac in his commission of inquiry into the equine influenza outbreak
444250 i want to acknowledge the practical no nonsense role played by the hon tony burke mp minister for agriculture fisheries and forestry in helping operations get back to normal
444251 his willingness to work with all parties to get results is appreciated
444252 the economic costs and social disruption caused by the equine influenza outbreak were significant and we are pleased that sydney airport is again able to play its role in the facilitation of horses from overseas in particular the shuttle stallions which are so important to the thoroughbred breeding industry
444253 to facilitate international horse transfers sydney airport has installed an amenities block with showers in the livestock transfer facility ltf this enables aqis to ensure that staff who have come in contact with imported horses shower out prior to leaving the ltf
444254 secondary fencing has also been installed around the amenities block to enable aqis to control the flow of personnel to minimise the risk of cross contamination after personnel have showered out
444255 sydney airport is committed to working closely with minister burke and aqis on any future quarantine upgrades that may be required
444256 were trying to get a picture of the health of the industry overall

444263 they had discovered the radiation leak weeks ago and did not inform the japanese government immediately
444264 the u s navys handling of the accident and lack of transparency showed there is no way we can trust them
444265 we have not had any discussion or agreement of the so called timeline
444266 they were given two weeks the two weeks is up this weekend
444267 if its not saturday but next week well not make a big fuss about it what matters is to get a clear answer quickly in the very coming days

444269 ive been flying my sonerai ii for 22 years now
444270 the plane has light sport aircraft characteristics which is perfect for vfr recreational flying
444271 great planes aircraft supply is a great resource for anyone looking to purchase parts to build their own sonerai ii
444272 buying each aircraft component separate can save builders a considerable amount of money
444273 this is a group of people to focus on only on thing service delivery
444274 we are not going to change policy or implementation plan
444275 its unprecedented to change a cabinet nine months before an election only one person cobus dowry kept his position and that creates massive instability
444276 mckenzie has as yet not been successful in any of the portfolios hes held as mec in the western cape he lacks the vision and commitment necessary to bring about change in a department which has been rife with malpractice over the past five years
444277 the creation of a new mega ministry under the auspices of garth strachan
444278 brown must have had a huge fight on her hands because the zuma faction now controls the finances of this province in the person of garth strachan
444279 strachan is a member of the skwatsha and ozinsky camp which means that the pro zuma faction has now seized the critical budgeting and finance powers of the provincial government in this way they now have control over all other departments in terms of what is delivered and to which communities
444280 i wanted to make housing a clear focus of one minister i separated one of the most difficult areas in the western cape with a backlog of 400 000
444281 the extent of the housing challenge warranted the attention of dedicated mecs
444282 should herald an improvement in co operative governance if everyone abides by the law and the constitution and acts in good faith
444283 the budget is still the same and they have an opposition that will keep them on their toes
444284 take yousuf gabru for example he has been long associated with education so things should go ahead as planned
444285 in my humble opinion i am none of those things
444286 i am not trying to prevent him from publishing this stupid book but if they publish it there will be consequences and there will be a libel action
444287 the falsehoods relating to our client and his friends the various statements that invade their privacy and statements about security precautions that remain in place
444288 unless you are prepared to take these steps i shall issue proceedings against you
444289 it is certainly not painless for either side it is all in all only acceptable in view of the duration of the settlement and the performance related one off payment it is imperative however that the increased costs be compensated by higher productivity resolution of the pay dispute on their own initiative by lufthansa and ver di is an important message to our customers as well as our staff and to germany as an economic base we will go to every length to resume flight operations quickly for our customers in the customary reliability and quality
444290 i didnt want to have to sit on the witness stand
444291 those people believe it or not they took care of me for 10 years i didnt want to sit on the witness stand and be pointing fingers at them saying that they did something to me
444292 for four days senator john mccain and his allies have accused senator barack obama of snubbing wounded soldiers by canceling a visit to a military hospital because he could not take reporters with him despite no evidence that the charge is true
444293 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky
444294 they are healthier and break down in the body more easily
444295 our message is that people should cut down on both
444296 we have been very concerned about the misunderstanding of our product in the marketplace and want to provide the facts so that consumers can make their choices based on science rather than urban myth hfcs and sugar are treated by the body the same they contain the same calories and nutritionally are no different
444297 it has a crisper flavor not as cloying i think it is a better flavored drink
444298 theres just a lot more awareness about high fructose corn syrup among the public and once people taste a soda flavored with cane sugar they like it better
444299 im aware that edibles would be healthier and probably taste more natural without the addition of corn syrup or that high fructose junk
444300 but i dont look for that ingredient when i purchase foods mostly because the labels are too long the ingredients too numerous the print too small and the chemicals too frightening
444301 the clash between the rat and the horse is a serious clash between water and fire
444302 for people born in the year of the horse it is recommended that they wear a pendant of an ox which will help to attract away the rat so as to minimise the influence of the clash
444303 the traditional belief is that you need an animal to attract away the rat
444304 according to the calendar it is an auspicious day there is nothing wrong with choosing this date it still represents a positive energy
444305 if you pick a good day this indicates a smooth beginning to the marriage
444306 you can see water trouble will be stronger in the second half of the year because of these seasonal elements
444307 for example the tsunami took place in december in 2004 usually water is more powerful in the months after august
444308 terrorism continues to rear its ugly head in our region it remains the single biggest threat to our stability
444309 we cannot afford to lose the battle against the ideologies of hatred fanaticism and against all those who seek to destroy our social fabric
444310 she cared for my child while i was away at work as if she was her own child
444311 my child got up early every morning all excited to go to roshnees school and i will leave her with roshnee again if she restarts the school
444312 one should not focus on the deadline too much what matters is that we get a clear answer quickly its not a matter of one day
444313 we had shifted to chandigarh from sonepat around 15 days ago for the better educational prospects for akshit our life was shattered due to my sons death i am totally clueless and do not know that what to do know
444314 the car dragged akshit up to a distance of 200 300 metres if the driver had stopped the car immediately then we may have been able to save the boy he had sustained major injuries
444315 it is a hit and run case and we have circulated the number of the car at all the check points of the region
444316 we have received a tip off that the car involved in the accident belongs to a businessmans family residing in panchkula and was driven by a youth aged 25 26
444317 he was a selfless leader and always strived to serve the poor throughout his life the kind of life he led and the kind of person he was his example should be emulated by todays politicians
444318 i trust that he hamm made the right call for the team and i m going to go with that and fill those shoes
444319 a man of olympic character he is now an olympian in full
444320 raj has represented the usa at two world championships and was very keen to be in the team he knew this would probably be his best chance for a medal
444321 it was a candid and open conversation between two individuals who wanted to go forward
444322 the high price of gas is taking a toll on summer travelers
444323 congress is now taking a monthlong recess of its own
444324 unfortunately democratic leaders are leaving town without taking any action to ease the burden of high gas prices on families across america
444325 that allows us to tap the extraordinary potential of oil shale permits exploration in currently restricted areas of northern alaska and enables the expansion of americas domestic refining capacity
444326 ainda estou conhecendo a vila toda cheguei ontem mas ela maravilhosa toda arrumada limpa cheia de pequenos lagos e pra as
444327 a vila ol mpica de pequim espetacular foi a melhor que j estive a de barcelona em 1992 era na praia as equipes iam sendo eliminadas e permaneciam curtindo o ver o espanhol mas aqui mais bem cuidada toda ornamentada com plantas
444328 to reduce pressure on prices we need to increase the supply of oil especially oil produced here at home
444329 lifting the ban would create new opportunities for american workers and businessmen
444330 but the leaders of the democratic congress have refused to allow a vote
444331 the president knows that the impact of any new drilling will be insignificant promising savings of only pennies per gallon many years down the road
444332 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
444333 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
444334 i think its important for the american people to understand were not going to drill our way out of this problem
444335 its also important to recognize if you start drilling now you wont see a drop of oil for ten years which means its not going to have a significant impact on short term prices every expert agrees on that
444336 the republicans and the oil companies have been really beating the drums on drilling
444337 and so we dont want gridlock we want to get something done
444338 why is it that you have not had the ability to speak to the interests or even speak on behalf of the oppressed and exploited african community the black community in this country
444339 i may not have spoken out the way you wanted me to speak out
444340 these stamps from royal mail are superb were delighted to have been selected to appear on both the first class and 50p stamps we are extremely proud of our reputation and are world renowned as ambassadors for both the royal air force and the united kingdom its wonderful that now through these new stamps even more people from around the world will get a glimpse of just what the red arrows can do
444341 you never forget the exhilaration of watching an air display especially if it involves the super human skill and excitement of the red arrows thats why were thrilled to have air displays celebrated on these new special stamps
444342 lower weight boosters are no longer consistent with the britax brand of safety
444343 he struggled a bit to get inside of her because she was still a virgin
444344 its a hell of a dive its 14 stories down
444345 she was moving her hand i was shocked she was alive she was covered in soot
444346 in my humble opinion i am none of those things
444347 i am not trying to prevent him from publishing this stupid book but if they publish it there will be consequences and there will be a libel action
444348 the falsehoods relating to our client and his friends the various statements that invade their privacy and statements about security precautions that remain in place
444349 unless you are prepared to take these steps i shall issue proceedings against you
444350 i hope that the leftist radicals who do not believe in the oil companies the mining companies the market or the transnationals goaway
444351 there have been different currents in the constituent assembly some defending capitalism and neoliberalism and others pointing to a new model we see that many of the proposals aiming to undermine social movements demands are coming from the president
444352 the mining debate highlighted these different positions the main power struggle isnt between the president and the right it is between the president and the left including within his own party
444353 i think that the correa governments intention is to put the country in harmony with the new currents of global capitalism particularly with regard to the exploitation of natural resources the irsa multimodal infrastructural integration project and territorial privatization
444354 correa is doing everything possible to integrate ecuador into this new global division of labor as a provider of primary materials commodities and energy
444355 correa just wants to formalize everything if someone sells you bubblegum on the streets he wants to make sure that taxes are paid and that you get a receipt
444356 i hope that the leftist radicals who do not believe in the oil companies the mining companies the market or the transnationals go away
444357 is a government that has declared itself anti neoliberal but i always thought that the main anti neoliberal struggles were those against the extractive model
444358 the leader of the pa s movement has consciously pushed an illegal project of privatizing oil leading the public company petroecuador to be dismantled
444359 these policies benefit the same old mafia groups and some new ones they are doing what the right and the partidocracy could not accomplish over the past 25 years
444360 if i come and ask you if i can come and mess up your house you say
444361 official language of ecuador while spanish kichwa and shuar are official languages of intercultural relation other ancestral languages are for official use for the indigenous nationalities in the zones that they inhabit and within terms determined by the law
444362 while my analysis is overall positive weve made very little progress on the topic of indigenous rights but that ecuador is a plurinational state has been included even though it doesnt include all of the content that it should it is at least a first step and opens doors for future discussions
444363 we the indigenous peoples and nationalities do not ask for a right just for ourselves rather we demand that all of ecuador assume and recognize its own historical cultural and social value to continue to not recognize the indigenous peoples and nationalities languages means the continuing displacement of indigenous cultures as tourist objects or as simple elements utilized to decorate the discourses at government inauguration ceremonies for the inauguration of little infrastructure projects and political rallies kichwa is spoken while its legitimate representatives are insulted
444364 we consider the fact that they have declared ecuador a plurinational state
444365 they call us infiltrators or accuse us of having a right wing agenda for supporting human rights social security freedom of expression the environment justice communication the womens agenda campesino rights and the indigenous movements aspirations
444366 the president then launched a campaign pushing his own agricultural law
444367 favors the importation of agrochemicals it favors subsidies to an agribusiness model those who will benefit from this are the importers of agrochemicals producers of agrochemicals the sellers of agrochemicals the massive companies that own monoculture crop export operations and the people who control the circulation of food in this country
444368 this was in many senses the breaking point that led to acostas resignation
444369 a fundamental difference over the model of economic development that ecuador should follow
444370 acosta was supporting a model that was friendly to people and the environment
444371 what were seeing now is a model totally capitalist and that favors the large groups of power
444372 the constituent assembly legally possesses what is known as plenos poderes or full powers
444373 there was an ideological and political conflict while acosta defended our proposals the president has opposed them the national constituent assembly with its plenos poderes should be above the president but this is not happening the president decides whether something passes or not the assembly is just a technical group
444374 we saw alberto acostas presence in the constituent assemblys presidency as an assurance that crucial issues would be addressed issues like the rights of nature plurinationality water food sovereignty transgenics protected areas and collective and environmental rights some of these have been incorporated especially in the case of amnesties for arrested environmental defenders we actually saw the assembly exercising its plenos poderes
444375 i have a certain bittersweet feeling while im happy with what weve done im not happy with how we are finishing our work there are too many topics that were very rushed without a clear idea of how we can respond to so many outstanding issues we should have taken a few more weeks
444376 there is the question of public sympathy which is complicated when you have a president with such high approval ratings any action that a social movement takes can be read understood or publicized as an action in support of the right since this government is supposedly a leftist one
444377 this has produced a climate of uncertainty over what positions to take what actions to take
444378 the only united opposition right now is from the right which more than anything helps the government
444379 this opposition allows the government to legitimize itself to position itself against the right because the right has little support and is so discredited
444380 correa is trying to form a solid center left block and marginalize the radical left and take on the right wing jaime nebot and lucio gutierezz neither of whom will win this is his calculus which isnt bad it is within the possible
444381 i think that the left needs to recuperate political space space that has been co opted by alianza pa s and generate its own proposals
444382 we did find some areas where although he initially resisted he came around
444383 it was a classic strategy of giving the president things he doesnt want in bills he has to have
444384 in the eighth year of the presidency and in this environment bushs veto was pretty strong
444385 he had to compromise and he had to do it in two ways either they negotiated out a compromise or he was pushed into a compromise politically because of where the votes were
444386 the president doesnt get involved much with what goes on around here
444387 talking about a second stimulus package right now is premature
444388 well fight if we must but wed much rather dance
444389 okay you know my service record how does it compare to bushs
444390 whenever america targets and kills innocent people it comes up with such propaganda that it has killed a big personality in an attempt to justify the cruelty it has done
444391 damn that is the ugliest child i have ever seen
444392 this moron is as dumb as a box of hammers why in the hell am i still listening to him
444393 even bill cannot truly comment on the black experience where obama lived it
444394 she isnt one of us and she never will be
444395 with nonstop protests against the government samak had no choice but to replace some of his unpopular ministers
444396 it is very disappointing to see the new cabinet list
444397 the new cabinet cannot give thais any hope in dealing with the economic situation
444398 how come a court gives individuals the right to sue each other in cases related to national security and interests issues like these should be handled by intelligence state security and other institutions
444399 the previous australian government is responsible for another terrible crime by forcing refugees to be sent back to gaza when they knew the situation there

444403 i could not abdicate from my right to political activity just because of my meagre party wage
444404 i realized there was a silent decision to get rid of me
444405 but they didnt want to expel me because of renamos past experience with expulsions
444406 i was suspended without being heard and without any information
444407 i was suspended for an unlimited period and the other party members had instructions not to speak with me only the most courageous disobeyed
444408 each party has its own internal rules just like renamo
444409 just as samuge was not forced to join renamo so he was not forced to leave it was a voluntary decision and we welcome it

444424 i could see the sincerity in her that this was something she really wanted for her and her son
444425 the first thing that came into my mind was reginald oh my god why are all these people here what happened
444426 when i walked through the door i still couldnt believe it
444427 i was overwhelmed that my struggle and my journey was over reggie has what he needs its a beautiful home in a nice neighborhood and in a district that can accommodate his special needs
444428 and so to see something positive like this is different
444429 we talk to our players about giving back to the community this was jasons idea so i was just very proud of him i thought it was a very ennobling thing to do i just think it is marvelous

444448 there were negotiations going on between israelis and palestinians back in 2000 then prime minister barak ehud barak offered to the palestinians who of course were demanding appropriately that their capital of their palestinian state should be in the palestinian city of east jerusalem

444475 you know someone like nadal who i think is going to go down as one of the best players ever is going to play well for a whole season
444476 i think it was a matter of a tournament and a year or a season when hes going to start to play better and better on hardcourts because he has all the things that he needs to play well on any surface hes proven that hes even this year the best player on grass if you look at his style of the game you dont think that he might do really well on that surface which is the fastest in the sport but he obviously does really well

444493 maybe when people decide theyre going to travel they go all out if youre going to do it might as well do it
444494 alberta is probably the worst in terms of giving back vacation time
444495 i think we use around 50 to 60 per cent of our vacation time
444496 in calgary theres definitely a mindset where theres a pride in working extremely long hours
444497 people are a lot less balanced and are willing to trade in their vacation time for money but thats definitely not good for their physical or mental well being

444508 a lot of the material recovered has never been reported stolen
444509 with modern weapons grade uranium terrorists if they have such material would have a good chance of setting off a high yield explosion simply by dropping one half of the material onto the other half most people seem unaware that if separated u 235 is at hand its a trivial job to set off a nuclear explosion

444511 al qaeda has tried to acquire or make nuclear weapons for at least 10 years and continues to pursue its strategic goal of obtaining a nuclear capability
444512 we have not yet reached parity with them we have the right to kill four million americans two million of them children
444513 this to me is the most danger we are facing today
444514 because any country even if they have nuclear weapons would continue to have a rational approach they know if they use a nuclear weapon they will be pulverized for an extremist group there is no concept of deterrence if they have it they will use it
444515 controls over nuclear materials and weapons military power diplomacy intelligence covert action law enforcement border security and consequence management
444516 the actual amount of weapon usable nuclear material in russia
444517 the likelihood that the current screening system would detect a shielded nuclear weapon is quite low around 10 percent

444519 a fat man cannot speak persuasively to a skinny man about the virtues of not overeating
444520 to free the world from weapons of mass destruction in the hands of those who hate freedom
444521 to get their hands on the worlds most dangerous weapons
444522 turning the goal of a world without nuclear weapons into a practical enterprise among nations
444523 the goal of a world free of nuclear weapons is like the top of a very tall mountain
444524 from the vantage point of our troubled world today we cant even see the top of the mountain and it is tempting and easy to say we cant get there from here

444536 instead after complaining about being tired all the time unable to sleep for more than a few hours not able to concentrate having difficulty remembering things not being able to find words to say what it is i want to say verbally and some other things i was just diagnosed with depression
444537 it also doesnt help that when i did see the doc i would forget to mention some of the stuff i had been experiencing i would feel ok at the appointment and forget about alot of the shit i had been experiencing
444538 trouble is those are all the symptoms of depression that busy doctors look for without bothering to dig deeper you definitely need to get this new doc to listen to your fears about having a tbi

444558 how come raising ministers and top civil servants pay does not cause inflation but raising the pay of ordinary workers does
444559 the worse thing that any country does at a time of high inflation would be for the unions and workers to push for wage inflation wage inflation is different from wage increment wage inflation means you are pushing up wages to fully offset the inflation

444565 i talked to three people who read the endorsement in the lovelock review miner and they thought it was judge wagner endorsing the candidate

444593 cd70 targeted therapies have shown promise in multiple preclinical models by reducing autoimmune disease activity at well tolerated doses
444594 this clinical trial is designed to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of sgn 70 in humans and to serve as a foundation for future clinical trials in patients with autoimmune disease
444595 rapid improvements can be achieved if a breastfeeding culture once again permeates all levels of society
444596 governments will be unsuccessful in their efforts to accelerate economic development in any significant long term sense until optimal child growth and development especially through appropriate feeding practices are ensured
444597 together it is possible to substantially increase the number of babies that are exclusively breastfed during the first 6 months of life
444598 while a connection between calcium regulation and alzheimers pathology has been predicted for many years this is the first direct observation of a connection between amyloid plaques calcium accumulation and a neurodegenerative mechanism in the most relevant animal model
444599 we need to keep in mind that animal models are not a complete reflection of what happens in human disease so we cant extrapolate too far down the road
444600 but our data do suggest that calcineurin inhibition should be investigated in future studies which also should look at how amyloid beta causes calcium overload and whether removing plaques really does improve neuronal health
444601 in the past we were constrained by the time lapse between the completion of exercise and capturing the images
444602 we now have the ability to exercise patients to peak stress and obtain a high definition image of their heart within 60 seconds which helps us more accurately identify exercise induced abnormalities osu medical center is the only place in the world performing treadmill exercise stress tests inside the mri scan room
444603 cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the united states and by combining our medical expertise with other disciplines we can develop safe approaches for improved diagnosis and treatment

444605 evidence consistently shows that school based education about sex relationships and hiv works
444606 when adults are silent on the issue of hiv aids the consequences for children are often fatal
444607 youth friendly prevention and information services are absolutely crucial and need to be part of all our education systems
444608 better education programmes will empower young people especially girls to protect themselves and prevent the spread of the virus
444609 unfortunately these groups are not adequately reached by hiv prevention treatment and care services
444610 the aids conference represents a unique opportunity to examine our challenges but also to highlight the progress in the response the hiv epidemic in latin america and the caribbean
444611 we encourage governments and civil society from latin america and the caribbean to share with the rest of the world the advances the region has made particularly the scaling up of treatment
444612 we will examine how this new data from the sensor along with patients clinical condition and hospitalization rates relate to each other in detail it is our priority aim to extract a very reliable algorithm
444613 in a next step we hope to further enhance and design the heart failure monitor in an even more significant way
444614 with our latest and most technologically advanced cardiac device implant series lumax 540 we are taking another important step towards early detection of worsening heart failure and improved patient care
444615 in the future by measuring the intrathoracic impedance several times a day and transmitting it via our unique home monitoring technologies physicians will be able to detect the onset of decompensation early and immediately intervene therapeutically

444621 as more and more servicemembers return from the wars in iraq and afghanistan the va will face increased pressure to fairly and efficiently provide the benefits these men and women have earned we owe our veterans a tremendous debt for their service to our country but the current va claims process burdens our veterans with bureaucratic obstacles and outdated rules we must take steps to improve va procedures so that claims can be processed and benefits delivered quickly fairly and accurately for our veterans their families and their survivors
444622 the current va system is outdated and ineffective the men and women who dedicate their lives to taking care of our country deserve better than this and must be given the same level of committed care now and in the future
444623 this legislation will modernize the process and guarantee that our servicemen and women receive the benefits they deserve quickly and efficiently i am glad that the house passed this critical legislation and i will fight tooth and nail to make sure that it passes in the senate
444624 veterans have been waiting far too long for these reforms to the va
444625 we can and must change the way washington treats our injured veterans veterans currently face an overly bureaucratic va heroes returning from war deserve to receive the benefits they have earned easily and promptly i am tremendously pleased that this legislation passed the house unanimously and that senator clinton and senator schumer who have always been staunch advocates for veterans are now spearheading the effort in the senate

444655 we had a difficult start to this weekend but weve improved throughout the sessions and learnt a lot of things along the way we therefore werent looking too bad for qualifying i made a mistake on my fast lap in q1 and lost two and a half tenths in one corner so my q1 time did not show the true potential of our car we then had a good chance of making it into q3 but a hydraulic problem meant i couldnt go out at all in q2 which was disappointing its pretty interesting here tyre wise as both are very soft on this track but the harder ones were better for me today
444656 it was a difficult qualifying for me aside from plenty of traffic i didnt really manage to find the right balance on my last set of option tyres both factors compromised my run we now need to go through the data and work out whats happening in order to get the most out of the car for tomorrow
444657 that was a very good qualifying session for me and im obviously delighted we made a good start in first practice yesterday the team did a good job overnight and we made the right choice over set up it wasnt easy today because we had a very tight choice over tyres so we had to make a close decision for every lap but in the end my engineers stayed cool and got it right in q2 the car felt perfect then on the very last lap it was a bit trickier again because the tyres didnt behave quite as well but im happy with p5 we are in a great situation for tomorrow its good for all of us and after hockenheim this is the perfect answer for the faith i have in the whole team
444658 im glad to be in the top ten but that was a difficult qualifying session and p9 is disappointing since this morning i have struggled for grip and balance and unfortunately we werent able to find the answers in time i had the same problems in qualifying so we will have to investigate that tonight im happy for timo who has done a good job this weekend and it is clearly important for us to score as many points as possible for the constructors championship overtaking is very difficult here but tomorrow is a very long race and we will see what we can achieve
444659 a shame to miss out on q3 by one hundredth but we expected it to be tight we can be happy though especially given i only managed nine laps yesterday it means we did a good job today now we can do what we like in terms of fuel load for the race and hopefully find a good strategy ive yet to do a long run this weekend but i think we can find a good compromise between qualifying and race pace and we have a good set up on the car
444660 i struggled with the option tyre as it gave me no grip and i was sliding around more and had no feel for the car i was very happy in a well balanced car earlier on but after that im not really sure what happened i am disappointed because even if q3 would have been hard to reach i could not match my q1 time in q2
444661 im happy to have qualified in p12 today after a good lap on the final run in q2 pushed me a few places up the grid weve definitely made some progress with the new developments to the car and in particular the new rear suspension is working well and this has enabled us to improve the car step by step over the weekend i got the most out of the car today and its encouraging to see we were only three tenths away from the top ten as it has been a while since we were that close im on the dirty side of the grid which is a disadvantage but i am sure we can have a good race tomorrow from here nonetheless
444662 choosing which tyre to run was a really tough decision today and it was a difficult qualifying session i felt the supersoft option tyre was working slightly better with the car so i stayed with that for my final run after a good first sector i went in too quick for turn 11 and made a mistake which ruined my lap with that went the chance to progress to q2 and the time from my previous run puts me in 18th place on the grid the lap was going quite well but a mistake at turn 11 meant that i had to abort the lap i have to settle for 18th place today and turn my focus now to the race
444663 p12 is where we hoped to be today so yes we have moved a little closer to the middle order again the new mechanical developments have brought us improved stability and that has enabled us to achieve a better balance on the car this weekend due credit to jenson as he delivered a particularly good lap when it counted and we have reason to feel optimistic about tomorrows race
444664 that was a pretty good qualifying session quite straightforward it would have been nice to have had a bit more pace in q3 but q2 and q1 went well for us im disappointed im on the wrong side of the grid an odd number is always better but we definitely have a chance to get something from where we are so well see how we go tomorrow
444665 i was losing a little bit of time in each of the sectors and i couldnt deliver that last little bit of lap time because i was bringing the mid corner speed too low its tough from thirteenth for sure but the hungarian race can be unpredictable so lets see
444666 a respectable qualifying from mark in a very tight field were close to our nearest rivals in renault and toyota which should make for an interesting race tomorrow david isnt far off the back of that group he unfortunately didnt have a good second run in q2 but well be fighting hard tomorrow
444667 i am really happy with the result this was certainly one of my best qualifying sessions so far this season i was not expecting to start from fourth as the car has been quite difficult to drive over the entire weekend we struggled a bit with the balance but in the end i was able to make the harder tyre compound work very well and here we are i am now looking forward to the race
444668 im totally disappointed it looked quite good at the end of yesterdays practice and also this morning but on my last lap in q1 i had four cars in my way most of them at least tried to give me room but it still cost me time towards the end of the lap i had one car in front which was on an out lap he saw me and accelerated he then overtook sebastien bourdais before the last corner and then sebastien was right in my way i was hoping it was so obvious he would be penalised right away and i could still get into q2
444669 it was a very tight battle at the front with marginal time differences we expected to see mclaren on the front row robert did a very good last lap and secured fourth which means he will be starting in between the two ferraris certainly nicks result is disappointing he complained several times about traffic on his last and important fast lap and missed getting into q2 we should be very happy if he scores a point from this grid position

444693 does anyone out there think barack obama is too thin to be president
444694 easy to see that for some people in the world totally meaningless drivel is what keeps them occupied and up at night the good news is that these people probably do not see the real problems in the world living in the one they are in hopefully there is something that can legally keep you from voting or remember to vote on november 20th you will miss the rush
444695 yes i think he is to skinny to be president hillary has a potbelly and chuckybutt id of voted for her i wont vote for any beanpole guy
444696 love your response and your username onlinebeerbellygirl would you mind shooting me an email so i can ask you a few more quesitons my email is amy chozick thanks so much
444697 the scary thing is that you have the right to vote and both parties are probably trying to get your vote
444698 but in a nation in which 66 of the voting age population is overweight and 32 is obese could sen obamas skinniness be a liability despite his visits to waffle houses ice cream parlors and greasy spoon diners around the country his slim physique just might have some americans wondering whether he is truly like them
444699 only celebrities like barack obama go to the gym three times a day demand met rx chocolate roasted peanut protein bars and bottles of a hard to find organic brew black forest berry honest tea and worry about the price of arugula
444700 these days he stays away from junk food and instead snacks on met rx chocolate roasted peanut protein bars and drinks black forest berry honest tea a healthy organic brew
444701 sen obama drew cringes on a campaign stop in adel iowa in july 2007 when he asked a crowd of farmers anybody gone into a whole foods lately and seen what they charge for arugula the upscale supermarket specializing in organic food doesnt have a single store in iowa
444702 barack obama what are you going to do for the black community
444703 in the face of the numerous attacks that are made by the black community by the same u s government the same government you want to be why is it you havent not one time spoken in the interests or even on behalf of the oppressed and exploited african community the black community
444704 this is democracy at work he asked a legitimate question
444705 i think youre misinformed when you say not one time every issue youve asked about i have spoken about
444706 that doesnt mean im going to always satisfy the way you want these issues framed it gives you the option of voting for someone else it gives you the option of running for office yourself but the one thing that i think is important is that we are respectful towards each other and what is true is that i believe the only way were going to solve our problems is that everyone comes together black white
444707 barack obama what are you going to do for the black community
444708 obama is an assured win unless the powers that be the ones who rigged the two bush elections rig yet another one
444709 barack obama what are you going to do for the black community
444710 if obama becomes president this is a good point african americans will except obama to more for them
444711 black america what are you going to do for yourselves
444712 i think that you will find obama more conservative than anyone expected
444713 do you notice that there is not one positive statement by any supporter of mccain
444714 i believe that offshore drilling and the gas tax rebate are pure snake oil mccain and fox are mocking the idea of checking your tire inflation but it would save far far more oil than offshore drilling
444715 mandating the size and horsepower of automobiles would save more oil than any proposal on the table
444716 gms market share in the region fell more than two percentage points from a year earlier to 20 and demand for its most profitable products trucks and sport utility vehicles essentially collapsed as consumers responded to high gasoline prices weak economic conditions and tighter credit
444717 the use of petroleum reserves that are exposed to little to no geopolitical risk will restore confidence and stability in the marketplace thus lowering perhaps significantly petroleum prices
444718 we dont need more mandates that will makes the cars more expensive and less affordable
444719 the amounts available are nowhere near significant enough to make an impact on the global market for petroleum futures
444720 if someone announced that they could reduce the countrys dependence on imported oil by 20 but that it would take contributions by everyone to pay for it we couldnt wait to do it
444721 the use of petroleum reserves that are exposed to little to no geopolitical risk will restore confidence and stability in the marketplace thus lowering perhaps significantly petroleum prices

444852 it makes me feel better to know that this person who harmed so many people can never hurt anyone again
444853 and by taking his own life he has punished himself
444854 i always wondered if the perpetrator had any remorse or guilt over the deaths
444855 now unless they have something to convince the public that ivins was the guy i think well always remain open to the idea that it could have been someone else i think there will still be uncertainty
444856 we are saddened by his death and disappointed that we will not have the opportunity to defend his good name and reputation in a court of law
444857 i was surprised that there has been an investigation going on
444858 it is sad that the man took his life so he couldnt give his side of the story life goes on and i hope this will be the end of it
444859 we still consider this to be the site of an active investigation
444860 it was a moving experience for all of us involved here
444861 it defied logic as to how a 94 year old living a quiet life in a small rural town could possibly be a victim of a terrorist act she was an unintentional and chance victim because her mail happened to cross paths with someone who was an intended target

444865 she was a first class lady from everything ive heard about her
444866 i didnt even think they were even looking into it anymore
444867 i hope the investigators will continue to look into it and will be successful in learning who was responsible even if it turns out that it was this person who just died
444868 she loved life and especially enjoyed children and being around young people

444874 the introduction of a qt of coffee solution into the colon will dilute portal blood and subsequently the bile theophylline and theobromine major constituents of coffee dilate blood vessels and counter inflammation of the gut the palmitates of coffee enhance glutathione s transferase which is responsible for the removal of many toxic radicals from serum finally the fluid of the enema itself stimulates the visceral nervous system promoting peristalsis and the transit of diluted toxic bile from the duodenum out the rectum because the stimulating enema is retained for 15 minutes and because all the blood in the body passes through the liver nearly every three minutes these enemas represent a form of dialysis of blood across the gut wall

444952 given the clear lack of public political and business support for a new multi purpose arena plus the enactment of initiative 91 as a city of seattle ordinance following a public vote authorized by the seattle city council itself and the significant operating losses the businesses are now incurring we have no option but to commence the nba relocation process
444953 today we notified commissioner david stern that we intend to relocate the sonics to oklahoma city if we succeed in the pending litigation with the city or are able to negotiate an early lease termination or at the end of the lease term

444965 recently youve had to call away games from the studio does that change the experience at all sure absolutely this was something that was actually started several years ago at the network level when you had the world cup in korea and japan and the time was so upside down there becomes that balance between the practicality of having somebody in the stadium and the costs that go into doing something like that so at the international level because of the time changes i think youre going to see that exclusively with the olympics all of the olympic soccer and many of the other olympic events are going to be done out of studio bob costas will be there as the host and there will be some people on site and the next world cup 2010 in south africa i think youre going to see the same thing therell be very little of announcers going on site
444966 but i dont think anyone and i say this with all due respect i dont think anyone is tremendously happy about the fact that were doing games out of studio this year with the crew and there are several reasons for that its not something that the crew is necessarily planning to do long term but there are in this day and age some economic realities that were all dealing with and youve got to come up with money some place and this was a place because television production is very very expensive and this was one of the ways in which they felt they could do some other things of importance for the organization is a beautiful game

445013 with millions gaining access to life saving drugs and treatment the battle against aids enters a critical phase we must address the long term deeply entrenched social challenges that stand in the way of people living full and productive lives with the disease
445014 this means confronting head on the discrimination and lack of opportunity that made so many vulnerable to the disease in the first place

445016 buyers of our vehicles are still shopping and purchasing but are even more discerning to choose for long term quality and value in light of our corporate results announced today we are going to strengthen our focus on profitability over the next 12 to 18 months by keeping the supply of vehicles in close alignment with demand which in turn increases our pricing flexibility and brand value actions we are already taking include shifting our customer programs in our dealerships to achieve a more equitable balance of retail financing to leasing further emphasizing the benefits of our four year free maintenance program and further developing our certified pre owned business to aid residual values

445019 when we began this process last year even our own members thought taking on car manufacturers was daunting
445020 but they came to understand this is an issue of survival for them and for their customers when the manufacturers fail to provide us equal access to that information the consumers are directly and negatively impacted
445021 i was in dozens of meetings with representatives from all corners of the state and i can tell you that they understand that this is a consumer issue first and then an economic issue about jobs in this economy
445022 the car manufacturers know better but they dont have any other defense for their opposition because this is a pro consumer bill
445023 what else would they say that they are anti consumer

445072 i think that this and perhaps providing additional incentives to permit exploration off their coasts would be very helpful in the short term for resolving our energy crisis
445073 it would have long term consequences for our coastlines but no short term benefits since it would take at least 10 years to get any oil
445074 now basically its a terrific idea but we ran out the clock its really misleading to hold that out as a panacea it wont work it might work for our grandchildren
445075 we dont have any idea whether any of it is there
445076 the problem is that the worldwide capacity to build rigs now has a backlog going out until about 2013 and we wont add enough rigs to even start to replace the very old rig fleet that we have
445077 i think its short sighted in my opinion to say its not going to make a difference
445078 this is just one piece of the puzzle we know that theres a lot of uncertainty around how much reserves and production it will bring to bear but having additional options makes more sense than keeping them off the table

445088 if you look at natalie and you hear the description of her you would never in a million years think that she was a child that would use heroin
445089 you ask 10 out of 10 people what a typical heroin addict looks like and theyll say its a junkie in the street with a needle hanging out of their arm
445090 youre not going to see the telltale signs like track marks and needle marks
445091 the kids have been told about the detriment of using cocaine alcohol or marijuana but heroin was never discussed really thats something from a generation ago
445092 a kid was asleep at the table next to them and then his buddy comes out of the bathroom with a needle and blood running down his arm he had heroin in his pocket and he got arrested
445093 i approached her and she told me she got it in school that day
445094 when your daughter has had one overdose and they dont come home we both immediately started crying
445095 how can we be responsible for someone and not have any authority
445096 they look at their good healthy beautiful kid and they feel secure i dont want them to feel secure and thats what got to me at the wake i saw these mothers
445097 even with a 15 year old what do you do
445098 tie them down and take them to a doctor or to a rehab im not sure what the answer is and im not sure the officials know what the answer is either otherwise they would be doing more about it its just alarming
445099 his death is leading the way to a true all out war in the problem of drugs and cowardly acts of violence
445100 let us hope that out of his ultimate sacrifice will come positive developments in defeating the drug problem
445101 the car has been feeling strong the last few races and i think we have been improving since the last test and all the way through the weekend
445102 weve just been improving the car more and more and it was just a matter of nailing it in qualifying
445103 it was difficult to choose the right tyre and also i was planning to use the softer one with the heavier fuel in the last part of qualifying
445104 but then we changed our mind when everybody else went quicker with the harder tyre
445105 with the conditions changing a little bit the harder tyre was in favour but apart from that it was a good effort by everybody at the team and tomorrow should be a good race
445106 tomorrow should be dry and i think we are going to see a circuit evolving towards the end of the race
445107 its going to get grippier and grippier and the off the line it is going to get dirtier so you just cant put a wheel off the line that is going to be crucial tomorrow
445108 kovalainen isnt here to support hes here to win the race and he has got the same car
445109 they fought at silverstone into the first corner and they can fight here all that id like them to do is not end up with egg on their faces
445110 the thing is to emerge from the first corner in first and second in whatever order that is but we havent had team orders and were not going to have them here
445111 we want to see a good race but lewis is on a roll at the moment so hes going to be strong competition for everybody including his team mate
445112 this is like monte carlo without the sea its almost impossible to overtake here and if your two cars are on the front row then you can really control the race
445113 our first objective is to come first and second thats how you approach a race like this but theres a long way to go but its a good place to be
445114 the developments we have on our car here were destined for valencia and to accelerate our programme took a lot of effort and a lot of all nighters which is an unheard of thing in motor racing these days
445115 in qualifying it was tricky with the tyres a lot of ups and downs in terms of tyre conditions and sometimes i couldnt get the pace on the out lap because of traffic and that already cost me a bit of time
445116 unfortunately i also lost a bit of time in the first sector but p5 i think is okay
445117 i think everybody around me will be battling hard and we have to wait to see how the race will go tomorrow especially what the temperatures are doing to tyre conditions and choice we will have to wait and see
445118 at the moment im happy with p5 and we should aim for that result and if we can keep kimi raikkonen in sixth behind us that would be really good but it will be difficult
445119 im glad to be in the top ten but that was a difficult qualifying session and p9 is disappointing
445120 since this morning i have struggled for grip and balance and unfortunately we werent able to find the answers in time
445121 i had the same problems in qualifying so we will have to investigate that tonight
445122 im happy for timo who has done a good job this weekend and it is clearly important for us to score as many points as possible for the constructors championship
445123 we didnt seem to be that strong this morning but if you look at the lap times in q1 and q2 we are there with mclaren
445124 for sure we are not where we are at the race in hockenheim and silverstone which was a big lottery but i think we are there and i can push this car tomorrow
445125 i was not 100 happy with my laps in q3
445126 i went a little bit at the wrong time onto the track as there were so many cars around and most of the people were very very slow on their out laps
445127 especially in my case i like to go a bit quicker so but i couldnt pass them so it was tricky for preparing the tyres
445128 i couldnt prepare them like i was supposed to so i didnt do as great a lap as i did in q1 and q2
445129 when i start to explain that to you youll be messing with my speech so you know i can only say that mr d eddie d hes instrumental in my life in more ways than one some ways probably more than mr d even knows himself
445130 but he gave me a lot of inspiration and so did coach walsh to me it was one of the lower moments in my life i was kind of depressed because i was leaving the chargers coach bill walsh he brought me in mr eddie he accepted me you know theres so much inside of me that its really difficult for me to explain right now
445131 the pressure he could apply from the outside and the push we got on the inside really people forget how good of a defense it was
445132 he was the freak before the freak he was like jevon kearse in that he wasnt especially big he was barely bigger than a linebacker at that i probably weighed more than him fred was quick and he was strong he had natural strength
445133 when he was traded in 81 that really changed things for our defense it put a lot more strain on the front and the linebackers it affected our effectiveness
445134 obviously he had great success in san francisco im happy for him
445135 i actually stepped on the other side for a minute breathed in the air looked at it as a rainbow i made it to the other side of the rainbow for me that was the pot of gold it was a different lifestyle for me altogether i felt free to perform once i got there
445136 at that time they were playing the dallas cowboys bill walsh told me they hadnt beat em in a while it was in the paper and everything about how they had not for me it was a platform for me to prove a point that i still had it and could do it
445137 i started for the chargers was a down lineman played every down with coach walsh he said im going to use you sparingly for rushing the passer he said he didnt know what my condition was
445138 the first game he said id only play like 10 or 12 plays
445139 yes i take a great deal of pride in that because
445140 to be the person that does something regardless of what it is if its anything out of the ordinary it makes you real good it makes you proud of it
445141 i never really looked at it from that standpoint the thing for me was i loved the game i played it to win and i was a team player i love competition even among my own teammates i liked the thing about challenging my teammates so we could all step up another level
445142 gary was the best left tackle i ever saw play the game
445143 his strength and athleticism were exceptional he understood the game and was as tough as i have ever seen also
445144 he practically played his last year one armed because of a bad shoulder he was a classic left tackle and very deserving of his election to the hall of fame
445145 it was kind of a storybook ending there for me
445146 old school tough guy never said anything to anybody but just worked his rear end off
445147 he brought a discipline in here to the offensive line that wed never seen before he was the mainstay of that offensive line that won super bowl xxxii
445148 for the first time in my life i have too much to say
445149 there are guys who try hard like me and i was relentless but i wasnt a good athlete
445150 and there are guys who rely on their talents but dont try hard to get better gary had more talent than anyone and also outworked everybody thats what separates guys like gary from the rest of us
445151 a technician he did everything right he wasnt the biggest tackle but he did everything right
445152 i hear people who are bulimic they see themselves as fat when i was playing i saw myself as not good enough so i always tried to be better
445153 i could watch people and think they did a good job but then watch myself and i was like kind of embarrassed so i tried to work harder
445154 when you have that different mind set that youve got to go out and prove yourself every day because you are such a perfectionist it gives you a chance to get better
445155 you get an overachiever with great ability and then youve got a hall of a fame player and thats what weve got
445156 when i went to denver its like the dog who gets put to the pound and you get a new owner and the loyalty is to that new owner and the owner treats you good

445163 i was working out the back cleaning out the guttering when i heard screaming and somebody shouting hes on fire
445164 i knew we had to put it out so i grabbed the hose as i held the hose on him i could see his skin was peeling he wasnt on fire by that stage
445165 we dont know what was happening but we believe michael may have been making popcorn in the kitchen
445166 everybody just had to get out very quickly were very worried about him
445167 for such a congested residential area it was very impressive that the air ambulance was able to land here so quickly
445168 what a lovely gift you have for writing this post will make me smile all day ah love
445169 you have a way of describing your life and the things you are doing there that really draws the reader in
445170 ooooh lucky you you get hate mail you have obviously made it
445171 i stop by almost daily to read your blog its like checking in with an old friend to see how their day went
445172 you make me love paris even more than i already do
445173 im reading this post at my office on a floor of open work cubicles laughing hysterically
445174 i want to tell you how much i enjoyed the podcast you should be a radio announcer
445175 rushdie told the guardian that the book portrayed him as mean nasty tight fisted arrogant and extremely unpleasant
445176 in my humble opinion i am none of those things i am not trying to prevent him from publishing this stupid book but if they publish it there will be consequences and there will be a libel action
445177 rushdies lawyer mark stephens said saturday that he had written to the publisher of on her majestys service the tell all not the bond novel demanding it withdraw the book which has not yet been published
445178 stephens who also does legal work for the associated press said he wrote to the books publisher john blake publishing ltd
445179 the metropolitan police said the force could not comment on evans allegations but said in a statement we regret that he chooses to publish this book
445180 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
445181 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
445182 i dont come out of central casting im young im new to the national scene my name is barack obama i do not have the typical biography of a presidential candidate
445183 if i lose a pound that week great if not i can have a treat either way i win
445184 athletes who make the unacceptable choice to cheat should recognize that there will be consequences those consequences can be severe including the loss of medals and results were in full support of this action in other matters like this in the past weve worked with the ioc to make certain medals will be returned and well do so again
445185 you lose that opportunity to stand on top of the podium and feel the joy of winning the race those are the people who hurt the worst when there are cheaters ahead of them giving back the medals is just a technicality because you cant repair the hurt feelings and the hard work that went into it

445194 in no way do i think john mccains campaign was racist i think they are cynical
445195 their team is good at creating distractions and engaging in negative attacks
445196 what i dont want to do is for the best to be the enemy of the good
445197 and if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things that i dont like or the democrats have to accept some things that they dont like in exchange for actually moving us in the direction of actual energy independence then thats something im open to

445262 access to nhs dental care is also a continuing concern and this survey shows where people are most worried about this around the country
445263 regular dental treatment is important for maintaining good oral hygiene if a large proportion of people do not receive this treatment regularly we could be facing a significant national health problem in years to come
445264 it is unacceptable that more than three quarters of people want access to an nhs dentist but cant get it
445265 the government urgently needs to do more to help the millions of people across the country who are unable to get affordable dental care under the current system
445266 real problems for patients could be being stored up for the future
445267 it is vital that urgent action is taken to tackle the flaws in the current nhs arrangements for dentistry

445269 as things stand perhaps to look at an inflation rate of 8 9 per cent will be a difficult thing but probably we will do it by march 2009
445270 you can get a much lower rate of inflation if there is confluence of favourable factors such as moderation in oil prices and so on otherwise if the oil prices remain at the prevailing rate that is best estimate for inflation
445271 as far as growth is concerned it will slow down it will slow down than what we have experienced in previous years but nevertheless i think we can still hope to have gdp growth of economy between 7 5 to 8 per cent

445298 para m es uno m s uno y la renovaci n depender de c mo me sienta yo
445299 creo que para m en lo particular esto es importante porque sigo en el lugar donde quise estar siempre desde mi vuelta de europa y eso me deja muy tranquilo
445300 por ahora aguanto seis meses m s y despu s se ver
445301 va a ser muy dif cil sobretodo porque los equipos se reforzaron muy bien y van a presentar dificultades en la segunda parte de enero a junio porque hay muchos equipos en la copa y los grandes se entretienen jugando esa competencia y dejan espacio a los que vienen de atr s
445302 formando un buen plantel en todas las l neas y que sea parejo ten s la posibilidad de apuntar a las dos cosas aunque despu s el f tbol no es matem tica tampoco es previsible y puede pasar en que ahora en el primer cruce te quedes afuera hay que ir por todo y ver qu ser lo mejor
445303 no son jugadores previsibles y aportar n gol que son las cosas importantes vienen con ganas de mostrarse y todo eso es importante y les da un plus que tambi n lo transmiten al resto del plantel
445304 c mo se reforz y c mo se habla fuera del club pero despu s depender mucho de nosotros mantener ese esp ritu con respecto a lo que se habla y se dice nos da orgullo y nos pone bien pero a la vez es una responsabilidad doble mantener alto algo que se hizo dif cil llegar y que es dif cil siempre de mantener
445305 no hablo de favorito sino que lo importante es mantener la seriedad la humildad y las ganas de superarse y de trabajar y que es lo que van a heredar los chicos en el futuro cuando no est yo calder n y alayes por dar algunos nombres ser n ellos los que se formaron en el club quienes deban llevar esa bandera que hoy llevamos nosotros
445306 el manoseo que hubo alrededor del tema fue mucho y si bien todos esperaban una decisi n de lio no todos tienen en este caso la misma personalidad tal vez otro agarra la valija y se va pero otros como le paso a lio esper a ver c mo se resolv a el tema
445307 cada uno lo maneja de una manera distinta pero conoci ndolo bien s que se mor a por estar en la selecci n pero tiene otro car cter y lo manej de otra manera lo que vi mal fue c mo se manejaron el barcelona y la fifa en este tema
445308 eso es importante y te da un plus m s all de las cualidades futbol sticas que pueda tener cada uno
445309 el hecho de haber nacido en el club de ser de la ciudad y respirar lo que se vive en la ciudad es importante estos chicos que volvieron a gimnasia que son hinchas les puede hacer bien gimnasia es uno de esos equipos que se reforz bien y puede hacer un buen campeonato est equilibrado y con muchachos que juegan bien al f tbol

445316 i go through phases when ive been filming where i wake up in the middle of the night and i think im being filmed thats when i have to take a vacation
445317 we definitely wonder what it would be like to have another hopefully knock on wood someday my job is great to have as a mom i get to take breaks and then work in a really concentrated way during that concentrated time it sucks but whatever
445318 i asked ted am i welcome in the building if i report and ted was just about shattered he said brett you cant do that youll get me fired i told him im not trying to get anybody fired so ted asked me to let the guys report and lets try to resolve this over the next two or three days
445319 they played a great four games they beat us we got schooled they played a lot better than we did we havent done anything right in four days
445320 we dont like the fact that we allowed their fans to come into our park and have a four day party but thats our fault
445321 thats just pathetic i certainly hope that the word has gone forth to all secretaries that youve got to really ratchet this down its not time to be trying to impress people with rented limousines
445322 were keenly aware of the fact that six months of crime progress can be undermined by a couple of bad days of crime news but i think the city deserves given its investment in us to get some positive news out of us
445323 it was a great act of courage since she happened to be a democrat perhaps your reward will be in heaven not here on earth
445324 hes the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
445325 its getting a lot of attention which is exactly what it was designed to do everybodys talking about it and were having a great time with it
445326 they ran a ridiculous ad thats insulting not to us but to the american people he said

445334 then they might think we are weird crazy or something
445335 the same joint resolution shall not propose an amendment to the constitution on more than one subject matter
445336 including a term limits repeal or revision could tank the reform proposal

445358 every club has its own disciplinary codes the club will make a judgement in the next week
445359 after the investigation we will make a decision i would suggest that it will be after the game with wolves
445360 has he a future lets wait and see i dont want to pre judge anything
445361 the city of london and the city of london police already has many methods of communicating with businesses workers and residents in the square mile
445362 we pull out all the stops since the amber alert has been implemented in california thereve been eight cases involving 11 children all 11 have been returned safely
445363 we tried to introduce a bill last year to do it it was ignored and it wasnt until after there had been a tragedy and an abduction earlier this year that the governor began to put some things in place
445364 the key is time and that is why the amber alert system works so well a study showed that out of 100 kids that were abducted and murdered they were killed within the first three hours
445365 i think its important for the american people to understand were not going to drill our way out of this problem
445366 why is it that you have not had the ability to speak to the interests or even speak on behalf of the oppressed and exploited african community the black community in this country
445367 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
445368 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
445369 i dont come out of central casting im young im new to the national scene my name is barack obama i do not have the typical biography of a presidential candidate
445370 we are fully committed to sustainable development within the uk europe and globally
445371 the uk took a leading role in the world summit on sustainable development

445377 the critics have been harsh all the way through my career but it doesnt affect me

445382 we did find some areas where although he initially resisted he came around
445383 it was a classic strategy of giving the president things he doesnt want in bills he has to have
445384 in the eighth year of the presidency and in this environment bushs veto was pretty strong
445385 he had to compromise and he had to do it in two ways either they negotiated out a compromise or he was pushed into a compromise politically because of where the votes were
445386 the president doesnt get involved much with what goes on around here
445387 talking about a second stimulus package right now is premature
445388 well fight if we must but wed much rather dance

445393 so the point that i was making at the time was that the political dynamic was the driving force between that sectarian violence and we could try to keep a lid on it but if these underlining dynamic continued to bubble up and explode the way they were then we would be in a difficult situation i am glad that in fact those political dynamic shifted at the same time that our troops did outstanding work
445394 ok heres the plan we use the daughter of some staunch and wealthy and well known supporters of our candidate and make her an example of all that is the worst in the culture of celebrity promiscuity partying porno to call attention to obamas shallowness in an ad that runs nationally
445395 so the point that i was making at the time was that the political dynamic was the driving force between that sectarian violence and we could try to keep a lid on it but if these underlining dynamic continued to bubble up and explode the way they were then we would be in a difficult situation i am glad that in fact those political dynamic shifted at the same time that our troops did outstanding work
445396 i havent spent time testing a lot of sites but the gawker media sites all seem to be affected these include gawker valleywag gizmodo and lifehacker among others
445397 when building a team i first search for people who love to win if i cant find any of those i then look for people who hate to lose

445399 now i can tell everyone that yes i will sign a contract i never told anyone i would be leaving this club never ever im very happy weve found a solution
445400 i have three years left on my contract and im putting two or three years more so im very happy being part of this family i can say this on arsenal tv i can say this on sky i can say this on every tv station in the world i never said i am going to leave arsenal
445401 when we started talking about my contract i never told him id be leaving this club and he knew my desire my desire was to stay at this club so for me hes like my father hes my boss so whatever he tells me ill do it so our relationship at the moment is always strong
445402 if he plays he will be captain if he does not play it will be somebody else but william will be the club captain yes
445403 first of all its two days where people are coming to watch good football without any special pressure the fans are like the players when there is a lot at stake its a big pressure and i think about it with great memories because it is a great day for the fans the weekend is of a good quality and is done in a good atmosphere there is a good mixture of enjoyment and quality of games because the top teams come here i believe everyone is happy to play in this tournament and none of our squad would want to miss it
445404 its a football country the clubs are always well organised and we will be favourites it will be important for us to be at the top of our concentration to go through steve mcclaren will get his team well organised and make it difficult for us but i still feel the biggest part will be how well we will play and how we will go into the game
445405 in one respect it is a tough draw for us on the other it is now an opponent we know very well not just myself everyone in holland knows the premier league well so arsenal will be no strangers to us on one hand it is very very tough for us but on the other it is very exciting

445415 a new duty will be placed on local authorities to promote democracy local leaders will be expected to do more to help residents understand how the democratic process works and how they can get involved residents can expect to see information campaigns and town halls being opened up to councillors to hold surgeries new civic champions council staff or former councillors who will go out into the community and work with residents and community groups to increase understanding about how they can raise awareness about civic roles they can take up whether thats volunteering standing as a governor a councillor or becoming a magistrate
445416 in our own informal way weve acted more as a critical friend than fawning acolyte or jaded oppositionalist
445417 wed like to highlight the good things that are happening right now in northern ireland and the awards will aim to reward effort and interactivity with a pat on the back from the blogosphere
445418 i have left the party and the press office as i feel that the current programme for government of the stormont administration will put working class communities under increased pressure at a time when the current global credit crunch is already hurting this vulnerable group in society i also feel that the partys left wing credentials have been damaged by the above and by a continued courtship with the american administration
445419 one of the bad things about the internet is that you pay attention to your commenters
445420 weve seen evidence for this water ice before in observations by the mars odyssey orbiter and in disappearing chunks observed by phoenix last month but this is the first time martian water has been touched and tasted
445421 yes its a rap about particle physics yes it mentions antimatter and the bbc report an
445422 criminal and anti social elements who are using this bonfire as a cover for other activities
445423 while the provincial man looks to the opinion of the metropolis the parochial is never in any doubt about the social and artistic validity of his parish
445424 these cases are due to come before the tribunals and will be strenuously defended by ofmdfm in the circumstances it would be inappropriate to comment further
445425 one thing that should not be allowed is the glorification in song or story of what was mean and nasty and dirty
445426 there is always the risk of the re emergence of a cyclical pattern as a generation of young people who have not experienced the actuality the horror and the cost of violence react against the ineffectiveness of politics and politicians their predecessors having been persuaded to turn away from violence on the promise that politics could deliver

445449 these findings are of major concern to health care professionals and should place families on alert to watch out for signs and symptoms of depression in new mothers
445450 we know from previous prams surveys that about one third of the pregnancies in oklahoma are unintended so we have a potential for high risk of postpartum depression in oklahoma

445454 we made these mice and they had low blood sugar they resisted weight gain they had low fats in their blood they were much healthier animals
445455 and when we put them on a treadmill the engineered mice ran twice as far than normal mice they transformed into remarkable runners
445456 we had shown that we could pre program muscle using genetic engineering if you express this gene while the muscle is being formed you can increase the amount of non fatiguing muscle fibers
445457 but what about reprogramming in an adult when all the muscles are in place can you give a drug that washes over the muscle for a few hours at a time and reprograms existing muscle fibers thats a very different question
445458 we measured gene changes and the muscles looked like they were responding so we knew the drug was working
445459 there was no change at all in running performance nothing not even a percent
445460 if youre out of shape and most of us are and you want to change you have to do some exercise the way we reprogram muscle in adults is by training
445461 it hops onto ppar delta in the nucleus and turbo charges its transcriptional activity
445462 we think ampk activity is the secret to allowing ppar delta drugs to work
445463 after four weeks of receiving the drug the mice were behaving as if theyd been exercised
445464 we have now created the potential for a really simple intervention in an area of major health problems for which there is no intervention
445465 almost no one gets the recommended 40 minutes to an hour per day of exercise
445466 for this group of people if there was a way to mimic exercise it would make the quality of exercise that they do much more efficient this might be enough to move people out of the danger zone toward a lower risk healthier set point by intervening early you may forestall the emergence of more serious problems
445467 if you like exercise you like the idea of getting more bang for your buck
445468 if you dont like exercise you love the idea of getting the benefits from a pill
445469 drugs that improve health are not only going to be used by people who have medical problems they may also be used by people who are healthy or by athletes who want an edge
445470 people born with this condition cannot move one or both eyes outward toward their ear
445471 when they try to look out the eye doesnt move when they look in the eyeball retracts and gets pulled back into the socket
445472 the large scale project reported in science benefited from collaborations with the researchers who had previously genetically mapped the disorder using linkage analysis and with clinicians worldwide who identified additional families with duane syndrome
445473 additionally neurodevelopmental biologists including professor sarah guthrie at kings college in london modeled the genetic defect in chick embryos
445474 likely disconnect the response of the nerve to growth signals so the nerve doesnt appropriately reach the muscle
445475 this is a nice example of an error in the development of a very simple motor circuit
445476 if we can understand the wiring of these simple circuits we may be able to better understand wiring of more complex neural circuits as well
445477 it is intriguing that loss of function studies revealed the necessity of 2 chimaerin for correct upper motor neuron wiring
445478 while our work now demonstrates that over activity of 2 chimaerin disrupts human lower motor neuron development future functional studies should provide insight into the fine tuning of 2 chimaerin and other racgap signaling molecules in neural development
445479 and we continue to find that congenital eye movement disorders are a very sensitive indicator for errors in the development of motor circuitry
445480 engaged in one of its most important missions establishing a negative narrative about the opponent
445481 our interest in using genomics to study metabolic diseases led us to screen dna from liver cells that expressed foxa2 with an assay called chip on chip
445482 we were surprised that a cluster of genes involved in lipid and steroid metabolism was identified by being bound to foxa2
445483 in order to lay the groundwork for developing new treatments we have to determine how foxa2 itself is regulated
445484 this paper makes the surprising discovery that one accessory co factor foxp1 is needed for the output of each of the 21 hox proteins that make motor neurons different
445485 depending on which hox gene is turned on foxp1 is induced to different levels and this difference in level programs which motor neuron subtype is generated it is a complicated but satisfying genetic logic one that appears to have evolved to ensure the generation of the diverse array of motor neuron subtypes needed for fine motor control of the limbs
445486 lampreys dont play the violin and they dont run their motor programs are designed for simple swimming behaviors
445487 the lamprey represents the most extreme example of vertebrate organisms whose lifestyle permits them to survive with a highly reduced array of motor neuron subtypes
445488 at some point in evolution vertebrates acquired the ability to generate hundreds of motor neuron subtypes presumably to accommodate the appearance of limbs new muscle classes
445489 this mutation in effect reverts the spinal cord to a primitive ancestral state generating a lamprey like spinal cord encased in a mammalian body
445490 we anticipate that these animals will have a severe impairment in motor behavior and studying later phases of foxp1 function should reveal insights into the assembly of motor circuits in the spinal cord as well as the periphery
445491 this is a promising screening strategy for identifying drugs that prevent or slow the degeneration of motor neurons
445492 hopefully many researchers will build upon these advances in basic motor neuron biology to design better and more predictive therapeutic screens
445493 do not the unbelievers see that the heavens and the earth were joined together as one unit of creation before we clove them asunder

445496 non sono molto contento dei miei giri spiega il brasiliano sono andato un po fuori tempo anche perch sulla pista cerano molte macchine ho avuto difficolt purtroppo non sono riuscito a preperare le gomme come avrei voluto e andare veloce come in q1 e q2 noi rispetto alla mclaren penso che siamo forti e siamo pronti forse non siamo a livello della gara di hockenheim ma faremo di tutto per migliorare stiamo cercando di sviluppare il pi possibile la monoposto e spingeremo sempre pi forte da qui alla fine

445506 this is a test if it comes back that no one is asking the first thing well do is send our inspectors in and start checking patrons ids to catch people doing the wrong thing
445507 these young adults will attempt to play gaming machines and casino tables games place bets with bookmakers and the tab play keno and buy lottery tickets without being asked for id
445508 the research will cover as many venues in as many metropolitan and regional areas as the budget allows mr west said
445509 id checks are the first line of defence in preventing minors gambling and potentially developing gambling problems
445510 high visibility policing is the best deterrent to clubs and pubs which are not doing the right thing he said
445511 im advocating a 20 year program that would see state governments accept the inevitable with ministries reduced to five and state mps serving on a part time basis he said
445512 theres been a devastating leaching of state government powers to the commonwealth i dont think its a good thing but is sadly irreversible
445513 meanwhile the national government has clawed indigenous affairs off the states and territories and might as well be making all the decisions in this area
445514 its hard to see much autonomy left in health policy for the states after the current review being conducted in canberra
445515 apart from police the one area where they are likely to continue to have real autonomy is in land use planning implementing capital city plans controlling rivers and native vegetation running most national parks making forestry decisions
445516 with 20 years for everyone to make the transition no state leader can be accused of blocking this reform just to preserve his or her own job he said

445518 the calais is one of australias prestige cars and has more power than the standard version and consumes more fuel he said
445519 cars like the berlina and the calais represent the high end of the fuel consumption up to three times more fuel consumption than for a toyota prius
445520 it is gross hypocrisy for labor ministers to lecture australians on carbon emissions and hybrid cars from behind the wheel of their own gas guzzlers senator mitch fifield said
445521 worthy of coming on her triggering fury among women who saw it as a deliberate double entendre
445522 no matter what women achieve some people apparently still see them as sex objects she said
445523 the public response to sam newmans latest outburst shows that most people appreciate how stupid and shallow his comments are
445524 he just wants to attract attention it cant be anything else and i dont think he is going to change she said
445525 it seems as if he is in pursuit of infamy and if thats the case perhaps he should be taken off air people find him offensive and inappropriate
445526 nine management should really pull sam newman in and tell him what is and what isnt appropriate in terms of his role on tv she said
445527 we are a free country and i guess people want sam on television she said its a rough and tumble show but sam went too far
445528 i think its important to be honest that youre pregnant said mrs giblin who lives on sydneys north shore with her husband
445529 im not ashamed of it but its made finding a job very difficult
445530 were young and we need a double income to have the baby pay off the mortgage and bills it all adds up
445531 i think some employers are insensitive i dont think they have any understanding of pregnant employees they need guidelines
445532 hiring someone who is pregnant brings additional complications for them
445533 they look for who can do the job now if the person is leaving on maternity leave in a couple of months and somebody else is there rather than starting all over again they might say this new person has some advantages
445534 a lot of employers regrettably still look at this as something which is detrimental to their business mr kerkyasharian said
445535 this mentality of employers is very damaging and belittling to women it makes women feel that theyve done something wrong by being pregnant

445603 say o muhammad but the things that my lord has indeed forbidden are al fawaahish great evil sins and every kind of unlawful sexual intercourse whether committed openly or secretly sins of all kinds unrighteous oppression joining partners in worship with allaah for which he has given no authority and saying things about allaah of which you have no knowledge
445604 it is sufficient for you to fast three days every month because for every good deed you will have the reward of ten like it so that will be like fasting for a lifetime
445605 if you fast any part of the month then fast the thirteenth fourteenth and fifteenth
445606 do as much of good deeds as you can for allaah does not get tired of giving reward until you get tired

445619 does he who created not know while he is the subtle the acquainted
445620 have you not considered that allah knows what is in the heavens and what is on the earth there is no private conversation of three but that he is the fourth of them nor are there five but that he is the sixth of them and no less than that and no more except that he is with them in knowledge wherever they are then he will inform them of what they did on the day of resurrection indeed allah is of all things knowing

445632 he who does an act which is not in agreement with our affair i e religion will have it rejected
445633 to proceed surely the best speech is the book of allaah and the best of all guidance is the guidance of muhammad and the worst of all affairs are newly invented things and every newly invented thing is an innovation and every innovation is astray
445634 there are two phrases that are light on the tongue but heavy on the scale

445636 do i sound excited i am when i was first introduced to the idea of neuroplasticity i thought it was interesting the more i learn about the subject the more i realize that we are on a frontier
445637 just to be clear if cognitive behavior therapy works to reduce drug cravings and years of research on addiction treatment has suggested that it can at least in some people then that should be enough but there is no denying the power of the neuro paparazzi when scientists can produce a dramatic picture demonstrating how some intervention alters patterns of brain activity that underlie a disease or problematic behavior it is more persuasive than if they merely reported that peoples behavior had changed

445646 my daddy was a bankrobber but he never hurt nobody he just loved to live that way and he loved to steal your money
445647 the impact of the current economic environment is more of a challenge than we anticipated just three months ago the real estate industry and the mortgage markets continue to deteriorate credit terms are tight fuel prices remain unstable and consumer confidence is at its lowest level since 1992
445648 as would be expected under such conditions retail purchases of housing as well as discretionary big ticket items such as rvs and boats are down significantly
445649 we continue to face highly volatile raw material costs particularly steel and aluminum
445650 while the impact of these higher costs began in the second quarter the cost of raw materials flowing through our cost of sales in the third quarter will be significantly higher than the second quarter in particular the cost of steel in our inventory at june 30 2008 depending upon the type of steel is 25 percent to 60 percent higher than the steel we used in the second quarter similarly the cost of aluminum in inventory at june 30 2008 is approximately 15 percent to 20 percent higher
445651 management is making every effort to offset these higher costs through improved product designs efficiency improvements and sales price increases however because of continued volatility in raw material costs as well as our on going efforts to work with our customers during this difficult industry environment we currently are not able to estimate the extent to which these adverse factors will impact our operating results in the second half of 2008
445652 though we were profitable in the quarter we are also cautiously monitoring conditions in our core markets as well as raw material costs and national economic trends
445653 all these conditions are shaping up for a very tough second half of the year however we have a very solid balance sheet and remain focused on our long standing strategy based on market share growth new product introductions acquisitions and operational efficiencies
445654 with the continuing economic downturn affecting consumer discretionary purchases we expect that the soft conditions in the rv market will not improve in the coming months
445655 while we often compare our results to industry production levels we also believe the real health of the rv industry is determined by retail demand retail sales have been weak in recent months with may 2008 retail sales of travel trailers and fifth wheel rvs down 24 percent following a 15 percent decline in april and a 27 percent decline in march
445656 despite these difficult conditions we see opportunities we have continued our expansion program including new products and acquisitions such as our july 1 2008 acquisition of seating technology we have also continued our cost cutting efforts nevertheless the dual challenges of rising raw material costs and lower industry production levels caused operating profit of our rv segment to decline 35 percent to 13 0 million this quarter or 11 7 percent of segment net sales
445657 this compares to segment operating profit of 19 9 million or 14 9 percent of segment net sales in the second quarter of 2007 with industry weakness expected to continue and the impact of higher raw material prices expected to be even greater our third quarter results are likely to be even more adversely affected
445658 the upholstered furniture and bedding manufactured by seating technology have an outstanding reputation in the rv industry
445659 this is an entirely new product line for lippert components and we expect that our extensive marketing and distribution capabilities will be an advantage in helping us to gain a greater share of the estimated 150 million market for these products
445660 it appears that concerns about the economy are hurting all facets of the residential housing market
445661 in early 2008 industry production of manufactured homes seemed to have stabilized with industry production up slightly year over year
445662 in recent months weve gained market share in this segment and were making every effort to continue this trend
445663 we are encouraged by the legislation which the president signed today to increase fha lending limits for chattel mortgages for manufactured homes from less than 49 000 to nearly 70 000
445664 this legislation also includes a tax credit for up to 7 500 for first time homebuyers which could be a big boost for manufactured housing however we remain cautious about the manufactured housing industry as we wait to see how consumer demand develops over the next few months
445665 though we face challenging times resulting from economic and industry conditions drew continues to be well positioned for the eventual economic recovery particularly because of our increasing market share within our core markets and because of our strong balance sheet
445666 we also continue to have extremely high confidence in our operating management whose track record of creating growth despite challenging markets has been exceptional in the past

445921 ive been locked up in illinois prisons since i was 16 i was tortured into confessing to a crime i didnt commit ive been here for over 25 years to look out and think this is where i will stay for the rest of my life now that is a living unbearable hell
445922 a death sentence by incarceration youre trading a slow form of death for a faster one
445923 western europeans regard 10 to 12 years as extremely long term even for offenders sentenced to life
445924 im the first to say that i made my share of mistakes in life im not perfect but life without the possibility of parole is a life draining sentence no matter how hard i try to better myself im treated as if i am the worst of the worst i cant sleep nights i cant rest in my body because this one bad choice to hang with friends could cost me my freedom forever
445925 we try to keep his spirits up by saying something will change in the law
445926 should suffer harsh criminal consequences for acting as a lookout in this case but to suggest that he ought to receive a sentence of life without the possibility of parole i find to be very very hard to swallow to the point where i can describe it as unconscionable
445927 he was convicted for the crimes of being poor and mexican
445928 hes just one of many there are so many people serving long sentences for nonviolent crimes hes a regular guy who was trying to make a living
445929 i have little hope at all this sentence is like a death sentence it is torture on my sanity theres no second chances for any of us no matter how good or bad i am these cruel prison conditions are all i have to look forward to
445930 studies have shown that offenders who have served over 20 years in prison rarely ever reoffend and never for a violent crime
445931 the recidivism rate for older inmates is less than 2 percent
445932 everyday that i wake up its a pain knowing that i have this sentence and if these devils get their way i will have to be here the rest of my days knowing this and being in this situation just the thought alone will kill you from the inside out a natural life sentence tells the public that you are a vile and insidious person and that you possess no rehabilitative potential to reenter society and be a productive citizen this is a bald faced lie and this lie can be brought to an end today

445970 i think that what people are really concerned about what theyre looking for is fundamental change on the economy things that are going to help their families live out the american dream there was nobody there who thought at all that i was trying to inject race in this what this has become i think is a typical pattern from the mccain campaign whether its paris hilton or britney or this phony allegation that i wouldnt visit troops they seem to be focused on a negative campaign what i think our campaign wants to do is focus on the issues that matter to american families

446004 shes one of the hardest working athletes ive ever worked with
446005 you want your sail to act like a spring to create the power to move your sail forward
446006 you can see the top of the sail really flexing thats really what you want and youre bringing the power from the middle all the way to the top
446007 when i look at pictures i actually realize that im really short and small and im just like god thats not fair i would love to be taller that would be nice im like 5 foot 2
446008 shes one of the hardest working athletes ive ever worked with
446009 she does everything you tell her shes got great character which is the best thing about her in my belief
446010 we do a lot of balance stuff a lot of strength stuff
446011 some basic olympic lifting but for her its a lot of upper body stuff especially going over to china theres not a lot of wind for her sport
446012 and so i did portugal when i was 15 poland when i was 16
446013 and then i started seeing all the young girls on the boards and i was like wow you know they are at such a higher level

446027 hes always picking his nose so he turned up on the programme with great big scabby cold sores under each nostril he kept dabbing at them with a filthy cloth yuck
446028 i met his wife afterwards poor little thing he calls her the booby i pity any woman stuck with that nauseating creature
446029 at first i thought f big brother theyre playing major mind games with me then i decided to make the best of it jackie and i hadnt spoken a word to each other for 17 years we made up on the show became friends and have stayed in touch ever since

446032 it is logical as with four australian teams we have enough diversity to supply the wallabies
446033 it would be great to get more bums on seats and create more interest and more revenue for the clubs you hear on the grapevine that guys like brian odriscoll want to play in the super 14
446034 someone like that playing in the competition would have to help to raise the profile of the game you cant underestimate the power and intrigue of high profile players coming into a competition
446035 maybe you can have one foreign player and the other player could be from a targeted developing nation you dont take the player but develop them on behalf of another country
446036 we have to make the jump between not having foreign players to having foreign players once we make that jump then we can start looking at the mechanics of it
446037 dan carter is a world class player and although its a massive loss to new zealand when hes away for six months its a feather in the cap of northern hemisphere rugby to have one of the worlds best players in european competition
446038 brian odriscoll has made it known that he wants to play in the southern hemispheres super 14 competition and i dont see any reason we he shouldnt be allowed to have his wish
446039 rugby is a global sport these days so i would welcome the opportunity for some of the munster players and other irish and european players to play in the southern hemisphere before coming home to continue their careers with their clubs
446040 you can survive anything for two weeks three months four days etc
446041 it will be our alaska gas flowing to provide aid to those in the lower 48 who are turning to alaska waiting and wanting alaska to help
446042 the duty of state government is to serve and protect people our first job is making sure we are serving the public and are available to the public the state director of personnel is currently reviewing telecommuting policies with that goal in mind and we would consider any proposals for a four day week in the same vein
446043 telecommuting for some state agencies might work well but supervising such an arrangement would take a special level of skills and development of standards to avoid abuse of such a system
446044 the pluses are that we save fuel costs with people staying either at home or in one location the supervisors will need to provide strong oversight to prevent abuse we must be careful which services we are doing this with and not lose the personal touch for our citizens
446045 as governor i will veto any income or sales tax fees are appropriate for special services but should be kept at a minimum necessary to provide the services
446046 i think we need to have a broad based fair based tax on all new hampshire residents that would be dedicated solely to paying public education costs in our school districts such a tax would likely be an income tax and could have a sunset provision of two or four years
446047 i do not support increasing any taxes or new taxes the people cannot afford it they are already being spent out of their homes i only support administrative fees as far as it goes to cover the costs of the existing program
446048 with the slowdown in the national economy we will continue to make the tough choices necessary to ensure we are balancing the budget providing services to our most vulnerable citizens and making smart choices for the future to create jobs improve education expand access to health care and improve our roads and infrastructure
446049 i oppose cutting back on human services dropout prevention tobacco hazard education and physical access building codes for private and public buildings would be programs i would like to see furthered with a little extra money
446050 my top three priorities in terms of agencies would be safety health and human services and transportation this is not the time for a new program nor is it the time to expand a program we should be concentrating on helping the taxpayer and hoping to maintain what we have

446053 a couple minutes later the englewood officers and the dayton officers were talking about the case when one of them looked up and saw a pink fuzzy slipper disappearing into the front seat of the englewood cruiser

446093 hes not from central casting when it comes to candidates for president of the united states hes new to washington yes hes african american
446094 i dont think he obama did himself any good with these comments what he did is inject back into this context the idea about voters comfort level
446095 what he said is not exactly rap talk black speak but that is something that obama has to be very careful about he just cant let people believe that they cant trust him
446096 for too long partisan gridlock and special interest influence has blocked progress on some of the most urgent challenges facing the american people and that is especially true when it comes to our energy crisis
446097 todays announcement includes many of the policies ive been fighting for during my time in the senate and over the course of this campaign
446098 like all compromises it also includes steps that i havent always supported
446099 but ive always believed that finding consensus will be essential to solving our energy crisis and todays package represents a good faith effort at a new bipartisan beginning in the coming days ill be laying out additional steps i believe we must take to bring down gas prices for good and truly free ourselves from our dependence on foreign oil
446100 what i was saying was we cant drill our way out of the problem
446101 what that means is if we want to have true oil independence true energy independence then were going to have to become more efficient obama said
446102 what i said was what ive seen so far from a so called gang of 10 energy bill which several senators are promoting has some of the very aggressive elements that he wants to see in an energy plan
446103 i remain skeptical of some of the drilling positions but i will give them credit that the way they crafted the drilling positions are about as careful as you might expect from a drilling agenda what i dont want is for the bad to be the enemy of the good

446130 we have to rely on the international markets so there is a big security concern there
446131 in order to really drive towards a low carbon economy policy incentives are crucial but it is not always the case
446132 the wind sectors fast growth was mainly a result of domestic policies because the government offered incentives to developments so that private and public sector entrepreneurs would jump on it
446133 but the solar pv sector benefitted mainly from the international market such as demand from the us and eu
446134 even today the policy incentives are still not there yet it still has grown to the level it is now
446135 in terms of total emissions china is already the worlds biggest emitter
446136 thats publicly available information even the government is not denying it anymore
446137 but if you look at emissions on a per capita basis we are not the biggest emitters because we have 1 3bn people
446138 but just looking at numbers does not help tackle global climate change
446139 in china we are concerned about the speed of growth in emissions it is really scary
446140 if they are not able to do it with the technology available to them then is it reasonable to expect china and india to do it
446141 china does not commit itself to a number and then not deliver
446142 brad lidge j c romero chad durbin ryan madson have made a number of appearances so youre a little concerned about fatigue we can certainly use somebody
446143 weve always viewed brett as a starter we had a situation last year where our bullpen was in shambles and brett was willing to become the closer but hes a starter hes a very important piece of this ball club he may have felt more confident in the bullpen but we believe hes a starter
446144 were kind of stubborn on this we think brett is a starter it might be that he prefers to close but we dont see a reason he cant start
446145 were trying to win our division so were going to try to put the best starters out there we can to win we have to keep our minds open with what were going to do were not locking ourselves in with anything we believe hell stay in the rotation but we have to keep our options open and we will
446146 clearly they were out of whack and were the reason that my situation existed
446147 in training camp the chiefs coaching staff leads by example they always wear protection when playing with their dingle
446148 kirkuk is an iraqi province and runs in the blood of all arabs
446149 no to annexation of kirkuk and yes to peaceful coexistence
446150 some of them came by car others came on foot to confirm their total rejection of the decision of the kurdish bloc in kirkuk to combine the province with kurdistan
446151 it is important to solve the kirkuk issue by compromises between arabs kurds and turkmen
446152 we reject any moves to annex it into another region
446153 the government rejects any unilateral step to change the status of the city of kirkuk and considers it illegal and unconstitutional
446154 our forces have arrested 265 suspects so far during our operations in diyala
446155 the operation is still on going successfully and is now in its fifth day

446161 every incident has to be seen within its proper framework you study an incident as an incident
446162 an incident is an incident and a crime is a crime
446163 it is as if there is a struggle each against the other and it creates a sectarian atmosphere
446164 this tense atmosphere makes people ready to explode at any point if they are subjected to any amount of instigation or incitement
446165 muslims cant say it but its clear they dont accept us here no one can speak the truth on this issue so everybodys feelings are kept inside
446166 when something happens it always comes back to muslim and christian
446167 if someone cant resolve it they go to the police station
446168 we feel pressure maybe not all the time but we do
446169 we have liberty of speech and religion but its as if somebody was telling us at the same time dont speak and dont practice your religion
446170 me i try to keep a certain distance from muslims
446171 we have simple relations i give you this you give me this thats it they dont want more than that either
446172 only content to send security forces after clashes catch fire
446173 the religious discourse has to change from both sides because it incites hatred even if it does so indirectly increasing fanaticism from both sides

446197 if i had to name any downsides it would have to be the price even if all the tablets last the full two hours it still works out at about 50p an hour
446198 another big setback is the actual taste of the tablets i have a pretty strong stomach so it didnt bother me but one of my friends who tried it physically gagged at the taste

446226 catching plagiarism is a concern we all share because otherwise degrees become useless
446227 what is wrong with these women ive been watching for 2 hours now and trying to read the updates here and am still having trouble figuring out what the big deal is can someone summarize this for me and the rest of the realityfanforum thanks

446236 i came back from kirkuk half an hour ago the situation is very tense there
446237 the kurds want to lay bricks for an independent state but escalating tensions will not bring any good to anyone
446238 why is the peshmerga kurdish militia in the center of kirkuk
446239 kirkuk is a city under the rule of the central government and must remain as it is
446240 everything in new york is big and the best here were trying to win and right away
446241 one of the things that im evaluating and assessing is what will a new york knick player look like and what values will he possess and how will he play
446242 winning to me is not a good effort you either win or lose
446243 i think there are different ways to motivate people ive always tried to inspire people instead of trying to manipulate them through fear because if youre going to have a long lasting effect it has to be through true inspiration of that individual wanting to succeed as opposed to im going to frighten you to succeed
446244 hes got great stuff his defense stuff is solid his offensive stuff is exceptional hes got a great basketball background im confident if we can put the right things around him from a coaching standpoint i as a manager can do the right things by him he can have success here
446245 it just made me realize how important that position was to us and how much we needed to go out and acquire a guy like that
446246 were in the state where i think it would be impossible for me to do both and do them well were trying to get healthy and we got to dig ourselves out of a big hole and i dont think i would do this organization justice by trying to do both jobs
446247 you definitely dont like to see anyone humiliated in such a public forum its a tough time for him as a man
446248 we came to the conclusion late this morning you never thought you would be able to get a hall of fame coach to be able to coach a team having the opportunity to have the winningest coach in basketball we pride ourselves on being the best and having the opportunity to select the best i just think hes a perfect fit and i think hes the perfect fit for stephon
446249 and i think ideally we would still like to get more athletic and go out and acquire the best talent and get the best players for him to play with i would like for us to become a much more athletic team a quicker team
446250 the only reason we made the trade was because we got both players when you add tim thomas and nazr mohammed to our team it makes us a much more athletic team i think weve become a better defensive team a better rebounding team
446251 i wanted to put together a team that was exciting for the fans to come and watch a team that had some character and some guts but also a team that you can grab a box of popcorn and grab a soda and enjoy the game
446252 you want players and you want a team that people want to see i think this is a team that when everyone is healthy and playing well it can be an exciting team that people will want to see and talk about
446253 lenny and i are on the same page we talk daily nightly hourly we work well together i love my team i love our coach i love our players but i want more
446254 this is a starting point for us we will learn from this experience youve got to be in the playoffs and have some humiliating moments to learn to win
446255 but i didnt think it was a good message to send to our fans to say you know we havent made the playoffs in two years
446256 after watching the yankees pour champagne last night in their locker room i got really fired up and inspired
446257 i look at our team and thats what we aspire to be and im pretty excited about this year and the possibilities and the chances that we have i like all the young guys that we have love the veterans that are coming back the coaches are enthused weve got a chance to have a really good year and im excited about it
446258 i have no interest in coaching i dont think ill ever coach the new york knicks
446259 as long as im the president of basketball operations here in new york i dont see myself coaching the new york knicks
446260 and i wish you would stop writing it or stop saying it because thats not going to happen while im here
446261 i think in other cities you may be able to pull off g m coach but i dont think in this city you can do it simply because the energy and the passion that it takes to do one job the way we have to travel the way we have to live the complexities of this city i know myself i wouldnt have the energy to be the president and also the coach
446262 i think hes in that discussion i know the thing that the coaches value the most is his work ethic the way he approaches the game every night and the way he does the dirty work inside the paint hes not flashy hes effective hes just a worker
446263 if youre not playing for the championship then youre not good enough and my job is to continue to try to make us good enough so we can compete and try to win the championship one day
446264 i thought he was awesome and i happen to agree with him
446265 when you look at his numbers across the board and what we do when hes out on the floor i think he is the best right now
446266 make no mistake the man in front of you has been through a lot of tough times
446267 our best days are in front of us and not in the present we have to be patient enough to get to that day
446268 we were able to upgrade our talent in getting malik rose and maurice taylor theres also the addition of the two picks we have two first round picks this year and two first round picks next year we will be able to improve our team with the youth well get in the draft or we may be able to package some players and do some other things this gives us creative ability in the draft
446269 malik is a high energy player and the fans are going to enjoy watching him play
446270 in terms of his salary a guy like malik who is making 5 or 6 million a year is worthy of that contract the two or three additional years that he has im very comfortable paying those numbers those are not 12 13 or 14 million numbers
446271 i really like what we have when youve lost 30 games by 6 points or less theres some hope so were not as far away as our record would indicate
446272 the way i feel right now id trade my mother if the right deal came along
446273 we like herb williams as a coach he did a fine job when he was here im sorry he did a fine job of coaching the team but we want to do the best and do the right thing for the new york knicks and well be diligent and patient with our approach
446274 i dont think ive ever said this to any of you publicly but last year was really the first time that ive ever been associated with a basketball team that was called soft at certain times every team that ive ever played on has always been a great defensive team whether its been my high school team college team or pro team or the team that i coached in indiana
446275 any guy that has center next to his name were interested in
446276 that is so far from the truth and im ashamed for you guys that you even have to ask me that because there is absolutely no truth to it at all
446277 larry has won every place that hes gone and make no mistake about it i think he will work extremely hard to turn this situation around for us
446278 i like what im seeing i like what weve done actually pretty excited about the way were playing before the knicks fell to 2 6 with a loss at the la lakers
446279 we were very competitive out on the road and i dont know if theres a fear of playing at home but weve had some embarrassing losses at home and it seems that our guys are much more competitive and play with a lot more confidence away from home
446280 im not saying this is a move to get to the playoffs or anything like that jalen is a person who fits exactly what we need a very versatile player he can handle the ball in the backcourt he can score from the small forward position and he can take some of the scoring load off some of our younger players who have been asked to score at difficult times during the game
446281 we feel pretty good about the direction were headed were not happy with the record however our future is bright
446282 i dont think that our record is indicative of the type of coach that he is or the type of players that we have
446283 ive been in pressure situations before all my life has basically been about pressure about having to get it done and just because you say it publicly does not make me afraid of it or shy away from it you got a job to do go get it done
446284 its challenging i dont think theres anybody else in the league or in sports probably working under this situation however thats how it is
446285 id rather bet on myself if my career is in the hands of somebody else trust is not something that i have a lot of these days
446286 no because i stand here before you today in all honesty and i say i would still rather have eddy curry than any player in this draft and every g m polled would take eddy curry in this draft and if we had the second pick i would have traded the second pick in the draft for eddy curry
446287 i spent a lot of time this summer talking to different people about chemistry because one of the things that was written and said and thats true about us is the chemistry wasnt right and what jared brings to us more so than talent he brings chemistry i think he balances your locker room he balances the plane ride relationshipwise in a group setting hes the chemical piece that makes everything kind of work in a strange kind of way
446288 i knew exactly what i was thinking i wasnt looking for jerome to be an offensive player im more than confident that the things that i want out of him in terms of defending and rebounding hes very capable of doing and he will do them if youre asking him to be a 20 point scorer and you want to judge him on his low post game then youre looking at the wrong guy but for a 5 million investment and we didnt have a center i know exactly what i was doing and you should keep that in mind its not 30 million a year its only five im just saying for centers in this league backup starting whoever we got a pretty good price there
446289 chances are when you look at our schedule we may start out in a hole and you cant get so buried in a hole that you lose hope and youve got to have enough intestinal fortitude to fight yourself out of the hole and persevere and overcome the obstacles
446290 hes a big man hes a nice man but there needs to come a time when its dont play with eddy we want him to really have a presence out on the floor
446291 this is an unmerciful league and well have a long memory and one day well be the team thats on top doing the kicking and the stepping and when we kick and we step if we ever get to the top its going to be a hard kick and a hard step just like people have stepped on us pretty hard well be pretty unforgiving when we get on top
446292 hey dont go to the basket right now it wouldnt be a good idea just letting you know
446293 our crowd had a huge impact on the game tonight
446294 being at home definitely has again become very comfortable to us we like to play here now its a good feeling when the garden puts its arms around you
446295 theyre a beautiful basketball team the way they move the way they pass the way they cut theyre good one day again the goal is to try to get to that kind of level of play
446296 this whole season every time it seems like we are at deaths door the team responds and gets a win
446297 who knows maybe this will turn out to be a very lucky season for us
446298 i think weve gotten to a point where were not looked at as one of those teams that youre supposed to beat i know weve gotten better as a basketball team and i know next month well be better than we are this month but weve gotten to the level where i think were starting to get some respect around the league that its not a gimme anymore
446299 you may look at the record but i dont think theres a team out there that walks in saying this is an easy night for us you cant say that wasnt the case all the time i dont think that will be again
446300 im kind of hoping we dont embarrass ourselves too much when the knicks announced an exhibition game with maccabi tel aviv
446301 its safe to say that the ball will be in one of their hands most every time down the court well throw the ball inside either it will be in eddys hands on one side or it will be in zachs hands on the other the thing thats intriguing about zach is he can step out he has a great midrange game
446302 i dont think any of us received a warm reaction tonight whatever reaction that happens to me or for me im a big boy ive handled and conducted myself well and ive been yelled at screamed at booed at and i know how to handle myself ill be fine thank you
446303 i think players are starting to pick up their intensity as we get closer to the season
446304 we need leadership from that position at the point guard and we also need defense and those are two things that hes definitely capable of doing and when he returns thats what i expect out of him
446305 ive played with people i dont like ive won with people i dont like
446306 thats on isiah tonight you never want to see this type of display of basketball anywhere and thats on my desk thats on me
446307 in new york youre either dead or alive you lose a game and youre dead and you win one and you basically get to survive
446308 hes self driven and hes self motivated so you dont have to get on him too often but you do have to remind him sometimes of how good he should be and dont let him accept where he is
446309 i thought every single player was thinking about himself as opposed to thinking about the team i dont know where this game came from
446310 every time you lose a game in new york were on death row here so tonight they unstrapped the belts and i get to walk and had we lost im sure theyd have wet me down
446311 we had a rough start but were starting to stabilize here
446312 i dont really think this is a time to threaten anyone i think its a time for me to get my team feeling good about themselves again and build their confidence up and get them back to trusting and loving each other and being a team
446313 i was just trying to make sure that we kept the team together and we stayed focused on what we were doing in trying to win a basketball game
446314 to me its win or die and i literally mean death i dont mean walk away i mean death thats how i approach it and we got a job to do here were going to get it done im confident we got the right players im confident we got the right people and well dig our way out of this
446315 theres certain things that he probably wont ever be good at doing
446316 we want to just make sure that he keeps doing the things that he knows how to do well
446317 there are a lot of things that can be said about me and teams that ive coached and the way i played
446318 but ive never been accused of not having heart or competing and tonight was very discouraging to me because we didnt collectively play with heart and compete like i know i do
446319 we dont have the grit to sustain a run a team makes a run at us and collectively we just cave we just give in
446320 i can give you a lot of things but i cant give you pride and heart
446321 im not happy about where we are and if we dont turn it around soon then yeah well have to make some changes
446322 i believe this agreement is good for india and good for the world and for non proliferation
446323 i am looking forward that the nsg will give a waiver to india to carry out nuclear commerce

446325 ik vind het eindresultaat prachtig als ik een winkel binnenga en ik zie mijn spel liggen geeft dat een geweldig gevoel alhoewel ik zie de schappen liever leeg dan is het namelijk uitverkocht
446326 dat is zo geweldig aan het genre horror er zijn zoveel verschillende manieren om iemand bang te maken zelf vind ik monsters helemaal niet eng dat is ook de reden dat ik ze niet heb gebruikt ik vind vooral onverklaarbare dingen en vreemde geluiden eng als je dat combineert met een eenzaam gevoel kun je de speler echt doodsbang maken
446327 nee alleen wat ik eng vind heb ik gebruikt vroeger waren er maar een paar films die mij bang maakte daar zaten van die mysterieuze dingen in dit miste ik in veel horrorgames toen ik net gamedeveloper was zat dit idee al in mijn hoofd maar had ik daar nog niet de middelen voor
446328 nee ik leefde juist in een gezellige buurt waar iedereen vriendelijk tegen elkaar was er was niks engs aan
446329 ik vond sommige spellen fantastisch maar vaak vond ik dat het beter kon ik had allemaal idee n om het spel beter te maken dat was een van mijn drijfveren om gamedeveloper te worden ik wilde graag zelf games maken omdat ik dacht dat ik het beter kon
446330 ik zie mezelf veel plezier maken met mijn gezin en geweldige games maken met mijn bedrijf
446331 ja rustig adem halen als je mijn spel speelt ik wil niet dat er doden vallen
446332 jika teori saya benar pasti pernah terdapat jenis jenis bentuk peralihan yang tak terhitung jumlahnya yang mengaitkan semua spesies dari kelompok yang sama sudah tentu bukti keberadaan mereka di masa lampau hanya dapat ditemukan pada peninggalan peninggalan fosil
446333 jika suatu spesies memang berasal dari spesies lain melalui perubahan sedikit demi sedikit mengapa kita tidak melihat sejumlah besar bentuk transisi di manapun mengapa alam tidak berada dalam keadaan kacau balau tetapi justru seperti kita lihat spesies spesies hidup dengan bentuk sebaik baiknya menurut teori ini harus ada bentuk bentuk peralihan dalam jumlah besar tetapi mengapa kita tidak menemukan mereka terkubur di kerak bumi dalam jumlah yang tidak terhitung dan pada daerah peralihan yang memiliki kondisi hidup peralihan mengapa sekarang tidak kita temukan jenis jenis peralihan dengan kekerabatan yang erat telah lama kesulitan ini sangat membingungkan saya

446365 i think there were some things going on with the team that were real not just imagined there was a dynamic that had been created that made it more difficult to go play at our best and for the players to perform there was doubt there was even exhaustion on the part of some players and a pretty major distraction that led us to want to address the situation one way or the other

446404 how many times have you heard the comment old mrs jones has walked with the lord for fifty years and knows more of god than any professor with a phd on one level the comment might well be true walking with the lord in faith will get you into heaven in a way that mere possession of a phd certainly will not nevertheless when we grasp that the gospel is first of all a message a proclamation of what god has done in jesus christ and that experience comes as a response to that message it is quite clear that a professor with a phd may well have certain insights into that gospel message which mrs jones for all her practical godliness does not much of the anti intellectualism which pours from pulpits in churches from reformed to charismatic is the result of precisely this confusion between gospel as message and the believers response in experience a confusion which has just enough appearance of truth to be superficially plausible while resting on a fundamentally skewed understanding of what the gospel actually is only when the church comes to acknowledge in both belief and practice that the gospel is a message not a feeling or experience will such fuzzy thinking and much else finally be put to rest

446449 today is the 2008 version of the boston tea party
446450 global it world you can simply take you time and visit web sites to find that
446451 since its one third of the formula to decide who plays in the national championship game
446452 it looks as though the population believes climate change is serious and there seems to be momentum behind the issue and there are some people who dont like that
446453 there are still plenty of creationists around and there are people who believe tobacco is not linked to serious health effects and so there are still people who choose to ignore or doubt the amount of evidence for climate change
446454 we would kill literally kill for a good paper that proved the science on global warming was wrong
446455 then i could retire and accept my chair at harvard unfortunately thats not going to happen and theres vast amounts of evidence why
446456 in essence the models we use to predict climate have been proven right
446457 you feed in the greenhouse gas concentrations that weve seen and the models predict extremely well the climate variations weve seen if you dont do that you get nothing the mathematical probability of it being a chance mistake or the wrong numbers is astronomical
446458 if theres been any change at all recently its that the observational evidence suggests were moving away from the lower limits of the abc projections towards more serious scenarios ive certainly seen no evidence of scientists holding back on their views or suppressing findings or anything approaching that
446459 i think there is healthy scepticism and then theres unhealthy scepticism
446460 what you do see is people who will claim that simply because they have a phd in engineering that they are an expert on climate modelling
446461 the other side of the coin is the danger that people who want to discuss the legitimate scientific issues in public becoming less if they are going to be called dangers we do need to keep giving scientists the freedom to go back and forth on these issues and apply their scepticism
446462 the fact is that a lot of the people working at the coalface of climate change research spend more time concerned they are underestimating some of the issues rather than exaggerating them
446463 i can tell you mr madenspacher that ive thought about nothing else but this case for over three weeks and in my experience sir and i invite you to disabuse me of this at oral argument i want you and i want the schnader firm to look for any case in any jurisdiction in the english speaking world where there has been as much prosecutorial misconduct because i havent found it
446464 statements of fact or mixed statements of opinion and fact
446465 tending to blacken the memory of one who is dead
446466 with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not
446467 i would imagine that for a lot of people it definitely caused pause for concern hochuli said
446468 all officials in any sport i know were upset by that the integrity issue were all about integrity its the most important thing we have to maintain because people have to trust that youre calling a fair game sort of clouded us all

446474 consumers deserve to know that the commitment is backed up by legal enforcement

446476 switzerland is an open source command line software tool designed to detect the modification or injection of packets of data by isps switzerland detects changes made by software tools believed to be in use by isps such as sandvine and audiblemagic advertising systems like faireagle and various censorship systems although currently intended for use by technically sophisticated internet users development plans aim to make the tool increasingly easy to use
446477 the sad truth is that the fcc is ill equipped to detect isps interfering with your internet connection
446478 its up to concerned internet users to investigate possible network neutrality violations and effs switzerland software is designed to help with that effort comcast isnt the first and certainly wont be the last isp to meddle surreptitiously with its subscribers internet communications for its own benefit
446479 it hurts to fall in love with somone who only sees you as a friend
446480 i can do that and have done it its not a good yoga studio i want a good one
446481 lohses advisers apparently still think getting people out is the way to go
446482 the bottom line is nobody will be left behind on this one it is a global straight line system so that everybody helps everybody no matter who sponsored them in every time 5 people come in anywhere in the world to the one structure the person at the top cycles and then re enters at the bottom
446483 we basically all take our turn getting paid but are also automatically re entered into the next highest level each time too it doubles every cycle starting at 50 then 100 then 200 400 800 1600 3200 6400 etc
446484 timing is of the essence don t get me wrong this program will be amazing no matter when you join simply because every 3 months everyone re enters to keep it all moving imagine there are 10 000 positions in the line and then in 90 days everyone automatically re enters so that 10 000 more spots come in to propel those again just to give everyone an extra boost happens automatically i d like to see you get in before the masses and take advantage of that 1st wave
446485 take it because ive learnt that you should always buy something you like immediately or else it will be gone
446486 scott what are you doing with your ass in the freezer
446487 i really should have mentioned this earlier but im actually a hooker and i charge 20 for sex
446488 youd better be careful when you go to countries in africa south asia middle east the men from these countries like women who are big especially those with big boobs and bums
446489 i was first attracted to you when i saw your bum and the way it jiggled as you walked
446490 i have said in the past and ill repeat again that the best reparations we can provide are good schools in the inner city and jobs for people who are unemployed
446491 lets not be naive sen obama is running for president of the united states and so he is in a constant battle to save his political life
446492 in light of the demographics of this country i dont think its realistic to expect him to do anything other than what hes done
446493 what steps should we take as a nation to alleviate the effects of racial exclusion and racial discrimination
446494 i fear that reparations would be an excuse for some to say weve paid our debt and to avoid the much harder work
446495 if we have a program for example of universal health care that will disproportionately affect people of color because theyre disproportionately uninsured
446496 if weve got an agenda that says every child in america should get should be able to go to college regardless of income that will disproportionately affect people of color because its oftentimes our children who cant afford to go to college
446497 people say he cant run and get elected if he says those kinds of things
446498 im like well does that mean were really not ready for a black president
446499 the lawyers dont care about you your kids or anything that is fair the lawyers goal is to find out how much you have and how they can take it
446500 no really i drive back home i even have my own car
446501 okay ill prove it to you that i and other women can drive stop the van and ill show you
446502 200 000 people are thought to have died in the region and more than 2m have fled their homes
446503 i have a friend who got into some trouble he was a debt collecter for a bookie and had major assault charges against him and disappeared about six and a half years ago he calls and tells me hell be back home after the new year is seven years the statute of limitations on an assault charge
446504 adhere d to our conclusions and amend the opinion to further clarify our reasoning
446505 it replicates the form but not the function of clothing on a person
446506 the question is not whether the design is useful but whether the fabric on which the design is printed is useful
446507 plainly there is only one question before us does the copyright act nullify an agreement by an author made during the original copyright term to assign his renewal the explicit words of the statute give the author an unqualified right to renew the copyright no limitations are placed upon the assignability of his interest in the renewal if we look only to what the act says there can be no doubt as to the answer but each of the parties finds support for its conclusion in the historical background of copyright legislation and to that we must turn to discover whether congress meant more than it said
446508 if an author cannot make an effective assignment of his renewal it may be worthless to him when he is most in need nobody would pay an author for something he cannot sell we cannot draw a principle of law from the familiar stories of garret poverty of some men of literary genius even if we could do so we cannot say that such men would regard with favor a rule of law preventing them from realizing on their assets when they are most in need of funds nor can we be unmindful of the fact that authors have themselves devised means of safeguarding their interests we do not have such assured knowledge about authorship and particularly about song writing or the psychology of gifted writers and composers as to justify us as judges in importing into congressional legislation a denial to authors of the freedom to dispose of their property possessed by others while authors may have habits making for intermittent want they may have no less a spirit of independence which would resent treatment of them as wards under guardianship of the law
446509 do distributors end up unfairly with the lions share of the money from exploitation of the work
446510 five votes are not that important to me when i feel that proper legal principles are involved
446511 i t was typical of blackmun to hold fast to territory he had staked out and to become deeply invested in its defense
446512 because the point that most strongly supports a reversal was not adequately developed during the argument and because i expect to emphasize it in dissent it occurs to me that it may be helpful to you in the preparation of your opinion and conceivably might persuade one of you adherents to reconsider the matter before positions become absolutely firm for me to put the basic outline of my argument on paper
446513 was new to me and i must say that it makes the question more difficult for me
446514 make clear that the plaintiffs burden of production is a substantial one and that unsubstantiated speculation is not enough

446537 the conditions you were working in on tuesday were not good
446538 i am not going to make an apology for something that the ioc is not responsible for we are not running the internet in china
446539 im disappointed that given the opportunity for a multi challenger competition as a result of the appellate court decision bmw oracle has chosen to further delay the 33rd americas cup
446540 we believe the challenger of record has to be a real yacht club it cannot be something that is manufactured with a defender to set up a one sided event
446541 it has some of the very aggressive elements that ive outlined in my plan to move us in the direction of genuine energy independence
446542 i remain skeptical of some of the drilling provisions but i will give them the bills drafters credit that the way they crafted the drilling provisions are about as careful and responsible as you might expect for a drilling agenda
446543 what i will not do and this has been my position is to support a plan that suggests drilling is the answer to our energy problems
446544 if we have a plan on the table that i think meets the goals that america has to set and there are some things in there that i dont like obviously thats something that you know i would consider it because thats the nature of how we govern in a democracy
446545 we need oil drilling and we need it now we need it offshore
446546 we ought to start drilling for more oil at home including offshore senator obama opposes that
446547 that i think is the kind of bold step that we need the fact that they are willing to put in seven billion dollars to help the auto industry retool so that those new energy efficient cars are made in america
446548 there are a whole bunch of goods in this that have been proposed by the bipartisan group i remain skeptical of
446549 obviously this is very preliminary and these are early details but i wanted to send a strong signal that we cant allow partisan bickering or the desire to score political points to get in the way of providing genuine relief to people who are struggling
446550 turns out we might have had a produce tracking system in place years ago but the corporate food interests succeeded with some help from the bush white house in getting the idea shelved

446684 its huge its worth a fortune you never would have known that rufuglio had a peseta to his name from looking at him but the old man could have funded a bank
446685 you remind me of the abogado and notorio publico baldenegro
446686 you know baldenegro sostenes baldenegro hes still alive i studied under him when i was young and he was ancient even then
446687 i look down at my feet not wanting to meet his eyes at that moment
446688 your father must have been a good judge of men
446689 would you care for a repast a glass of wine some fruit cheese you are going to spend the night
446690 ill not stay in the country a minute longer than i have to despicable place totally uncivilized if it hadnt been for rufuglio dying
446691 the lord is well pleased for his righteousness sake he will magnify the law and make it honourable
446692 for verily i say unto you till heaven and earth pass one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law till all be fulfilled
446693 whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments and shall teach men so he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven but whosoever shall do and teach them the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven
446694 on these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets
446695 and he shall speak great words against the most high and shall wear out the saints of the most high and think to change times and laws and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time
446696 they the catholics allege the sabbath changed into sunday the lords day contrary to the decalogue as it appears neither is there any example more boasted of than the changing of the sabbath day great say they is the power and authority of the church since it dispensed with one of the ten commandments
446697 it the roman church has reversed the fourth commandment doing away with the sabbath of gods word and instituting sunday as a holy day
446698 the earliest recognition of the observance of sunday as a legal duty is a constitution of constantine in 321 a d enacting that all courts of justice inhabitants of towns and workshops were to be at rest on sunday venerable day of the sun with an exception in favor of those engaged in agricultural labor
446699 constantine the great made a law for the whole empire 321 a d that sunday should be kept as a day of rest in all cities and towns but he allowed the country people to follow their work
446700 let all the judges and town people and the occupation of all trades rest on the venerable day of the sun but let those who are situated in the country freely and at full liberty attend to the business of agriculture because it often happens that no other day is so fit for sowing corn and planting vines lest the critical moment being let slip men should lose the commodities granted by heaven
446701 the seventh day sabbath was solemnized by christ the apostles and primitive christians till the laodicean council did in a manner quite abolish the observation of it the council of laodicea 364 a d first settled the observation of the lords day
446702 because christians ought not to judaize and to rest in the sabbath but to work in that day wherefore if they shall be found to judaize let them be accursed from christ
446703 question how prove you that the church hath power to command feasts and holy days
446704 answer by the very act of changing the sabbath into sunday which protestants allow of and therefore they fondly contradict themselves by keeping sunday strictly and breaking most other feasts commanded by the same church
446705 question have you any other way of proving that the church has power to institute festivals of precept
446706 answer had she not such power she could not have substituted the observance of sunday the first day of the week for the observance of saturday the seventh day a change for which there is no scriptural authority
446707 know ye not that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey his servants ye are to whom ye obey whether of sin unto death or of obedience unto righteousness
446708 then said elijah unto the people i even i only remain a prophet of the lord but baals prophets are four hundred and fifty men
446709 baal or bel the principal god of the phoenicians chaldeans and carthaginians is regarded as a personification of the sun the worship of baal prevailed among the jews in the time of the prophet elijah and earlier
446710 and elijah came unto all the people and said how long halt ye between two opinions
446711 god provides the wind but its up to us to raise the sail
446712 we do not see things as they are we see them as we are

446719 lifting the ban would create new opportunities for american workers and businessmen
446720 but the leaders of the democratic congress have refused to allow a vote

446731 its only wednesday why do you need to know now what i want to do

446734 no i distincly told you i was coming to visit and that i would go swimming with carla and evan later
446735 i never thought id get to say id seen the backstreet boys just because they faded away for a bit
446736 my favourite part of the band is the memories attached to them
446737 howie just actually reminded us that we were here years and years ago
446738 i got my earring ripped out by kevin by accident while he and i were wrestling
446739 my record is a lot more personal and a lot more real so to speak
446740 my stuff is a little more relatable as far as things ive been through heartache the rela tionship i dont have with my dad
446741 as i started making the record i found i had a lot more to say than i thought i did and i had more to get off my chest
446742 the only thing i didnt harp on was my sobriety and the drugs i didnt want to go there yet
446743 c chi nasconde i fatti perch non li conosce ignorante impreparato sciatto e non ha voglia di studiare di informarsi di aggiornarsi
446744 the people in italy especially the young people are tired to think
446745 weve reached a point in our civilization where counterculture has mutated into a self obsessed aesthetic vacuum
446746 i spoke freely without the restraints of daily journalists that obliged me to be distant and objective
446747 from australia to south africa the e mail was published in local newspapers and strangers wrote to me asking is it really that bad in iraq we had no idea
446748 i have written this book in the same spirit as i wrote that e mail
446749 five years have passed since the united states led a military invasion into iraq and george bush declared a mission accomplished but americas proposed goals remain elusive iraqs fragile stability hinges on deals brokered with sunnis and shiites iraqis caught in the midst of open ended war struggle to survive
446750 i keep asking myself what justifies the enormous costs of this war and the wounds it has inflicted i am at a loss for an answer this is the story of war
446751 basically we will be restoring the death penalty to anyone who scribbles on a wall
446752 after that period of reflection it may be possible to renew discussions
446753 siptu will be pressing ahead with claims to protect workers living standards across all the sectors of economy in which the union organises
446754 we will also continue to campaign for measures to protect employment standards and prevent the ratcheting down of pay and the quality of their employment
446755 we will be seeking a substantial flat rate pay increase for our members with immediate effect along with other non pay issues
446756 i hope that the culture of industrial peace that has developed in ireland and which has benefited workers and employers does not come under threat
446757 pay must not chase inflation government trade unions and business must put in place arrangements that will help us to regain competitiveness and protect the maximum number of jobs
446758 arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time
446759 there were lots of good natured drivers we thought we would get a bit of grief but everyone has been really supportive
446760 it is about direct action outside the camp we will break the law or do whatever needs to take place to stop e on peacefully from profiting from climate change
446761 we are planning to shut the coal fired power station down and we are planning to come back when they create a new coal fired power station
446762 having a player like artest takes our team to the next level
446763 officer es war notwehr was h tte ich denn machen sollen

446768 as soon as it launches you are going to be kissing googles ass and you are going to be launching on their platform
446769 we knew that the qualifying session would be very close and that proved to be the case
446770 the session was very competitive and more difficult than i thought it would be in the end i managed to reach q3 and i am happy about that it means we can approach the race sensibly tomorrow and i hope we can make the most of this grid position to score some points
446771 ich m chte nicht strikt sagen dass wir gar nichts tun k nnen
446772 pre season is about blowing off the cobwebs and giving trials to some prospective new players so we have arranged our pre season campaign a bit differently this year playing sides that are higher up the pyramid means we can really test the players on trial at the club
446773 teams such as altrincham and kettering are bound to have better quality players than we will face in the unibond premier next season but with players on holiday and injuries to jerome wright and rob nugent we have also been a little disjointed
446774 although we have lost three games so far i remain confident about our prospects this season
446775 weve been doing a lot of work on fitness in our pre season training and the lack of ball work at this early stage can sometimes be evident however we feel that the hard work done so far this summer will prove worthwhile as the season progresses
446776 elizabeth cumming 38 of alvinston pleaded guilty to the fraud that occurred between march 1 1996 and march 31 2002 along with her partner they got 70 000 to which they were not entitled by not reporting all their income
446777 cumming was given a suspended sentence and placed on probation for one year with the condition she pay the government 60 every month a restitution order was made separately from the probation order the restitution amount was set at 15 000
446778 the man had pleaded guilty in november to the same offence and was placed on probation for two years he was required to repay 40 000
446779 a viler evil than to murder a man is to sell him suicide as an act of virtue a viler evil than to throw a man into a sacrificial furnace is to demand that he leap in of his own will and that he build the furnace besides
446780 wed jan 17 2007 a documentary on the history of ipperwash provincial park is in the making

446803 cdcs first estimates from this system reveal that the hiv epidemic is and has been worse than previously known results indicate that approximately 56 300 new hiv infections occurred in the united states in 2006
446804 this figure is roughly 40 percent higher than cdcs former estimate of 40 000 infections per year which was based on limited data and less precise methods

446816 option is disabled from system properties performance settings 4 dreamscene stops running when we maximize the active window 5 when u change something from performance settings in system properties the aero theme is automatically changed to vista basic theme taskbar and start menu properties
446817 tab now look carefully at the image and ull find that the sidebar icon is still from vista beta releases and they forgot to update the image in rtm
446818 which shows the opened windows previews when we move the cursor in taskbar yeah it works perfectly but i found that if we minimize maximize a window by clicking on the taskbar and keep the cursor on it then it doesnt show the thumbnail preview it just shows the simple tool tip
446819 applet in control panel 14 its related to the hidden files if a file folder is hidden under another folder drive and we press folder options

446821 but dont worry bill youre still dominating that important demographic 65 to dead
446822 crows about the ratings and then gets them wrong again
446823 and bill o the clown gets caught with his ratings down
446824 bill o crows about the ratings and then gets them wrong again in worst persons
446825 ive got your reality check right here goober in july countdown was the number three rated show in all of cable news adults 25 to 54 behind bill o and hannity we were the number two rated show in all of cable news adults 18 to 49 and we were the number one rated show in all of cable news adults 18 to 34 and bill o was third since i was off for two weeks in july i want to thank rachel maddow for kicking the asses of laura ingraham john kasich and e d hill but dont worry bill youre still dominating that important demographic 65 to dead
446826 finally finally the ratings for july are in the tv ratings causing a true reality check for cnn and msnbc fox news ranked number six in prime time thats among all cable channels cnn 22 msnbc 30 right behind the tomato channel since i was off for a few days in july i want to thank laura ingram john kasich and e d hill for keeping the numbers up
446827 as human rights defenders we are very thankful for the attention given by the united nations that resulted to the urgent action of the government
446828 we are also pleased with our friends from other international human rights groups who have reported my case to the two un special rapporteurs we are somehow hopeful that something good will happen out of these efforts
446829 i am not amenable to having a police escort as i need to protect the interest and safety of our clients
446830 it would be inappropriate and unethical to work with such condition especially that our clients have given to us their trust and considering the confidentiality of the information they give us
446831 we have been very vocal in criticizing the arroyo government and its implementation of oplan bantay laya 1 and 2 this poses dangers to our lives
446832 it was a legitimate encounter with the npa new peoples army
446833 the on going atrocities gross violations of indigenous peoples and collective rights being perpetrated by the 21st and 77th ibpa against innocent civilians in kalinga
446834 all these victims were falsely accused as combatants and members or supporters of the npa
446835 malaca ang the national security council nsc and the department of justice doj masterminded this highly irregular mafia style and grossly diabolical transfer of echanis they have been planning something evil against our colleague
446836 let me remind the national security gang in the presidential palace headed by mrs gloria macapagal arroyo her security adviser norberto gonzales and the twin evil brother of norberto justice secretary raul gonzalez that echanis is a political prisoner a decent and principled man wrongly accused by this criminal regime of mrs arroyo he is not a common criminal accused of petty street crimes
446837 everything was done in a highly questionable manner did the pnp file any motion or request for echaniss transfer did judge medina approve the pnp request for echaniss transfer how come the lawyers and relatives of echanis were not informed about his transfer and of this latest legal twisting escapade of the arroyo government why is everything kept like the best kept secret of the national security council
446838 echanis should stay with the pnp custodial center in camp crame while his case is being tried thats why we repeat the transfer is highly irregular and absurd and it only revealed the national conspiracy and sinister agenda of arroyo and her militarist advisers which is to further persecute and make life more miserable for echanis
446839 we fear for ka randys security considering his status as a political prisoner were also afraid that he will be subjected to tremendous suffering given the prison conditions and his health
446840 this politically motivated case has been on hold since april 2007 the arroyo government and its state security forces should have desisted from arresting those included in the questionable charge sheet
446841 special project of the palace created inter agency legal action group ialag
446842 gonzales and then afp chief hermogenes esperons grave digging stunt in inopacan leyte is a special project of ms arroyos ialag in a desperate bid to immobilize those who strongly oppose her anti people political and economic policies
446843 the continuing injustice committed by the arroyo government against echanis should not be tolerated
446844 he became active once more with selda and helped in processing claimants in a class suit against the marcos dictatorship he was also instrumental in establishing the human rights group karapatan alliance for the advancement of peoples rights
446845 my husband is a dignified patriotic and pro masses person he has been a perpetual victim of state terrorism and government and military persecution
446846 the relatives of the victims cannot be happy with that because what is needed is that the killings and disappearances stop altogether
446847 the reduction in the numbers does not matter so long as we dont see our relatives given justice
446848 in some parts of the country the armed forces have followed a deliberate strategy of systematically hunting down the leaders of leftist organizations
446849 one one hand there is success in our campaign to stop the killings and disappearances since there is a drop in their rates but still we are not happy because we havent seen our loved ones and there is still no justice
446850 these decisions unfortunately disregard the actual state of human rights in the philippines today that has prompted the promulgation of the new remedy in the first place this spate of decisions will only encourage the re escalation of extrajudicial killings and enforced disappearances because of the continuing impunity which has unfortunately and unwittingly been judicially engendered further
446851 the perpetrators of extrajudicial killings and enforced disappearances will surely be emboldened to commit more of the same
446852 the rates may have decreased but because of what has been happening in the court of appeals we can be almost sure that the killings and disappearances will again escalate
446853 yes in a way it encourages more human rights violations especially extrajudicial killings and enforced disappearances because it shows the impunity of the perpetrators because the court of appeals shows that the perpetrators need not answer for their crimes
446854 that distractions consume as much as 28 of the average u s workers day including recovery time and sap productivity to the tune of 650 billion a year
446855 the expectation of recognition is much less so the prima donna syndrome is much lower
446856 sempre que isso acontecer ele disse que vai mandar um ministro em cadeia nacional para divulgar os programas

446859 em s o paulo a ministra dilma roussef casa civil foi apresentada mais explicitamente como a sucessora aqui no rio ele disse que o nome sucess o era segredo de estado
446860 a tal ponto que a imprensa quando faz previs o de novo apag o joga sempre para o ano que vem
446861 ele ouviu todas as avalia es com humildade e prometeu entregar o posto em 2010 com o pa s numa situa o social melhor do que a atual
446862 has not empowered citizens to check or mitigate our pervasive problems of mass poverty unemployment corruption social inequality injustice rebellion and the environment
446863 outmoded form of government and dysfunctional political parties sustain our politics of personality patronage cronyism and corruption and without transparency and public accountability
446864 it will allow people to take greater control over their own lives and satisfy their preferences what they really want
446865 sad to say we have been informed that until now musa could not talk so we could not get relevant information from her including what happened she is in a state of paralysis
446866 we suspect that if migrante did not bring the case to the attention of the owwa overseas workers welfare administration in dubai they would not be working hard for musas immediate repatriation she should be given proper medical treatment in the philippines
446867 this predatory practice of charging remittances is practically feeding off our blood sweat and tears enough is enough
446868 the 200 monthly remittances have radically shrunk and continue to shrink with the spiraling prices of almost all basic goods and services and the arroyo government refuses to scrap remittance charges and fees
446869 we dont even see and feel where the remittance charges go theyre only being kept in somebody elses pockets stop exploiting and exporting filipino workers overseas
446870 we pay the philippine governments paycheck yet we have no protection in return
446871 when will the government stop sucking the blood of migrant workers you claim that they are the modern day heroes because of the money they remit that keep the economy of the country going yet you still have the audacity to tax them for the money that keeps the government alive enough is enough scrap the remittance charges now
446872 pity our family members who work abroad and yet they are being taxed by gloria enough is enough let us remove her from malaca ang
446873 their hard earned money is being forcibly taken from them they are being made as milking cows to all migrant workers and their families let us oust gloria
446874 i hope as many wowfanboys stay with wow as possible i dont want any of there sic kind in our new game
446875 once and for all the american public needs to hear from the djs in a unified voice
446876 there are questions that the american public has for for the dj and one of the concerns of the american public for djs in every medium is the lack of responsibility that djs show to younger ears the djs i know care about the public they play for many of them are responsible parents themselves it is not that djs are irresponsible it is that djs do not speak in one unified voice on anything
446877 you were so little that you couldnt suck your mommas milk
446878 the procedure took place without any complication and ribery has already begun his physiotheraphy
446879 im extremely disappointed that having returned to training i now have to undergo further surgery
446880 however im confident that i can recover from this setback sooner rather than later
446881 the concern that ceos have is if we wait for a sputnik like event its very hard to turn around and get moving on the kind of timeline we would need
446882 it still takes a minimum of 17 years to produce an engineer if you consider k 12 plus four years of colleges
446883 this is on the top three ceo agendas of every company i know
446884 i feel like i can step up to the table and say im doing my part other companies are doing the same thing
446885 what im suggesting is i really could use more raw material thats about having federal leadership
446886 it still takes a minimum of 17 years to produce an engineer if you consider k 12 plus four years of colleges
446887 this is on the top three ceo agendas of every company i know
446888 i feel like i can step up to the table and say im doing my part other companies are doing the same thing
446889 what im suggesting is i really could use more raw material thats about having federal leadership
446890 asking the public to be patient here is simply not an answer
446891 i think the public should frankly demand more timely testing results and more timely graduation data
446892 because after all theyre being asked to invest an enormous amount of money in the system
446893 we will continue to work with the state to generate reports as data is made available
446894 its very tough to run a data system of this size smoothly the first time
446895 theres just an enormous amount of new information thats moving through here at all areas
446896 the new volume has created challenges from people having to fill out different forms to different verifications and all of the multiple steps involved
446897 we have already seen with aris here in the city how expensive and flashy computer systems are turning out to be clunky and flawed
446898 the longer we have to wait for these data systems to produce results the more skeptical people become
446899 while it did not come out of the box perfect
446900 we got an awful lot of information to a large number of people
446901 without the volunteers in the part time forces our troops would struggle to be an effective fighting force
446902 their bravery and sacrifice truly is making a difference in many theatres and i am convinced the same will be said about 202 in iraq
446903 the freedom of entry is an opportunity to tell all our sons and daughters from ipswich who are serving that whatever the political arguments whatever our own personal thoughts on different campaign you have our unwavering support and we salute your willingness to serve your bravery and all your sacrifices
446904 porque la actualidad le pone a uno de un humor de perros

446906 the park is a lovely place the fact we had so many toads crossing during the migration season is a good indication of its biodiversity what were making sure is it doesnt degrade
446907 es totalmente normal que cuando salgas de esa tienda las alarmas suenen y la culpa no ser a tuya sino que a los dependientes les va la marcha
446908 changes in precipitation patterns due to climate change coupled with increasing demand for water from both urban areas and agriculture could lead to problems in water allocation and quality
446909 more study of this complicated issue is needed if we are to make meaningful educated choices that may help us shape a better future for kansas food production
446910 no one has really looked at the other side of the equation about what it would cost us if we didnt do anything about it

446983 these findings give a great deal of hope for individuals with schizophrenia and their families and loved ones and caregivers that were moving towards an understanding of the causes of the disease
446984 weve only explained a tiny fraction of why people might develop schizophrenia and much more work needs to be done to connect specific changes to the full spectrum of other types of genetic factors that might influence schizophrenia as well as ways they might interact with the environment
446985 weve been working on schizophrenia for rather more years than we care to think and successes have not been dramatic
446986 there has been precious little on diseases of the brain and what seems to be emerging is that a lot of risk of brain diseases including schizophrenia and autism seems to be conferred by rare gene variants like rare deletions
446987 we looked at a relatively rare type of dna change where people have a substantial portion of a chromosome either missing or extra these are called copy number changes
446988 that triples the number of specific dna areas that may be responsible for schizophrenia
446989 all of these together were found in about 1 percent of patients

447037 no compromise is reached to resolve so far regarding article 24 of the law on elections provincial and district councils and respects

447039 a meeting between the president is now the territory of kurdistan massoud barzani and other parties on the issue but i have not been officially informed interested
447040 the committee continues to exist has accomplished things that belong quota of women and minorities and the use of religious symbols stayed with the subject of article 24 which the committee can not composed of 17 vice that they allowed it as a political issue and needs more time
447041 the elaboration of the ideas and perceptions on article 24 of the law on elections provincial assemblies
447042 the countrys leaders to find consensus solutions to the issue
447043 in the absence of a compromise to resolve the article it lead to give more time for a compromise between the parties to resolve the issue politically with internal and external dimensions

447047 members of the governorate of kirkuk kurdish bloc want their decision to put pressure on parliament which leaves open how council can maintain pressure on the parliament is the legitimate representative of the iraqi people
447048 the risks of the situation in kirkuk began after the demographic change that occurred in 2003 after the city
447049 all administrative and security institutions and professional however the two kurdish parties now
447050 all politicians and members of parliament and provincial assemblies to respect the authority and preserving the rights of oppressed people who have suffered so much and still suffers
447051 maintain security in the city of kirkuk and if it can not therefore appeal to the united nations and strongly call upon the international and regional countries to protect arabs and turkmen alcaldoachuren in the city
447052 all parties should stand by the honorable and one stance to prevail peace justice and brotherhood in the city of kirkuk to be for all iraqis arabs and turkmen as a caldoachorien and be divided administrative power functional and security in the city equally among all parties
447053 the law will be discussed provincial council elections to the satisfaction of all parties on the basis that there is no majority or loser and everyone is satisfied and compatible to allow the implementation of what has been agreed on the reality of the earth
447054 the council requested the kirkuk governorate to join the kurdistan region is legal and constitutional challenge is thus to rely upon the legal road
447055 the third paragraph of article ii formation regions in the law stipulates that any province the right to demand integration with the territory and the resolution issued by at least one third of the province and submit to the legislature of the territory if approved by two thirds of its members at that the power referendum in the territory and preserve the populations opinion
447056 this step came in response to the article 24 which plunged in the election law provincial assemblies have not entered the subject where this article include moving troops and the distribution of posts and these matters be the subject of possible compromise is either this law is not entered for the elections these things
447057 we want to be dealing with the kirkuk governorate as any other because the security situation which is worse than the rest of the governorates and in case the insistence of some parties to postpone the elections we do not object but provided that the postponement for a limited period and that the council will continue to maintain the jewelry duties under the law extended his term until elections in which it can not remain without kirkuk governorate council
447058 if not this article in the law there would not be any problem in this matter and rule it has a lot of non constitutionality of a mask to make a citizens right to freedom of opinion whoever wants if kirkuk was divided into three areas then have to vote for the kurdish kurds and the arabs for arabs the turkmen of the turkmen is a non democratic
447059 we will not allow any formula unconstitutional and article 24 unconstitutional and the way voting is unconstitutional because the house never voted on the rule of law in sri that in itself makes the issue a conspiracy
447060 the kurdistan alliance constitutional challenge article 24 of the district councils election law and the law whole front of the supreme constitutional court even if put to the vote again
447061 we hope that the proposed united nations has reached its final approval by all and be voted on in formula one and we hope that does not matter to this point and that is to compromise and reach an understanding and reach a compromise formula so there is no ghalib or loser
447062 invite the government to calm things down is good and we also call for it but call for calm when there is unrest in our view be calming down and finding compromise solutions
447063 there is no military intervention by the government because there is no military action until it received the government
447064 boiling and ahtkanat in the iraqi street reflecting on the citizens of various nationalities
447065 the government sent vojin one brigade of the fourth year in kirkuk and deployed to maintain security but where we believe that the regiment are not sufficient to maintain security in kirkuk especially after the escalation that happened before the kurdistan alliance
447066 what must be done to the parliament from a legal standpoint is to deal with the constitutional text and vetoed the validity of the veto if the veto is true look at the details but if the veto is not true we must rule the presidency again
447067 in the case of veto should be no provision for alternative text vetoed and may not be included as an alternative text proposed dmistora unless it consensus by all parties
447068 proposal dmistora contains a lot of positive things but omitted an important point which guarantees because the law is the basis of safeguards relating to the work of the commission and obstruction dmistora proposal did not contain any guarantee and therefore can not deal with him or adopt him
447069 article 24 does not distort them anything from the legal constitutional procedural even when it was voted secretly decided that the house of representatives and the kurds have accepted the principle and then left the room for that i do not think that there is no legal justification to resort to the constitutional court to rule challenged
447070 this step refunded to the owners do not have weight
447071 man that guy swears almost as much as you do
447072 everybodys trying to figure out how to lower levels of acrylamide without significantly adversely affecting taste
447073 what shall we do that we may work the works of god
447074 for by grace you have been saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of god
447075 who saved us and called us with a holy calling not according to our works but according to his own purpose and grace which was granted us in christ jesus from all eternity
447076 now has been revealed by the appearing of our savior christ jesus who abolished death and brought life and immortality to light through the gospel
447077 for through the grace given me i say to every man among you not to think more highly of himself than he ought to think but to think so as to have sound judgment as god as allotted to each a measure of faith
447078 for to you it has been granted for christs sake not only to believe in him but also to suffer for his sake
447079 your first name needs whatever ridiculous thing you want to put
447080 through two thousand years of western history millions of sincere devout and knowledgeable people have seen the end as about to happen in their own lifetimes but they have all been wrong
447081 the last days are upon us weigh carefully the times look for him who is above all time eternal and invisible
447082 we have reached the time of the white horse of the apocalypse this world will not last any longer than another hundred years
447083 i am fully convinced that somewhere between march 21st 1843 and march 21st 1844 christ will come
447084 88 reasons why the rapture will take place in 1988
447085 and as it was in the days of noah so it will be also in the days of the son of man they ate they drank they married wives they were given in marriage until the day that noah entered the ark and the flood came and destroyed them all likewise as it was also in the days of lot they ate they drank they bought they sold they planted they built but on the day that lot went out of sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all even so will it be in the day when the son of man is revealed luke 17 26 30
447086 therefore you also be ready for the son of man is coming at an hour you do not expect matthew 24 44
447087 your majesty i am nothing but a servant but i make enough of a living to keep my wife and children happy we dont need too much a roof over our head and warm food to fill our tummy my wife and children our my inspiration they are content with whatever little i bring home i am happy because my family is happy
447088 your majesty i believe that the servant has not been made part of the 99 club
447089 your majesty to truly know what the 99 club is you will have to do the following place 99 gold coins in a bag and leave it at this servants doorstep you will then understand what the 99 club is
447090 ah but your majesty the servant has now officially joined the 99 club
447091 the 99 club is just a name given to those people who have everything but yet are never content therefore they are always working hard and striving for that extra 1 to round it out to 100 we have so much to be thankful for and we can live with very little in our lives but the minute we are given something bigger and better we want even more we are not the same happy contented person we used to be we want more and more and by wanting more and more we dont realize the price we pay for it we lose our sleep our happiness we hurt the people around us just as a price to pay for our growing needs and desires that is what joining the 99 club is all about
447092 whenever america targets and kills innocent people it comes up with such propaganda that it has killed a big personality in an attempt to justify the cruelty it has done
447093 naturally the common people dont want war neither in russia nor in england nor for that matter in germany that is understood but after all it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a parliament or a communist dictatorship voice or no voice the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders that is easy all you have to do is tell them they are being attacked and denounce the peacemakers for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger it works the same in any country
447094 if john mccain doesnt stop changing his position on the issues he threatens to make john kerry look like an amateur in order for mccain to win in november he has to appeal to both the traditional republican base and to independents dana milbank in the washington post says thats a delicate dance and if mccains not careful hes liable to break a hip of course any doctor will tell you a broken hip can be very difficult to recover from

447101 people work exceedingly hard for us i wanted to go out doing the right thing
447102 sometimes god doesnt entrust us with money because we want to keep it while he wants us to give it away
447103 let them do good that they be rich in good works ready to give willing to share
447104 well if i had millions of dollars id be happy to share what i have with others
447105 he who receives you receives me and he who receives me receives him who sent me

447107 fruit drinks were consumed more frequently than soft drinks in our study and the proportion of total energy intake from fruit drinks in the u s population doubled from 1977 to 2001
447108 the public should be made aware that these drinks are not a healthy alternative to soft drinks with regard to risk of type 2 diabetes
447109 that will require a national effort akin to the apollo moon launch you
447110 gary was the best left tackle i ever saw play the game
447111 he was a mans man he looked like you could bounce a medicine ball off his chest
447112 you put him out there at left tackle and you never had to give him any help when john developed that confidence in him he felt almost as if he could ignore anybody coming from that side because they werent going to get to him obviously that propelled us to the next level
447113 i asked him what happened and he just said football
447114 i think if i hadnt said something to him to start the conversation we probably never would have spoken
447115 the problem is ive got too much to say for once in my life
447116 thats whats really bizarre ive got so many people to thank and so many people who made a difference in my career and a few little funny stories along the way ive got to whittle it down
447117 a lot of people dont understand gary is a very intelligent guy and hell have some things to say that nobody would ever expect him to talk about
447118 zim will be zim but id be surprised if he isnt one of the more interesting guys who gives his speech
447119 the shoulders have always been my problem but the last few years its been my hip its to the point where my shoulders dont bug me anymore because the hip has taken over the pain
447120 its just gradually getting worse to where i cant fight it off much longer
447121 its hard at first but it became a thing of pride for me not to let an injury stop me from playing once you start doing it you can never give in because the first time you give in its over
447122 i honestly thought when he got back from that trip he would never get on a plane again
447123 but he literally got off that plane and while we were still in the airport told me he was going to take flying lessons
447124 once he decides he wants something or tries to do something theres no stopping him
447125 it was a reality check for gary but it also inspired him even more

447127 adakah orang yang dapat mendengarkan aku bicara adakah orang di sekitar sini dimana kalian di mana para camar yang tadi terbang aku perlu kalian
447128 apa apaan ini siapa yang mempermainkan aku apakah kalian tahu siapa aku
447129 sesungguhnya ada apa kenapa hari yang cerah menjadi hitam aku yang tadi riang sekarang menjadi edan aneh sungguh aneh
447130 akankah diamku menimbulkan sahutan ini tolonglah siapapun disana mendekatlah baik apapun yang kau minta akan kuturuti asal aku bisa mendapat sinar matahari lagi
447131 apa yang akan kau berikan kau akan memberi pada siapa siapa yang akan menolongmu
447132 terserah kau percaya atau tidak tapi aku adalah dirimu aku tahu apa yang kau lakukan kau sedang bediri seperti orang bingung
447133 tidak mungkin ok siapapun kau tak masalah tapi yang penting bawa aku keluar dari tempat pengap ini aku sudah tidak tahan lagi
447134 apa kau tahu dimana para camar itu mereka terbang mencarikan makanan buat anak mereka sedang kau mencuil ikan tangkapannya dan sekarang kau minta tolong padaku seharusnya camar camar itu yang menghukum bukan aku dirimu sendiri
447135 sudah kubilang aku adalah dirimu aku tahu apa yang kau lakukan
447136 sepertinya aku tak bisa mengelak baik apa yang kau ingin
447137 jangan tanya aku apa yang ku ingin tanya pada dirimu tentang apapun
447138 jalan keluar apa kau ingin lari dari kenyataan yang sedang terjadi ini kalau boleh berkata aku tidak jadi bangga menjadi bayangan orang yang pengecut
447139 kalau boleh berkata aku tidak jadi bangga menjadi bayangan orang pengecut
447140 a teaser for the larry king live news show july 29 got to the quintessence of the scientific controversy over cell phones
447141 why was it good or why did he miss it that is what camp is for being a young guy he has to understand that the feel he gets after kicking the ball and the result that he has when he looks up and takes a look at the ball that means a lot so he can learn how to adjust by that feel
447142 do you want him to make it all sure you do does it happen all the time no it doesnt but right now if we were in the season and in this position i would be feeling pretty good as long as we are improving
447143 right now we dont have a leader basically they are really close
447144 i think they understand where they are at and what they need to do another week will give us another look at them and show us exactly where we are heading into our first preseason game
447145 his knee was a little inflamed today so we kept him off
447146 what i said is you have to be a little bit lucky fortunate and healthy like i said in the two super bowl years we lost 10 starters games one year and we lost 15 starters games the next year last year we lost 72 ive got some high expectations for this team and hopefully we will get there
447147 same thing a little tight his groin was a little sore we kept him off the last two periods he practiced everything except the last two
447148 its a great tribute to gary and this organization obviously the first super bowl we won he was a big part of that like i said hes a guy we never had to worry about making a play you dont say that very often in the national football league especially at that left tackle position i gave an illustration of this one where his shoulders popped and he refused to come out until john elway did that gives you an idea of how tough he was as well we will be down there in canton ohio with about nine or 10 coaches that were with gary we are looking forward to it
447149 i dont know tom is such a tough guy when hes feels like hes ready to go hell go when that will be i really dont know hes smart when you get older you understand what you can do and what you cant do there is a difference between being injured and being hurt tom knows the difference so when he can play hell be back in the lineup
447150 thats the reason we signed him not only was he a veteran player but we thought he was kind of the nuts and bolts of the offensive line at kansas city all these years i dont how many snaps he made in a row he was a guy that held that offensive line together a lot of years he did a very respectable job at kansas city having him on our football team and playing the way he has is a plus for us
447151 obviously we talk about a lot of things the main thing is we just want to get better every day there is not just one thing in training camp what we are trying to do is get better every day as a team and focus on the now dont worry about what happened in the past and just worry about whats happening in the future if guys go out there with that mindset then you have a chance to play a little football
447152 i dont know ill tell you when his weight is down his weight is not down right now when his weight does go down to the weight that we wanted then hell be out there practicing
447153 anytime you give guys an opportunity to get in front of you its never good ill answer that question when he comes back
447154 they are doing a good job not much experience there but playing very well im hoping we have one of the better offensive lines weve had in a long time
447155 what they do is evaluate our players just like we evaluate college players if somebody is cut at the end they have a pecking order too just like we do through free agency and what we do in college if the guy is not picked up and they think he might help their football team we want them out here we feel like all these guys are working their rear ends off if for some reason they dont make it with us they have an opportunity in canada to play as well
447156 obviously the first super bowl we won he was a big part of that like i said hes a guy we never had to worry about making a play you dont say that very often in the national football league especially at that left tackle position i gave an illustration of this one where his shoulders popped and he refused to come out until john elway did that gives you an idea of how tough he was as well we will be down there in canton ohio with about nine or 10 coaches that were with gary we are looking forward to it
447157 when his weight does go down to the weight that we wanted then hell be out there practicing
447158 not much experience there but playing very well im hoping we have one of the better offensive lines weve had in a long time
447159 tom is such a tough guy when hes feels like hes ready to go hell go
447160 when that will be i really dont know hes smart when you get older you understand what you can do and what you cant do so when he can play hell be back in the lineup
447161 not only was he a veteran player but we thought he was kind of the nuts and bolts of the offensive line at kansas city all these years i dont how many snaps he made in a row having him on our football team and playing the way he has is a plus for us
447162 what we are trying to do is get better every day as a team and focus on the now
447163 dont worry about what happened in the past and just worry about whats happening in the future if guys go out there with that mindset then you have a chance to play a little football
447164 its a pretty significant change its similar to the college rule
447165 it makes it easier on us as officials because its just a simple two feet down and not have to worry about anything else because it takes the judgement out of it i think its better for everybody
447166 theyll designate that by number and player at the beginning of the game
447167 theyll usually have green dots on the backs of their helmets so well look around for that

447180 very few people look the part and are it too

447188 although this democrat majority just adjourned for the democrat 5 week vacation house republicans are continuing to fight on the house floor although the lights mics and c span cameras have been turned off house republicans are on the floor speaking to the tax payers in the gallery who not surprisingly agree with republican energy proposals all republicans who are in town are encouraged to come to the house floor
447189 i want to melt down their phones i want to flood their e mail boxes i want to hold them as political hostages the ransom demand is to unleash the free market to begin exploring and pumping domestic crude oil and getting it to market as fast as possible weve got two months days to make our voices heard lets make history by bringing this recalcitrant body of elitists into compliance with the will of the people and the rule of law
447190 i hope radio talk show hosts across the country will embrace this bipartisan non partisan movement
447191 there is no question in my mind this is what the american people want now its just time for them to impose their will on their elected representatives who in their chauffeured limousines and taxpayer supported travel are hopelessly out of touch with their constituents with people who are finding it difficult to make ends meet
447192 but this time we wont just be stopping something bad from happening we will be doing something that is very good for the country something that will improve the lives of all of us something that will improve national security something vital for the future of the nation
447193 im going to do everything in my power to push congress into action in the next two months days
447194 i know i cant do it by myself but i know if the american people get mobilized nothing can stop them you have to let members of congress know you are serious you have to persuade them and their staffs they are not returning to washington next year if they fail to act in americas interest before they leave town
447195 very few people look the part and are it too
447196 we like mr obama we hope that he will win the election
447197 whats damaging the mccain campaign now i suspect is that this fiercely independent man is trying to please other people especially a republican leadership that doesnt really trust him

447220 eid al fitr is one of eight paid holidays for all team members covered by the contract while labor day is not a paid holiday
447221 based on the contract the other paid holidays include the team members birthday new years day martin luther king jr day memorial day independence day thanksgiving day and christmas day
447222 implementing this holiday was a challenge since it falls on a different day every year and is declared on fairly short notice
447223 but the negotiating committee felt this was extremely crucial since this holiday is as important to muslims as christmas is to christians
447224 two prayer rooms have been created to allow muslim workers to pray twice a day and return to work without leaving the plant
447225 does have a prayer room to accommodate the needs of muslim team members
447226 labor day differs in every essential way from the other holidays of the year in any country

447235 this is the biggest news for public health and hiv aids that weve had in a while
447236 this puts a key part of the dashboard in place
447237 this is the most reliable estimate weve had since the beginning of the epidemic
447238 the largest commitment by any nation to combat a single disease in human history
447239 evidence of a failure by government and society to do what it takes to control the epidemic
447240 we have been inadequately funding this epidemic all along we need to step it up
447241 i think the fbi owes us a complete accounting of their investigation and ought to be able to tell us at some point how were going to bring this to closure
447242 its been seven years theres a lot of unanswered questions and i think the american people deserve to know more than they do today

447245 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
447246 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
447247 i dont come out of central casting im young im new to the national scene my name is barack obama i do not have the typical biography of a presidential candidate
447248 what that means is that im sort of unfamiliar and people are still trying to get a fix on who i am where i come from
447249 what has been an approach of the mccain campaign is to say hes risky
447250 i am adamant in saying there has been no deal whatsoever to accept restrictions
447251 our requirements are the same from host city to host city and remain unchanged since the ioc entered into a host city contract with beijing in 2001
447252 today i am glad to see that media are able to access the bbcs mandarin site wikipedia and various websites of ngos from the main press center and the olympic village i believe this is unprecedented for this country
447253 when beijing was awarded the games the ioc required it to provide the media with the fullest access possible to report on the olympic games this is what beijing organizers bocog has said it will deliver
447254 i am not going to make an apology for something that the ioc is not responsible for we are not running the internet in china its the chinese authorities that are running the internet
447255 there has been a heated debate and i understand your concerns but we have pressed the issue and there has been an improvement thats what counts
447256 with nonstop protests against the government samak had no choice but to replace some of his unpopular ministers
447257 it is very disappointing to see the new cabinet list

447263 but the leaders of the democratic congress have refused to allow a vote
447264 the president knows that the impact of any new drilling will be insignificant promising savings of only pennies per gallon many years down the road
447265 the conditions you were working in on tuesday were not good
447266 i am not going to make an apology for something that the ioc is not responsible for we are not running the internet in china
447267 we did find some areas where although he initially resisted he came around
447268 it was a classic strategy of giving the president things he doesnt want in bills he has to have
447269 in the eighth year of the presidency and in this environment bushs veto was pretty strong
447270 he had to compromise and he had to do it in two ways either they negotiated out a compromise or he was pushed into a compromise politically because of where the votes were
447271 the president doesnt get involved much with what goes on around here
447272 talking about a second stimulus package right now is premature
447273 well fight if we must but wed much rather dance
447274 i came back from kirkuk half an hour ago the situation is very tense there
447275 the kurds want to lay bricks for an independent state but escalating tensions will not bring any good to anyone
447276 why is the peshmerga kurdish militia in the center of kirkuk
447277 kirkuk is a city under the rule of the central government and must remain as it is
447278 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
447279 in no way do i think john mccains campaign was racist i think they are cynical
447280 their team is good at creating distractions and engaging in negative attacks
447281 what i dont want to do is for the best to be the enemy of the good
447282 and if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things that i dont like or the democrats have to accept some things that they dont like in exchange for actually moving us in the direction of actual energy independence then thats something im open to
447283 cdcs first estimates from this system reveal that the hiv epidemic is and has been worse than previously known results indicate that approximately 56 300 new hiv infections occurred in the united states in 2006
447284 this figure is roughly 40 percent higher than cdcs former estimate of 40 000 infections per year which was based on limited data and less precise methods
447285 the data really confirm that there is a severe impact of this epidemic among gay and bisexual men in the united states as well as black men and women
447286 it also mirrors what we see about sexually transmitted diseases and changes in risk behavior among men who have sex with men
447287 the reality is that it is a wake up call for all of us
447288 there are things that you and i can do to stop the disease encourage others to use condoms consistently and correctly abstain from sex
447289 it is important to note that the new estimate does not represent an actual increase in the annual number of new hiv infections
447290 in fact cdcs analysis suggests that the epidemic has been roughly stable since the late 1990s though the number of new hiv infections remains unacceptably high
447291 the analysis shows that new infections peaked in the mid 1980s at approximately 130 000 infections per year and reached a low of about 50 000 in the early 1990s

447300 for too long partisan gridlock and special interest influence has blocked progress on some of the most urgent challenges facing the american people and that is especially true when it comes to our energy crisis
447301 todays announcement includes many of the policies ive been fighting for during my time in the senate and over the course of this campaign
447302 like all compromises it also includes steps that i havent always supported
447303 but ive always believed that finding consensus will be essential to solving our energy crisis and todays package represents a good faith effort at a new bipartisan beginning in the coming days ill be laying out additional steps i believe we must take to bring down gas prices for good and truly free ourselves from our dependence on foreign oil
447304 what i was saying was we cant drill our way out of the problem
447305 what that means is if we want to have true oil independence true energy independence then were going to have to become more efficient obama said
447306 what i said was what ive seen so far from a so called gang of 10 energy bill which several senators are promoting has some of the very aggressive elements that he wants to see in an energy plan
447307 i remain skeptical of some of the drilling positions but i will give them credit that the way they crafted the drilling positions are about as careful as you might expect from a drilling agenda what i dont want is for the bad to be the enemy of the good
447308 at some point people are going to have make some decisions are we going to keep on arguing or are we going to get some things done
447309 is there a way to advance your view in hopes of constructively pushing your candidate without undermining your candidate
447310 when a school reinforces an english only policy it sends a message to all children that minority languages have less value than english as tools of learning and because the school is a microcosm of society this message also suggests that those languages are not an integral part of the american society this message equally deprives mainstream children of the opportunity to experience the cultural diversity in this country and robs every child of the chance to learn the full potential of human possibilities
447311 you are crazy if five years ago someone had told you that in 2008 a terrific brilliant charismatic black guy would come along in a democratic year but would lose to an ancient white republican simply because he was black you would have said that of course hed lose whats changed
447312 while oil companies are earning record profits and gas prices are soaring the largest oil companies have invested more resources in stock buybacks than u s production
447313 language diversity has always been with us as early as 1664 when the island of manhattan was ceded from the dutch to the british 18 different tongues were spoken there not counting any of the hundreds of native american languages spoken in north america at the time in the 1790 census german americans accounted for 8 6 percent of the population a proportion comparable to that of hispanic americans 9 0 percent exactly two centuries later these assimilative forces are even more powerful today
447314 there is no evidence that bilingual accommodations slow down english acquisition
447315 about a third of the worlds nation states have official language provisions in their constitutions but few of these designate a single language for government some do so at enormous cost to civil liberties turkey for example has criminalized minority language usage in many contexts others elevate a single national language for purely symbolic ceremonial purposes but a larger number of constitutions include explicit provisions for minority rights giving official status to more than one language in practice some of these guarantees are faithfully observed some are ignored elsewhere language laws serve a planning function for example in post colonial nations that remain linguistically diverse or they may seek to mediate ethnic rivalries
447316 in sum it is impossible to generalize about the meaning of an official language
447317 we have room for but one language in this country and that is the english language for we intend to see that the crucible turns our people out as americans of american nationality and not as dwellers in a polyglot boarding house
447318 dont just sit there and waste your precious time when you want to do something do it right away do it when you can its the only way to live a life without regrets

447347 a respectable qualifying from mark in a very tight field were close to our nearest rivals in renault and toyota which should make for an interesting race tomorrow david isnt far off the back of that group he unfortunately didnt have a good second run in q2 but well be fighting hard tomorrow
447348 that was a pretty good qualifying session quite straightforward it would have been nice to have had a bit more pace in q3 but q2 and q1 went well for us im disappointed im on the wrong side of the grid an odd number is always better but we definitely have a chance to get something from where we are so well see how we go tomorrow
447349 i was losing a little bit of time in each of the sectors and i couldnt deliver that last little bit of lap time because i was bringing the mid corner speed too low its tough from thirteenth for sure but the hungarian race can be unpredictable so lets see
447350 engine wise we have been completely clear all weekend which has allowed us to concentrate on the performance of both the car and the engine we would have preferred to have seen both cars appearing in q3 but we are sure david will be strong tomorrow mark has a good chance for a good race
447351 things have gone very well and we were checking out all the tyres we had available i may have to check a bit more tomorrow because there are still some parts of the track the rear tyre doesnt like so much so we have to fix the suspension settings for that i also did some crash testing at the very fast first corner but my old collarbone injury was perfect so no problem i have a good feeling from the front tyre here after this session there are three japanese riders in the front row which looks ok to me we will check more suspension settings tomorrow but it all depends on if it rains or not it was also quite windy today and you could feel it on some corners
447352 the first day back here after last year and the circuit feels pretty bumpy especially compared to the last track we were at brno the bike feels a little bit nervous at the moment and that was a similar feeling to last year at this track the set up has been improved compared to this morning and we did go in the right direction with the set up just not far enough so tomorrow we will go further in that direction and right now the tyres dont seem to be causing any issue in terms of life so the choice will probably depend on grip considering how i felt about the bumps and given our decent lap times were not a mile away
447353 we spent today looking for the best balance and we have already found good race tyre possibilities tomorrow we will finish the job we have always had good results here so after this first day were confident we can continue to perform well at brands
447354 from the pit wall that was a very exciting and pleasing hour of qualifying we were fighting in the top three for all the sessions except for the very last lap we will investigate what happened but compared to the outings before we slightly underperformed still there is no room for disappointment timo took his best ever grid position and he was very strong during all the sessions well have to see what the fuel loads are tomorrow but when all the cars were at low fuel he was consistently in the top three jarno struggled for balance so we will look into the data tonight the tyres were a very close call today but we organised our run plan so that we were able to make the right decisions at the right time and it worked out now we have a strong position for the race tomorrow with both drivers
447355 that was a very good qualifying session for me and im obviously delighted we made a good start in first practice yesterday the team did a good job overnight and we made the right choice over set up it wasnt easy today because we had a very tight choice over tyres so we had to make a close decision for every lap but in the end my engineers stayed cool and got it right in q2 the car felt perfect then on the very last lap it was a bit trickier again because the tyres didnt behave quite as well but im happy with p5 we are in a great situation for tomorrow its good for all of us and after hockenheim this is the perfect answer for the faith i have in the whole team
447356 im glad to be in the top ten but that was a difficult qualifying session and p9 is disappointing since this morning i have struggled for grip and balance and unfortunately we werent able to find the answers in time i had the same problems in qualifying so we will have to investigate that tonight im happy for timo who has done a good job this weekend and it is clearly important for us to score as many points as possible for the constructors championship overtaking is very difficult here but tomorrow is a very long race and we will see what we can achieve

447365 regret comes in all shapes and sizes some are small like when we do a bad thing for a good reason some are bigger like when we let down a friend some of us escape the pangs of regret by making the right choice some of us have little time for regret because were looking forward to the future sometimes we have to fight to come to terms with the past and sometimes we bury our regret by promising to change our ways but our biggest regrets are not for the things we did but the things we didnt do the things we didnt say that could save someone we care about especially when we can see the dark storm thats headed their way

447412 validation allows the detection of attacks and encoding prevents any successful script injection from running in the browser
447413 injection flaws allow attackers to create read update or delete any arbitrary data available to the application
447414 in the worst case scenario these flaws allow an attacker to completely compromise the application and the underlying systems even bypassing deeply nested firewalled environments
447415 if you must invoke an interpreter the key method to avoid injections is the use of safe apis such as strongly typed parameterized queries and object relational mapping libraries

447730 the government will have to bear the costs if contracts are broken
447731 it is not economically efficient if the government wants to spend rm5 billion they have to cut back on other areas
447732 i do not know the terms of contracts between tenaga nasional berhad tnb and the ipps but if there are terms that say the contract needed to be re newed tnb can make a choice of not needing the ipps as tnb has additional capacity

447734 the minister provided more facts in defending the governments move to restructure the fuel subsidy compared to anwar who chose to adopt the populist approach in wooing the audience

447749 nothing really im just deciding each day what im in the mood for and seeing where it takes me
447750 when you quit your job did you have any goals in mind for yourself
447751 definitely not thats what i just left the world of goals and to do lists
447752 but then will you go back to work after some period of time
447753 yeah like those people that have blogs how do they ever have any energy left over for real writing
447754 im going to tell you what i told you 16 years ago at your wedding i wish you had a sister that i could introduce to my son
447755 what am i doing wrong that im 72 and still working
447756 what do you guys do that you can just take off on a hawaiian vacation with your friends at a moments notice
447757 what do you guys do then now that you are retired
447758 as i say it i anticipate the glazed look in their eyes
447759 i just left my 22 year career in finance to find out what else life holds for me
447760 i manage money for a young retired silicon valley couple
447761 to feel simply thats a chair thats a table and yet at the same time its a miracle its an ecstasy
447762 from all sides they come an incessant shower of innumerable atoms
447763 record the atoms as they fall upon the mind in the order in which they fall let us trace the pattern however disconnected and incoherent
447764 we now know enough to know that we will never know everything
447765 this is why we need art it teaches us how to live with mystery
447766 i have finally arrived at some idea of a new form for a new novel
447767 at factories at utopias even at the decoration and upholstery of the carriage but never at life never at human nature
447768 examine for a moment an ordinary mind on an ordinary day
447769 is it not the task of the novelist to convey this varying this unknown and uncircumscribed spirit whatever aberration or complexity it may display with as little mixture of the alien and external as possible
447770 was very erratic very undependable now to be found in a dusty road now in a scrap of newspaper in the street now in a daffodil in the sun
447771 we are the words we are the music we are the thing itself
447772 like a butterflys wing clamped together with bolts of iron
447773 you can really feel the particulate stuff getting into your lungs
447774 after the race when we tried to talk or laugh or cough it was pretty tough you could feel it in your lungs there was a burning
447775 trying to cheer was almost impossible because we just couldnt take deep breaths
447776 there may be some risk for outdoor events that include minimum one hour continuous physical efforts at high level
447777 its going to be the toughest on those athletes because theyre going to be out there breathing hard for the longest amount of time
447778 its going to have its biggest effect on those with an underlying lung disease like asthma or those who have allergic rhinitis that would be triggered by the smoggy air
447779 certainly those athletes are going to be at a disadvantage and thats just going to be a fact of life
447780 so im just trying to take inventory of when that gets to be bad and when that is fairly good
447781 ive tried my different asthma medicines and my different allergy medicines and im trying to find the perfect combination that helps me breathe the best
447782 i think scientifically weve done everything possible and will continue up until games time and through games time to make it the best possible for athletes and visitors
447783 we are confident that because of those extra measures the air quality will be good for the athletes during the games time
447784 two days of rather impressive blue sky its been beautiful outside and you just take it one day at a time
447785 there has definitely been an improvement in the air quality
447786 the beijing government calls days here with good air quality blue sky days
447787 sometimes its hard to tell looking at the sky today theres only a suggestion of blue peeking through the haze and the clouds
447788 the benefits of the masks are as much psychological as they are physiological
447789 whether or not these devices are necessary is something we wont know until were actually in beijing at the games were optimistic that the air will be of a suitable standard but we are prepared in the event that we encounter conditions that are somewhat less than ideal
447790 i think of pollution as one of many factors that i need to deal with during the race
447791 most of my planning is going to be focused on simply getting used to the time zone change and getting used to the heat and the humidity
447792 those are things i feel i have better control over
447793 if it cant be fixed with a hammer it cant be fixed at all
447794 these nerve cells which die have been impossible to culture in the laboratory and as a result we have no idea why they die
447795 we actually infect them with four different viruses each of which contains a particular embryonic gene
447796 and then that has this desired effect of transforming those adult skin cells into these pluripotent stem cell lines which can make all the different cells in the body including the very specific type of nerve cell which dies in lou gehrigs disease
447797 until we find some way to circumvent that difficulty which is just a matter of time we wont be able to transplant these exact cells into patients
447798 now well literally be able to make a limitless supply of those and ask why that is and i think invariably that is going to lead to a better understanding of the disease and then in turn new drugs for the disease
447799 we can generate the neurons now we have to find out are they any different and what can we learn about the disease from those motor neurons
447800 were going to have a model or a new system in which to study the disease and i think youll see different papers coming out on different disorders such as parkinsons and other diseases in the near future
447801 whenever america targets and kills innocent people it comes up with such propaganda that it has killed a big personality in an attempt to justify the cruelty it has done
447802 thats a storybook ending right there manny getting traded here and coming up representing the winning run but brandon made some quality pitches and got the double play hes done his job pretty well all year
447803 the fuel of the future could be hydrogen if it can be made cheaply enough currently electrolyzers machines that split water into its constituent hydrogen and oxygen need a catalyst namely platinum to run ditto fuel cells to recombine that hydrogen with oxygen which produces electricity the problem is that the precious metal costs about 1 700 to 2 000 per ounce which means that hydrogen would be an uneconomical fuel source unless a less costly catalyst can be found but researchers from the massachusetts institute of technology m i t and monash university in australia report in science today that they may have a cost effective solution
447804 why is it that we celebrate people after they die we all make time to come in and tell stories and honor this life but the person is dead and never felt what he meant to you
447805 good leaders know how to follow and bad leaders dont

447810 both prime ministers said we need to overcome these problems and move forward
447811 prime minister gilani said he would conduct an independent investigation into the kabul blast he will discuss the matter with afghan president hamid karzai and will look into the matter
447812 i am meeting president karzai tomorrow if they give me evidence then we will look into the matter

447816 the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
447817 mr president former secretary of state colin powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
447818 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
447819 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
447820 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective
447821 governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government

447824 we cannot dedicate we cannot consecrate we cannot hallow this ground the brave men living and dead who struggled here have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract
447825 we cannot dedicate we can not consecrate we can not hallow this ground
447826 they pick the most dangerous enemy they can find and its themselves
447827 the tools of conquest do not necessarily come with bombs and explosions and fallout there are weapons that are simply thoughts attitudes prejudices to be found only in the minds of men
447828 for the record prejudices can kill and suspicion can destroy and a thoughtless frightened search for a scapegoat has a fallout all its own for the children and the children yet unborn
447829 a media campaign to create a wedge between the american people and their government
447830 in the 1920s a failed austrian painter published a book in which he explained his intention to build an aryan super state in germany and take revenge on europe and eradicate the jews
447831 the world ignored hitlers words and paid a terrible price
447832 we must remember always that accusation is not proof and that conviction depends upon evidence and due process of law
447833 it demands the deep analysis and the sober contemplation of every american
447834 we want the coalition forces there so they can hear what the governor promises

447847 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
447848 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
447849 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
447850 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
447851 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
447852 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
447853 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
447854 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
447855 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
447856 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
447857 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
447858 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

447888 this is a very dynamic park there have been melting glaciers for the last three years but weve never seen anything like this in the 40 years the park has been in existence
447889 what happened in pangnirtung is what appears to be happening in the park
447890 weve lost huge chunks of our trails there were established foot trails that are completely gone now
447891 were getting more rain were getting earlier ice melting and later freeze ups
447892 changes in precipitation patterns due to climate change coupled with increasing demand for water from both urban areas and agriculture could lead to problems in water allocation and quality
447893 more study of this complicated issue is needed if we are to make meaningful educated choices that may help us shape a better future for kansas food production
447894 no one has really looked at the other side of the equation about what it would cost us if we didnt do anything about it
447895 climate change is likely to result in hotter drier summers and warmer wetter winters perversely this means we will suffer from having both more water and less with greater risk from flooding and drought
447896 taken separately all the impacts are harmful but taken together they could ultimately destroy an internationally important river system policies must therefore be developed that can address droughts floods pollution and climate change simultaneously rather than treating each in isolation
447897 population growth will place further pressure on our already stressed water supplies we now need to take action to reduce the amount of water each person wastes lower leakage and reduce pollution
447898 australia can no longer rely on fossil fuels to meet our energy needs
447899 the forest industry can provide a renewable and sustainable energy source
447900 bioenergy generated from wood waste is a low cost renewable clean energy option available to australia
447901 its significantly cheaper to produce than wind or solar power
447902 with petrol as high as 1 70 a litre and coal producing large amounts of greenhouse gas emissions its time australia seriously looked at clean renewable energy sources
447903 wood waste from australias existing forest industry activities without harvesting a single extra tree has the potential to significantly substitute fossil fuel based energy production and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 3 millions tonnes of co2 every year
447904 producing renewable energy from wood waste has potential to provide around 7pc of australias goal of a 20pc share of renewable energy by 2020
447905 however regulations which restrict the full use of wood waste from forest industry activities must be removed if this renewable energy generation capacity is to be realised
447906 everyone at simon amp schuster is deeply saddened by this terrible tragedy our thoughts and prayers go out to the families of the victims and to all of our colleagues at our bristol pennsylvania facility
447907 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
447908 in no way do i think john mccains campaign was racist i think they are cynical
447909 their team is good at creating distractions and engaging in negative attacks
447910 what i dont want to do is for the best to be the enemy of the good
447911 and if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things that i dont like or the democrats have to accept some things that they dont like in exchange for actually moving us in the direction of actual energy independence then thats something im open to
447912 oh i could use one of those for that price
447913 i reckon he should hand the title back to the south african how can he walk around like a world champ after getting a beating like he got

447920 protected species and admitted he was under pressure to perform
447921 everyone thinks i am protected here and i will be here forever he said
447922 but that is not the case i have been through the ups and downs and maybe a change would be best for me
447923 both will davison and steve are off contract at the end of the year schwerkolt said
447924 i am looking at the positives and maybe looking at positive outcomes
447925 it hasnt been the best year but it is so competitive out there
447926 steve has got an awful lot to offer especially in endurance racers he has had a bit of bad luck with qualifying and it becomes a bit of a mess when you are starting from the back
447927 im not really stressed about it he said i know i will be driving for the next 10 years obviously everyone wants results and no one gets more disappointed than me
447928 adrian and charlie had a chat to me at the beginning of the year and made me look at things a different way i havent been consistent and it is very frustrating and confusing we cant understand why things havent improved when they should have
447929 we are aware that will has been linked to sbr he said
447930 but we have just begun negotiations with wills manager and it is going along nicely obviously our goal is to come up with a good package which will keep him here
447931 we basically wanted to remind the nrl we were still around florimo told us
447932 it was a good meeting everyone knows that eventually theres going to be a team on the central coast if the opportunity arises weve got to be ready to jump weve obviously got a lot of work to do but its a start
447933 if we end up on the central coast it would be very much like the titans model where the community was involved in the naming of the team the jersey and things like that to give them a feel of ownership
447934 a few of the things the club has come up with im struggling with i want to be back helping the raiders push for a finals berth this season carney said
447935 if they want to sack me then ill have to sit back down with my manager dave riolo and my family and discuss what could happen
447936 i dont condone what ive done i know ive got to sort my life outside of football out carney said
447937 im obviously not as big as cathy and nova perris but the first or one of the first indigenous female basketballers to make an olympics so im over the moon cox says
447938 theres a lot of indigenous male athletes out there so id just love to tell the girls that if they want something really bad they can achieve it
447939 as soon as my daughter turned one i thought what the hell are you doing here my daughters not going to get any opportunity here snap out of it
447940 im glad i got out of there seriously otherwise i would not be here now if i wouldnt have left i would have had maybe another two more kids knowing i could have been someone was just bugging me

447947 we are not at this time making any official statements or comments regarding this situation
447948 is so much easier with so many fewer restrictions and problems ethical as well as others
447949 the ultimate goal is not to create therapies with somatic cell nuclear transfer
447950 the ultimate goal of all lines of this research is to be able eventually to reprogram ordinary body cells so that they could be used for therapy to replace cells that have been destroyed by injury or disease
447951 the conflict centers on an effort to create stem cells from embryos that are exact clones of adults
447952 one of the problems is that there is a significant risk to the health of a woman who donates eggs
447953 even under normal doses drugs used to coax eggs for use by fertilization clinics can occasionally lead to serious complications caused by excessive stimulation of the ovaries in rare instances the condition can be fatal

448031 these agencies can ill afford to be confronted with a precipitous loss of service when dealing with potentially life or death situations
448032 this is wonderful news for the navajo nation and its president joe shirley who has worked hard for many years to provide the navajo people with the best possible satellite service despite numerous obstacles
448033 we are hopeful that the payment irregularities will soon end and there will be no further threats to turn off this critical service on which so many navajo depend
448034 as chairman martin rightfully pointed out these services should not be confronted with sudden loss of service when dealing with life and death situations we will work closely with the fcc and ses to ensure the most seamless possible transition

448055 the thing i liked about what he did on the block was when they doubled him he made the right pass he got the ball out and we were able to get the ball to the right guy he doesnt have to score when hes doubled he just has to make the right pass
448056 we just didnt manage the game we got up 20 with eight minutes to go and we came down and took two quick shots one of them was a three and then another quick shot and then we had two turnovers so there were four possessions where we didnt get a good shot and they hit two threes and scored so we cant do that when youve got a 20 point lead at home with eight minutes to go youve got to control the basketball game
448057 i knew that rasho would be guarding zydrunas so i knew gooden is a better matchup for me hes a very good player he always tries to post you up and hes very strong under the basket and you have to contest his shot the main thing is to try to keep on top of him and keep him out of the paint and i tried to do that

448210 accordingly those countries where large scale hunger and malnutrition are already present face the bleak prospect of little if any improvement in the food intake in the years ahead barring a major foreign financial food aid program more rapid expansion of domestic food production reduced population growth or some combination of all three
448211 on what basis should such food resources then be provided would food be considered an instrument of national power will we be forced to make choices as to whom we can reasonably assist and if so should population efforts be a criterion for such assistance is the u s prepared to accept food rationing to help people who cant wont control their population growth

448221 the countries in south asia need to work towards a collective response that leads to a quantum leap in agricultural productivity foodgrain output and farm incomes so that the spectre of food shortages vanishes from our region

448228 in dit land is er nog nooit een belangrijke stap vooruit gezet inzake staatshervorming met een centrumrechtse coalitie
448229 cd amp v n va willen twee dingen tegelijkertijd die absoluut niet verzoenbaar zijn ze willen zeker als je naar de n va luistert een centrumrechtse coalitie zeker geen socialisten en ze willen een grote staatshervorming wel ze zullen moeten kiezen in dit land is er nog nooit een belangrijke stap vooruit gezet inzake staatshervorming met een centrumrechtse coalitie
448230 ik stel alleen vast dat het niet lukt je zal een staatshervorming niet lukken zonder franstalige socialisten dat heeft de geschiedenis duidelijk uitgewezen
448231 het is even tegenstrijdig als zeggen vrienden we gaan nu een partij voetbal spelen en tegelijkertijd basketbal dat gaan we samen spelen je moet wel kiezen welke match je wil spelen je gaat er nooit in lukken van een staatshervorming te doen terwijl je tegelijkertijd met een centrum rechtse coalitie de ps probeert te isoleren dat lukt niet
448232 volgens mij is het juridisch perfect denkbaar dat wij in vlaanderen zeggen wie zijn kind inschrijft in een nederlandstalige lagere school die moet dat kind minstens n jaar hebben ervaring laten opdoen in een nederlandstalige kleuterschool dat is eigenlijk een beetje sterker dan leerplicht want leerplicht veronderstelt niet noodzakelijk dat je naar een nederlandstalige school gaat
448233 het zal niet simpel zijn omdat het revolutionair is eigenlijk dat we dat onderscheid gaan maken maar ik vind inderdaad dat mensen die ancinniteit opbouwen in brusselse scholen daar een financieel voordeel zouden mogen zien dat ze bijvoorbeeld sneller de ancinniteit opbouwen dat die belangrijker wordt daarover wil ik echt het gesprek aangaan met de vakbonden
448234 there is no question of the ties being snapped permanently between the families mahajan family still says that shweta is their bahu

448341 we are the owners operators and experts of our critical infrastructure from the ceo of a large company in agriculture or high finance to the guy who turns the valve at the water utility
448342 at its most basic level infragard is a partnership between the federal bureau of investigation and the private sector
448343 infragard chapters are geographically linked with fbi field office territories
448344 350 of our nations fortune 500 have a representative in infragard
448345 to date there are more than 11 000 members of infragard
448346 from our perspective that amounts to 11 000 contacts and 11 000 partners in our mission to protect america
448347 those of you in the private sector are the first line of defense
448348 disgruntled employees who will use knowledge gained on the job against their employers
448349 there is evidence that infragard may be closer to a corporate tips program turning private sector corporations some of which may be in a position to observe the activities of millions of individual customers into surrogate eyes and ears for the fbi
448350 the interests of infragard must be protected whenever presented to non infragard members
448351 during interviews with members of the press controlling the image of infragard being presented can be difficult proper preparation for the interview will minimize the risk of embarrassment the infragard leadership and the local fbi representative should review the submitted questions agree on the predilection of the answers and identify the appropriate interviewee tailor answers to the expected audience questions concerning sensitive information should be avoided
448352 gain access to an fbi secure communication network complete with vpn encrypted website webmail listservs message boards and much more
448353 we get very easy access to secure information that only goes to infragard members
448354 he said his brother talked to him before the fbi
448355 and the governor got a lot of grief for releasing the information
448356 youd think an elected official would be the first to know not the last
448357 what infragard brings you is reach into the regional and local communities we are a 22 000 member vetted body of subject matter experts that reaches across seventeen matrixes all the different stovepipes can connect with infragard
448358 if you had to call 1 800 fbi you probably wouldnt bother
448359 but if you knew joe from a local meeting you had with him over a donut you might call them either to give or to get we want everyone to have a little black book
448360 we have all the numbers youd need for homeland security for the fbi for the cyber center and by calling up as an infragard member you will be listened to
448361 special telecommunications card that will enable your call to go through when others will not
448362 the fbi should not be creating a privileged class of americans who get special treatment
448363 theres no business class in law enforcement if theres information the fbi can share with 22 000 corporate bigwigs why dont they just share it with the public thats who their real special relationship is supposed to be with secrecy is not a party favor to be given out to friends this bears a disturbing resemblance to the fbis handing out goodies to corporations in return for folding them into its domestic surveillance machinery
448364 we provide speakers as well as do joint presentations with the fbi we also train alongside them and they have participated in readiness exercises
448365 private sector owners and operators of critical infrastructure as appropriate in order to provide for the delivery of essential services during an emergency
448366 theres been lots of discussions about what happens under an emergency
448367 the meeting started off innocuously enough with the speakers talking about corporate espionage
448368 from there it just progressed all of a sudden we were knee deep in what was expected of us when martial law is declared we were expected to share all our resources but in return wed be given specific benefits
448369 then they said when not if martial law is declared it was our responsibility to protect our portion of the infrastructure and if we had to use deadly force to protect it we couldnt be prosecuted
448370 i have nothing to gain by telling you this and everything to lose
448371 im so nervous about this and im not someone who gets nervous
448372 i have never heard of infragard members being told to use lethal force anywhere
448373 if you want to quote a businessperson saying that knock yourself out if thats what you want to print fine
448374 there have been discussions like that that ive heard of and participated in
448375 strategic planning business continuity planning and disaster recovery physical and it security policy development internal control personnel selection and travel safety
448376 its the only true organization where there is the public private partnership
448377 its all who knows who you know a face you trust a face thats what makes it work
448378 that much i cannot comment on but as a private citizen you have the right to use force if you feel threatened

448456 i think the subject which will be of most importance politically is mass psychology its importance has been enormously increased by the growth of modern methods of propaganda of these the most influential is what is called education religion plays a part though a diminishing one the press the cinema and the radio play an increasing part it may be hoped that in time anybody will be able to persuade anybody of anything if he can catch the patient young and is provided by the state with money and equipment
448457 although this science will be diligently studied it will be rigidly confined to the governing class the populace will not be allowed to know how its convictions were generated when the technique has been perfected every government that has been in charge of education for a generation will be able to control its subjects securely without the need of armies or policemen
448458 scientific societies are as yet in their infancy it is to be expected that advances in physiology and psychology will give governments much more control over individual mentality than they now have even in totalitarian countries fitche laid it down that education should aim at destroying free will so that after pupils have left school they shall be incapable throughout the rest of their lives of thinking or acting otherwise than as their schoolmasters would have wished
448459 diet injections and injunctions will combine from a very early age to produce the sort of character and the sort of beliefs that the authorities consider desirable and any serious criticism of the powers that be will become psychologically impossible
448460 gradually by selective breeding the congenital differences between rulers and ruled will increase until they become almost different species a revolt of the plebs would become as unthinkable as an organized insurrection of sheep against the practice of eating mutton
448461 in like manner the scientific rulers will provide one kind of education for ordinary men and women and another for those who are to become holders of scientific power ordinary men and women will be expected to be docile industrious punctual thoughtless and contented of these qualities probably contentment will be considered the most important in order to produce it all the researches of psycho analysis behaviourism and biochemistry will be brought into play all the boys and girls will learn from an early age to be what is called co operative i e to do exactly what everybody is doing initiative will be discouraged in these children and insubordination without being punished will be scientifically trained out of them
448462 except for the one matter of loyalty to the world state and to their own order members of the governing class will be encouraged to be adventurous and full of initiative
448463 on those rare occasions when a boy or girl who has passed the age at which it is usual to determine social status shows such marked ability as to seem the intellectual equal of the rulers a difficult situation will arise requiring serious consideration if the youth is content to abandon his previous associates and to throw in his lot whole heartedly with the rulers he may after suitable tests be promoted but if he shows any regrettable solidarity with his previous associates the rulers will reluctantly conclude that there is nothing to be done with him except to send him to the lethal chamber before his ill disciplined intelligence has had time to spread revolt this will be a painful duty to the rulers but i think they will not shrink from performing it

448475 on monday july 21st apple chief financial officer peter oppenheimer dropped a bomb on those listening to apples quarterly conference call on earnings for wall street analysts
448476 heres what i think apple is about to do i reported more than a year ago and repeated in this years predictions that apple would be adding h 264 hardware support to its entire line of computers the chip they are adding comes from ntt in japan and was developed in cooperation with japanese broadcaster nhk the chips began sampling a year ago and should now be available in volume though apple may be paying as much as 50 each for early production
448477 the ntt chip is not just an h 264 decoder it encodes too which is what makes it so special the last i heard nhk was claiming the chip could compress a 1080p video and audio stream into four megabits per second down from the 20 megabits normally required if we assume apple will apply the same kind of wink wink nudge nudge transcoding to 1080p that theyve already applied to 720p in the apple tv then it is within reason to expect theyll claim to distribute 1080p over itunes in two megabits per second
448478 this is all about taking command of the 1080p video market apples strategy with itunes will continue to evolve but for the moment having a unique real time 1080p capability will suck a lot of early adopters back into the apple stores and give apples emerging content competitors like netflix something new to worry about

448603 in one sense all discounts for pleas of guilty could be said to subject the defendant to pressure and the greater the discount the greater the pressure
448604 but the discount would have to be very substantially more generous than anything promised here before it constituted unlawful pressure such as to vitiate the process okay i except that part at least the disparity between sentences would need to be a good deal higher for any calls that the plea bargain offered here to be viewed as something less than fanciful but does he really deserve to be extradited well according to the pc pro blog lets get this straight gazza did it theres no second gunman lurking he wasnt framed by the mob nobody forced threatened or otherwise made him hack into us military computers he was bored and decided to peek up americas skirt 97 times happily though gazza the cheeky little scamp he is decided that merely hacking into their machines wasnt enough and also left mocking little messages critiquing us foreign policy which is a bit like kicking a big angry bear in the bottom and then sticking your head in its mouth when it doesnt immediately bite your foot off and if you were left in any doubt as to their feelings on mckinnon gary mckinnon is going to be extradited and deserves it this battle shouldnt be fought over mckinnon he doesnt deserve the attention but my sense is that sooner or later somebody will come along who does and then hopefully all these headlines will be justified

448739 dealing with other people burdens will not repair yours do you think it will make yours go away no you must deal with your own anger but not with hurting those who hurt you
448740 no no no never happened stop thinking it erase and start over
448741 i dont need a man but i need to make sure theyre looking at me when i go out
448742 ive issued a written apology ive stated publicly a number of times that i was sorry to the extent that my newsletter offended anyone on staten island
448743 it wasnt intended to it was genuinely meant to be a humorous article
448744 i dont know how many staten islanders know about snug harbor the snug harbor cultural center but its phenomenal
448745 and certainly its not the aspects of staten island that new jersey residents necessarily think of and i hope that today will open up everyones eyes to some of the treasures that you have here in staten island
448746 we feel his apology was more about apologizing for making us mad and not apologizing for his actual statements and thats kind of like a half hearted apology
448747 people down at the jersey shore people from belmar theyre not just from staten island
448748 theres people from all areas theres people there who do act the wrong way but theyre not only from staten island
448749 yes i accept his apology and hopefully he wont be speaking negatively about staten islanders again
448750 i have said in the past and ill repeat again that the best reparations we can provide are good schools in the inner city and jobs for people who are unemployed
448751 lets not be naive sen obama is running for president of the united states and so he is in a constant battle to save his political life
448752 in light of the demographics of this country i dont think its realistic to expect him to do anything other than what hes done
448753 what steps should we take as a nation to alleviate the effects of racial exclusion and racial discrimination
448754 i fear that reparations would be an excuse for some to say weve paid our debt and to avoid the much harder work
448755 if we have a program for example of universal health care that will disproportionately affect people of color because theyre disproportionately uninsured
448756 if weve got an agenda that says every child in america should get should be able to go to college regardless of income that will disproportionately affect people of color because its oftentimes our children who cant afford to go to college
448757 arent following the rules of the road they put us all at risk

448760 in europa ci sono prezzi impossibili quindi anche giusto fare un mix tra campioni del calibro di ronaldinho e giovani promesse come cardaccio e viudez questultimo ha dato risultati eccezionali nelle visite di milan lab cardaccio avvantaggiato dal fatto di possedere il passaporto italiano ringrazio molto fonseca che ha contribuito al successo delloperazione
448761 kak rimarr al milan i giocatori sotto contratto non se ne vanno n dal milan n dal chelsea inutile destabilizzarli
448762 sono contento di ci che stanno facendo con la nazionale olimpica ma si devono confermare con squadre pi forti senza nulla togliere a vietnam e singapore
448763 sicuramente un aspetto importante e un grande stimolo per il presidente berlusconi ronaldinho ha portato grande entusiasmo abbiamo fatto oltre 20 000 abbonati in pi dal suo arrivo siamo arrivati a 33 000 abbiamo fatto pi abbonamenti rispetto a quelli fatti dopo la vittoria della champions league in pi ronnie ha portato nuovi stimoli anche ai suoi compagni di squadra
448764 siamo molto felici dellacquisto di flamini siamo entusiasti stato un grandissimo colpo perch molti club lo volevano stata una trattativa difficile anche se lacquisto poi stato poco reclamizzato come avvenuto anche per zambrotta
448765 abbiati ottimo lho visto molto bene anche contro il siviglia kalac giocher con il chelsea dida giocher invece contro il manchester city e poi sar tempo di decidere

448777 never let anybody guess that you have a mind of your own
448778 in now way do i think john mccain s campaign was being racist
448779 i think theyre cynical i think they want to distract people about the real issues
448780 i dont think its accurate to say that my comments have nothing to do with race
448781 heres what i was saying that i dont come out of central casting when it comes to presidential races for a whole range of reasons im young im new to the national scene my name is barack obama i am african american i was born in hawaii i spent time in indonesia
448782 i think that what has been an approach from the mccain campaign is to say hes risky to try to divert focus from the fact that they dont have any new ideas
448783 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
448784 neste momento eu sinto medo e tenho s rias raz es pra isso
448785 o que o f bio gosta de comer em casa al m de voc
448786 why should i have a blog and what does this have to do with me
448787 the lesson really is that in considering a case of this complexity the police and those responsible for the prosecution need to keep an open mind as far as possible as to who might be responsible
448788 i think they did close their minds after the arrest of barry george yes there was a feeling that he was somebody who filled the likely description of who might be a suspect for such a case all these cases that attract widespread publicity put huge pressure on the police and the prosecuting authorities to try to find the perpetrator and i sometimes feel that pressure distorts the objectivity that would otherwise be present it seems to be abandoned
448789 an awful lot of work by many dedicated and experienced officers went into presenting this case its to be expected that people connected with george are now coming out to attack the police
448790 we are disappointed by todays verdict but especially disappointed for jills family and friends however we respect the decision of the court
448791 the investigation into her murder was complex thorough and professional with more than 2 500 statements taken and 3 700 exhibits recovered i would like to thank the members of the public who came forward following the murder to give us information in particular those who gave evidence in court
448792 i think he would be like a fish out of water in ireland i think hell stay in london but he wont go back to fulham he wont want to go back there after everything that has happened
448793 at the moment barry isnt angry hes just happy to be out
448794 i have been searching for this so long and glad you posted i have been browsing through your blog and find it interesting keep up the good work
448795 i f youre looking for the right word to sum up mccains week try one of these desperate dishonorable outright lies off the mark nasty the gutter baloney or baseless
448796 mccain may be proud of his shameful campaign tactics but the voters expect and deserve better
448797 o ur time our energy should be spent in educating agitating organizing our fellow citizens in the workplace in the neighborhood in the schools our objective should be to build painstakingly patiently but energetically a movement that when it reaches a certain critical mass would shake whoever is in the white house in congress into changing national policy on matters of war and social justice
448798 true religion will not let us fall asleep in the comfort of our freedom love thy neighbor is not a piece of advice its a command god my friends is with the poor and god is with us if we are with them this is not a burden this is an adventure

448803 allah and his angels send blessings on the prophet o ye that believe send ye blessings on him and salute him with all respect
448804 o people lend me an attentive ear for i know not whether after this year i shall ever be amongst you again therefore listen to what i am saying to you very carefully and take these words to those who could not be present here today o people just as you regard this month this day this city as sacred so regard the life and property of every muslim as a sacred trust return the goods entrusted to you to their rightful owners hurt no one so that no one may hurt you remember that you will indeed meet your lord and that he will indeed reckon your deeds god has forbidden you to take usury interest therefore all interest obligation shall henceforth be waived your capital however is yours to keep you will neither inflict nor suffer any inequity god has judged that there shall be no interest and that all the interest due to abbas ibn abdal muttalib shall henceforth be waived beware of satan for the safety of your religion he has lost all hope that he will ever be able to lead you astray in big things so beware of following him in small things o people it is true that you have certain rights with regard to your women but they also have rights over you remember that you have taken them as your wives only under a trust from god and with his permission if they abide by your right then to them belongs the right to be fed and clothed in kindness do treat your women well and be kind to them for they are your partners and committed helpers and it is your right that they do not make friends with any one of whom you do not approve as well as never to be unchaste o people listen to me in earnest worship god say your five daily prayers fast during the month of ramadan and give your wealth in zakat perform hajj if you have the means all mankind is from adam and eve an arab has no superiority over a non arab nor does a non arab have any superiority over an arab white has no superiority over black nor does a black have any superiority over white none have superiority over another except by piety and good action learn that every muslim is a brother to every muslim and that the muslims constitute one brotherhood nothing shall be legitimate to a muslim which belongs to a fellow muslim unless it was given freely and willingly do not therefore do injustice to yourselves remember one day you will appear before god and answer for your deeds so beware do not stray from the path of righteousness after i am gone o people no prophet or apostle will come after me and no new faith will be born reason well therefore o people and understand words which i convey to you i leave behind me two things the quran and my example the sunnah and if you follow these you will never go astray all those who listen to me shall pass on my words to others and those to others again and it may be that the last ones understand my words better than those who listen to me directly be my witness o god that i have conveyed your message to your people
448805 this day have i perfected your religion for you completed my grace upon you and have chosen islam for you as your religion
448806 i was a prophet when adam was between water and clay
448807 do men think that they will be left alone on saying
448808 thus have we made of you an ummah justly balanced
448809 allah does not change a peoples condition unless they change what is in their hearts but when once allah wills a peoples punishment there can be no turning it back nor will they find besides him any to protect

448813 i think the fbi owes us a complete accounting of their investigation and ought to be able to tell us at some point how were going to bring this to closure

448819 weve got too many players hurt right now to really compete
448820 we require that different media have the fullest access possible to report on the olympic games and im adamant in saying there has been no deal whatsoever to accept restrictions our requirements are the same from host city to host city and remain unchanged since the ioc entered into a host city contract with beijing in 2001
448821 im not going to make an apology for something that the ioc is not responsible for
448822 we are not running the internet in china the chinese authorities are running the internet
448823 foreign media will be able to report freely and publish their work freely in china there will be no censorship on the internet
448824 again i think we are trying to hang on every single word often spoken by people whose mother tongue isnt english let me be clear again the ioc would like to see open access for the media to be able to do their job
448825 we will give the media complete freedom to report when they come to china
448826 i guess there will be some debate as we move toward the games if there are sites that may or may not be open
448827 and the line between what could be considered as a national interest issue might be a bit blurred but well work on it and we will deal with any potential grievances
448828 we are continuing to work to have the organizers deliver what has been pledged what has been outlined

448831 in case of my election i will defend azerbaijans national interests and work to strengthen the state
448832 the majority of the party supports boycotting the elections and i support it as well
448833 unfortunately we have no basis to believe that the upcoming election will be free and fair according to international standards
448834 we have not seen any election since 1993 that was democratic they have always been falsified this year i think the situation will be even worse
448835 giving the next administration the tools it will need to start putting public health and especially the health of our children first
448836 it was a very good week for the american public
448837 its stunning democrats would claim to have a great week after failing to vote on let alone pass an energy plan on the no 1 issue facing most americans gas prices the democrats in congress have failed to deliver any relief
448838 the safety commission failed to protect children against dangerous levels of lead in toys and it did nothing to stop the use of dangerous chemicals in plastic toys

448864 i tell you that virtue is not given by money but that from virtue comes money
448865 its a shame i didnt manage to get the best out of the car in q3 mainly because of traffic especially on my second run in the first two parts of qualifying the car felt good as can be seen from my times but then i never managed to prepare the tyres in the best way clearly overtaking isnt easy but we have a good pace and i will try and exploit that in fighting with the two drivers ahead of me on the grid
448866 i made a mistake on my final flying lap which cost me precious time and that followed on from not having got a great lap on my previous attempt which explains why im sixth of course i am not happy and starting from the third row my race will be an uphill struggle i will try and make the most of this situation given that the car today was not that bad we are going through a bit of a difficult time but we mustnt give up all we need to do is put together all the pieces of the jigsaw and then the results will come to us again

448879 im totally disappointed it looked quite good at the end of yesterdays practice and also this morning
448880 but on my last lap in q1 i had four cars in my way most of them at least tried to give me room but it still cost me time
448881 towards the end of the lap i had one car in front which was on an out lap he saw me and accelerated he then overtook sebastien bourdais before the last corner and then sebastien was right in my way
448882 it has been so far a pretty decent weekend and the team have done a great job in improving the car again even from the last race
448883 the pace of our car is great and it is a great day to have me and heikki 1 2
448884 it is about time we did that for the team and weve both done a great job it is very satisfying we were quick in testing yesterday q2 looked a bit close but it was tyre dependent and we made the right choice at the end so i am very happy
448885 you can never be too comfortable for sure but i feel safe to be in the position i am in
448886 we have speed to push on and challenge for the win tomorrow is another day and ill make sure i do the preparations tonight and tomorrow morning

448889 yang dibangun adalah perbaikan jalur darat yang mengarah ke bandara internasional minangkabau dan pelabuhan teluk bayur dari daerah tetangga agar transportasi angkutan barang dan orang melalui darat lancar sehingga komoditas ekspor dari daerah tetangga lebih mudah melalui padang
448890 proyek ini ditargetkan selesai 2009 sebagian di antaranya sudah ada yang ditender selain dana apbn juga ditambah dana pendamping dari apbd sumatra barat sebesar rp232 miliar
448891 yang masih kita tunggu kepastiannya adalah pelebaran jalan padang by pass jika ini sudah pasti dan pembangunannya selesai seluruh infrastruktur penunjang padang sebagai pintu gerbang perekonomian pulau sumatra bagian barat akan tuntas
448892 sebenarnya guru mendesak untuk diadakan sertifikasi karena guru yang sudah disertifikasi mendapat tunjangan profesi sebesar tunjangan pokoknya namun program ini disesuaikan dengan kemampuan keuangan pemerintah
448893 dalam 15 tahun kita membutuhkan dana rp57 triliun untuk tunjangan guru yang lulus sertifikasi ini perhitungan flat tanpa menghitung kenaikan gaji jelas itu anggaran terbesar apbn untuk pendidikan selama ini
448894 dana sebelumnya rp821 miliar menjadi besar karena pemerintah provinsi sumatra barat juga mengusulkan pembangunan kantor gubernur baru sebesar rp311 miliar karena kantor gubernur sekarang rusak akibat gempa 6 maret dan gempa 12 september
448895 ditargetkan 2008 pemulihan rumah sudah selesai sedangkan prasarana publik dan pemulihan ekonomi selesai 2009
448896 sumatra barat memiliki potensi yang mendukung rehabilitasi dan rekonstruksi pasca gempa seperti kearifan lokal bergotong royong organisasi nonformal lembaga adat dan agama potensi pemimpin nonformal ninik mamak dan cerdik pandai serta potensi perantau ini perlu dilibatkan dalam pembangunan kembali pasca gempa
448897 i used tears in my design because working women from all over the world may be so pressurised that they want to cry so ive included their tears in my design to represent the suppression of their emotions
448898 im inspired by how women rise against the odds in a male dominated society likewise in a strict country people can also rise against the odds and emerge as winners
448899 creo que si gano este partido ser n mero uno si gano ma ana la pasada madrugada ser el n mero uno en dos semanas as que no importa si caigo en la primera ronda de los juegos y roger gana no este duelo ser muy importante
448900 s que estoy en una buena posici n y no s lo porque roger tenga que ganar todo a partir de aqu los juegos ol mpicos y el us open
448901 probablemente no he jugado mi mejor partido tengo que mejorar mis movimientos si quiero jugar mejor pero estoy contento porque es importante ganar en estos momentos es muy importante ganar cuando no haces tu mejor tenis y ha sido un partido importante por la situaci n

448904 we are also thinking of sending two teams but we still dont know as so far we have not seen the details
448905 they nazir and rana are no longer eligible to play for stallions so there is no real problem stallions will only field players who have no connections with the icl
448906 no i have seen no such letter so i dont know anything about it at the moment
448907 probably indians are slightly in front getting those two wickets of sachin tendulkar and rahul dravid were very crucial for us to keep them back for a while just need to keep them to a decent score that we can chase it down on the fourth or fifth day
448908 ideally if we had got a lead it would have been brilliant but i thought harbhajan bowled very well the previous day to pick up thilan samaraveera and tillakaratne dilshan that put us on the back foot
448909 our target was to try and get to the indian total which we fell short but they got a good start again and we managed to pull them back which is good if we can get a couple of wickets early on sunday that will put the pressure on indians
448910 it is turning but still you need to bowl at good areas and create opportunities i think that is an important thing
448911 the first day ajantha turned the ball and so did murali harbhajan turned it on the second day still you need to put the ball in the right areas if you are really determined you can survive and then get into a rhythm and it is quite easy to score runs as well
448912 they india were batting cautiously and were attacking at different time with murali we tried to get wickets early because of that probably he gave away a few loose ones
448913 i am not that worried when you have a top spinner like him the batsmen tend to fall back cautiously murali will come back to the party
448914 we will get 400 or if it is 500 we will get that is the attitude we have got there is nothing difficult for us
448915 they have not given us a certain time they have said that certainly we cannot ask from our camp in the dressing room after a replay and that it has to be done fairly quickly like whether it will be 10 seconds 15 seconds 20 seconds or 25 seconds
448916 with the lbw the umpire is the one who is making the decision so i wanted to know whether he has made the obvious mistake or not if it is caught behind or a bad pad or something then i can ask the guys around or the wicket keeper or whatever
448917 the field umpire thought that it stuck outside the off stump and he gave a reason that is when i made up my mind to go for it seeking referral on dravids decision
448918 our vision is to become the leading provider of keynote speakers business leaders trainers and entertainers in austria

448988 19 there was a rich man who was clothed in purple and fine linen and who feasted sumptuously every day 20 and at his gate was laid a poor man named lazarus covered with sores 21 who desired to be fed with what fell from the rich mans table moreover even the dogs came and licked his sores 22 the poor man died and was carried by the angels to abrahams side the rich man also died and was buried 23 and in hades being in torment he lifted up his eyes and saw abraham far off and lazarus at his side 24 and he called out father abraham have mercy on me and send lazarus to dip the end of his finger in water and cool my tongue for i am in anguish in this flame 25 but abraham said child remember that you in your lifetime received your good things and lazarus in like manner bad things but now he is comforted here and you are in anguish 26 and besides all this between us and you a great chasm has been fixed in order that those who would pass from here to you may not be able and none may cross from there to us 27 and he said then i beg you father to send him to my fathers house 28 for i have five brothers so that he may warn them lest they also come into this place of torment 29 but abraham said they have moses and the prophets let them hear them 30 and he said no father abraham but if someone goes to them from the dead they will repent 31 he said to him if they do not hear moses and the prophets neither will they be convinced if someone should rise from the dead

449019 mr buxton should not have to wait for his state sentence just because the district attorney cannot make a decision
449020 the judge declined ehrlichs request noting that under a plea deal with prosecutors buxton needed to pass the polygraph examination and to testify in any prosecution that may result from the investigation of shutters allegations
449021 i know youre disappointed but i think that the people have a reasonable period of time to decide how theyre going to proceed

449042 everything is not just fair in love and war its fabulous jodhaa akbar review
449043 aamir is staying true to his reputation of being a perfectionist aamir is currently very busy giving final touches to tzps dvd he is adding in a whole host of different extras which include commentaries and the detailed making of the film this is what the actor is also busy shooting for and thats why he hasnt been able to give time to his next release
449044 aamir was to shoot for the film by the end of january but had asked the producers of the film some time off for tzp they kept waiting for over two months and now aamir has finally given them dates
449045 it has become a trend of sorts nowadays that big film producers are using arm twisting tactics to squeeze in as much revenue they can from multiplexes in the first two weeks jodhaa akbar is 2008s first big release by all means they are asking for a revenue share of 50 45 for the first week whereas multiplexes are keen on a 48 40 settlement jodhaa akbar is being released by united motion pictures ump and is their first release for this year it has ambitious plans to release jodhaa akbar with as many as 1500 prints across 26 countries
449046 we do not wish to compromise on lower terms for a project as gigantic as this it is double standards by multiplexes as i am sure they shall soon be seen agreeing to yash raj when their biggie tashan is about to release what we are demanding is a fair price for a project of this proportion
449047 i am confident the multiplexes will agree to our terms as there is no big release for at least a month ahead
449048 we havent yet agreed to their demands as we feel they are quite high i am not sure as of now whether we shall give in to them or not

449055 u s sen barack obama said today he would be willing to open floridas coast for more oil drilling if it meant winning approval for broad energy changes my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices obama said in an interview with the palm beach post if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done obama said

449100 rabbi we know you are a teacher who has come from god for no one could perform the miraculous signs you are doing if god were not with him
449101 i tell you the truth no one can see the kingdom of god unless he is born again
449102 how can a man be born when he is old
449103 surely he cannot enter a second time into his mothers womb to be born
449104 i tell you the truth no one can enter the kingdom of god unless he is born of water and the spirit flesh gives birth to flesh but the spirit gives birth to spirit you should not be surprised at my saying you must be born again the wind blows wherever it pleases you hear its sound but you cannot tell where it comes from or where it is going so it is with everyone born of the spirit
449105 for you have been born again not of perishable seed but of imperishable through the living and enduring word of god
449106 i tell you the truth among those born of women

449109 is this hear o israel the love the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength the second is this love your neighbor as yourself there is no commandment greater than these
449110 you are right in saying that god is one and there is no other but him to love him with all your heart with all your understanding and with all your strength and to love your neighbor as yourself is more important than all burnt offerings and sacrifices

449122 the iniquity of the house of israel and judah is very very great and the land is filled with blood and the city is full of perversion for they say the lord has forsaken the land and the lord does not see

449136 cdcs first estimates from this system reveal that the hiv epidemic is and has been worse than previously known results indicate that approximately 56 300 new hiv infections occurred in the united states in 2006
449137 this figure is roughly 40 percent higher than cdcs former estimate of 40 000 infections per year which was based on limited data and less precise methods
449138 the data really confirm that there is a severe impact of this epidemic among gay and bisexual men in the united states as well as black men and women
449139 it also mirrors what we see about sexually transmitted diseases and changes in risk behavior among men who have sex with men
449140 the reality is that it is a wake up call for all of us
449141 there are things that you and i can do to stop the disease encourage others to use condoms consistently and correctly abstain from sex
449142 it is important to note that the new estimate does not represent an actual increase in the annual number of new hiv infections
449143 in fact cdcs analysis suggests that the epidemic has been roughly stable since the late 1990s though the number of new hiv infections remains unacceptably high
449144 the analysis shows that new infections peaked in the mid 1980s at approximately 130 000 infections per year and reached a low of about 50 000 in the early 1990s

449192 im happy to have qualified in p12 today after a good lap on the final run in q2 pushed me a few places up the grid weve definitely made some progress with the new developments to the car and in particular the new rear suspension is working well and this has enabled us to improve the car step by step over the weekend i got the most out of the car today and its encouraging to see we were only three tenths away from the top ten as it has been a while since we were that close im on the dirty side of the grid which is a disadvantage but i am sure we can have a good race tomorrow from here nonetheless
449193 choosing which tyre to run was a really tough decision today and it was a difficult qualifying session i felt the supersoft option tyre was working slightly better with the car so i stayed with that for my final run after a good first sector i went in too quick for turn 11 and made a mistake which ruined my lap with that went the chance to progress to q2 and the time from my previous run puts me in 18th place on the grid the lap was going quite well but a mistake at turn 11 meant that i had to abort the lap i have to settle for 18th place today and turn my focus now to the race
449194 p12 is where we hoped to be today so yes we have moved a little closer to the middle order again the new mechanical developments have brought us improved stability and that has enabled us to achieve a better balance on the car this weekend due credit to jenson as he delivered a particularly good lap when it counted and we have reason to feel optimistic about tomorrows race

449234 i think he meant something really radical i think he was talking about loving as god loves loving completely loving with a whole self he told his disciples to give everything they had everything they were to hold nothing back not money not time not even life itself everything was to be given over in the service of love
449235 lets say i decided to become a devoted follower of jesus christ
449236 and i die and because im a christian i get to go to heaven instead of hell
449237 if i really take jesus seriously if i really am willing to give up everything i am and everything i have in the service of love if i really am a christian it seems to me i would have to give up my place in heaven to someone else someone who otherwise wouldnt get to go
449238 id have to go to hell so this other person could be in heaven right mom

449242 for them to think they can address the social and emotional issues of a child without being in the same room as that child is ludicrous
449243 you can only adequately address these issues in a classroom where you have necessary peer support and peer interaction
449244 attorney general buddy caldwells opinion to the rapides parish police jury on tax rebates highlights a potential conflict every time some business or industry is contemplating locating here the opinion would appear to be sound the police jury cannot give tax breaks to prospective new employers or to existing employers who want to expand as an incentive to create new jobs if the tax revenue belongs to some other political entity but the opinion also exposes a paradox tax incentives that create more jobs generate more taxes from the new workers employed as a result of the incentives
449245 every year tax incentives were given the school board received more sales tax income than in the previous year

449259 wir m ssen uns entscheiden entweder wir bauen hocheffiziente kohle und erdgaskraftwerke oder wir m ssen die atommeiler l nger laufen lassen
449260 die vorhandenen und geplanten europ ischen kraftwerke reichen schon ab 2015 nicht mehr aus um eine verst rkte nachfrage aus deutschland zu decken

449290 now that the secretary general of the united nations mr kofi annan has sealed the deal made between the presidents of nigeria cameroon and the companies exploring oil over the blood of the bakassi people the die is cast therefore bamosd now declares as follows
449291 that our peaceful social economic historical and ancestral ties with the rest of the people of the niger delta leave us not only with no other frontier but with no other option than to join forces with the valiant and heroic freedom fighters of the niger delta
449292 that bamosd by this declaration is subsuming all its activities on the bakassi peninsula into the larger war of liberation of the nigeria delta under the joint leadership of the movement for the emancipation of the niger delta mend and other joints commands for the protection defence and security of its people and resources
449293 as major stakeholders in the area we have a joint responsibility to ensure that we take a leading role in the establishment of structures and a force to safeguard our people and resources towards a collective security of the gulf of guinea

449299 von michael w hrer ein blog der mich mit jeden neuen beitrag neu in seinen bann zog dich seit geraumer zeit ist es leider aus mit den wertvollen tips rund um programme und helferlein f r windows amp co nach dem letzten beitrag im februar mussten wir auf diese perle verzichten
449300 we have been working all summer lifting conditioning and watching film
449301 when i see something that i think bates is doing wrong i tell him
449302 he does the same for me we have been watching a lot of film together and help each other when either of us notices something
449303 when i moved to tucson in 1993 from russia my christmas spirit was broken by the swimsuit clad neighbors walking to the pool right by my newly decorated tree eventually i learned to cope by gluing paper snowflakes on windows and mirrors
449304 im a conservative whos open minded on taxes and a republican who isnt afraid to vote for a democrat e g i voted to re elect gov janet napolitano

449315 that man has no respect for his rover and beats
449316 awal mulanya pak bupati sumba timur mengeluh sakit perut sehingga kami mengira beliau masuk angin ada sejumlah pekerja di rumah jabatan bupati sempat memijat di bagian perutnya setelah dipijat badannya malah tambah lemas sehingga langsung dilarikan ke sebuah klinik
449317 tim dokter sudah berusaha memberikan pertolongan melalui bantuan alat pernafasan tetapi tuhan menghendaki lain ia pergi meninggal dunia begitu mendadak sehingga membuat kami semua kebingungan
449318 itu fenomena dan dikhawatirkan bisa memicu keinginan anggota legislatif melakukan penyelewengan seperti menerima suap dari pihak pihak yang berkepentingan atas keputusan dpr misalnya terutama terkait dengan undang undang maupun peraturan lainnya
449319 biaya tersebut tentunya sebagian besar dari kantong pribadi jadi ibaratnya orang berdagang karena sudah keluar modal maka modal harus kembali atau syukur memperoleh keuntungan
449320 caleg yang butuh dukungan harus mengeluarkan biaya besar sepertinya juga sudah membudaya dan sulit dihapus
449321 saat ini memang sudah ada parpol yang menerapkan kebijakan memotong gaji anggota legislatif untuk kepentingan parpol dan konstituennya
449322 jika moralnya baik tentu tidak akan tergoda dengan penyuapan sehingga benar benar melaksanakan tugas sebagai anggota dewan secara bersih
449323 tersangka dtp ditangkap dengan cara dipancing untuk bertemu di rumah teman korban susila di jalan cibaduyut no 3 kecamatan bojongloa kidul kota bandung jumat 1 8 malam
449324 korban mengikuti saran dtp namun tetap uang tersebut tidak berubah karena merasa tertipu dan uang sudah diberikan kepada dtp korban akhirnya melaporkan hal itu ke polisi kita terima laporan itu dan langsung menindaklanjutinya
449325 jadi para petinju yang akan bertanding di india adalah yang memiliki prestasi di tingkat nasional
449326 ini adalah suatu penghargaan yang cukup besar diberikan pb pertina kepada pengprov pertina sumut
449327 kemudian jika ada pihak lain menyebarkan dan mendengarkan rekaman tersebut tanpa didampingi tenaga ahli dapat menyesatkan publik
449328 setidaknya analisa hanya dapat dilakukan jika ada pasangan rekaman black box kedua yakni rekaman tentang tingkah laku pesawat terbang pada 30 menit terakhir
449329 saya minta dengan segala hormat agar rekaman itu tidak disebarluaskan mari kita hormati krebilitas knkt laporan lengkap yang komprehensif dan baik dapat dibaca di website www dephub go id knkt
449330 jika pun benar rekaman itu maka ini sudah kriminal cyber criminal dan sesuai ketentuan icao annex 13 memang tidak untuk konsumsi publik kami berharap ini bisa ditindaklanjuti oleh penegak hukum
449331 indonesiakan meratifikasi icao jadi ini kebocoran red tanggung jawab bersama karena itu semua ratifikasi atas nama negara
449332 barang bukti kini sudah kami amankan seperti satu unit motor batu besar dan kecil yang digunakan membunuh korban dan pakaian baik korban maupun tersangka
449333 kamu kan bilang mau bikin rumah tapi kenapa kamu pulang membawa rumah kamu sendiri
449334 jenazah ariel dimakamkam satu liang dengan makam ayahnya alm albert p sitanggang yang telah meninggal sejak tahun 2002
449335 saya juga bingung biasanya ariel tidak percaya begitu saja kepada orang yang baru dikenal ia orangnya kritis dan tidak mudah percaya kemungkinan dia dihipnotis agar mau ikut ryan
449336 motifnya memang keinginan seketika untuk menguasai barang barang milik korban tapi ryan tak selalu lancar mewujudkan keinginan seketika itu
449337 ada tiga korban yang sempat berantem dengan ryan yaitu vincentius yudi priono wonogiri jateng guruh setio pramono nganjuk jatim dan seseorang yang disebutnya graddy marga tambunan manado
449338 ada yang bertemu di surabaya ada yang di jombang hanya satu yang tak dikenal yakni satu korban yang ryan sendiri tidak hafal namanya yakni korban yang diduga dibunuh pertama kali pada 2006
449339 mereka umumnya mudah dirayu ryan karena ada rasa cinta termasuk ada juga korban wanita yang mencintainya
449340 kalau tanda tanda psikotis gangguan jiwa yang berat tak ada tapi kalau psikopat minimnya empati dan kontrol perilaku memang ya karena perilakunya impulsif
449341 artinya tersangka membunuh dengan sadar dan paham akibatnya dia tahu mana yang benar dan mana yang salah
449342 saat diperiksa penyidik tersangka juga mempunyai keinginan kelihatan nggak normal agar terbebas dari jerat hukum itu biasa karena itu kami melakukan pemeriksaan kejiwaan dan ternyata tak ada gangguan kejiwaan yang berat
449343 dalam hubungan homoseksualitas itu tersangka lebih menyukai peran sebagai perempuan tapi kelainan seksual itu nggak ada kaitan dengan kejiwaan karena mereka yang bukan homo juga dapat mengalami gejala kejiwaan
449344 hasilnya orangtua ryan juga normal dari sisi kejiwaan tapi ibunya mempunyai sifat yang mirip dengan ryan yakni sensitif mudah tersinggung dan mudah marah bahkan di dalam rumah tangga ada dominasi ibu
449345 ryan merasa kurang mendapat perhatian ada ketidakcocokkan dengan kondisi ekonomi keluarga dan juga ada ketidakcocokkan dengan perilaku ibu ryan sering cekcok dengan orangtuanya sehingga dia menjadi impulsif dan ada rasa tak suka dengan perilaku ibu
449346 sejak kecil ryan sering mengalami kekerasan dari ibunya sehingga usia sekitar 13 tahun mengalami tekanan kejiwaan akibat memendam benci kepada ibunya
449347 if youre familiar with the story 70 of it happens in the office and its hard to find an advertising agency which would cater to the look that we wanted so why not construct a set na makukuha yung gusto nating look and hindi pa tayo pagbabawalan kung anong oras lang tayo pwedeng mag shoot
449348 i didnt back out i didnt really want to join beforehand i had told mr ben chan already that its my personal conviction not to join siguro kasi bench endorser ako kaya people expected me to be there but for the record hindi po talaga ako kasama sa show bago pa man naplano yun i have nothing against anyone or what the show is all about
449349 the conditions you were working in on tuesday were not good
449350 i am not going to make an apology for something that the ioc is not responsible for we are not running the internet in china
449351 fonte della verit dellopen source non pu installare un sistema operativo libero proprio in virt di quelle killer apps
449352 sento spesso gli utenti linux e mac os x che sostengono che lutilizzo di un firewall completamente inutile su questi sistemi lunica cosa che riesco a fare mettermi a ridere
449353 quindi chi sostiene che lutilizzo di un firewall su ubuntu inutile evidentemente non sa che il pacchetto iptables integrato nel kernel linux
449354 il problema per questo una falla di sicurezza di unapplicazione firefox safari windows media player ecc un conto una falla di sistema un altro
449355 hai forse letto da qualche parte sul mio blog la frase
449356 e poi quando c una falla ricordo di recente una falla ssl in debian che ha fatto molto rumore solitamente si impiegano poche ore per chiuderla a parte quella appena citata che ci hanno messo due anni a decommentare una riga di un codice ma io gli effetti di quella falla in un anno di ubuntu non li ho mai riscontrati
449357 se poi contiamo che circa l80 di chi usa windows naviga senza un antivirus la frittata fatta
449358 prendiamo in considerazione linux negli ultimi 3 mesi ci sono state 2 falle che permettevano una scalata dei privilegi nonostante questo non sono stati scritti malware che ne facevano uso ma solo codice dimostrativo
449359 ma lutilizzo dellavverbio praticamente prima dellaggettivo immune d un tono meno sententorio allaffermazione ti sfuggito nel quote
449360 parli di chiavi pgp io ho sempre sentito di chiavi gpg ma magari ti si sono solo invertite inavvertitamente le lettere
449361 ma la maggior parte delle persone pensa di saper usare un pc solo perch accede al pannello di controllo e queste stesse persone sono le prime a cliccare a vanvera un antivirus pu essere un buon surrogato alla loro mancata cautela
449362 prese in considerazione le conoscenze di utente medio con linux si ottiene un sistema sicuro mentre con windows si ottiene un sistema meno sicuro
449363 non riesco a concentrarmi per pi di due o tre pagine se insisto inizio a stare sulle spine perdo il filo e inizio a guardarmi intorno in cerca di qualcosaltro da fare
449364 we get four or five shots in a row assertions by mccain that i would rather lose a war so that i can win a campaign that i am not willing to visit the troops that i somehow am full of myself that im an empty headed celebrity whatever repeated attacks have been launched this week so when i say boy those are kind of silly arguments the press says isnt that being negative
449365 ich hatte gehofft dass das so offensichtlich war dass er daf r direkt eine strafe bekommen w rde und ich doch noch in q2 rutschen w rde
449366 eine gute fahrt in q2 brachte mich noch einmal ein paar pl tze nach vorn wir haben mit den weiterentwicklungen auf jeden fall einen fortschritt erzielt speziell die hinterradaufh ngung funktioniert gut so konnten wir das auto am wochenende schritt f r schritt verbessern
449367 ich habe das beste aus dem auto herausgeholt und es ist sch n zu sehen dass wir nur drei zehntelsekunden hinter den top 10 liegen
449368 es ist schon etwas her seit wir das letzte mal so dicht dran waren ich stehe auf der schmutzigen streckenseite am start das ist ein nahteil aber ich glaube dass wir dennoch ein gutes rennen haben k nnen
449369 die reifenwahl war heute wirklich schwierig und damit auch das qualifying
449370 ich hatte das gef hl dass die weichen etwas besser funktionieren w rden also blieb ich beim letzten versuch auf diesen pneus nach einem guten ersten sektor fuhr ich zu schnell in kurve 11 und machte einen fehler der meine runde ruinierte
449371 damit war auch die chance dahin es in q2 zu schaffe und meine zeit aus dem versuch davor brachte mich auf den 18 platz
449372 dabei lief die runde bis zum fehler in der elften kurve sehr gut aber dann musste ich abbrechen vom 18 rang aus muss ich nun auf das rennen schauen
449373 rang zw lf ist das was wir uns erhofft hatten
449374 die neuen mechanischen teile haben die stabilit t verbessert und uns eine bessere balance an diesem wochenende erm glicht jenson lieferte eine besonders gute runde ab wir k nnen optimistisch auf das rennen blicken
449375 es ist immer rgerlich wenn der kollege vor einem ist aber n chstes mal komme ich wieder zur ck
449376 ich h tte viel besser sein aber ich kam beim start nicht weg
449377 als ich die handbremse gel st habe ist nichts passiert wie schon in der t rkei das hat mich bestimmt vier sekunden gekostet wertvolle sekunden
449378 es ist sehr gut gelaufen ich habe wirklich mein bestes versucht es war zwar eine neue pr fung aber da mikko immer wieder an mich herankommt muss ich wirklich alles geben ich konnte meinen vorsprung zwar nicht wesentlich vergr ern aber alles ist gut ich habe volles vertrauen in mein auto
449379 ich bin ich jetzt voller selbstvertrauen das h tte gestern schon so sein sollen aber ist es gut f r n chstes jahr wenn ich in finnland wieder angreifen will
449380 dies war f r mich eine sehr gute qualifying einheit und ich bin nat rlich erleichtert
449381 wir fingen gestern im ersten training gut an das team leistete ber nacht gute arbeit und wir trafen in bezug auf das setup die richtige entscheidung
449382 schlussendlich blieben meine ingenieure gelassen und bekamen es richtig hin
449383 es war heute nicht einfach denn wir hatten eine sehr knappe reifen wahl wir mussten also f r jede runde eine knappe entscheidung f llen aber schlussendlich blieben meine ingenieure gelassen und bekamen es richtig hin
449384 im zweiten qualifying teil hat sich das auto perfekt angef hlt auf der allerletzten runde war es erneut etwas schwieriger zu fahren da sich die reifen nicht ganz gut verhielten aber ich bin ber den f nften rang gl cklich
449385 wir befinden uns f r morgen in einer gro artigen situation das ist f r uns alle gut und nach hockenheim ist es die perfekte antwort f r das vertrauen das ich in das gesamte team habe
449386 ich hatte im qualifying dieselben probleme wir m ssen dies also ber nacht untersuchen
449387 ich bin froh in den top 10 zu sein aber es war eine schwierige qualifying einheit und der neunte rang ist entt uschend
449388 seit diesem morgen habe ich mit der haftung und balance gek mpft und ungl cklicherweise waren wir nicht in der lage rechtzeitig antworten darauf zu finden ich hatte im qualifying dieselben probleme wir m ssen dies also ber nacht untersuchen
449389 ich bin f r timo gl cklich der dieses wochenende gute arbeit geleistet hat und es ist f r uns ganz klar wichtig so viele punkte wie m glich f r die konstrukteurswertung zu holen das berholen ist hier schwierig aber morgen gibt es ein sehr langes rennen und wir werden schauen was wir erreichen k nnen
449390 wir k mpften in allen einheiten um die top drei abgesehen von der allerletzten runde
449391 von der boxenmauer aus war dies eine sehr aufregende und zufriedenstellende qualifying stunde
449392 wir k mpften in allen einheiten um die top drei abgesehen von der allerletzten runde wir werden untersuchen was da passierte denn im vergleich zu den versuchen zuvor sind wir dort etwas hinter unserer leistung zur ckgeblieben dennoch gibt es keinen raum f r entt uschung
449393 timo holte sich seine bisher beste position in der startaufstellung und er war w hrend allen einheiten sehr stark wir m ssen einmal abwarten wie die benzin mengen morgen ausschauen aber als alle autos mit wenig benzin unterwegs waren war er konstant unter den top drei

449401 well i just wanted to take one for the road
449402 it really was quite morbid bella youre being very noir this evening
449403 well you know theres no telling how my sense of humor is going to be after this so i have to get all the sarcasm slash noir in before well you know
449404 definitely in london and in the uk the standards are more lenient and sort of risky advertising is expected i think you wouldnt see something like that from bmw in the u s
449405 the resistance is now stronger than before and this keeps the option of war awake if we were weak israel would not hesitate to start another war
449406 we are stronger than before and when hizbollah is strong our strength stops israel from starting a new war we dont seek war but we must be ready
449407 we are proud of our friendship with iran and with syria and every country which helps us to gain our rights
449408 all parties in lebanon are getting weapons no one asks from where
449409 i doubt that israel will attack iran because they know the consequences
449410 israel didnt achieve any of its goals the known goal of israel is death to hizbollah hizbollah is still here
449411 no better than pimps and those who advertise sexual services in phone boxes
449412 the authority considered that the execution had been carefully targeted and that its sexual nature was unlikely to offend the fashion conscious readership
449413 i think it is a great pity that the asa continues to give way to the advertising industry
449414 a lot of people who saw this advert thought it was indecent and im surprised the asa have not upheld these genuine complaints
449415 intended to be the ultimate ironic pun for a sexy brand in a logo led age
449416 polishing you can also elect to have the wheel polished to a shiny aluminium finish the preparation is much the same as shown here but the costs can be significantly higher especially on wheels with a complex design
449417 the next morning i was awakened by some noise down in the street outside my window it was the same delirious cacophony i had heard the day before when i first arrived in the northern border town and witnessed the passing of that unique parade but when i got up from my bed and went to the window i saw no sign of the uproarious procession then i noticed the house directly opposite the one in which i had spent the night one of the highest windows of that house across the street was fully open and slightly below the ledge of the window lying against the gray facade of the house was the body of a man hanging by his neck from a thick white rope the cord was stretched taut and led back through the window and into the house for some reason this sight did not seem in any way unexpected or out of place even as the noisy thrumming of the unseen parade grew increasingly louder and even when i recognized the figure of the hanged man who was extremely slight of build almost like a child in physical stature many years older than when i had last seen him his hair and beard now radiantly white clearly this was the body of my old physician dr zirk now i could see the parade approaching from the far end of the gray tunnel like street the clown creature strolled in its loose white garments its egg shaped head scanning the high houses on either side as the creature passed beneath my window it looked up at me for a moment with that same expression of bland malevolence and then passed on following this figure was the formation of ragged men harnessed by ropes to a cage like vehicle that rolled along on wooden wheels countless objects many more than i saw the previous day clattered against the bars of the cage the grotesque inventory now included bottles of pills that rattled with the contents inside them shining scalpels and instruments for cutting through bones needles and syringes strung together and hung like ornaments on a christmas tree and a stethoscope that had been looped about the decapitated dogs head the wooden stakes of the caged platform wobbled to the point of breaking with the additional weight of this cast off clutter because there was no roof covering this cage i could see down into it from my window but there was nothing inside at least for the moment as the vehicle passed directly below i looked across the street at the hanged man and the thick rope from which he dangled like a puppet from the shadows inside the open window of the house a hand appeared that was holding a polished steel straight razor the fingers of that hand were thick and wore many gaudy rings after the razor had worked at the cord for a few moments the body of dr zirk fell from the heights of the gray house and landed in the open vehicle just as it passed by the procession which was so lethargic in its every aspect now seemed to disappear quickly from view its muffled riot of sounds fading into the distance

449461 i heard a bit when warming up but thats all lets hope it diminishes the longer the season goes on
449462 a lot of things have been said and ive seen and read the negative things so i was pleasantly surprised that it wasnt that bad
449463 i could totally handle the reception at the start and when i did come off i was over the moon with the reception i got
449464 then again some folk were saying that maybe they were cheering the fact that i was being taken off
449465 but im an optimist so i am taking it that they were cheering a decent performance
449466 i can say hand on heart that not one person has come up to me on the streets and given me a negative reaction to coming back its all been good
449467 i knew there would be people who didnt want me back because it was only last year i was playing for celtic
449468 in the first case a 39 year old female taking 50mg a day of vitamin b6 for three months developed a feeling of burning pain and
449469 its about youre not on the list i was a naughty boy its always fascinated me that idea of finishing your life and then being analyzed on it and this idea runs throughout most religions thats why people blow up buildings because they think theyre going to get lots of virgins i always feel like saying just join a band laughs that is the most frightening thing you could possibly say to somebody eternal damnation i know about this stuff because i studied it i was into it all i know it its still mildly terrifying to me and this is serious

449478 mejorar en los entrenamientos para poder llegar bien a los partidos y que no me pase ning n delantero
449479 son tres equipos dif ciles aunque el primer partido siempre es el que m s cuesta
449480 el primer partido por la ansiedad y por muchas cosas siempre es el m s dif cil
449481 pero es una ronda que va a estar muy pareja igualada va a ser dif cil y vamos a tener que trabajar bastante para poder empezar con buen pie
449482 por la calidad de jugadores que hay es cierto que tenemos la chapa de candidatos
449483 tenemos que tratar de poder funcionar como equipo para eso estamos trabajando en estos entrenamientos y vamos por objetivos el primero es tratar de clasificarnos y despu s esperar a ver qu es lo que pasa
449484 al ser compa eros fuera de la cancha se genera una gran amistad y un compa erismo dentro del campo y se sabe que si uno apoya al otro se va a hacer mucho mejor resultado
449485 l en boca me ayud mucho a crecer como futbolista porque juega mucho con los laterales y me dec a mucho las proyecciones que tengo que tener en qu momento pasar y en qu momento no y la verdad es que es una gran ventaja con l que adem s de ser un tipo con experiencia ya gan casi todo
449486 lo que m s sufrimos es el calor y la humedad para entrenar eso agota bastante
449487 ayer el entrenamiento en la ma ana bajo un cielo soleado y despejado en contraste con la neblina de hoy fue dur simo hac a un calor b rbaro pero bueno la verdad es que lo estamos llevando bastante bien
449488 las canchas est n realmente bien es lo nico que m s o menos hemos podido ver
449489 ha sido un fin de semana bien decente el ritmo del autom vil es sensacional creo que ha sido un gran d a tener los dos primeros puestos con heikki
449490 no parecimos muy s lidos esta ma ana pero mirando los tiempos de las vueltas de las dos primeras seiones creo que estamos all
449491 la vuelta no fue perfecta el tr fico significa que no pude preparar mis neum ticos
449492 estamos hablando de que cuando se presenta una lesi n de esta magnitud y en el sentido como se produce ser n alrededor de tres semanas el tiempo en que se pueda recuperar por lo pronto no realizar el viaje a estados unidos para jugar ante barcelona

449504 mojuba is about friends and family and will only feature different artists if they can offer something really special e g bernard badie for the celebration of the 10th release
449505 now i put some of the back catalogue online due to request from music lovers who are not djs and dont even own a record player they also dont want to download the illegally ripped vinyls
449506 actually i dont think so because there was never the intention to create a cult or such a following movement for me it was more about the sound and the attitude which is translated trough the music and the layout for that reason vinyl was the weapon of choice because no mp3 is cable of giving you the feeling of holding a mojuba record or a record in general in your hands
449507 after the demand increased i decided to do a repress on coloured vinyl that was actually the starting point of using coloured vinyl then i thought it is nice to give some real mojuba lovers something special by letting them receive the first copies in coloured via hard wax or mojuba direct sale actually i wanted it like it was in the good old days when the basic channel associated labels for example published their releases first
449508 i dont like it because this stuff was made for the music lovers but apart from one copy only politics i cant do much to avoid it
449509 quality in sound and creating beautiful feelings and memories for the music lover or dancer also some kind of education to show the people who are new to this music where it comes from or where we gained our experience from e g re release of bernard badie i think thats my main motivation good recognizable music with a character
449510 depends sometimes he will sometime get the artists do the pre mastering themselves we are friends for a very long time and i trust him in the way how he see the whole thing of how a record should sound like and besides that he is quick and reliable some of the first records had been mastered by friend 2000 and one who really knows how to make the sound phat he has also a great background regarding sound design and sound engineering so i was very happy about his offer to master the records
449511 those who are true to their sound and not following the hype i think you know who i mean
449512 there are plans for that maybe next year this will be the next level for me as well as for the artist because we already have a concrete vision how an album should be like we will try our best

449515 i came back from kirkuk half an hour ago the situation is very tense there
449516 the kurds want to lay bricks for an independent state but escalating tensions will not bring any good to anyone
449517 why is the peshmerga kurdish militia in the center of kirkuk
449518 kirkuk is a city under the rule of the central government and must remain as it is
449519 whenever america targets and kills innocent people it comes up with such propaganda that it has killed a big personality in an attempt to justify the cruelty it has done
449520 i think the fbi owes us a complete accounting of their investigation and ought to be able to tell us at some point how were going to bring this to closure

449604 i personally believe that until the central nervous system develops it is not killing a baby
449605 it doesnt even look like a baby by then just an alien blob
449606 i am lucky because i have never nor will i ever be faced with the desicion of abortion unless i am raped
449607 however just because i personally would never make that decision for myself who am i or anyone else to tell another what they should do
449608 it was a little bit different to anything ive done before
449609 it was all really elegant cocktail dresses and very stylised but then theyve changed it all with cowboy hats and feathers an american indian feel
449610 my agency told me that they were very happy and i got lots of good feedback so i think i did a good job
449611 his slider was nice and sharp and his fastball was hard he looked like he had his good stuff tonight
449612 we got something going and kept chipping away you like to see fight like that were a team with heart
449613 we felt we needed to try a different direction with the pitching staff a different voice a different message
449614 not that anything they were saying was wrong but sometimes players respond to different voices and were going to take that chance
449615 dad were paying 30 grand a year to get the same indoctrination you can get every day for fifty cents in the newspaper
449616 in evaluating the monetary comparison i was forced to agree with her a business major was more appropriate to her goals
449617 to steal ideas from one person is plagiarism to steal from many is research
449618 sam operates outside the boundary of good taste like most people i find the comments highly inappropriate
449619 paulas a fantastic person and she just doesnt deserve it
449620 she cried in the dressing room and we cried for her as well but we are very optimistic bunch and we have not given up hope
449621 she is such a good kid she is going to be up all night icing it because what she does over the next 24 hours is going to be crucial
449622 it is a huge setback for the kid and for us
449623 im interested in getting the spirit into the australian team and getting them up to perform at their best
449624 the buildings around our part of the village have been decorated with posters from all over australia
449625 the athletes are absolutely loving it weve got the two big screens up the all blacks supporters have come down
449626 my job is to try and make it pleasant for the athletes so that they have an olympic experience so that win lose or draw these young people here are going to meet people from all over australia
449627 one of the sports ive been allocated is equestrian which should be interesting because i havent ridden a horse since i was five
449628 but i wont be giving technical advice thats not why im here i just hope i can help on the mental side
449629 its clear the banks are increasing their profit margins because they can
449630 there are very strong signs all the indicators show it that there are problems on the way if not here already
449631 these days lenders make money from keeping people in debt for more and for longer
449632 australia desperately needs to fix its weak regulation of reckless lending we need an effective legal duty on lenders to give a loan only if the consumer can actually afford to repay it
449633 i am extremely pessimistic about the way australia is heading
449634 what you need to watch very closely in australia is what is happening to your main trade partners in asia if you conclude that there is a slowdown taking place then you will be left alone to deal with your over valued housing market which could cause a recession
449635 if commodity prices drop you will see a decline on the same lines as the uk a drop of 15 or 20 per cent
449636 australian banks perceived immunity to the world financial crisis turns out to have little basis in reality
449637 in the near term this is bad news for the australian dollar in the longer term it is worse as australias structural problems come to the fore
449638 in reality its a big thing but you dont look at it that way when its your child
449639 my son is critically ill and needs a liver transplant but hes maintaining a level of stability
449640 the risk involved in a live transplant is higher than using a deceased donor they felt it didnt warrant the risk
449641 but if he deteriorates before a donor becomes available using me is the next option
449642 we probably came across as being very angry and upset but we know everyones got patricks best interests at heart
449643 we have had to come to terms with the fact patrick may die but hes a tough little bugger
449644 its a horrible sensation waiting for your child to deteriorate before he can get better
449645 his physical development has been delayed to an extent because of his condition
449646 he started walking without holding on to anything a week ago were so proud of him
449647 i would warmly welcome it if he would stay in the parliament and return to the front bench
449648 i couldnt care less what people say or think about me
449649 life is too precious to worry about what other people are saying or what they think
449650 the stories were sometimes difficult to listen to we found that all the prisoners we met played with our emotions
449651 the prisoners had portrayed their stories as such normal incidents that in my mind i started to see these crimes as lesser offences
449652 you dont want people normalising sanitising glamorising drug use murder and anti social behaviour
449653 its a really good wake up call for them a lesson they should be more careful and critical
449654 the kids are intrigued they hang on every word it teaches them some important lessons weve never had any problems at all
449655 my sister kindly offered to be my surrogate she already has a family and we didnt think it was any big deal
449656 our families are 100 per cent behind us and so initially we thought theres no reason why we cant do this but it turns out there is a big reason
449657 my sister and her husband both need to be made sterile it is crazy
449658 rushed through and not all the implications were thought about
449659 they didnt actually make surrogacy illegal but they made it bloody difficult
449660 it is fairly bizarre that you ask the surrogate who you would expect to be fertile to be infertile and that you expect her partner to also be infertile
449661 it actually discriminates against people who want to do surrogacy and its affected couples since technology allowed surrogacy
449662 i just dont understand why if were an infertile couple we cant access the same help as everybody else
449663 i am very excited it is going to be a challenge but im ready and i cant wait
449664 i am obviously very happy at the network and city homicide is doing great but i was hungry i was hungry for more
449665 i reckon my appetite will be pretty well fulfilled at the end of this
449666 the opportunity to be in the no 1 drama in the country and potentially the no 1 variety show simultaneously was just an offer that i could not refuse and it was a challenge i could not walk away from
449667 the thrill satisfaction and reward i got from the live component of x factor prompted us macpherson and his management to spend about 12 to 18 months developing and shopping around a live variety show
449668 that was sort of the direction we were heading and then tripping over came along and then city homicide came along and some opportunities in the states popped up
449669 i reckon somebody has told them how bad a dancer i am
449670 old photostat copies from the 20s and 30s are shiny like that so this is why youd think this is not a real document

449678 i would warmly welcome it if he would stay in the parliament return to the frontbench and re engage with politics
449679 if he was planning to come back all along keeping well out of the howard legacy immediately after the election so he can make a clean start after october might end up being a clever strategy
449680 niki has been an important part of the georgetown family for a long time and she will be missed

449699 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
449700 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
449701 i dont come out of central casting im young im new to the national scene my name is barack obama i do not have the typical biography of a presidential candidate
449702 what that means is that im sort of unfamiliar and people are still trying to get a fix on who i am where i come from
449703 what has been an approach of the mccain campaign is to say hes risky
449704 prime minister gilani said that he would conduct an independent investigation
449705 he said he would look into the matter and try and get to the root of it
449706 so the two prime ministers naturally reviewed where we are in the process of normalizing an improving india pak relations
449707 the indian prime minister was relatively frank in expressing his concerns about recent events which have had an impact on the relationship and on the prospects of the dialogue
449708 both sides expressed the determination that we need to overcome these events and to move back on to the track of improving relations
449709 it was a candid and open conversation between two people who both wanted to see a way forward in this situation
449710 a funny name and he doesnt look like all the presidents on the dollar bills and the five dollar bills
449711 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
449712 i dont think he obama did himself any good with these comments what he did is inject back into this context the idea about voters comfort level
449713 what he said is not exactly rap talk black speak but that is something that obama has to be very careful about he just cant let people believe that they cant trust him
449714 i will say that the way that theyve amplified this you know has been troublesome and the eagerness with which theyve done it indicates they think they can exploit this politically
449715 but in fact what i have said and theres no doubt about this theyve said it themselves is that they want to make me appear risky to the american people
449716 because obama has had less than one term in the senate and people dont know much about him and he is different in terms of race there will be some americans who are uncertain about the kind of change he is offering
449717 our job is to make sure that they understand that the changes were promoting are changes that have to be made that if we dont make them in fact thats the riskier course
449718 you knew it was coming you just didnt know when well we know and well tell you stick around
