6340124 in combat the changes seem physical at first adrenaline begins to flood your system the moment the first bullet is fired but unlike adrenaline rushes in the civilian world a car accident or a bungee jump where the surge lasts only a few minutes in combat the rush can go on for hours in time your body seems to burn out from it or maybe the adrenaline just runs out whatever the case after a while you begin to almost lose the physical capacity for fear explosions go off you cease to jump or flinch in this moment now everyone sits still numbly watching the mortars dump down nearby the only things moving are the pupils of their eyes this is not to say the terror goes away it simply moves out from the twitching muscles and nerves in your body and takes up residence in your mind if you feed it with morbid thoughts of all the terrible ways you could be maimed or die it gets worse it also gets worse if you think about pleasant things good memories or plans for the future just remind you how much you dont want to die or get hurt its best to shut down to block out everything but to reach that state you have to almost give up being yourself this is why i believe everyone said goodbye to each other yesterday before leaving on this mission they would still be together but they wouldnt really be seeing one another for a while since each man would in his own way be sort of gone

6340128 our first responsibility remains to unemployed australians who might want financial assistance some changes in social security laws which enable and encourage them to take up seasonal fruit picking
6340129 australians need to be reassured about health and security checks about getting the people back once they come
6340130 if australia is prepared to bring dirt poor people from pacific island nations to do work australians are unable or unwilling to do then surely we are capable of working out some financial assistance to get australians who are unemployed to help them do the work

6340171 a diverse collection of individuals fitting no single demographic profile nor do they all follow a typical pathway to violent extremism
6340172 challenge many of the stereotypes that are held about who becomes a terrorist and why
6340173 the brilliant orange flame colored throat of this species outshines the others in the genus
6340174 the combined greek name is meant to describe a stout sturdy bird stiphrornis that bears a flame colored throat pyrrholaemus combined with the english common name of olive backed forest robin which highlights the distinctive olive back and rump the bird is aptly described by its names
6340175 rat meat has huge potential to be developed into a popular dish which if extensively commercialized will tackle almost 50 per cent of the food crisis in the country
6340176 many of the reputed hotels in foreign countries have rat meat as an important part of the menu we will interact with these hotels to teach us how to adapt our cuisine to this meat we intend to make it a household item very soon here
6340177 nigeria the significance of the nigeria bonga offshore oil platform attack
6340178 the leaders will be prepared to consider the suspension of the fiji interim government from the councils of the forum
6340179 its a very strong message and now the ball is in bainimaramas court as to how he responds
6340180 for the region to speak with a united voice condemning the abuse of democracy on the part of the interim fiji government is itself a significant step forward
6340181 this guy has been given 18 months since the coup date to honour a commitment to have an election next year what weve seen is him go backwards from that commitment not forwards towards realising it
6340182 not only inappropriate but goes against the principle of inclusiveness and dialogue which is integral to the pacific way
6340183 the thing is hes not only ruled out march 2009 he actually has no timetable for elections at any time so theres just not a willingness on his part up until now to look at any timetable
6340184 the future of this coalition is linked to the restoration of judges
6340185 if the judges are not restored we will prefer to sit on opposition benches
6340186 from what we can tell nobody in virginia is as dry nobody has the crop failure
6340187 nationality or religion those are the only reasons why i can think its been denied

6340194 este recorte es inevitable debido al coste de mantenimiento que suponen dichos aviones
6340195 la gente no tiene el cuerpo para actuar con todos los sentidos cuando sobre ellos pesa una amenaza de despido o un expediente de regulaci n de empleo
6340196 observationer om j der 1 they dont think the same way we do 2 when you meet them in just the right circumstances they are a very likable people 3 their values are fundamentally different from ours their self esteem is derived from a different source 4 not only can they not build the infrastructure of a modern society they cant maintain it either 5 they do not think of obligations as running both ways 6 in warfare we think they are sneaky cowards they think we are hypocrites 7 in rhetoric they dont mean to be taken seriously and they dont understand when we do 8 they dont place the same value on an abstract conception of truth as we do they routinely believe things of breathtaking absurdity 9 they do not have the same notion of cause and effect as we do 10 we take for granted that we are a dominant civilization still on the way up they are acutely aware that they are a civilization on the skids 11 we think that everybody has a right to their own point of view they think that that idea is not only self evidently absurd but evil 12 our civilization is destroying theirs we cannot share a world in peace they understand this we have yet to learn it
6340197 we are about sticking by athletes through thick and thin through injury and poor performances
6340198 that is why sports are such an exciting field there are no guarantees there is heartbreak and failure as well as excitement and triumph
6340199 i think the folks at nike do want to come out of the games with a big win they have the luxury of multiple opportunities for that
6340200 not that they arent winning medals all over the place
6340201 but those big iconic victories that transcend the games that just hasnt happened yet
6340202 its really been fun to watch and to watch this u s basketball team perform
6340203 i wouldnt say we expected it such good performance but we hoped for it
6340204 in den letzten 24 stunden eine f r uns gef hrliche eigendynamik entwickelt
6340205 wir suchen mit diesem wettbewerb gesundheitsprojekte die vielen anderen schulen anregungen und ideen liefern so profitieren dann nicht nur die gewinner sondern auch weitere schulen von dem wettbewerb
6340206 heute klagt schon jedes dritte kind gelegentlich ber r ckenschmerzen fast jedes zweite hat haltungssch den und nahezu jeder f nfte grundsch ler ist bereits bergewichtig diese zahlen unterstreichen dass mit der gesundheitsf rderung nicht fr h genug begonnen werden kann nat rlich liegt der tk als familienkasse die gesundheit unseres nachwuchses besonders am herzen etwa jeder zehnte rheinland pf lzer unter 20 jahren ist bei uns versichert
6340207 es gibt in den schulen landesweit schon viele gute konzepte auf dem feld der gesundheitserziehung und der pr vention nur zwei beispiele daf r sind das aus mehr als 45 schulen bestehende netzwerk f r gesunde schulen und das grundschulpr ventionsprogramm ich und du und wir das bis 2011 an mindestens 240 grundschulen umgesetzt werden soll wir wollen allerdings dass derartige vorbilder noch st rker herausgestellt werden und damit andere schulen zur nachahmung anregen
6340208 was fr her mal als schlaraffenland galt steht jetzt f r gesunkene lebensqualit t denn gerade das berangebot an nahrung ist inzwischen zum problem geworden
6340209 die soziale herkunft darf keine rolle spielen dabei ist die zusammenarbeit von allen gesellschaftlichen gruppen notwendig
6340210 weil die schullaufbahn von jungen besonders in den weiterf hrenden schulen sehr viel h ufiger als bei m dchen von misserfolgserlebnissen begleitet wird sollen nun in einem modellversuch geschlechtsbewusste grundschule jungenf rderung in der ganztagsschule methoden und ma nahmen

6340212 es sind nicht die kinder welche probleme bereiten es sind die alten welche nie gelernt haben was freude am lernen und lebenslanges lernen bedeutet
6340213 it is not surprising to see such tactics from the people who managed to paint a war hero as a traitor in 2004
6340214 det hade v l varit kul du kan ju ta f rstastr ckan s slipper du ju bry dig om kartan utan kan bara h nga p n n som verkar veta vart han hon ska jag pekar ut en l mplig kandidat innan start och sen r det bara att h nga p
6340215 theyre having to continually balance the capacity of the network there certainly has been a great enhancement from 2g to 3g but still pressures are put on the network
6340216 its only a matter of time before there is a critical mass
6340217 the data network is fully capable of handling this level of access weve built the network to handle the busiest likely data traffic peaks for internet access
6340218 as you would expect we have been in communication with the companies for months to receive updates weve also been communicating with their regulator and the federal reserve
6340219 the treasury bailout plan is socialism for the rich the well connected and wall street
6340220 weve given that entrepreneurial opportunity to thousands of contractors to own grow and expand their own business
6340221 fedexs legal position is much less appealing because these drivers are at the core of their business
6340222 we do not think its against the law to work for yourself
6340223 if it looks like a duck walks like a duck swims like a duck and quacks like a duck it is a duck
6340224 and in this process gains an unfair advantage over its competitors who pay their employees as employees
6340225 die beschleunigung des verfahrens die international unter besonderer mitwirkung der deutschen reiterlichen vereinigung ins leben gerufen wurde ist genau richtig
6340226 wir werden seitens der fn alle m glichkeiten aussch pfen um den fall aufzukl ren
6340227 everybody has been looking for a correction in supply and i dont think this is the last
6340228 we have seen a lot of restaurants here in dallas some at the higher end some at the lower end go away i am sure if you look around the city you are in you are seeing the same kinds of situations
6340229 supply is starting to rationalize itself which is a good thing for us
6340230 we may never see 2 50 u s a gallon gas again
6340231 were just starting to get used to this new normal of higher prices
6340232 we have to be very very careful with the natural inclination to raise prices in the face of higher commodity costs
6340233 we cant afford to raise prices above levels that consumers find acceptable the battleground is keeping stores open through this turbulent time and were determined to win this battle
6340234 the entire segment in all food consumed away from home is going to continue to be under inflationary pressure
6340235 ich nehme mit dem kind ein jahr frei dann komme ich auf die tour zur ck

6340242 blijkbaar wil iedereen mee als het moet kan ik 20 man selecteren maar er zijn slechts negen plaatsen beschikbaar
6340243 ik wou dat ik toen hetzelfde probleem had als nu
6340244 ik wil met een paar jongens een goede babbel hebben daarvoor ben ik hier en zak ik straks af naar de vuelta
6340245 zoveel tijd heb ik dus ook niet meer ik kan zeker niet wachten tot het einde van de vuelta e n ding is zeker er zullen jongens ontgoocheld zijn maar ik heb zeker nog geen certitudes
6340246 dat het hooliganisme nog niet is verdwenen maar ernstig aan belang heeft ingeboet
6340247 vooral in de eerste helft hebben we een aantal goeie momenten gehad
6340248 stijnen heeft voor de rust enkele goeie reddingen moeten doen maar we werden niet overspeeld
6340249 we stonden goed en de intenties waren er om te combineren op het einde van langere combinaties maakten we soms toch een technisch foutje waardoor we de bal te snel verloren
6340250 daniel zegt dat hij gomez niet aanraakt bij de penalty de 2 0 was mooi maar dat mag tegen vijf verdedigers niet dat is jammer
6340251 vooral de eerste helft hebben we weinig weggegeven als we het beter uitspelen pikken we misschien ook ons doelpuntje mee maar we waren niet rustig genoeg aan de bal drie vier passes geven dat ging nog maar aan de 16 meter lukte het niet meer ik ben niet ontevreden over mijn eigen wedstrijd maar met het resultaat kan ik niet blij zijn ik hoop dat ik er straks opnieuw bij ben
6340252 ik denk dat we een goeie stap gezet hebben in de aanloop naar de eerste wk kwalificatiematch
6340253 het zag er lang naar uit dat we de nul konden houden jammer genoeg veranderde een dubieuze fase dat
6340254 maar we hebben op enkele fases na met een heel goeie organisatie gespeeld
6340255 duels worden op het scherp van de snee uitgevochten een keeper mag zich toch ook verdedigen tegen een knie
6340256 als je voor de bond werkt moet je niet van een bepaald succes profiteren en de a ploeg destabiliseren
6340257 er moet eendracht zijn maar ik heb de indruk dat bepaalde mensen zichzelf belangrijker vinden dan het belgische voetbal
6340258 we hebben het ioc gevraagd of onze atletes een zwart lint mochten dragen maar het antwoord was neen we weten echt niet waarom dat geweigerd werd

6340271 barring finding mr sperry ultimately this turns into a passive search where we distribute photos contact the media and then it becomes a missing persons file
6340272 and theres nothing to indicate any other rationale for the disappearance of mr sperry
6340273 its been a huge effort on behalf of the community just unbelievable
6340274 i just would like to help out with the search or cooking just in some way
6340275 we learn about the environment and global warming in school
6340276 the whole idea is really to teach them to live as sustainably as possible
6340277 we want to make sure that its as clean as a garbage cleanup can be
6340278 but i dont think weve had a participant yet leave with that same attitude
6340279 once they see it at this level they want to protect it
6340280 the programs are so creative and i get try so many new things
6340281 its really pretty here i would absolutely love to do it again
6340282 im very hopeful that within the month well be seeing a cheque come forward
6340283 its kind of an old stale disease and everyones kind of accepted the fact that you know somebody that has cancer that dies
6340284 cancer one day will be something that our grandkids talk about
6340285 ultimately the biggest breakthroughs and discoveries in the 21st century around this disease are going to be things that are actually common throughout all types of cancer
6340286 he dealt with exactly the same things that everybody that gets cancer does
6340287 they think if he did that and went there maybe i could just get back to work
6340288 when i was a kid yeah i absolutely wanted one
6340289 never did get it too expensive and that was that but now it looks like im getting a second chance
6340290 that has appeal from a personal point of view of course
6340291 but also it lets you do things that you wouldnt be able to do otherwise you can dare to be a little bit bolder and fly a little closer to the action and if something were to happen to it of course its a shame but its not tragic
6340292 theres a huge difference in size the auroras over 100 feet long and fully loaded weighs about 70 tonnes
6340293 the new unmanned aerial vehicle is more the size of a cessna or something along those lines its pretty tiny
6340294 since then ive been flying a desk at wing ops
6340295 if i got into a plane id certainly feel rusty
6340296 i think the unmanned aerial vehicle world may be different enough from flying manned aircraft that i wont notice the rust so much
6340297 i hope well be able to help out the army because thats really what the scope of the mission is all about
6340298 you get the view of whats going on on the ground so its possible to see things that wouldnt be seen from ground level because of obstacles and hills
6340299 that will give us a chance to not only operate the vehicle in flight but also to co operate with the army because thats the main thrust of the job
6340300 so with a few of them you could get round the clock coverage
6340301 there will also be one person from the intelligence section watching because they would be the experts on interpreting what you see
6340302 the only greater experience is when i kiss my wife
6340303 getting to keep the stanley cup would be my best birthday present ever
6340304 youre around the people that you care about an awful lot your family and friends and lots of friends in the community players that i played with back in the day when i was a junior bulldog it also feels really good to be able to bring the stanley cup home and very satisfying

6340317 mukhang gustong sairin ng gobyernong arroyo ang aming pera hindi pa nakuntento sa bilyong dolyar na halaga ng remitans na ginagamit para sagipin ang ekonomiya ng bansa ginagamit naman nito ngayon ang mga cash transfer firms para makakuha pa ng dagdag na buwis sa mga ofw sa anyo ng 0 15 dst
6340318 habang ang gobyerno at malalaking negosyo ay nagkakamal ng dambuhalang tubo halos wala namang natitira sa mga ofw ang 200 buwanang remitans na ipinadadala namin sa aming pamilya ay lalong lumiliit ang halaga dahil sa patuloy na pagtaas ng mga bilihin at serbisyo

i v mul umesc pentru acest lucru de asemenea v mul umesc pentru discu ia foarte bun pe care am avut o i pentru coinciden a punctelor de vedere ntre republica moldova i rom nia cu privire la conflictele nghe ate n acela i timp ca ef al unui stat european in s v mul umesc pentru faptul c republica moldova a aderat imediat la declara ia uniunii europene cu privire la georgia declara ie care a fost adoptat de mini trii de externe de cagre pe data de 13 august n ceea ce prive te conflictul transnistrian n analiza pe care am f cut o cu domnul pre edinte voronin am ajuns la concluzia c acesta corespunde perfect la ceea ce s a nt mplat n kosovo la ceea ce s a nt mplat n osetia de sud acum v este cunoscut faptul c rom nia este una dintre rile care nu au recunoscut kosovo consider nd c decizia de a crea un stat pe teritoriul unui stat suveran i independent contravine legilor dreptului interna ional contravine principiului integrit ii teritoriale i a inviolabilit ii frontierelor statelor n transnistria situa ia este chiar dac are motiva ii diferite este similar cu cea din kosovo i din osetia de sud adic o popula ie majoritar av nd etnie sau cet enie a altui stat i o conducere local nelegitim care i declar independen a dac ve i compara cu realit ile din kosovo i din osetia de sud ve i constata c mai lipse te un singur lucru conflictul din acest punct de vedere n discu ii am apreciat extraordinar de mult capacitatea republicii moldova de a nu r spunde niciunui fel de provoc ri din partea transnistrienilor i trebuie s o spun public mi se pare c se dep e te orice limit a decen ei n momentul n care transnistrienii refuz orice fel de discu ii cu autoritatea suveran a statului moldovean de asemenea consider m c ce s a nt mplat n osetia de sud este demonstra ia faptului c aceste conflicte nghe ate nu au un mecanism corect de deblocare a situa iilor n ceea ce prive te transnistria mpreun cu domnul pre edinte voronin am ajuns la concluzia c implicarea uniunii europene

dezbaterilor despre kosovo n momentul de fa state suverane i independente sunt dezmembrate n numele drepturilor colective ale minorit ilor drepturi colective care nu sunt recunoscute n fapt de nimeni

lucrurile i n osetia i s nu spun vorb mare n abhazia i acest tip de abordare politic trebuie s nceteze rom nia pleac de la premisa c niciun fel de drept nu poate prevala asupra dreptului de

sau n numele unei majorit i de cet enie se rup teritorii din state independente i suverane creeaz riscul unui proces care poate deveni extrem de periculos pentru securitatea europei acum ce s a nt

6340341 i do not find shemale pics of tranny beauties on this site to be offensive i understand the standards and laws of the community and i am solely responsible for my actions i am at least 18 years of age and have the legal right to access adult material in my country
6340342 i am genuinely concerned i think australians are beginning to feel genuinely concerned that less than 12 months after the last election they are going backwards in net terms
6340343 certainly its a victory for national australia bank customers who have been doing it tough after eight interest rate rises in three years
6340344 this decision by the national australia bank is a challenge for other banks to follow
6340345 while i am pleased to make todays undertaking our medium and long term funding and our retail deposit base represent the greatest proportion of our funding costs and the average cost of these sources of funding continue to increase
6340346 you could argue that banks are in a position to reduce some of the pressure now in advance of the reserve bank making any decision that it does
6340347 we know the banks have had to pay more for money in the last six to eight months because of the result of the global liquidity crisis but we also know that their margins are extraordinarily healthy
6340348 we will review our full costs of funding at the time of any announcement by the rba taking into account any reduction in the official cash rate and do our best to pass on as much as we can to our customers
6340349 my philosophy is simple i like the world of music and there i think global because you have to let

6340364 fortunately ive had the chance to train with the halls who i consider to be among best drivers in off road racing today
6340365 while the desert is unforgiving the combination of the h2s durability and the team hummer support provide an excellent opportunity to achieve my goal and finish for the team
6340366 with 12 years of experience racing stock class hummers i believe that they are the most capable off road vehicles straight from the factory
6340367 in fact the h3 alpha and h3 were the first stock class vehicles to finish the 2007 baja 1000 and 2008 baja 500
6340368 this is a clear indication of our confidence in the quality and value of our cars and trucks
6340369 were pleased to now offer that same level of confidence with every gm certified used vehicle from buick chevrolet gmc and pontiac and every saturn certified pre owned vehicle as we reach the 3 million sales milestone this warranty enhancement adds a real point of differentiation for our program enabling our dealers to offer customers a range of peace of mind assurances that compare favorably with any other manufacturer certified program in the industry gm certified and saturn certified do an outstanding job of bringing in new gm customers and this enhancement will only add to that
6340370 we upped our game and made great strides in quality
6340371 we take care of our customers by standing behind our cars and trucks with a five year 100 000 mile transferable powertrain warranty plus roadside assistance and courtesy transportation we already provide the best coverage in america and now were making that coverage even better

6340374 despite the economic headwinds affecting the industry we are on track to sell more vehicles than we did last year and 2007 was already a record year for us
6340375 at a time when consumers are more hesitant in their purchasing decisions it is even more crucial to have convincing products
6340376 early reactions to our all new fiesta make us confident that we are adding another cornerstone to continue the upwards trend of the ford brand despite adverse economic conditions
6340377 fun to drive stylish safe fuel efficient and roomy the pontiac wave has seen sales grow almost 20 this year and the new g3 wave takes that winning formula to new levels for 2009

6340379 theres a sense that its a cutting edge destination where they can be among the first to learn firsthand about another culture

6340417 amongst those people recorded as having very low incomes there will be some individuals who would not generally be considered poor but who do genuinely have few sources of income in the short run for example there are a disproportionate number of individuals who are selfemployed at the very bottom of the income distribution whose incomes tend to be erratic
6340418 the level of material deprivation covering things that households can afford to buy for those with incomes below 40 of the median is lower than it is for those with incomes between 40 and 60 of median income
6340419 severe poverty is probably the wrong term to attach to those with incomes below 40 of the contemporary median

6340426 we needed to win before we went to premadasa for the remainder of the series there was lot of pressure on us but zaheer did the job for us we would have loved to win comfortably but nevertheless we would take this
6340427 we didnt want to put pressure on anyone and even called off the team meeting you can discuss 1 000 things and that itself can put pressure on you we just allowed everyone to mentally prepare for the game
6340428 promoting myself up the order worked but credit should go to badri subramaniam badrinath he batted well on debut he hadnt played muralitharan and mendis before and its good to see him doing so well
6340429 its good to have a break ahead of the next game if we had lost here we would have been really down
6340430 you need to be consistent my responsibility is to provide early breakthroughs i just bowled within myself it was important to keep in the right areas and i thought all the bowlers did well to restrict sri lanka
6340431 this is a wicket that we are not used to its very fresh wicket that makes batting a bit difficult but its a good wicket and has a good bounce you need to survive against the new ball
6340432 at one stage it was nicely set up after reducing them for 75 for five we could have won the game but that partnership for the sixth wicket was crucial that took the game away from us
6340433 obviously you have to find a way to bowl some dots against him and build a bit of pressure because he is one of the worlds best if not the best at the moment
6340434 he has got all the shots and new ones i see it as a challenge because no one else out there does it so i would like to see what i do if he does it we have had a few chats and some of the senior guys have an idea what i should do if he moves late you cannot do anything if the ball has already left your hand if he does move early you maybe could pull out but i suppose it is also a good opportunity for a wicket if you get it right if he is totally turning around then his head is moving but you have to acknowledge he has done it well so far i have seen him five to 10 times and he has never failed
6340435 if we can set it up early and take a lead i am sure the confidence should take us through to the end and we can win the series
6340436 during that period i had to really think about my bowling and be really on my game so that if something didnt feel right with my bowling i knew what it was that helped me to groove my action and feel my action a bit more so i can work it out if something goes wrong

6340446 which croydon advertiser reporter was sent out to find some of the boroughs most beautiful people for a feature this week and accidentally ended up interviewing a convicted gang rapist
6340447 and which reporter on a sister title took photos of todays celebrating a level students on her own digital camera and then handed the card over to the picture desk completely forgetting they had some very interesting personal shots on it
6340448 you wont find the answers to those questions in this weeks advertiser but its still a pretty packed edition
6340449 its been smoother than usual deadline day so far despite the news editor taking the morning off to attend a meeting at our parent companys kensington hq only to be told upon her arrival that she was a week early
6340450 we are absolutely delighted with the progress that the site has made we have been live for almost eleven months and are now advertising a staggering 800 jobs on the site we have also integrated with the job posting site idibu to help make life easier for clients that have a large number of vacancies to place

6340453 we know that there are better more effective modalities to try to prevent infection such as combination therapies for the mother
6340454 we need to continue to work towards using more effective regimens in mothers both for their own benefit as well as to prevent infection in their babies
6340455 what we see with our commonly available tests is not really the full picture of whats there and what resistance is developing in the mother
6340456 from that standpoint there is probably even more room for concern but again in terms of the public health response the availability of single dose nevirapine is very valuable because it allows public health departments to actually start addressing the problem to start building infrastructure around something that seemed doable
6340457 it does a lot of tweaking of the federal financial aid program
6340458 the transparency of book costs is just a small part of that bill
6340459 we try to get a picture of the full costs not just what we bill
6340460 one of the projects we have scheduled this year is writing an interface between axess and efollett com
6340461 such an interface will make it easier for students to identify the materials they should secure for the courses they have selected
6340462 we havent worked out the details and student input is welcome but we hope that the information will be complete including isbn codes so students may shop with other vendors as desired for price service vendor loyalty etc
6340463 we hope to encourage our faculty to select and designate their materials before axess opens each quarter so students will have ample time to shop for their course materials
6340464 we dont see radical changes coming as a result of the bill
6340465 as far as were concerned we will sell what the faculty asks us to sell
6340466 we dont act as an independent adjudicator of what the faculty assigns their students
6340467 with stanford being a level one research university theres a lot of thought from professors about what students really need to learn
6340468 the more we can do to keep those book prices down the better it is for students
6340469 one broader issue regarding the kma report is if the hospital can be asked or be expected to provide land
6340470 we dont control the land the hospital leases the land from the university also no other employer whos creating jobs has ever had to create housing it is not reasonable to think that the hospital should be able to do that
6340471 property at quarry and el camino and another parcel at quarry and arboretum are already planned for housing under the santa clara county general use permit
6340472 they are part of the academic campus not leased to the hospital the fact that this housing near the medical center is already planned by the university is another reason we do not think building housing for hospital employees is necessary
6340473 the analysis only gives you an estimate of how many employees might need housing at certain income levels but it doesnt tell how many employees may want to live in palo alto
6340474 people make decisions for where they want to live on a number of issues not just proximity to work
6340475 local housing can reduce the need for lower income employees to commute in from very long distances
6340476 new housing will cause more local trips but these are trips which can be translated to walk bike and shuttle alternatives
6340477 when all of the studies currently being conducted for the environmental impact report are completed the information will enable us to fully analyze issues that may be interdependent
6340478 we feel it is necessary to take a comprehensive approach and not an individual approach
6340479 no one wants to give up too much too early on
6340480 there are obviously some differences and issues with mitigation however by the release of the eir later in the year everything should be negotiated and smoothed out
6340481 one can hardly hail from two more historically losing causes than the south and judaism both my cultures have long tragic pasts and not one jot of it has been forgotten
6340482 the story of southern jews is the story of sons not wanting to work in their fathers businesses
6340483 the most technically advanced container port in the world integrated with europes largest logistics park
6340484 we have to do things differently which we will and hopefully itll have a different result than it has
6340485 i am calling on strathclyde police to clarify the legality of the northern ireland flag as it has come to our attention that some officers believe the flag to be illegal and sectarian and have asked travelling supporters to remove it
6340486 this has caused both distress and offence to the travelling northern ireland supporters who have otherwise had a warm welcome in scotland
6340487 it is my hope that this is an isolated incident that can be quickly clarified allowing the match to pass off without any further problems
6340488 there was an interaction with police concerning a flag today
6340489 this was a misunderstanding on behalf of strathclyde police and the match commander is currently en route to meet with the fans and personally apologise
6340490 it has been a fantastic week for him i was there at the stadium and spent time with him before he got called out getting him ready for the race
6340491 its a great achievement thats what we were aiming to do winning both events was fantastic he is something special
6340492 he is also a really great guy a very down to earth guy he is very popular and he is a good example for other kids
6340493 when i met usain it was when he won the junior world championships at just 15
6340494 he was offered lots of things at that stage to study in the us or go professional and he chose to go professional
6340495 we felt like warriors out there the pressure of playing the hosts made it pretty intense
6340496 ever since the ball dropped in athens weve wanted to repeat as olympic champions
6340497 i think my regular training is the most important factor contributing to my victory
6340498 there was no inquiry after our son died its as if our pauls death has been forgotten
6340499 the report doesnt really answer any specific questions and were very disappointed it doesnt go far enough thats why we want to call for an independent public enquiry into his death
6340500 absence of any clear coherent and agreed strategy for maternity services
6340501 i was hoping for some closure when i heard that an investigation was going to take place but we are still waiting for someone to explain what mistakes were made
6340502 i feel let down by the medical care i received nothing is going to bring my son back but i feel as though i deserve some answers
6340503 we have noted the assurance in the independent report that maternity services at antrim are safe
6340504 the independent experts confirmed that the units performance in respect of maternal death perinatal deaths and other accepted indicators is rated in the top 25 of maternity services across the uk
6340505 the financials are down today on more negative news out of the us and the market is probably watching the reaction to babcock amp brown
6340506 some of the reports weve had out today have been slightly negative despite some coming out with higher profit theyre indicating forward earnings are coming under pressure
6340507 the best defense against crime is law abiding citizens ready and able to defend themselves says bob barr the libertarian party candidate for president
6340508 put your hand in my hand and you wont feel a thing
6340509 i was still trying to pretend i was an advertising executive
6340510 i just said yes kind of didnt even think about it
6340511 if i had thought about it i dont think i would have done it
6340512 when youre in advertising you think youre the master of the universe
6340513 i didnt know how much of a strain it was to keep up that sort of existence
6340514 how starbucks saved my life a son of privilege learns to live like everyone else
6340515 leap with faith rather than huddle with fear sometimes you just get so locked into your previous life
6340516 but this life is terribly brief so make sure you grant yourself
6340517 i was working so hard in my previous life that i didnt really have a life i think we take our puritan ethic too far
6340518 for most people it lies inside your own heart not in the external measure about whether you achieve some goals that society said was important
6340519 try walking out of rhythm you cant theres something about us that just is rhythm drumming brings us back to our core
6340520 its amazing how the child comes out in these business men and women ive seen a lot of miracles happen
6340521 sometimes they put their brains into it drumming takes people out of their head so theyre more inside their heart their spirit

6340523 when im done with class i always have sore smiling muscles
6340524 i dont want the fans to get on him about my situation
6340525 he kind of just got thrown into this whole thing things dont need to be directed at him and i wanted that to be known
6340526 its hard to say it that way when you say my name fast
6340527 coach reid has enough trust in me and confidence like i said i didnt know where i was going to be once i got back with my teammates
6340528 once i got back with my teammates i was thinking if they put me second group or third group i would follow suit and work my way back up
6340529 i really didnt have a clue you can go out and practice and it can be one thing and they say hey youre not going to play you have to do your job
6340530 shawn is going to give it a go and well just see how he does
6340531 were going to try to keep good communication with him during the game and give him an opportunity to play
6340532 i think another week of practice will definitely move me over the edge and ill be ready for the regular season
6340533 however i have been away from the guys and havent struggled with them or sweated with them i feel bad about that but i practiced this week and felt pretty good i think i am getting the trust from my teammates and offensive line back
6340534 he is going to take two or three steps forward and one back on occasion max is a fine player i think you win games with players like max
6340535 its funny i told him only my wife and mom call me lee tohhh its kind of hard to say my name the right way when youre saying it fast
6340536 i dont want fans to get on him for my situation
6340537 this is just one small token thats one less thing they have to worry about as far as school supplies it might not sound like a big thing but a lot of the kids cant go buy book bags and pads and pencils and stuff i want to try to eliminate at least that small part
6340538 shawn is going to give it a go and well just see how he feels

6340540 pictures of the spanish mens and womens basketball teams making the gesture a crude impersonation of chinese people were published in adverts in spanish newspapers earlier this week the photos which were reprinted around the world added to spanish sports poor reputation for racial sensitivity the latest image appears to show players in spains federation cup team doing the slit eyed gesture along with members of their support staff there is no suggestion that they intended to cause offence

6340564 when we signed a peace accord after the post election crisis we pledged to ensure the country got a new constitution i and president kibaki are determined to fulfil the promise
6340565 move with speed and give the country a new constitution
6340566 i want to once again assure fellow kenyans that i am fully committed to a new constitution
6340567 will be one of the greatest gifts that my government will bequeath to the people of kenya
6340568 i therefore view the conclusion of our countrys constitution making as a pivotal collective objective that will entrench the freedom and openness that has begun to define our homeland
6340569 despite this setback kenyans have shown both resilience and determination in the quest for a new constitutional order and indeed a new kenya as leaders we have resolved to work together across party lines to complete the process
6340570 the vision clearly highlights the need for a modernised rights based and democratic constitutional order
6340571 i can tell you that we have very many other reports as this was a process but we have already presented our final report to this commission
6340572 this is a statutory body and you can put them to task to produce the report
6340573 is it not true then that you have doctored the report and you are hiding something and could it also be that you are not comfortable with the report
6340574 you heard what mr gateere said pay keen attention to it
6340575 even if you are my own brother and you cant deliver on the services i have no reason but to kick you out the government is well balanced and nobody should say because this factory is in our place the chief executive officer must come from here lets rise above cheap thinking
6340576 we want to ensure that the government operates with zero tolerance to corruption
6340577 kenyans have proven to us that they know their power and have the ability to throw out not only mps but even a whole government
6340578 the heavy handed top down approach is no longer tenable
6340579 and while we will never be able to deliver everything we are required to discourtesy and lethargy are unacceptable in the civil service
6340580 we want to aim even higher and be rated with the best in the world
6340581 det r ju uppenbart att det inte r en slump eller ett sammantr ffande
6340582 the financials are down today on more negative news out of the us and the market is probably watching the reaction to babcock amp brown
6340583 some of the reports weve had out today have been slightly negative despite some coming out with higher profit theyre indicating forward earnings are coming under pressure
6340584 what do i want to have be true about this
6340585 what do we want to have happen in this meeting

6340587 the feeling of having a lock on the truth than to the truth itself
6340588 do we have ryan kerrigan purdue davyd jones ball state and eric lowe
6340589 no but we have mark clemons dylan howard and justin darden
6340590 this will help us to deal with the new threats of the 21st century of long range missile threats from countries like iran or from north korea
6340591 it is nonetheless a system that establishes firmly again and reaffirms our cooperation and relationship with poland it will deepen our defence cooperation and it will deepen our ability to deal with threats
6340592 achieved the basic aims that mean poland and the united states are more secure
6340593 we will be forced to respond to this adequately the eu and us have been warned
6340594 no one can dictate to poland what it should do thats in the past
6340595 our neighbours should now understand that our nation will never give in nor allow itself to be intimidated
6340596 no one should be afraid of the shield if they have good intentions towards us or the rest of the west
6340597 i hope people wake up and emotionally engage in issues

6340635 i was interested to see what it was because ive worked with a team of people involved in monitoring and forecasting aphids those of greenfly and their relatives in this country
6340636 i looked at it with my team and we thought we could identify it down to the level of genus but we had no idea what the species was
6340637 he discovered that it was something that hadnt been described before
6340638 its not uncommon to find insects in amber but im not sure that one has turned up on ebay that has been undiscovered before

6340653 it really is tremendous luck because today its so hard to imagine that this is where berlin started
6340654 weve not just found the houses where some of the oldest berliners lived but the residents too
6340655 we had hoped at the start of our dig to give berliners back a bit of their history but what we have found is the cradle of berlin
6340656 we can never be surprised at what vile evil comes from the mouth of a confessed victim of child abuse at the hands of her own parents
6340657 roseannes parents responded to the accusation by going on air and slating she is a psychopathic liar and her sister agreed
6340658 that gave us an insight into who she is and what she is capable of saying and doing

6340709 what i can do is do a courtesy exchange but it wont happen again cause there is not an issue with 3g
6340710 using the iphone on a network it is not designed for may break the iphone
6340711 oh no sir we inform all our customers before we sell them the 3g iphone
6340712 well no one informed me i wouldnt have bought one had i known but i guess thats the plan wouldnt sell as many phones if people knew the truth lying by omission is still lying
6340713 as much as the chip may be the chief problem glitches may also stem from apples software or the at amp t network part of the role of the infineon chip is to check whether theres enough 3g bandwidth available in a given area if 3g isnt available or there isnt enough bandwidth the iphone will be shifted to a slower network one source says apple programmed the infineon chip to demand a more powerful 3g signal than the iphone really requires so if too many people try to make a call or go on the internet in a given area some of the devices will decide theres insufficient power and switch to the slower network even if there is enough 3g bandwidth available according to this person the problems are only occurring in areas of high iphone density these include the san francisco bay area boston and certain overseas locales the reason the problem has gotten worse in recent days is because of the steep increase in iphone activations in these places the more people who are trying to use a given piece of gear the more likely they are to get bumped
6340714 im having the same problem and i live in the pocket area of sacramento i called att and they told me it was not the phone but the 3g network it would be interesting to have other 3g phones in the same exact area and see if they are also having the same problem if the other phones are having the problem then its the network 3g if not then it has to be the 3g i phone so lets see how long it will take this issue to be resolved so we may enjoy our i phones
6340715 i can happily report that ever since we have done the sim swap routine we now have three working iphone 3gs
6340716 any idea why my service wouldnt have 5 bars one mile from a tower

6340718 what i was told was that 90 of the disconnects are initiated inside the phone which would exonerate at amp t
6340719 here is the bug here is the fix update the driver
6340720 apple released a patch we dont know if it works or not

6340722 the problem is affecting 2 to 3 of iphone traffic the people say that compares with a dropped call rate of around 1 for all traffic for at amp t
6340723 further to our telephone conversation on 20th august 2008 i can confirm that a case has been raised with apple with regards to the signal and service issues with their new 3g iphones apple have advised that they are presently working on a fix for this issue and hope to have resolved with the latest software updates
6340724 look we know there is a global problem going on were working on it
6340725 what i didnt hear you iphone iphone are you there
6340726 safari cant open the page because it could not connect to the server

6340728 re iphone 3g stuck at the apple logo screen will not boot
6340729 yes we know about this issue and yes were working on it 24 7 and a fix is coming soon
6340730 itunes can not connect to the iphone because it is locked with a password you must enter your passcode on the iphone before it can be used with itunes
6340731 there should be another update out this month that may clear up many of our problems
6340732 the catch is that you cannot download apps from over the air thats where the problems are dont upgrade over the air either ive been doing downloads and upgrades through itunes for over a week with no major issues

6340774 clearly working with a retailer of size and strength shows that komet is achieving its pan canadian objectives and that its products are exportable
6340775 we had two of the most bearish factors thrown at oil today and were closing moderately higher
6340776 were seeing supply concerns go back into the price of a barrel of oil
6340777 these people need a new ouija board all these big smart guys forecast there would be an increase of 800 000 barrels its an increase of crude oil of 9 4 million barrels
6340778 my guess is that there is still some suspicion that with at least a partial relationship with u s financials canadian banks are going to have to show some kind of stress some kind of writedown on some of their assets which they havent done so far
6340779 your opinion is important and i encourage you to get directly involved in this environmental assessment over the coming months
6340780 public participation is a key part of the environmental assessment process and as we move through the summer and into the fall there will be a number of publicized opportunities for us to provide information on the tidal energy demonstration project
6340781 we want to have direct input from as many people who live in the area or who are concerned about the ecological and energy issues as possible

6340785 it was a bit wet in the spring but not as wet as previous years the plants were in better shape going into spring
6340786 i have nothing substantive to confirm or deny this particular suggestion we are aware of the media reports and therefore we have to look into it

6340790 it now looks like gdp gross domestic product managed to eke out a tiny advance in the second quarter
6340791 the underlying story in this retail sales report is consistent with that
6340792 there is a little bit of slowing occurring in the canadian economy and that squares with what weve seen with a lot of the other economic data out recently
6340793 what we saw through the second quarter is that exports and manufacturing really pulled up the slack in the economy
6340794 were expecting that to be really the driver of any growth that we see going forward
6340795 the leading indicators for the second month in a row were flat
6340796 signalling modest growth at best in the second half of the year
6340797 well probably see the economy over the next couple of months treading water

6340895 in terms of stadium readiness we can say here that will be ready by the end of 2009 all the stadiums will be complete for kick off
6340896 it is true we at fifa have talked about a plan b meaning that when there is something happening in a country where we are not in control of the problem when you have a natural catastrophe when you have to move when you have a disaster that is not in the control of fifa or of south africa then you move the event to somewhere else

6340922 theyre a good side and at this stage were just taking it one match at a time
6340923 im pleased with how weve been playing but its a long season so were not getting carried away just yet
6340924 the mistake in the past was expecting the talent of the team to get us through and clearly that is not enough to win the air nz cup
6340925 that is part of the approach i have taken as the coach and the players have bought into that
6340926 it was a bit of a punt and it paid off
6340927 we had a lot of youthful energy mixed in with the experienced players and thats probably what has taken us to a new level

6340944 it doesnt bother me whether im up alone or with james or anybody else i just want to be part of the team and playing
6340945 but i was up front with james and i felt we linked up well and both of us could have been on the scoresheet
6340946 if we get the nod in a couple of weeks hopefully it will get better
6340947 it was another game under the boss and another positive performance
6340948 yes the result was disappointing but we feel we should have won the game and barring a couple of really good saves from their keeper we would have won the game
6340949 but it was good preparation for the big one in the couple of weeks time
6340950 as always we defended well as a team but i thought the midfield were outstanding the movement passing and their energy was fantastic so we have to take positives
6340951 theres no doubt we can go away to macedonia and iceland and win both games and thats our aim
6340952 for a player its always hard to say when but i think the time is right for me now to make the ultimate decision
6340953 i have been at bradford for eight years and a professional for 15 and i have thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it but the old body is telling me to give it away
6340954 we have some great players coming through here players like sam burgess andy lynch and koppy craig kopczak and i just feel the time is right to hang up my boots and enjoy the game from the sidelines
6340955 joe has probably been up there with robbie paul as the most significant overseas signing the club has ever made
6340956 in terms of overall contributions to the club both on and off the field his presence is simply immense and there will be a whole host of players who will be glad to see the back of joe vagana so they dont have to play against him
6340957 he will be a great loss to the club on the field and also off it because of the sheer amount of work he has done for the club in that area
6340958 the idea is to inspire young filipinos to look at where we are now and what is it that we need to change in ourselves so in the process we can change the country

6340960 young people want to buy things and we thought that if they buy a ninoy shirt they may be inspired to claim ownership of his values and beliefs his fight for freedom and justice
6340961 with this campaign we want the young people to see the country and its problems and create a full experience of having to make a very important choice like what ninoy did that may eventually change the destiny of our country

6340988 we all know what were capable of its just a matter of whether we want to play that way
6340989 weve made a few excuses for ourselves because weve been missing players but at the end of the day we didnt have the right attitude last week
6340990 weve got all our players back now so there cant be any excuses this week
6340991 we all knew after the game on friday night against the dragons that our attitude wasnt there
6340992 time will tell whether everyones changed their attitude but theres been a bit of soul searching this week
6340993 we need to win our remaining three games and win them with some sore of authority
6340994 the big arm guard he only has to notice that and his confidence is going to be a little bit rocked
6340995 any halfback who is a main ball player is going to get tested and were no different
6340996 our big wide running forwards head for those guys and our plays revolve around engaging those players hell get tested
6340997 every time i play theres always forwards out to get me
6340998 i think i overcame a lot of demons last week taking the field
6340999 im little more confident that i can get through the full 80 and i wouldnt be playing if i didnt think that
6341000 im sure the broncos will be targeting me a little in defence but thats to be expected
6341001 hes got a varied kicking game which weve talked about and weve got a plan to handle that
6341002 theres certain players that we need to be aware that are around the area hes going to kick to so i think weve got that covered
6341003 we have an understanding that he bennett has a job to do and i have a job to do and personal feelings about each other dont come into it
6341004 once wayne signed with st george he always had to plan for st george
6341005 id hate to think though that his main focus wasnt on making sure that the side was playing well and in good form
6341006 this year is still our main focus and weve both still got a job to do
6341007 we wouldnt be doing the right thing by the players if that wasnt the case
6341008 wayne bennett obviously has things he has to plan with st george and were doing the same for the brisbane broncos
6341009 its a difficult situation but darius has made his decision we know about it now and we have to move on
6341010 if anyone wants to doubt israels signing here they just need to go and look at a few of his games and what he can do
6341011 hes young and hes a wonderful player and hes got a long long career ahead of him
6341012 we needed that area of our game fixed up and he can certainly fill the void for us
6341013 we have lost some good players but weve also signed some good players and we think weve got a couple of good young players in our under 20s who can come through next year which well find out in the next few months
6341014 we have an incredibly successful era under stuart and there is a little bit of a similarity there
6341015 i think we are hopefully making the right steps to get back to where we were when he was coaching
6341016 i think freddie has taken stuarts coaching on board and freddie has got his own style as well
6341017 it is a bit of a contrast in styles there but certainly both of them have got the same principles and the same work ethic as well so theres a lot of similarities there
6341018 every time you play a team coached by ricky stuart you know you are in for a tough game and certainly thats the way they play their football
6341019 i dont think theyve had a game where they havent turned up to play this year and thats the way the teams he coaches prepare and thats the way youve got to prepare if you want to be able to hold them
6341020 all of us want to cement a top four spot with a three point buffer ahead of brisbane
6341021 its important in that respect but we certainly feel it is two different competitions

6341030 one hopes that fiji sees the sense of sticking to the commitments it gave to leaders and i would think the message coming out of the forum should be that thats what it should be doing
6341031 its not just that the commodore is balking at the commitment he gave for march 09 there is no timetable for 09 10 11 12 or any other time i think people have run out of patience and theyll be looking to communicate that pretty clearly

6341039 jack it must feel like youve been to a party for the past 20 years that the rest of the world is only now getting invited to
6341040 what happens to chinas economy after the olympics we will be doing more on this topic later but here is a preview
6341041 if you want to do business in china jack perkowski is your man in managing the dragon he takes you into the heart of the middle kingdom and shows you the way with insight humor and the kind of practical advice an entrepreneur or a down home tourist needs to navigate this fascinating and often bewildering colossus of a country
6341042 ive just finished managing the dragon which i thought was fantastic i was riveted by it i cannot believe what jack perkowski has accomplished and what an adventure hes had how he lived through it how he has succeeded and how well written his book is it reads somewhere between a novel a how to book and primer on a second business life in a developing country
6341043 i love jack perkowskis book it tells with some bravado and lots of humility the first hand story of a man who dared himself to move to china to seize upon the greatest economic boom of our age perkowski invites us into his world into the blur of business meetings and friendships hirings firings and onto chinas shop floors he reveals what it took to build a world class manufacturing company in a country that like perkowski himself needed to set firm goals but reach them in an environment where the rules and circles of influence shift daily managing the dragon is more than a manual more than a memoir it is a gift from a seasoned friend offering the keys to his wisdom and experience
6341044 managing the dragon is more than a great story about jack perkowski and his courage to move to the new frontier it is a graduate degree in the trials tribulations and successes of starting from scratch in china jack captures the essence of doing business in china and turns it into a very compelling how to guide my experiences in china over the last 14 years validate the accuracy of jack perceptions managing the dragon is superb and will be a must read for any borgwarner executive involved with china
6341045 business books on china are published so frequently these days it seems there is a secret factory churning them out
6341046 over the years every time there is a major election we have had people attempt to put up a listing we catch them very quickly
6341047 when we see these listings we definitely take them down
6341048 its possible that someone would put a listing up its possible to be up for a couple of hours before we catch it its possible that for a brief period of time something might actually be visible on the site
6341049 we are very clear if you engage in illegal activity on our site we absolutely will share information with law enforcement we provide testimony in court
6341050 and what this person was proposing was probably not so feasible unrealistic
6341051 i dont think it will happen more and more as the elections are approaching
6341052 its not anything thats widespread or cause for concern in any way
6341053 people are just looking for an audience they are really using that listing as an opportunity to put their opinion on there
6341054 we have had instances that would be similar in nature where we have sports fan who are really unhappy with the performance of their favorite team and they may try to list the coach for sale as a way to express their unhappiness with the performance of their team
6341055 those who have nothing to hide have nothing to fear
6341056 i have become very concerned with the possibility that this administration may have violated federal law by using the resources of our intelligence agencies to influence domestic policy processes or opinion
6341057 what i remember is george tenet saying we got this from basically from what george said was downtown
6341058 he may have hinted just by the way he said it it would have cause almost all that stuff came from one place only scooter libby and the shop around the vice president
6341059 i never received direction from george tenet or anyone else in my chain of command to fabricate a document as outlined in mr suskinds book
6341060 according to recent allegations in your capacity as the former cia deputy director of clandestine operations and chief of the near east division you were tasked by former cia director george tenet to create the false letter and may even have seen the white house stationery on which the false letter assignment was reportedly written
6341061 given your reported direct knowledge of these events i am requesting that you contact judiciary committee staff as soon as possible to set up a time to discuss your involvement and knowledge of the allegedly false letter
6341062 n o covert action may be conducted which is intended to influence united states political processes public opinion policies or media
6341063 whenever theres a corrupt system then youre going to have these birds of prey descend on it to get their share of the spoils
6341064 let me just begin by saying that to save you some time im not going to comment on the vice president
6341065 i point out what my record is which is one that has not won me miss congeniality over the years
6341066 people want change in america we all know that and very legitimately so
6341067 i would not allow anyone who worked for my administration to go back to lobbying
6341068 i have and continue to question his judgment whether it be his initial reaction to the russian invasion of georgia or whether it be his failure to acknowledge that the surge has succeeded or his opposition to nuclear power among others
6341069 so i question the judgment i dont question the patriotism
6341070 it would be important to have some kind of framework for the meeting in other words there would have to be some kind of predetermined at least outcome about some aspects of the meeting for example some progress in some area that was agreed upon earlier the nixon in china reagan gorbachev et cetera it would have to be something besides just a quote meeting
6341071 some people are wealthy and rich in their lives and their children and their ability to educate them others are poor if theyre billionaires
6341072 but the fact is that they are the symptom of a disease
6341073 as long as you have earmarking and pork barrel spending and
6341074 so its kind of entertaining to me to attack the lobbyists rather than the source of the problem which is the earmark theyd all be out of business most of em would be out of business if we stopped pork barrel and earmark spending
6341075 as you know i have condemned the commercials invoking obama pastor the that were done by various people

6341078 in the last day or so the market has begun to question the fundamentals of the recent us dollar recovery
6341079 we have seen particular focus on rumours and innuendo about us investment banking
6341080 i still stand by the view interest rate differentials are less us dollar supportive
6341081 us credit concerns seem to be causing investors to become risk averse said toshihiko sakai head of trading in foreign exchange and financial products at mitsubishi ufj trust amp banking in tokyo
6341082 the dollar has been recently heavily overbought despite deteriorating us economic fundamentals said keiichi iguchi a currency dealer in tokyo at resona bank a unit of japans fourth largest lender by market value
6341083 weaker economic data could spark sharp dollar selling as traders unwind their positions he said

6341085 in the last day or so the market has begun to question the fundamentals of the recent us dollar recovery he said
6341086 we have seen particular focus on rumours and innuendo about us investment banking
6341087 i still stand by the view interest rate differentials are less us dollar supportive he said
6341088 entry into power generation is consistent with santoss strategy of accelerating the commercialisation of its gas reserves and resources
6341089 looking forward our focus is on delivering the base business and executing our lng and asian growth strategies
6341090 i wouldnt consider it enormously strategic for us whether we had it or didnt have it
6341091 its like trying to stop an aircraft carrier in the middle of the ocean you just cant change these things in the blink of an eye
6341092 a compensation structure that awards origination without regard to investment outcomes is not appropriate
6341093 we recognise that the level of balance sheet leverage that we currently have is not appropriate
6341094 we recognise that we have too many sub scale non strategic assets on our balance sheet
6341095 you cant throw all of that out overnight without seriously damaging the business
6341096 we cant win it back overnight but we have to make a start and we have to deliver consistently on what we say
6341097 as far as we can see obviously aussie bonds were well bid taking direction from the us but really outperforming them
6341098 people are looking at the gasoline inventory drawdown said tetsu emori fund manager at astmax asset management in tokyo
6341099 i think the price is going to be heading to the downside for the medium term to the end of the year he said
6341100 the financials are down today on more negative news out of the us and the market is probably watching the reaction to babcock amp brown
6341101 some of the reports weve had out today have been slightly negative despite some coming out with higher profit theyre indicating forward earnings are coming under pressure
6341102 we are behind soren like a rock not only will our nine mlas support him on the floor of the house but we will also make efforts to make him the chief minister

6341106 this is a grave problem thats only going to be escalating for canadian companies
6341107 if one is going to have facilities and personnel in these high risk countries there will need to be a far higher degree of preparedness and intelligence work on the part of companies
6341108 our canadian business people worldwide generally speaking havent had real reason to be scared in part because of canadas reputation as a friendly country but were seeing that change quickly in places like algeria
6341109 whats happening is that the terrorists in algeria are turning to softer targets further removed from the capital
6341110 theyre looking for soft targets like snc lavalin that are easier to attack as security is beefed up for government and military targets
6341111 we are always monitoring the situation in countries where there is a high risk
6341112 if oil production is down 25 years from now its going to be a different world
6341113 but with oil sands you dont have a decline rate
6341114 our view is that this is a win for all parties involved
6341115 we think this stacks up with many projects around the world for the partners and thats why people stayed at the negotiating table
6341116 this is the beginning of a whole new era for us were now partners at the table
6341117 the hardcore of hardliners in the group in favour of suicide bombings are in charge of the operations on the ground
6341118 there is no easy solution to stop a suicide bomber the only way is to continue to besiege the terrorist strongholds and fight them there it is a race against time
6341119 but the group is viewed increasingly as outsiders coming in to attack algeria theres no evidence they have more support among the population this is still a localised thing
6341120 whether the issue at hand is oil credit or the availability of cheap consumer goods we expect the world to accommodate the american way of life
6341121 there is no vice more painful than luxurious habits says an old chinese saying and its totally true if you can accustom yourself to modest living you are far ahead of your neighbors and you are investing in your peace of mind

6341129 we are now waiting to return him to england as soon as possible
6341130 i was looking at the replay thinking hey i look cool
6341131 ive no problem with him doing a show but i think he should show more respect and shake hands after the finish
6341132 not make gestures like the one he made in the 100m
6341133 he might have interpreted that in another way but the way it was perceived was catch me if you can you dont do that but hell learn hes still a young man
6341134 when he was introduced he was dancing and the crowd loves it it adds a bit of sparkle and cheer
6341135 i love to dance and show people my personality its fun and the crowd loves it
6341136 i was looking at the replay and thinking hey i look cool i was thinking wow that guy looks fast its just a great feeling
6341137 i would not compare myself to michael phelps to win eight golds nobody has done that plus i am on the track and he is in the water hes a great athlete and i congratulate him on what he has achieved
6341138 lots of people compare me to michael johnson but i do not compare myself to other people i am just trying to be myself michael johnson is a great athlete and he revolutionised the sport i just changed it a bit
6341139 usain bolt is a super human being the world has never seen anything like him

6341141 i just want to chill out and sleep i wish it was the weekend so i could chill out in some sandals but we have the 4x100m relays and i have to focus on that the boys are excited about it and i want a third gold medal
6341142 bolt must be considered now the same way like jesse owens should have been in the 1930s bolt has a bigger edge than owens on his rivals

6341158 weishhaupt was backed financially as are most if not all anarchistic leaders by a group of bankers under the house of rothschild it was under their direction that the long range and worldwide plans of the illuminati were drawn up
6341159 we require a pope for ourselves to march more securely to the storming of the church
6341160 the complete annihilation of the catholicism and even ultimately of christianity if christianity were to revive even upon the ruins of rome it would a little later revive and live
6341161 the one is the kingdom of god on earth namely the true church of jesus christ and those who desire from their heart to be united with it the other is the kingdom of satan those who refuse to obey the divine and eternal law and who have many aims of their own in contempt of god and many aims also against god
6341162 at this period however the partisans of evil seems to be combining together and to be struggling with united vehemence led on or assisted by that strongly organized and widespread association called the freemasons no longer making any secret of their purposes they are now boldly rising up against god himself
6341163 there will be no centralized control no uniformity in teaching no universality in practice and worship prayer sacrifice and priesthood
6341164 it is your task here to proclaim the basic rights and duties of man you are the interpreters of all that is permanent in human wisdom we could almost say of its sacred character
6341165 the most honest and natural man was one who believed nothing
6341166 we are about to witness a greater freedom in the life of the church fewer obligations and fewer inward prohibitions formal disciplines will be reduced every form of intolerance will be abolished
6341167 christian tradition has never upheld the right of private property as absolute and untouchable
6341168 only private enterprise can provide the head of a family with the healthy freedom it requires to carry out the duties allotted to him by the creator for the physical spiritual and religious well being of the family
6341169 bodily union has always been the strongest language two people can have for each other

6341242 please be advised that if dfg wishes to engage in foreign currency transactions goldman sachs has extensive capabilities in this area for instance upon receipt of approximately 700 million japanese yen into the above account goldman could convert such funds into approximately 5 million u s dollars
6341243 funds were reversed and withdrawn from our account without our permission
6341244 did you receive the return of 5 117 280 00 back from goldman sachs
6341245 on september 10 1991 we received our august 1st august 31 statement from goldman on the statement enclosed you will see that the japanese yen went to mitsui bank of tokyo which is goldman sachs correspondent bank the monies were then credited to the account and exchanged and deposited u s d equivalent at the rate of exchange that part of the transaction was perfectly normal
6341246 what happened next is what concerns me on august 7 1991 the funds were reversed and withdrawn from our account without our permission there is no reference to the whereabouts or disclosure of the whereabouts of this money or of the receipt of acknowledgement that this transaction even took place

6341251 there was another 120 billion in deutsch mark currency transfers and it is possible the contracts are being withheld until a grand jury subpoenas the officials involved
6341252 the goldman sachs deal as you have informed me is absolutely disappointing i have studied your papers and discussed with the european fiduciary of the yen side to find a way to bring the real acting of goldman sachs to light but nobody here can influence a deal between an american bank and a japanese bank
6341253 as you know goldman sachs did not receive any information from our side to be in a situation to close because we have never contacted them i agree entirely with you and russell colonel hermann that it is most possible that goldman sachs has been inspired by you and this deal to find a source which can deliver yen with discount and as they found out that they cannot execute such a deal as a bank because a private partner has to be the usd supplier they may have used the account of you or of dfg with goldman sachs to fulfill the condition of a private exchange to me this seems to be the most important argument that the acting of goldman sachs is a fraud

6341265 this was july 1 1993 vince foster turned up dead on july 20 and my husband russell was murdered on august 29 1994
6341266 the next day while mowing his lawn on july 2 1993 russell was sprayed with some type of poison gas possibly sarin from a passing vehicle he took a few steps and went down bleeding from the eyes ears and nose
6341267 russell had not finished his report on clinton foster and the mena arkansas drug money laundering she said adding that her husband had cryptically told her
6341268 a 24 foot white box van with no lettering or markings took colonel herman away and he was missing and unaccounted for from 9 00 am till 10 00 pm at night i found him the next day through a phone call at my neighbors
6341269 he was at st marys hospital in clayton missouri in a wing all by himself strapped down to a bed with no life support system when i got to him nothing
6341270 russell was a u s intelligence officer a full colonel and he told me to call my cwo2 chief warrant officer and tell him to get my mandatory two men in here to protect my life
6341271 russell told me they strung him up on meat hooks on the way to the hospital i saw the warning graphic photos hook marks under his collar bone they beat him and burnt him with cigarettes broke his ribs left hand and left arm and shoved a cattle prod into his rectum
6341272 theyll do it again to any of the intelligence guys walking around now if they dont do something to stop these criminals
6341273 the hospital was filled with naval officers and a woman named ruth said you have to sign these papers 4 inch stack and i asked
6341274 when ruth had her back to me another woman slipped me a piece of paper of the hours and medical log sheets with the hour russell was taken to the hospital helping to fix the hours of his torture and the fact that his ambulance authorization had not even been signed
6341275 proving he was tortured in the back of that white truck and this is the united stated veterans administration
6341276 russell was kept there against his will after he recovered until november 17 1993
6341277 something was going on at that hospital i saw a navy commander strapped to a gurney from seal beach tied down a female doctor was sitting there with his wife and they were bartering over his body parts i heard all this with russells doctor friend the commander was alive and strapped there his eyes looked terrified and his mouth was taped shut
6341278 his wife walked over to her husband and said now ill never have to know when youre coming home again
6341279 hillary clintons operatives david horowitz and karen koffee came to meet with russell seeking money to underwrite the national healthcare program she was pushing in 1994
6341280 this was on july 20 russell told me clintons people said youre going to die before very long and your wife will disappear and no one will know where she is and both of them are accessories to murder as far as i am concerned
6341281 russell was doing pretty well around august 1994 and on friday august 26 he said that george bush sr alan greenspan and oliver north came to see him in his hospital room at the va and tried to get him to sign off on the iran and latin america contra accounts so they could get control of them
6341282 but russell told me he just reached down and grabbed a hand full of excrement from his hospital bowel and threw it at president bush saying go to hell then the three of them left the room as i was coming up the other elevator
6341283 i was planning to take russell home from the va the following monday august 29 a couple days after bush greenspan and north visited on friday i came in to pick him up and he was dead
6341284 the attending physician dr pettit refused to do an autopsy even though russells body was all red and he was given 8 or 9 injections on his hip and the base of his skull and his back and body were as red as fire but his eyes were as clear as mine
6341285 the coroner michael vickery took a number of photographs and told me this man was murdered and i had been refused possession of his body for six days from august 29 until september 5 after being told there was evidence that he was frozen alive she told us while still in stunned silence
6341286 i found out the contra accounts were moved from republic bank in texas to republic bank in new york i think teddy lloyd was the banker in new york i believe they knocked russell out and i thought he was dead then they moved him to the guernsey islands near england and used his voice activated and fingerprint codes to sign over control of the 13 17 billion in gold that was in the accounts

6341297 i was not in the right frame of mind to read it
6341298 i thought this sounds too stupid kind of goofball brainless idiotic but then and then i found out it was and i still liked it
6341299 i remember the first thing that came across was that mention of
6341300 but it also made me think that whoever made the decision they could have chosen any movie for him to put onstage made a smart choice not an obvious choice but a funny choice theyre thinking smart people smart writers
6341301 and the rest of the script lived up to that first initial response
6341302 you develop very good peripheral vision you know when youve been recognized right on the edge of your vision
6341303 just by someone turning their head very quickly you go ok i know what that is people dont turn their heads that quickly unless they just saw something and im in the vicinity
6341304 then again it might be a pain but its when they stop doing it thats when you have to worry you think is it all going to dry up is the party over
6341305 i shot my stuff in hawaii early in the shoot the first month
6341306 i was there four or five weeks which on tropic thunder equates to about 20 minutes of screen time
6341307 i came to night at the museum because ben saw my stuff and asked to meet me in london
6341308 its like being summoned before royalty you know youve been summoned to the court of stiller im probably not in the inner circle but im on the inner outer circle or the other inner circle of the court of stiller
6341309 and im a huge admirer of his the work hes done the choices hes made especially with tropic thunder he is a sort of comedy godzilla but someone whos managed to retain his voice its not dumbed down hes managed to do the almost impossible thing of becoming globally successful and still retaining this sharp edge
6341310 weirdly those two little characters that owen and i played they registered really strongly with the audience it baffles me
6341311 im very pleased and grateful but i dont know the studio says weve done all these audience tests and the audience really love you and owen as these two little guys and im going ok great
6341312 i have no idea why but im very happy and pleased
6341313 three months from todays date you will get some very good news

6341319 the government will decide whether to accept the appeal or not based on public opinion
6341320 we dont link humanitarian aid to political issues such as the nuclear issue
6341321 i will nominate a person to be vice president my running mate who shares my principles my values and my priorities
6341322 yes i work out and take care of myself but i also like a cold beer once in a while
6341323 we believe that people who choose to look after themselves those who do the things to make their lives better should have the opportunity to do this in all aspects of their lives why not the beer they drink
6341324 since launch we have enjoyed a remarkable growth in membership and the number of luxury fashion and beauty brands we work with we had reached a point where the business had to accommodate the needs of our members and look to the future
6341325 we turned to aqueduct to create an easily adaptable web platform upon which we can launch further web assets as required aqueduct have understood exactly what we needed as a business and conceived and delivered a savvy digital strategy that will hugely enhance our offering and cater for our expansion
6341326 this project has been an overwhelming success the website answers the needs of both fashion confidential and its members its inspiring and represents the high fashion brands that appear in the range
6341327 were excited by the further opportunities already underway that will be built upon the web platform weve put in place for fashion confidential
6341328 it was the wrong decision and i think anybody that knows anything about the game knows that
6341329 theres no doubt in my mind i would have made those saves and the fact of the matter is its not 2004 anymore its 2007 and i think you have to live in the present and you cant live by big names you cant live in the past it doesnt matter what somebody did in an olympic gold medal game in the olympics three years ago now is what matters and thats what i think
6341330 i know hope is probably very happy to see brazil
6341331 it has nothing to do with those shots that got by scurry
6341332 that was 11 months ago i dont think its a personal thing anymore i think its our team wanting to reclaim what we could have gotten at the world cup it has nothing to do with anything personal right now
6341333 i think it would be nice to play brazil because you always want to reclaim what you could have had
6341334 i got five different stories about what happened i said to each player ok two questions one do you want to win
6341335 ok thats why they are here the fact is we want to move on were in this together
6341336 ive never been that player thats been overly close with my teammates just because were all so busy

6341338 ah well just run some cloud management software on a bunch of machines
6341339 no desire to see your real life suffer as a consequence of playing dont forget your friends your family your school or your work
6341340 we decided to end it before we risked turning into a horrible news story about how video games ruin peoples lives
6341341 wtf at the people who still kept fighting it past the third hour

6341349 theres a week long period in which the signatures are available for review by anyone and absent an objection itll be certified on the ballot
6341350 we were able to come up with well over 10 000 signatures in just about a month of doing this just at a handful of events were very confident we will get a similar response on a ballot in november
6341351 there have been hundreds even thousands of people who have rotated through there over the years
6341352 any veteran who qualifies in madison county is guaranteed a spot this is really an investment over time not something thats just going to be used by a select number of people
6341353 the best case scenario for the vote would be to get a large majority in favor of the shelter care home then a county board member would make a motion for the vote to go ahead with construction
6341354 it comes down to this fact should the county be in the health care provider business and most of the board says no
6341355 irgendwie scheint alles leichter einfacher sch ner im sommer wenn es warm ist wenn die sonne scheint liegt das wirklich nur am wetter oder liegt es an uns an dem was wir machen an den perfekten tagen
6341356 i think its a well meaning initiative i just think its wrong
6341357 the argument that appears to be being made is well people break the law anyway so lets just change the law and its not a winning argument for me
6341358 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
6341359 as a catholic franciscan liberal arts university we feel it is our duty to commit to open dialogue on this issue since it directly affects the health and well being of our students
6341360 because the drinking age often helps shape the culture of a college campus we felt it was important to be informed and involved in this process
6341361 it is clear that for the 18 to 21 year olds as a society we are failing because these laws we have are very abused and essentially ignored by the people in this age group
6341362 whatever we do we have to increase our programs of education we have to continue to work with young people to have them understand the chemical relationship of what theyre doing
6341363 you want us to die for our country yet we cant have a beer
6341364 this is a responsibility we take very seriously and strongly believe that our students are better served when they are armed with information on the damaging effects of underage binge drinking
6341365 the science says that a persons brain is really not fully developed until theyre about 21 22 23
6341366 you know folks they left a paper trail it will speak louder than any witness
6341367 he slapped me and called me a whore and a slut because i was sharing my body with
6341368 come up to my bedroom if i am sleeping or not and massage me i need it i love you ray
6341369 the fact is john is not the man jen thought he was
6341370 once again she feels she has been mislead by a man she cared deeply about only to be left disappointed
6341371 jen and john made a pact not to go public about their relationship when they were together and now they are apart he has gone and shot his mouth off at the first opportunity
6341372 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
6341373 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
6341374 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
6341375 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
6341376 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
6341377 am primit niste vesti proaste astazi bunul nostru prieten leroi moore a decedat astazi si ii vom simti lipsa pentru totdeauna
6341378 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
6341379 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
6341380 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
6341381 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
6341382 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
6341383 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
6341384 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
6341385 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
6341386 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
6341387 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
6341388 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
6341389 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
6341390 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
6341391 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
6341392 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
6341393 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
6341394 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
6341395 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
6341396 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
6341397 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
6341398 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
6341399 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
6341400 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
6341401 who are open to doing something on the production side
6341402 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
6341403 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
6341404 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
6341405 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
6341406 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
6341407 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
6341408 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
6341409 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
6341410 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
6341411 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment

6341413 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
6341414 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
6341415 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
6341416 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
6341417 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
6341418 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
6341419 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
6341420 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
6341421 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
6341422 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
6341423 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
6341424 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
6341425 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
6341426 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
6341427 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
6341428 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
6341429 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
6341430 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
6341431 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
6341432 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
6341433 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
6341434 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
6341435 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
6341436 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
6341437 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
6341438 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
6341439 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
6341440 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
6341441 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
6341442 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
6341443 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
6341444 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
6341445 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
6341446 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
6341447 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
6341448 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
6341449 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
6341450 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
6341451 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
6341452 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
6341453 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
6341454 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
6341455 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
6341456 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
6341457 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough

6341509 and i think as we look forward a lot will depend on the behavior of consumers if they choose to spend their money well get out of the slow times fast if however on the other hand they decided to save it or pay off debt were looking at a more bear market

6341574 it does a lot of tweaking of the federal financial aid program
6341575 the transparency of book costs is just a small part of that bill
6341576 we try to get a picture of the full costs not just what we bill
6341577 one of the projects we have scheduled this year is writing an interface between axess and efollett com
6341578 such an interface will make it easier for students to identify the materials they should secure for the courses they have selected
6341579 we havent worked out the details and student input is welcome but we hope that the information will be complete including isbn codes so students may shop with other vendors as desired for price service vendor loyalty etc
6341580 we hope to encourage our faculty to select and designate their materials before axess opens each quarter so students will have ample time to shop for their course materials
6341581 we dont see radical changes coming as a result of the bill
6341582 as far as were concerned we will sell what the faculty asks us to sell
6341583 we dont act as an independent adjudicator of what the faculty assigns their students
6341584 with stanford being a level one research university theres a lot of thought from professors about what students really need to learn
6341585 the more we can do to keep those book prices down the better it is for students
6341586 we know that there are better more effective modalities to try to prevent infection such as combination therapies for the mother
6341587 we need to continue to work towards using more effective regimens in mothers both for their own benefit as well as to prevent infection in their babies
6341588 what we see with our commonly available tests is not really the full picture of whats there and what resistance is developing in the mother
6341589 from that standpoint there is probably even more room for concern but again in terms of the public health response the availability of single dose nevirapine is very valuable because it allows public health departments to actually start addressing the problem to start building infrastructure around something that seemed doable
6341590 in uk alone two million people have diabetes up to 750 000 are believed to be afflicted without even realising it
6341591 one broader issue regarding the kma report is if the hospital can be asked or be expected to provide land
6341592 we dont control the land the hospital leases the land from the university also no other employer whos creating jobs has ever had to create housing it is not reasonable to think that the hospital should be able to do that
6341593 property at quarry and el camino and another parcel at quarry and arboretum are already planned for housing under the santa clara county general use permit
6341594 they are part of the academic campus not leased to the hospital the fact that this housing near the medical center is already planned by the university is another reason we do not think building housing for hospital employees is necessary
6341595 the analysis only gives you an estimate of how many employees might need housing at certain income levels but it doesnt tell how many employees may want to live in palo alto
6341596 people make decisions for where they want to live on a number of issues not just proximity to work
6341597 local housing can reduce the need for lower income employees to commute in from very long distances
6341598 new housing will cause more local trips but these are trips which can be translated to walk bike and shuttle alternatives
6341599 when all of the studies currently being conducted for the environmental impact report are completed the information will enable us to fully analyze issues that may be interdependent
6341600 we feel it is necessary to take a comprehensive approach and not an individual approach
6341601 no one wants to give up too much too early on
6341602 there are obviously some differences and issues with mitigation however by the release of the eir later in the year everything should be negotiated and smoothed out
6341603 wir wollten uns anerkennung sowohl von der gesellschaftlichen als auch der kirchlichen seite holen
6341604 dass wir doch noch nicht so weit sind wie wir dachten
6341605 es ist wichtig dass die menschen homosexuelle in ihrem alltag erleben
6341606 eine segnung eingetragener lebenspartnerschaften durch katholische seelsorger sei nicht m glich hei t es in einer mitteilung des bistums angeblich habe die segnung sowohl bei evangelischen christen als auch bei katholiken proteste ausgel st
6341607 it would have been a snub to william and harry to have left their girlfriends names off the guest list
6341608 they are senior advocates and did not tender either conditional or unconditional apology for their conduct in the case
6341609 we are not dealing with young lawyers both are seasoned lawyers and such conduct was not expected of them
6341610 indeed and thats about the angriest thing angela merkel can possibly say shes the tight lipped reserved type you see
6341611 one can hardly hail from two more historically losing causes than the south and judaism both my cultures have long tragic pasts and not one jot of it has been forgotten
6341612 the story of southern jews is the story of sons not wanting to work in their fathers businesses
6341613 intended to rubber stamp a russian interpretation of the plan that we do not agree with
6341614 calls upon the parties concerned to implement the above mentioned plan in good faith
6341615 no one can object to the security council endorsing the six principles of the russian and french presidents which form the foundation of all current efforts to normalize the situation
6341616 to put the spotlight on the fact that the russians have not withdrawn
6341617 we will assess the situation on the ground and whether there are concrete and credible signs of withdrawal in the days ahead we will see based on this
6341618 well work on situations hitting making sure our tackling is where it should be
6341619 there wont be any aggressive action from anyone on our side we will behave in a pragmatic manner there will definitely not be a cold war
6341620 i am planning over the next few days to give certain signals concerning military cooperation
6341621 i think the signals will be received positively without russias support in afghanistan nato would face a new vietnam and this is clear to everyone militarily nato and russia have a very good and trusting relationship
6341622 decisions are being taken on the current cooperation and not about cooperation in general rogozin said
6341623 these decisions are of temporary character of regional character not global character
6341624 i will bet that everyones upset that they havent had you
6341625 up 4 anything but 215 pounds is the highest ill go
6341626 this helps reserve and guard family members to be able to continue to see civilian providers with whom they have established relations and promotes access and clinically appropriate continuity of care
6341627 not just to show all of the veterans how much we care about them and honor them but also to remind future congresses that freedom is not free that a price is very high when the president calls on our armed forces to deliver and when they do we honor them and will always remember their memory
6341628 thats what sprang us into action to make things easier for families that are grieving
6341629 the courts are moving to the position where government can fund religious activities and endorse religion without restraint
6341630 theres quite a powerful trend here in the courts to take the supreme courts decision and really run with it
6341631 i have not yet seen one case where people have brought up this standing issue where the government has lost and the taxpayers have won every single one has been thrown out this is really quite significant
6341632 basically what we wanted to do is create something which would give military members a better means of assessing how their pay stacked up in comparison to civilians
6341633 that in fact was a recommendation of this qrmc and it was enacted before the publication of this document eakle said
6341634 and so now its up to the department to begin the process of drafting out the instructions to adopt this
6341635 today we have an s amp i budget that quite frankly is rather small in comparison to the size of the other pay accounts
6341636 and because of that it doesnt give the service as much flexibility for arranging pay
6341637 we would recommend that they get a rebate on their bah
6341638 the range we are talking about is going from zero for people in the one plus one dormitories up to a 25 rebate for those who are living in ships with hot bunk arrangements
6341639 so youd be able to give people something in recognition of the fact that housing is not at the dod standard
6341640 we looked very seriously at this recommendation but weve chosen not to accept it and are not going to endorse the change
6341641 we dont think thats in keeping with our spirit of being fair and equitable to all members
6341642 there is a perception that the system we have today is inequitable because only 15 of all enlisted personnel and less than half of officers will ever receive anything in the system
6341643 this is a payment made for achieving a particular year of service
6341644 and within the services they would have the flexibility to vary this by year of service as well as by skill that way they could begin to shape the skills by dragging people further into their career by offering them an incentive
6341645 the separation payments would be made available by the service to members that they wished to entice to leave
6341646 therefore the recommendation of this qrmc is that the department of defense conducts a multi year test of this system the way the test would work is this all four services would be asked to identify some skills that have different types of retention patterns some that stay not very long some that stay longer periods of time and ones they wish to influence the test would offer people in those skills in the first eight years of service an opportunity to volunteer if someone was selected for the test they would be paid all of the tsp that they should have earned up until that point and it will be put in their tsp account for them the programs vesting rules would in fact apply to all those individuals so should they achieve 10 years of service while they are in the test they would fully own it at the end of the test period people who are in the new system who wish to revert to the original retirement system would be allowed to do so
6341647 retiree fees ought to relate to how much the plan is worth the higher value plans should have higher premiums associated with them the panel believes fees need to be fair to all retired military members they ought to reflect how much income an individual has so that if they make more money and are therefore better able to pay for a system they should do so
6341648 essentially what this says to you is that we are asking our older retirees who are in fact the least likely to hold jobs and therefore have the lowest incomes to pay the most for their system
6341649 we believe we need to get some parity between our older and our younger retirees the panel wants to redress some of this imbalance we believe that the under 65 retirees should begin paying 40 of the medicare part b premium using the same fee structure that is laid on by the medicare system adding that this should bring the system into a semblance of parity in addition we believe that the under 65 retirees who elect to use tricare standard and extra need to pay a small fee for that and we would suggest to the department that that fee be set at 15 of the medicare part b we think the family rate should be set at double the individual rate and that the premium increase needs to be phased in over four years
6341650 this stuff would slop around it would drip on you
6341651 youd walk through it and get it on your shoes on your clothes on your hands they didnt give us any protective clothing at all
6341652 this has huge implications for men especially in the va
6341653 these treatment courts will address the specific challenges with drugs and alcohol too many veterans face when returning home from their honorable service overseas
6341654 for those who have given so much for our country we should address the serious issues of drug and alcohol addiction in an appropriate forum that recognizes that some veterans fall victim to substance abuse as a way to handle post traumatic stress its well past time we offered our veterans services worthy of their sacrifice
6341655 some of the brave men and women who have served our country fall victim to alcohol and drug addiction and end up in our criminal justice system drug courts are an effective way to break this cycle of abuse and help these veterans re enter society the alaska court system already has successful drug courts in anchorage fairbanks bethel juneau and ketchikan and there is a veterans court in anchorage this bill would provide additional funding for some of alaskas existing therapeutic court programs and would allow more nonviolent offender programs to be developed across the state the serv act is particularly important for alaska which has one of the highest veterans per capita rates in the nation
6341656 i take my running shoes seriously since comfort while pounding mile after mile really does boil down to the quality of the shoe
6341657 this is just another reason why we play in bathing suits

6341659 this is the best italian food ive had in san francisco
6341660 fuck it im going to pasta pomodoro instead parkings fine over near union
6341661 but there is no reason to believe that there is an agreement yet
6341662 there are still issues concerning exactly how our forces operate
6341663 ultimately the prime minister has to make the call on moving forward
6341664 a chance for me to meet with the prime minister and see what we can do from washington to get to closure
6341665 but praise be to allah now i can devote the rest of my life to studying and writing about islam
6341666 it was partly because i openly pray five times a day
6341667 and also because i used to greet listeners with an adyghe ethnic group including kabardins blessing which mentions allah
6341668 it would have been too brazen to sack me for the real reason as that would have been seen as persecution for religious belief so they just said it was due to a reduction in staff
6341669 in the same way that russians think they are christian people here automatically consider themselves muslim if they are kabardian
6341670 but i didnt understand why my father said it was necessary we were living under the communist regime and no contemporaries prayed you couldnt study islam freely then
6341671 i began to understand that you are a muslim believer only if you utter the shahadah declaration of belief in allah and mohammed as his prophet profess tawhid monotheism and follow the canons of islam keep away from haram what is forbidden and do good deeds
6341672 alhamdulillah arabic praise be to allah i am glad i was sacked
6341673 now i can devote the rest of my life to studying and writing about islam
6341674 i brought him up to be honest just as my parents did me but what job can you go to if you pray five times a day if youre a muslim
6341675 no one at the trial testified that he passed a copy to me
6341676 he just disappeared we still dont know whether hes alive or dead

6341704 i was looking at the replay thinking hey i look cool
6341705 ive no problem with him doing a show but i think he should show more respect and shake hands after the finish
6341706 not make gestures like the one he made in the 100m
6341707 he might have interpreted that in another way but the way it was perceived was catch me if you can you dont do that but hell learn hes still a young man
6341708 when he was introduced he was dancing and the crowd loves it it adds a bit of sparkle and cheer
6341709 i love to dance and show people my personality its fun and the crowd loves it
6341710 i was looking at the replay and thinking hey i look cool i was thinking wow that guy looks fast its just a great feeling
6341711 i would not compare myself to michael phelps to win eight golds nobody has done that plus i am on the track and he is in the water hes a great athlete and i congratulate him on what he has achieved
6341712 lots of people compare me to michael johnson but i do not compare myself to other people i am just trying to be myself michael johnson is a great athlete and he revolutionised the sport i just changed it a bit

6341716 bolt must be considered now the same way like jesse owens should have been in the 1930s bolt has a bigger edge than owens on his rivals

6341748 as one of the judges i was thrilled and inspired to see such a diverse and creative range of proposals for how to make the daily work of scientists easier and more productive we await the semi finalists presentations in december with bated breath
6341749 the semi finalists will be given access to more than half a million life science articles including their images and supplementary files in order to build their tool
6341750 access to such a large and diverse body of work will give them the opportunity to scale up their ideas and really test them to see if they can make something that will change the way life scientists read write visualize even think about data

6341764 the ark we heard it was in ephratah we found it in the fields of jearim let us go to gods dwelling place let us fall upon our knees before his footstool
6341765 a son the fruit of your body will i set upon your throne if your children keep my covenant and my testimonies that i shall teach them their children will sit upon your throne for evermore
6341766 this shall be my resting place for ever here will i dwell for i delight in her i will surely bless her provisions and satisfy her poor with bread i will clothe her priests with salvation and her faithful people will rejoice and sing there will i make the horn of david flourish i have prepared a lamp for my anointed as for his enemies i will clothe them with shame but as for him his crown will shine
6341767 it may be that my children have sinned and cursed god in their hearts
6341768 from going to and fro on the earth and from walking up and down on it
6341769 have you considered my servant job there is no one like him on the earth a blameless and upright man who fears god and turns away from evil
6341770 does job fear god for nothing have you not put a fence around him and his house and all that he has on every side you have blessed the work of his hands and his possessions have increased in the land but stretch out your hand now and touch all that he has and he will curse you to your face
6341771 very well all that he has is in your power only do not stretch out your hand against him
6341772 the oxen were plowing and the donkeys were feeding beside them and the sabeans fell on them and carried them off and killed the servants with the edge of the sword i alone have escaped to tell you
6341773 the fire of god fell from heaven and burned up the sheep and the servants and consumed them i alone have escaped to tell you
6341774 the chaldeans formed three columns made a raid on the camels and carried them off and killed the servants with the edge of the sword i alone have escaped to tell you
6341775 your sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brothers house and suddenly a great wind came across the desert struck the four corners of the house and it fell on the young people and they are dead i alone have escaped to tell you
6341776 naked i came from my mothers womb and naked shall i return there the lord gave and the lord has taken away blessed be the name of the lord
6341777 get up and go toward the south to the road that goes down from jerusalem to gaza
6341778 like a sheep he was led to the slaughter and like a lamb silent before its shearer so he does not open his mouth in his humiliation justice was denied him who can describe his generation for his life is taken away from the earth
6341779 about whom may i ask you does the prophet say this about himself or about someone else
6341780 look here is water what is to prevent me from being baptized
6341781 to put it into perspective there are more microbes than there are cells in the human body in fact they often are the first line of defense against disease or environmental disasters
6341782 microbes are mostly our friends but sometimes they can be pretty nasty
6341783 this approach will advance human progress in environmental protection public health and safety sustainable energy and many other research areas
6341784 the computational tools will pave the way to less expensive and more reliable tests that can be used across the globe the sheer number of microbial communities presents great commercial potential
6341785 itanium based systems with their relatively large caches provide the effective memory bandwidth we need for fast processing of genomic information their high availability design has been serving us very well providing very dependable access for years
6341786 the efficiency and availability of the itanium systems have enabled us to make very rapid progress and broaden our research into a broad range of genomes
6341787 further studies into the cellular and molecular processes leading to these changes could have implications for understanding and treating brain infections brain tumors and neurodegenerative disorders
6341788 astrocyte polarization as opposed to hypertrophy may be due to the fact that t cells engage in a very focused attack and the astrocytes respond in a directed polarized manner we know that the astrocytes respond in this polarized manner but we are continuing to investigate precisely why
6341789 we believe this is part of a defensive astrocyte response that may serve to destroy the attacking t cells
6341790 when a t cell recognizes an astrocyte infected with a virus or identified as a foreign cell it launches an attack in response the astrocyte polarizes toward the t cell and may actually end up engulfing the aggressor if so this could be a novel unique mechanism of defense by brain cells against immune cells
6341791 t cells immunological synapses induce polarization of brain astrocytes in vivo and in vitro a novel astrocyte response mechanism to cellular injury
6341792 despite the attention that stem cell research has received most of the work has been restricted to biological approaches
6341793 for those discoveries to go from the test tube into treatments that heal injuries and cure diseases we will need to equip a broad range of scientists and engineers with stem cell knowledge and expertise
6341794 with this nsf support rutgers will prepare more students to conduct breakthrough research that reveals new knowledge in fundamental biology and accelerates the use of stem cells in the treatment of debilitating injuries and diseases
6341795 it will boost our standing as one of the worlds top universities for stem cell research and training
6341796 by broadening the scope of stem cell research to encompass molecular biosciences engineering and physical sciences the grant will strengthen our efforts to find cures for brain and spinal cord injuries and disorders
6341797 with this project igerts interdisciplinary approach is advancing transformative science by bringing researchers from different worlds together to realize the promise of stem cells
6341798 what you would desire others to do for you you should do for others you should respect others as you want to be respected by them

6341815 were refocusing efforts on delivering a firefox 2 gt 3 major update within the next week
6341816 were pretty committed to user choice but were also pretty ardent that firefox 3 0 is a good product
6341817 you can decline the update when its offered if you if dont want it
6341818 well start and make sure the mirror network is not overloaded
6341819 one thing we heard from users was whether there was a problem with firefox 2 0
6341820 theres been a good buzz around it and for people who have gotten firefox 2 0 its been a while since theyve had a major update
6341821 el sistema de salud colombiano est soportado sobre estructuras econ micas y no sobre un marco de derechos lo que lo convierte en inequitativo y excluyente
6341822 no obstante esos avances que fueron significativos en los primeros a os de desarrollo de la norma han tendido a estancarse por lo cual subsisten problemas muy serios de inequidad universalidad y calidad del servicio de salud
6341823 lo cual parece contrario al principio de no discriminaci n que debe gobernar las pol ticas sociales
6341824 se trata de un modelo mec nico que busca la eficiencia econ mica y no la satisfacci n del derecho a la salud
6341825 por esa raz n el congreso lo reform mediante la ley 100 el nuevo sistema basado en el aseguramiento elimina el efecto del ingreso sobre el uso de servicios dando cabida tanto a los que tienen como a los pobres
6341826 en resumen el sistema de salud colombiano muestra gradualidad hacia el cumplimiento de los objetivos de universalidad expresado como afiliaci n al sistema y aumento en la equidad y en el uso de servicios avanza de manera sostenida al cumplimiento de las metas adoptadas por los convenios internacionales
6341827 a largo plazo le aporta estabilidad al sistema permite la participaci n social les da a las personas la condici n de cliente fundamental de los prestadores permite el manejo de recursos con destinaci n espec fica provee mecanismos para identificar a los beneficiarios mejora la eficiencia y estimula la calidad

6341873 vegetation adjacent to the crossing had grown to the point where the truck driver could not see the approaching train even if he had stopped as required the atsb said
6341874 the report makes it clear that truck drivers were gambling with their lives whenever they used the two wells level crossing said ata chairman trevor martyn
6341875 under the australian standard truck drivers should have been able to look north for 600 metres up the railway line to see oncoming trains
6341876 but the vegetation growing next to the track meant that truck drivers could only see for 60m
6341877 in other words they could not see an oncoming train until it was too late to do anything about it
6341878 every day truck drivers gamble with death or serious injury when they go over level crossings with badly placed stop signs and inadequate sighting distances he said

6341894 i think the team just came together the first time we played them cuba kicked our butts but that didnt deter us
6341895 we always fight we came together as one unit when we first started playing we played individually it was ugly and we made a lot of errors
6341896 the us team played very well however we didnt especially on service and reception
6341897 there were two points that differed from the preliminary game where cuba did very well on serve and reception
6341898 the us did it very well and we didnt they were very well prepared and played to their potential
6341899 my teammates had enough confidence in me to set me the ball to win the match and i was just thinking is this me did i just do that
6341900 its not good for us but this is what happens in football one team loses and one team wins against argentina its always very difficult with a great rivalry

6341911 the beautiful thing of the world we live in today is that i went upstairs to my office i googled her name i found her website and was like yes she doesnt have an agent
6341912 every other month for a year i stayed in touch with the family i sent emails and finally a year later he calls and says now is the time to come down
6341913 they gave me nothing it was just such a steely russian thing they were so eating my brain and i walked away saying i blew it
6341914 but after three times going down there i got a call saying
6341915 i said theres only one reason i would do this book
6341916 it has to teach girls some people come here and instead of standing up for themselves they feel they have to go along with whatevers happening in order to get a job or be famous
6341917 i never drank except a couple sips of wine at thanksgiving
6341918 because you end up in so many unfamiliar places from africa

6341922 the apology has been given and it wont be repeated
6341923 the motivation and timing behind the announcements are the subject of much debate what is clear is that many of those canadians most affected by these acknowledgments live in some of the most competitive ridings in canada particularly in british columbia and central canada
6341924 in order for this apology to be considered genuine more efforts must be undertaken to correct current oppressive measures under the indian act that prevent indigenous peoples from prospering socially culturally politically and economically and while we may recognize the governments admission of guilt the fact remains that many obstacles must be removed in order to give meaning to the spirit and intent of their apology
6341925 the historical injustices of the chinese head tax are being replicated today through canadas exploitative guest worker programs and restrictive immigration policies
6341926 the descendants of these policies will be demanding apologies in future decades we should deal with this present reality and not just dwell on the past especially if a history that we are supposed to have learnt from is repeating itself
6341927 we gain self respect by setting our own standards and holding ourselves accountable to them we gain clarity and confidence by knowing which lines we will not cross and we gain nobility by paying heed to principles larger than ourselves those who live with honor are the backbone of our society and the ones who ultimately reap lifes richest rewards

6341939 even getting it out to sea doesnt mean saving the whale
6341940 its looking like its too big a mountain to climb
6341941 were racking our brains but we need to be realistic about this
6341942 to look after this little whale you need to suckle it for 11 months thats never been done anywhere in the word before for a whale this size or for that long
6341943 you then need to get it to the antarctic where its food supply is letting it go off sydney its got a 2000km trip to make it doesnt know how to avoid killer whales or how to find krill
6341944 theres a whole range of extremely serious problems with the idea of getting this little whale through to getting it released in the wild thats the advice were getting from every single expert that weve spoken to

6341947 i feel depressed like garbage therefore there must be reasons

6341970 we are looking at something verging on the incredibly bizarre as she got older she got shorter and broader and was reduced to a giant gelatinous blob carrying many thousands of eggs
6341971 her shape was likely to have affected her behaviour and ability to hunt i cant imagine her jetting herself around in the water at any great speed and she was too gelatinous to have been a fighting machine
6341972 its likely she was just blobbing around the seabed carrying her brood of eggs living on dead fish while her mate was off hunting

6341979 when you are in hospital and feeling so much pain and feeling so tired you dont want to want to think about the next day or week you just think about the next hour
6341980 it teaches you to be patient when you are lying in a hospital bed and that was almost the same strategy i chose here to wait for my chance in the pack
6341981 that would be more in the spirit of the olympic ideal
6341982 dons comments at the time raised questions and we sought clarification as to what he meant by unfair after the hearing
6341983 he said he regretted the choice of words and as much as he may disagree with the decision he did not intend any suggestion of bias or lack of procedure by the panel the judiciary chairman or the judiciary staff
6341984 he has apologised if that suggestion has been taken and his apology has been forwarded to the judiciary
6341985 their role is to be as consistent as they possibly can and i know they spend hours and hours each week reviewing incidents and comparing them to previous incidents to try and ensure that they are consistent
6341986 but the fact is each case has its own particular features and no two cases are ever completely alike and then it becomes a matter of judgement
6341987 but you always draw the line at any suggestion theyre being less than professional and honest in the way they carry out their duties
6341988 it was important to make sure my future beyond next year was sorted out as soon as possible especially now that i have a young family
6341989 when the cowboys showed an interest it made sense that i signed with them considering im from queensland and its a little bit closer to home
6341990 while theyve struggled a bit this year the cowboys have some great players and with a bit of luck i can enjoy as much success there as i have in melbourne
6341991 the explosion occurred in a vacant car left at the blast scene we believe the blast was the result of plastic explosives set off by remote control
6341992 the parliament of nsw has a clear responsibility to the people of nsw to pass the legislation to ensure the economy of nsw is on a firm footing for the future
6341993 i think its highly unlikely dissenting alp mps will change their position
6341994 this battle will continue until such time as the government withdraws these proposals from the parliament
6341995 as an entrepreneur i am always looking for ways to diversify my portfolio with good ideas and good people
6341996 yes i work out and take care of myself but i also like a cold beer once in a while
6341997 dons comments at the time raised questions and we sought clarification as to what he meant by unfair after the hearing
6341998 he said he regretted the choice of words and as much as he may disagree with the decision he did not intend any suggestion of bias or lack of procedure by the panel the judiciary chairman or the judiciary staff
6341999 he has apologised if that suggestion has been taken and his apology has been forwarded to the judiciary
6342000 their role is to be as consistent as they possibly can and i know they spend hours and hours each week reviewing incidents and comparing them to previous incidents to try and ensure that they are consistent
6342001 but the fact is each case has its own particular features and no two cases are ever completely alike and then it becomes a matter of judgement
6342002 but you always draw the line at any suggestion theyre being less than professional and honest in the way they carry out their duties
6342003 according to the law the airline must take responsibility as it brought in someone who is persona non grata
6342004 the first priority is that he must continue his journey to london as originally booked
6342005 god am i happy to be leaving vietnam and that jail i should never have been in there
6342006 it was important to make sure my future beyond next year was sorted out as soon as possible especially now that i have a young family
6342007 when the cowboys showed an interest it made sense that i signed with them considering im from queensland and its a little bit closer to home
6342008 while theyve struggled a bit this year the cowboys have some great players and with a bit of luck i can enjoy as much success there as i have in melbourne
6342009 the colossal species has a reputation for being an aggressive and dangerous predator and have been feared and misrepresented in the past
6342010 my research suggests theyre not the t rex of the sea they get more docile as they mature a strange phenomenon that has caught scientists off guard
6342011 we are looking at something verging on the incredibly bizarre as she got older she got shorter and broader and was reduced to a giant gelatinous blob carrying many thousands of eggs
6342012 her shape was likely to have affected her behaviour and ability to hunt i cant imagine her jetting herself around in the water at any great speed and she was too gelatinous to have been a fighting machine
6342013 its likely she was just blobbing around the seabed carrying her brood of eggs living on dead fish while her mate was off hunting
6342014 when you are in hospital and feeling so much pain and feeling so tired you dont want to want to think about the next day or week you just think about the next hour
6342015 it teaches you to be patient when you are lying in a hospital bed and that was almost the same strategy i chose here to wait for my chance in the pack
6342016 that would be more in the spirit of the olympic ideal
6342017 they have experienced some of these natural disasters and after a lot of hard work and support they are able to stabilize
6342018 thats what i think their challenge is and they seem to continue to have met it over the years
6342019 the real issue is whether or not were in a period where these floods are occurring more frequently or not
6342020 one of the most beautiful magnificent places in the world and should be seen by everyone
6342021 it really truly is among the most beautiful places on earth
6342022 when you get down by havasu falls its as though kodak made an outdoor movie set
6342023 i would never go back there in my life because if anything like that happens again theres no organization theres no plan
6342024 for the pacific islands forum to declare an unequivocal condemnation of bainimarama the interim prime minister of fiji is itself unprecedented
6342025 secondly what was unprecedented was for the first time the forum countries giving definition to special measures that is the inclusion of suspension thirdly a timeline
6342026 forum should be more concerned about assisting fiji and resolving this particular issue and not putting it into a corner and making demands on it
6342027 i feel that forum would be weakened without fijis presence i dont think in the long term fiji has much to lose if its not the member of the forum
6342028 the interim government has been making excuses all this time simply for the purpose of delaying elections
6342029 they have also signalled that they will not let the issue drop
6342030 there is no technical administrative or managerial reason why elections cant be held by the end of march next year only political will is lacking
6342031 in practical terms i dont think there is any prospect of fiji restoring its relations with its very important donors if it goes down a road of refusing to engage with the forum around the proper timetable fiji has already greatly undermined its economy the living standards of its people
6342032 despite being amongst the lowest contributors to factors causing climate change the pacific islands region is one of the most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change including its exacerbation of climate variability sea level rise and extreme weather events
6342033 its like trying to stop an aircraft carrier in the middle of the ocean you just cant change these things in the blink of an eye
6342034 a compensation structure that awards origination without regard to investment outcomes is not appropriate
6342035 we recognise that the level of balance sheet leverage that we currently have is not appropriate
6342036 we recognise that we have too many sub scale non strategic assets on our balance sheet
6342037 you cant throw all of that out overnight without seriously damaging the business
6342038 for the pacific islands forum to declare an unequivocal condemnation of bainimarama the interim prime minister of fiji is itself unprecedented
6342039 secondly what was unprecedented was for the first time the forum countries giving definition to special measures that is the inclusion of suspension thirdly a timeline
6342040 forum should be more concerned about assisting fiji and resolving this particular issue and not putting it into a corner and making demands on it

6342049 i have been a dolly fan all of my life she is a wonderful woman i really connect with her music and i cant think of a better role model for my children

6342054 at first i was concerned that he would miss summer workouts
6342055 i thought that he was one of our leaders on and off the field i thought that he needed to be there but after talking to him ive changed my opinion i definitely thought this was a positive experience for him
6342056 the basic training and football training were pretty much the same the difference is that physical training is all day and all night it was very hard mentally and that was the part that was a bit harder than football
6342057 theres a sense that its a cutting edge destination where they can be among the first to learn firsthand about another culture
6342058 theres something about being one of the first in your generation to really have a deep understanding
6342059 its probably the most different and most unorthodox place i could think of
6342060 i kind of wanted that as opposed to england where the prestige is there but the life experience is kind of similar
6342061 i think thats one of the real divisions between studying abroad in europe and studying abroad in asia
6342062 even if it was harder than i expected it to be thats not necessarily a bad thing because i grew up a lot
6342063 were pretty sure that china can take more but exactly how many and in what fields and what would it take to double or quadruple the numbers thats something we as an industry will have to explore
6342064 i would have been sorely disappointed if i had left after the first semester
6342065 honestly its the best thing i could have my done for my career
6342066 it also means its our turn to be as corrupt and irresponsible to the democratic process as their white predecessors have been
6342067 i recall john f kennedy president of the united states when he became president he recommended his brother right

6342082 the purpose of data networks is to satisfy human impatience
6342083 at the center of our being is a point of nothingness which is untouched by sin and by illusion a point of pure truth a point or spark which belongs entirely to god which is never at our disposal from which god disposes of our lives which is inaccessible to the fantasies of our own mind or the brutalities of our own will this little point of nothingness and of absolute poverty is the pure glory of god within us it is so to speak his name written is us as our poverty as our indigence as our dependence as our sonship it is like a pure diamond blazing with the invisible light of heaven it is in everybody and if we could see it we would see these billions of points of life coming together is the face and a blaze of a sun that would make all the darkness and cruelty of life vanish completely

6342089 our schools are training grounds for sexual harassment boys are rarely punished while girls are taught that it is their role to tolerate this humiliating conduct
6342090 85 percent of girls and 76 percent of boys surveyed say they have experienced unwanted and unwelcome sexual behavior that interferes with their lives
6342091 the majority of both genders 53 described themselves as having been both victim and perpetrator of harassment that is most students had been harassed and had harassed others
6342092 our results led us to question the simple perpetrator victim model
6342093 it is now known that the majority of adolescents of both genders successfully negotiate this developmental period without any major psychological or emotional disorder and develop a positive sense of personal identity

6342122 woodlands and the open spaces within them have a vital contribution to make towards conserving scotlands threatened habitats and species
6342123 we are very fortunate in scotland to enjoy a wealth of biodiversity that is for the most part robust and healthy
6342124 however some elements are extremely fragile and making sure that they thrive will require some large scale thinking and landscape scale vision both of which are forestry sector strengths
6342125 the excitement surrounding the first press smart car raffle is just one indicator of the growing anticipation that is building up for our weekend of wine fundraising event our partnership with smart car is an acknowledgment of changing times

6342134 i thought about it for a long time and asked other people about my ideas but nothing worked then while i was visiting my parents in maine i woke up at 6 a m hearing bells jingling on the cats collar im not a morning person but i kept hearing the bells and a beat started coming to me the idea just hit me

6342137 the zensah leg sleeve could speed up your performance and reduce recovery time according to research and runner reports compression sleeves improve performance of the most important muscle for running the calf muscle the zensah leg sleeve is the only calf sleeve which incorporates pin point compression to the calf area i recommend it for use when traveling on flights to and from a marathon
6342138 our compression clothing has a more ergonomic fit has specially engineered compression zones and is far more comfortable than any other compression clothing on the market
6342139 we allow athletes to focus on their training and competition not on their clothing
6342140 there is no question that with the success of olympic athletes it will raise the awareness of the benefits of compression clothing we believe that zensah will benefit greatly since our technology is superior athletes always are looking for that edge and zensah has that qualitative advantage
6342141 our customers are clamoring for new food and beverage products and were working hard to deliver in addition to developing new products personally engineered by dr sanford siegal were now allowing manufacturers of products that are compatible with ours to indicate so on their labels

6342144 we were scrambling to find something that would get this virus out of our network
6342145 we tried everything we could think of but nothing was working and time was running out
6342146 obviously after avgs free product performed so well i owed it to the company to check out avgs commercial offerings
6342147 weve just renewed our subscriptions to avg for the fifth time
6342148 this time we decided to work with an authorized avg distributor to help the purchase and installation process go as smoothly as possible we selected walling data who ive since learned is the largest avg distributor in the country because they were offering free round the clock support as part of their already competitive license prices
6342149 we havent had any issues with avg that have required us to contact walling for support but it is reassuring to know they are there if we ever do need them it also helps that there would be no surprise charges for support if we did have a problem
6342150 we were and always will be more concerned with finding a product that we can have confidence in something that wont allow viruses to take over our network we lost our confidence in mcafee but we found it again with avg
6342151 unfortunately so many of those 47 blogging ebooks seem to leave you frustrated and disappointed so when i was planning the ballistic blogging range i thought lets take on the opposition with a free version
6342152 since those disappointing 47 blogging ebooks tell you how to start but then leave you high and dry i decided it was time for a new approach as blogging comes of age
6342153 instead the free ballistic blogging report is only the introduction to the system that looks set to redefine blogging for profit theres an interim 7 version that buyers can resell and keep all 7 but the main product is called the ballistic blogging toolkit this includes video tutorials to show you how a blueprint to follow to get started and then monthly updates of new blueprints help and advice
6342154 im really excited about the new dimension that ballistic blogging monthly will bring as it will provide new ideas advice and guidance each and every month so that ballistic blogging toolkit owners can repeat these techniques time and time again giving them free web traffic for life

6342157 we owe our success to our readers and customers theyve been loyal enthusiastic and highly encouraging all these years were happy and also honored that they continue to invite us into their lives

6342162 i want to provide my students with an exciting curriculum that will not only prepare them for kindergarten but will excite and stimulate their young minds
6342163 we wanted to find a way to reach children everywhere
6342164 its surprising just how quickly the value of the contents of our luggage adds up its easy to forget the actual value of the suitcase or bag itself and the accumulated value of all its contents may not be fully appreciated particularly if you like designer accessories holidaymakers should check that they have appropriate cover in place for both their holiday plans and their personal belongings before travelling
6342165 up to 200 000 passengers an average a month from the uk have lost their luggage in the past two years but holiday bags may still go missing or be mislaid when travelling in the uk to ensure holidaymakers enjoy a relaxing summer holiday we recommend people check their cover every time they plan to go away regardless of how far or for how long
6342166 we are exited to offer such low rates out of major us gateways to popular european destinations
6342167 the so called offences were supposed to have been committed some two years ago its strange that in our uniquely singapore it has taken the authorities such a long time to bring us before you this is absurd if we are considered to have committed the offences then the very existence of our countrys constitution and the national pledge make no sense
6342168 how can i plead guilty to something that our constitution tells me is my right
6342169 our companys main objective is to let the buyer beware that the easiest way is not always the best
6342170 complying with laws in the country you are investing in is of primary importance in the investment process
6342171 the track record of winners to losers is not that impressive
6342172 many unstable countries change their currency every few years to help control runaway inflation and often to curb corruption the african country ghana just looped off three zeros in their currency this was done more to help control the rampant illegal diamond business in that country than to help inflation there was an estimated 25 percent of the currency in criminal hands outside the countrys banking system the turn in period was short only 60 days and the customer turning in old currency had to have an existing bank account
6342173 when the ruble became an international currency the first thing the russian government did was print new currency and give only 90 days to turn in old currency to convert to new currency
6342174 they also put a temporary freeze on new bank accounts being opened during the turn in period this left all the tens of millions of rubles outside russia as worthless a successful investor made several thousand percent in just the first year
6342175 today investors are interested in the chinese yuan the vietnamese dong and the iraqi dinar to name a few
6342176 the lesson learned is to make sure you comply with the issuing countries laws on their currency and business
6342177 to safely invest in any of these countries you need a state approved business license
6342178 because we do licensing in iraq we do make it easier to do business there where licensing has gone up dramatically for foreign companies often times it is better to wait until the currency actually makes it to the international market before investing or doing business
6342179 its very difficult to try and categorize it as anything else other than chaos
6342180 yet people loving you to a point where they want to have a piece of you for their wall and they can love you so much they want to tear your clothes off or tear you apart and
6342181 so its not like i didnt appreciate it i always did and i always felt very grateful for it but at the same time it compromised my own ability to just be a normal human being and unless youve lived that experience you have no idea what thats like
6342182 it was the last year when i was in television that i decided that i couldnt carry on at that pace and i thought that it was the appropriate time for me to try and have a personal life and also that it was enough you know
6342183 had you been there for even an hour or two you would have understood it and looked at me and gone well i dont know how youre dealing with this madness
6342184 so it just seemed like the right time and for me i just knew that it was necessary for my own survival
6342185 everybody asks me about it i understand peoples curiosity about it i dont mind talking about it because im very proud of the work that i did and the impact that ive had on two generations
6342186 im really comfortable in my own skin and i love the fact that i get to go out and celebrate the music and do it with people it had an impact on and who really care about it

6342274 kids definitely spend more time online during the summer months
6342275 but very often parents will try to curtail that time now with school back in the picture kids have the excuse they need to legally be online and surfing the internet

6342278 but they may find themselves becoming friends with classmates they werent friends with before or perhaps befriending the new student at school add to that the joining of special clubs or sports and there is a definite chance of new friends popping up on your childs social network page and im buddy lists

6342286 i got on the 6 22am train for ipswich and at that stage people began appearing in the station suggesting the doors had just been opened
6342287 i can confirm that the station wasnt open i understand that the member of staff was late for work

6342298 he was dedicated to middleton and didnt want anything to do with politics he just did it all for the town everything he did was for middleton and the day before he died he attended a pct meeting he was just a person for and of middleton and he will be sorely missed both as a friend and for all his work

6342310 theres a vast difference since then and the situation is changing daily
6342311 its very much grown up as a local response to a local issue i was actually toying with the idea then a pcso asked for them which clinched it because pcsos dont have all the powers of a police officer they sometimes dont have the teeth to deal with a situation there and then theres also a deterrent factor as people know they are being filmed
6342312 some of the youngsters think its incredibly amusing people dont believe im the inspector not that i make a point of it but a lot of them assume im a pcso and some have made derogatory comments its less about a gimmick and more about proving that as a team we are interested in whats going on and getting as physically close to the issues as possible

6342324 some people might not like relegation promotion relegation promotion but would you want to be a middlesbrough stuck in mid table every season
6342325 some people would settle for that because it is better for your heart but the highs and lows are what football is all about for me
6342326 i was amused to read davids comments that he would rather his side suffered relegation every other season than be like middlesbrough

6342443 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors

6342445 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
6342446 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration

6342449 industries no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe
6342450 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
6342451 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature

6342459 it was difficult we knew that the track would not be one of our favourites but we also suffered from a lack of performance compared to our competition for the third consecutive race we did not score any points which is hurting us after the french grand prix we were fourth in the constructors championship but today we are sixth we are well aware that the gaps are very close and the pecking order can therefore change very quickly

6342463 every business leader needs to take note of this if they want to grow their organization
6342464 great leadership doesn t happen by accident organizations need to start listening to their leaders and make the right development investments if they want different results than they re getting now
6342465 the message isn t clear if ceos think these are the traits they need in the next five years but leaders don t think these are respected
6342466 leaders are focused on the bottom line because that is the message they are hearing loud and clear
6342467 organizations will have empty seats in key leadership roles if they don t begin planning for their future leadership
6342468 these aren t good odds for programs that are supposed to increase success
6342469 organizations need to look at how they re developing those individuals and identify why the failure rate is so high
6342470 we re sending leaders into key roles in rapidly growing industries and geographies without the tools they need
6342471 they re facing new cultures and ambiguous environments without much preparation
6342472 its bad enough that employees who exercise their right to refrain from union membership are forced to pay fees to a union they do not want

6342567 anthony will not be part of the main kawasaki motogp team next season but we want to offer him a contract to remain as a kawasaki factory rider because we have invested a lot in him to bring him up a level since he joined us last year that could mean that anthony rides for us in another world championship series

6342571 no se tiene conocimiento de la existencia de centros que atiendan espec ficamente las necesidades de esta poblaci n m s afectada
6342572 los hombres que tienen sexo con hombres representan el mayor porcentaje de casos con vih lo que corrobora que la epidemia est concentrada en este grupo esto posiblemente se deba a que muchos de ellos enfrentan retos adicionales entre ellos el dif cil acceso a informaci n por causas como la homofobia y el machismo presentes en el pa s
6342573 los hombres que tienen sexo con hombres son los m s vulnerables ante el sida porque el personal de salud realmente los discrimina y eso afecta la salud de esos varones
6342574 tuvimos que hacer poleras que luchen contra la discriminaci n para que se concienciaran
6342575 en los pa ses con prevalencia elevada del vih la expectativa de vida ha descendido de manera dr stica en algunos casos se estima que en frica meridional la expectativa de vida se ha reducido a los niveles observados por ltima vez en la d cada de 1950 en la actualidad es inferior a 50 a os en la regi n en general e inferior a los 40 a os en zimbabue
6342576 aun all donde los sistemas de notificaci n de los fallecimientos funcionan relativamente bien por ejemplo en sud frica las defunciones a causa del sida rara vez se documentan como tales
6342577 a escala mundial la epidemia de vih se ha estabilizado pero los niveles de nuevas infecciones y de fallecimientos por sida son inaceptablemente altos se estima que en todo el mundo 33 millones 30 3 millones 36 1 millones de personas viv an con el vih en 2007

6342580 private equity players are frankly in a better position to take on some of the risks especially the larger positions
6342581 private equity players have locked in money distressed hedge funds can have quarterly or annual redemptions rights so they definitely can get money pulled if they take on larger deals and get redemptions it hurts
6342582 large pools of capital have become interested in these investments because they do not correlate to the traditional debt and equity markets

6342601 sounds made by various extended techniques form one aspect of ideal breads approach they are the core of the approach of the duo of trumpeter mirio cosottini and pianist tonino miano cosottini never seems to hit a note square rather he squeezes them out barks them even the notes splatter like fat rain drops on hot pavement his tone is a breathy cry at times a lyrical sigh miano moves from the outside to the inside of the piano however such a range of techniques often does not result in a corresponding variety in the music thats where miano and cosottini stand out each of the seven pieces in their short recital has a focus
6342602 this actually makes it slightly worse the fund quote implied that mccain wouldnt appoint an alito because he thought alito was too overtly conservative novaks report shows that it wasnt alitos overtness but his conservatism that mccain found unattractive that wont help convince conservatives to trust mccain on judicial nominations

6342628 my hope and expectation is that we are going to be able to build one of the best expanded convention centers anywhere and stay within our cost constraints
6342629 i dont want to speculate on the what if because we havent gotten to that point
6342630 well know a lot more in about three weeks when we are dealing with hard data
6342631 we certainly had both challenge and controversy people did give us a shot the end result is 51 2 years later this convention center is at a much different and better place
6342632 we cannot go fowrward weve simply got to pull the plug

6342660 old mines like the orphan were mined in the 1950s under no federal regulations whatsoever
6342661 most mines today are above the water table which makes chances of leakage practically nil what we have now is a well regulated industry
6342662 we already have the clean water act the national environmental policy act and others that require comprehensive analyses before any mining is done so there wont be impacts to the environment
6342663 at this time were still evaluating plans on an individual basis but a regional study is not something i can rule out
6342664 we hear from the industry and federal government that today
6342665 says roger clark air and energy director for the grand canyon trust an environmental watchdog group
6342666 but thats not the way we do things today we understand and know a lot more about uranium radium and radon and the impacts of those so to say some things that happened in the 1950s and 1960s will happen again today is not a good comparison
6342667 when you take uranium and the other trace elements out of their resting places in nature and expose them to the environment
6342668 you expose them in higher concentrations to the environment and intensify their effects people dont appreciate the cumulative impact of mining in a consolidated area theres a very real threat
6342669 they would continue to be mobile through the aquifer and eventually discharge in springs impacting the human uses of water of these springs
6342670 statements that the historic operations at the orphan mine have been polluting horn creek are false

6342682 years ago i saw a mother and four babies walking across u s 41 single file in calumet
6342683 and they were so cute the way they walked and i thought it would be so neat to have one
6342684 babies are so cute because they run all over the house with their tail up like theyre ready to spray
6342685 you wont come home and find them on the kitchen counter

6342688 its the business model thats come under fire so changing the guard has only destabilized the market an external appointment would have been better if they wanted to restore confidence
6342689 for our shareholders we would like to think that some of the measures today and the clear direction we are taking should be the first step down the path of restoring some confidence he said

6342697 you had better believe i would like to talk about it
6342698 the timing is not the greatest thing right now with everything thats pending so i really cant make a comment on the events that unfolded today
6342699 i think when you read the report there may be some questions which is why the attorney general made the referral to the grievance commission
6342700 the public has to know that this office goes above and beyond and i dont think we can go forward with even a hint of impropriety in the way we discharge our official duties
6342701 we had some of our best attorneys on this case and they simply didnt leave any stone unturned
6342702 matwiejczyks actions and omissions may have denied mccollum a fair trial and prejudiced the administration of justice
6342703 after returning to the courtroom matwiejczyk spent time with ms kronenbergs family explaining the contents of the report to them
6342704 avoided asking questions that would elicit any testimony on the issue of mccollums whereabouts at the time ms kronenberg was assaulted
6342705 they just really botched things up is all i got to say
6342706 im disgusted with this is all i can tell you
6342707 it is the average of what has been paid out under the first three schemes
6342708 im disappointed that theyre putting such a limited monetary restriction on it but im very happy that its going to be an ongoing process that theres going to be a lot more people now being able to come forward and go through this process
6342709 we are barring entry to paul francis gadd and will be deporting him to his home country england unconditionally and even if he does not wish to board the plane
6342710 we are now waiting to return him to england as soon as possible
6342711 i cant get into specifics other than to say it is not uncommon during a course of an investigation that a sum of money is paid for information
6342712 was attempting to make contact with an unknown party at ubc with whom he could discuss the stolen items and a possible reward for their return
6342713 right now theres a business whereby criminals are actually stealing with the hopes of being paid ransom rewards for what they steal
6342714 however when there are only dead ends in a case what do we do
6342715 it is a fact that insurance companies are often successful in negotiating the recovery of stolen art works where law enforcement agencies may not be
6342716 do i have to give up me to be loved by you
6342717 all happy people are grateful ungrateful people cannot be happy we tend to think that being unhappy leads people to complain but it is truer to say that complaining leads to people becoming unhappy
6342718 this force that keeps us always wanting is known in several buddhist traditions as the wanting mind the wanting mind is always craving an experience different from the one it currently has
6342719 to entangle somebody or something in something from which it is difficult to be extricated or separated
6342720 whether buying or selling the lease option really works for buyers and sellers
6342721 both sides have reached the conclusion that there is no need for any further negotiations a draft agreement is there it is now a political decision
6342722 the improved security in iraq allows us to have conversations with the iraqis about setting goals for more american troops to come home and for the iraqis to take the lead in more combat missions any dates in an agreement will be based on conditions on the ground because we do not want to lose the hard fought gains of the surge
6342723 i had no experience in business after six years as a nurse and in combat
6342724 i learned leadership at west point and with men in combat ill keep in touch with those people all my life but i need to learn business management thats what this program gives me

6342730 more than 100 years ago a new statue standing tall in new york harbor gave our nation its greatest symbol of freedom
6342731 in this century that freedom is being undermined by dependence on foreign oil so i think it would be a thing of beauty if when lady liberty looks out on the horizon she not only welcomes new immigrants but lights their way with a torch powered by an ocean wind farm
6342732 the current wind turbine technology is not designed for installation at those heights
6342733 the clock acts as an incentive the impact is real on staff
6342734 if some of this stuff comes to fruition it might give him an even bigger legacy
6342735 new challenges such as obesity and global warming presented new opportunities for marketers and the new changes need to be embraced because they are bringing new opportunities that can be used to expand product portfolios and develop brand awareness as well as consumer relationships through educational and lifestyle programmes
6342736 brand value need to understand the different roles lifestyles life stages and perceptions of mom and how these translate to her needs
6342737 trading conditions have been the most challenging in persimmons recent history our results for the period reflect this difficult market
6342738 there has been a major step down in activity since the end of march
6342739 the current economic conditions the uncertainties surrounding the general financial markets and mortgage availability will be defining factors in the return to a more normal housing market
6342740 until we see an improvement in respect of these factors it is difficult to predict the short term future with confidence
6342741 first time buyers are the people who have been hit hard we would say whatever the government can do do it for first time buyers
6342742 computer programs for disabling the history and file caching features of a web browser and computer software for notifying a user of a web browser when others are tracking web use and for controlling the information others can access about such use
6342743 the larger challenge here is notifying users clearly about what sites theyre disclosing information to and enabling them to control that disclosure if they choose
6342744 the user is in control of what information the browser makes available to websites
6342745 nihal and nick grimshaw have already proved themselves in their current slots and im really excited about what they can achieve with their new shows itll be great to have sara and edith back in the radio 1 family
6342746 we are saying goodbye to dick and dom and i want to wish them all the very best and say thanks for their work at radio 1
6342747 the current economic conditions the uncertainties surrounding the general financial markets and mortgage availability will be defining factors in the return to a more normal housing market
6342748 until we see an improvement in respect of these factors it is difficult to predict the short term future with confidence
6342749 first time buyers are the people who have been hit hard we would say whatever the government can do do it for first time buyers
6342750 i cant foresee the future but i cant anticipate any further job cuts at this stage
6342751 the recent speculation regarding a change to stamp duty on housing transactions has undoubtedly caused further delay and uncertainty in respect of house purchases
6342752 but putting things on the skin puts them straight into your blood stream

6342754 the fewer ingredients the better and dont trust the labeling claims
6342755 as a result of todays talks at acas between the unions and swissport we have a new improved offer to put to our members
6342756 because of the improved offer all planned industrial action is suspended until we get the reaction of the members
6342757 this does not affect the industrial action for the scanner workers who are employed by airport services
6342758 for the first six months of a 12 month package
6342759 one of the most effective strategies we have developed during the course of the past two or three years in terms of obtaining a speedy and satisfactory resolution for us plaintiffs has been the threat or implementation of multi jurisdictional proceedings
6342760 for a european however the notion that there should be no safety net in place whereby the veracity of what is published as fact in the public forum can be monitored is very difficult to contemplate
6342761 served to discourage critical media reporting on matters of serious public interest adversely affecting the ability of scholars and journalists to publish their work
6342762 in the past anyone who could be classified as a public figure in the us has simply had to ignore these false and outrageous allegations being thrown at them in the tabloids
6342763 with the ever increasing expansion of internet publication and with us magazines such as the national enquirer now distributing uk irish editions i am being consulted more and more by internationally famous stars who would otherwise have difficulty in seeking vindication of their reputations in the us where the libel laws are geared much more in favour of the press
6342764 you know that you are on the front line in the fight against the taliban you know that by what you are doing here you prevent terrorism coming to the streets of britain
6342765 what you are doing is part of an incredibly important process of creating not only a terrorist free afghanistan but an afghanistan where there will be democracy and people will have a stake in the future for the long term
6342766 this week we are celebrating the olympics where we have had great success
6342767 but this week also i believe that our olympic athletes and everybody else in our country will remember that you have showed exactly the same courage professionalism and dedication
6342768 you make our country proud every day of the week and every week of the year you are truly the heroes of our country

6342771 as far back as i can remember ive been a news junkie
6342772 the majors are looking for new places to explore and the favourable tax rate in ireland makes it worth a punt
6342773 high oil and gas prices improved deepwater technology and a safe political environment means that we can expect higher drilling activity in the future
6342774 the short term nature of the spiking is not something that you could plan your exploration strategy around
6342775 there is huge potential reward off the west coast of ireland but obviously it is higher risk
6342776 everybody wants a brent crude or a west texas type crude and the irish crude oil certainly in the atlantic margin is of that quality
6342777 we know there is a petroleum system we dont know its extent
6342778 it really does depend on near term exploration success whether people remain interested in irelands atlantic acreage
6342779 many of these countries are being forced to think hard about how much gas and oil they can export as their own demand grows
6342780 its quite clear that ngls are having a very positive impact on overall oil supply
6342781 we need to be very concerned when people get cavalier about the countrys energy supply
6342782 energy and energy abundance should be a populist issue not relegated to the right wing fringes of the republican party

6342784 the second half should improve further on the back of still high oil prices and the start ups of numerous oil and gas fields in bohai bay
6342785 we believe there is room for the government to raise domestic refined product prices further
6342786 removal of such taxes could boost our full year 2009 profit forecast for cnooc by 52 percent restoring enough cash flow to reinvest in oil and gas exploration

6342790 er is zeker geen sprake van een officieel door ons erkende rechtsvorm de vur bestaat voor ons niet
6342791 het klopt dat de vur niet bestaat als arbeidsvorm het gaat om de declarabele uren bv dubv dat is een product wat wij hebben ontwikkeld wij hebben met de belastingdienst en het uwv aan tafel gezeten om toestemming te krijgen voor een landelijke dekking hiervan voorheen moesten we namelijk in iedere provincie opnieuw gecontroleerd worden nu mogen we de dubv overal in nederland toepassen
6342792 het kan niet zo zijn dat we mensen die 30 000 euro per jaar verdienen laten schieten omdat we meer verdienen met dubvs die 300 000 per jaar binnenhalen daarom betaalt men ons een vast bedrag
6342793 houdt de uniforcer zich niet aan de in de vur opgestelde regels dan wordt hij gewoon door ons ontslagen

6342803 its the radiocarbon date that to our minds is like a square peg in a round hole its not fitting properly and the question is why
6342804 there is a lot of other evidence that suggests to many that the shroud is older than the radiocarbon dates allow and so further research is certainly needed
6342805 only by doing this will people be able to arrive at a coherent history of the shroud which takes into account and explains all of the available scientific and historical information
6342806 hes had other ideas but theyve all been shot down and this one will be shot down too
6342807 if you love christ why wouldnt you want to explore the possibility that you have an artifact of his material existence on earth
6342808 how i think about the shroud comes from the shroud its not gee im a christian so ill force it to be what i want it to be thats not scientific logic
6342809 its like were on an archaeological expedition thats not finished im not sure well ever be truly finished
6342810 a lot of the pleasure is in the journey itself
6342811 if we get to the point where we believe we have a viable hypothesis that works in the lab then we have scientific grounds to go to turin and say heres what we think has happened to the shroud

6342834 mcgill has been at the forefront of medical discovery for almost 200 years
6342835 this important award supports our commitment to remain at the forefront of medical discovery for future generations of physicians and scientists our scientists at mcgill and the muhc share this commitment and have been rewarded for their efforts and vision i am proud and delighted the kinds of transformative scientific discoveries and advancements that will be made in this state of the art facility will have worldwide repercussions in health care for generations to come
6342836 thanks to the cfi our plan to bring together our investigators on the glen and mountain campuses in order to bridge biomedical research and clinical medicine is assured
6342837 the award will support building areas of roughly 40 000 gsm 400 000 gsf for the research institutes centre for innovative medicine centre for translational biology and evaluative research infrastructure on the glen campus the addition of research neighbourhoods shared platforms and equipment for 180 clinical evaluative and biomedical researchers will enhance the muhcs capacity for meaningful innovation dramatically i am tremendously proud of the leadership of our research institutes director dr vassilios papadopoulos and the entire muhc mcgill team who worked on this landmark application
6342838 our researchers are currently spread out over more than 65 separate labs located in 50 to 100 year old buildings that impose severe constraints on their activities
6342839 given the world class achievements of our scientists and clinicians in these poor conditions one can only dream of the discoveries that will emerge from a modern facility that is designed to encourage the interdisciplinary collaborations and synergies that are the basis for true scientific innovation
6342840 this historic decision by the cfi underscores the absolute need of partnerships harnessing the strengths and resources of governments the private sector and world class institutions like mcgill and the muhc
6342841 together truly transformative research requiring this level of investment and collaboration is possible and we applaud the cfis vision in supporting our exciting project
6342842 this award represents a strategic boost to the research capacity of mcgill university and the muhc
6342843 this project selected through a rigorous assessment process will help ensure that researchers and graduate students at the muhc have access to a world class research facility and training environment

6342867 leicesters involvement in this major research project is a direct result of our international reputation for research on the analysis of safety critical control software
6342868 future esa missions like the autonomous robotic satellites which will collect and return samples from the surface of mars require control systems involving complex requirements system architectures software algorithms and hardware implementations
6342869 key elements for the development of such autonomous rendezvous control systems are the availability of reliable analysis tools for the verification and validation of complex system behaviour
6342870 in this new project we will develop and test control system analysis techniques to improve the reliability and efficiency of this verification and validation process
6342871 this latest project is the third major research contract we have recently been awarded by esa and confirms that the leicester control group is now at the forefront of european research on space control systems

6342880 well be pressing on the pakistanis themselves to be involved with us in fighting terrorism and making sure the number of terrorists coming into afghanistan from pakistan is limited
6342881 obviously we have had a period of political uncertainty in pakistan i think its very important now that we see the pakistan and afghan governments working together
6342882 we have obviously also suffered casualties because of the summer offensive
6342883 we have always expected there to be a summer offensive because of the fact that there was very little of a spring offensive
6342884 its a summer offensive of the taliban we will see that happening but in our view our strategy will be to build up the afghan army to build up the rest of afghan society
6342885 sort out the government so that we have a full attack on corruption

6342887 my philosophy of ministry is strongly flavoured by my experiences overseas i embrace this and am attempting to translate that experience synergistically into my context here consequently i am passionate about mission as an organising principle for a community of disciples who gather around jesus as their living middle i am committed to that ground people in the deep channel of scripture and a developing biblical worldview to the point where it is self sustaining sensitive to the spirit of god and actively seeking accountable relationships with other disciples who are further along in the journey discover amp exercise their spiritual gifts both individually amp corporately to creatively experiment amp to tenaciously fail forwards together for the sake of kingdom of god that moves beyond prestige and comfort for the sake of those who are yet to encounter jesus anywhere in our global village

6342918 i would love him to show more respect for his competitors thats not the way we perceive being a champion but he will learn in time he should shake hands with his competitors and not ignore them hell learn that sooner or later but hes a great athlete of course
6342919 no one else knows how hard this is for me
6342920 therefore in conclusion this essay has looked at the needs of a patient with congestive cardiac failure and talked about the activities of daily living model the patient had many needs and the model identified what needed to be done i think the patient got good care and it was a good experience for me
6342921 in conclusion the roper activities of living model helped to identify that the key need for this patient was to relieve the distress caused by both her breathlessness and immobility
6342922 dont rely totally on what you have done in the past
6342923 communication in nursing is the most important thing of all when i approach the patients on the ward i am very careful to make sure that i establish eye contact first and hold their hand to show that i care about them non verbal communication is just as important as verbal communication
6342924 many authors such as bernard 2003 kemp and smith 2004 and jones 2001 agree that communication is the most important therapeutic skill in nursing however brown 2005 emphasizes that nurses must appreciate that non verbal communication through eye contact and touch particularly is an essential pre requisite to establishing a rapport and trusting relationship with patients before verbal communication commences in my own experience on my most recent placement on a surgical ward i found that patients responded positively to me when i wanted to give them information about their operations if i established eye contact first and also reached out to touch their arm or hold their hand
6342925 when we have done the obis and done lots of walking with him he was well chuffed
6342926 after performing routine observations for blood pressure and pulse to check the patient was not tachycardia or hypertensive we were able to help the patient to mobilize he was able to walk for a significant distance and was extremely pleased with his achievement
6342927 it is intuitive therefore that the fundamental dichotomy in theory and practice is inevitably exacerbated and irrevocably confounded by the underlying quixotic nature of nursing lecturers
6342928 it seems obvious that the theory practice gap is always going to be made worse and become dreadfully confused by nursing lecturers who dont live in the real nursing world
6342929 jones 2005 recently traced the theory practice gap in nursing
6342930 brown 2005 maintains that leadership is an essential quality in nursing this is confirmed by the recent requirements of the nhs plan doha 2002 this plan has emphasized the importance of introducing the transformational model of leadership smith 2001 explains that this is a leadership which involves the use of charisma and interpersonal skills to enable achievement jones 2004 argues that the key characteristic of transformational leadership is empowering others to achieve in my own experience a leader with transformational qualities can make any team member feel that they have a useful part to play in the organization this is confirmed by feat 2001 who argues that transformational leadership increases feelings of self worth and capability in their team members
6342931 a review of the available literature provides a wealth of examples of authors advocating leadership as an essential quality in nursing for example as early as 1950 shackle ton emphasized that nursing needed strong leadership and recommended a strong transactional approach of reward and punishment to get results and promote teamwork more recently however authors have been moving towards the concept of charismatic and transformational leadership these qualities are also an integral part of the new recommendations laid down in the nhs plan doha 2002 charisma appears to be a complex phenomenon to define davidzhar 1991 suggests that it is an aspect of personality which makes the individual irresistible to others in terms of their ability to persuade and empower others however other authors such as romano 1996 and harvey 2000 highlight the intangible nature of charisma and emphasize the frustrating point that individuals know charisma if they see it but find it difficult to define it appears problematic therefore to identify exactly how charisma can become an integral part of developing transformational leadership in nursing if it is a quality which in itself is difficult to define for example smith 2001 maintains that transformational leadership uses a combination of charisma and interpersonal skills to enable achievement however identifying potential transformational leaders may be a difficulty if the pre requisite for identifying charismatic individuals is an integral part of this selection process jones 2004 argues that the key ability of a transformational leader is the ability to empower others while feat 2001 maintains that their key strength is to increase feelings of self worth and capability in their team members on reflection my own experience of transformational leadership appeared to be based principally on being persuaded by the sheer force of personality of the individual that i had the potential to contribute and achieve it seemed to me that it was their apparent faith in me and their power of persuasion that enabled me to become an effective team member this requirement for charisma in transformational leadership therefore may indeed be based on individual personality factors that enable others to feel good about themselves and their achievements there is some evidence that this is the case jones 2003 for example argues that transformational leaders are born and cannot be made registrar 2003 also maintains common key personality traits can be identified in effective transformational leaders which have probably been present since childhood it seems therefore that the key requirement of the nhs plan 2002 for the training of transformational leaders is not going to be as straightforward as they first envisioned as the available literature suggests that these leaders are born rather than made

6342978 joe stumpf wants me to get more referrals and he can show me exactly how all i need to do is be coachable and willing to learn what he knows
6342979 thanks for noticing i am sure i could count on you to do the same for me if i were your client and you were my agent and because you know how important your referrals are to my business i am sure i can count on you to refer me to the people you care about
6342980 watch your thoughts they become words watch your words they become actions watch your actions they become habits watch your habits they become character watch your character for it becomes your destiny
6342981 mr and mrs client after i left your home i started thinking what advanced marketing strategies i could apply to make sure the maximum number of prospects could see your home via the world wide web so what i did was arrange a virtual tour of your home my out of pocket expense is 150 and i believe it will be money well invested to help you reach your goals lets take a look at what the prospects will see
6342982 i will represent your money like it is mine and when it comes to to make you money or save you money im like a pit bull
6342983 here is a list of the 20 people that we love and care about would you please notify them that we will be selling our home
6342984 please let my friends know that we are selling our home and ask them if they know of anyone who might be interested in owning our home
6342985 now that you have chosen me to market your home you will want me to use every possible vehicle i can dont you
6342986 here is a unique advanced marketing method that can help you quickly find a great buyer for the house and because you want me to quickly find you a qualified buyer you maybe very interested in doing it and you may not
6342987 what i do know is that the sellers that have used this method have been very pleased with the outcome let me explain it to you and then you tell me if you want to use this more advance marketing method to assist you in getting your home sold
6342988 the nar national association of realtors have discovered within their research that 11 of all homes are sold through direct and indirect referrals
6342989 what that means is someone finds out that your home is for sale then they tell another person who is interested in living in your neighborhood about your home
6342990 so it might happen that someone drives by sees your sign then tells a brother or sister or cousin or friend at work about your home then that person contacts me or their agent and 11 of the time that is how your home gets sold
6342991 so what i would like to do is unleash our full 100 marketing effort to get your home sold using my direct and indirect marketing strategy here is how it works
6342992 in your life you know several hundred people you have close friends family members and business colleagues when you think about if you were to have a wedding today you would invite a certain group of people to the wedding

6342994 what i will do is let them know youre moving because they may know someone who might know someone who might know someone

6343041 i know on a team like this youre not supposed to worry about how many minutes you play and things like that but guys like myself and lebron james we were expected to play in 2004 but we didnt so that kind of takes down a notch of your confidence
6343042 he had problems with me a lot of people never really got a chance to really hear what i have to say but i dont really have nothing to say thats over with for me im in 2008 right now
6343043 in 06 he probably was in the best shape i have ever seen him
6343044 last year he was still there this year he probably was one step off that when he showed up last month for training camp in las vegas
6343045 now hes gotten it back going full blast this is probably the best defensively i have ever seen him play he started out shooting poorly and he didnt have all three of those guys before james wade and bryant theyre really scorers
6343046 i get tired of people saying i cant play no defense
6343047 hes been playing great defense the last game he rebounded the ball like an animal six in 14 minutes against germany obviously the numbers are going to be skewed for everybody hes been fantastic
6343048 hes funny as hell thats my guy thats my dude hes just funny and he and i we get along extremely well
6343049 im happy for him when we get that gold medal hes going to be one of the happiest men on the podium
6343050 im happy im having a lot of fun on the court just hanging with the guys and visiting and talking with players from different countries

6343099 microsoft is one of the only vendor s with top enterprise search and business intelligence reporting capabilities it offers strong support for aggregation summarization search engine and dashboards transactions across distributed data sources and long running transactions are also strengths for microsoft
6343100 market share business intelligence platform software asia pacific and japan 2007 report said that microsoft leads the market with 20
6343101 based on idcs recent report worldwide relational database management systems revenue by vendor 2007 although the top three vendors had somewhat similar growth rates microsoft was leading the pack in terms of year on year growth idc sees similar trends in malaysia and most asia pacific countries where the rdbms relational database management system market growth ranges between one to 30 percent

6343105 a better process enables higher transistor counts larger caches and more cores ultimately the cores will impact performance more but the larger caches will help as well
6343106 going from four to six cores will see close to the 50 percent improvement linear scaling with a little slowdown due to i o contention

6343124 the national youth orchestra has a very important role the potential for a kinetic explosive type of energy is endless people want that i was very surprised to hear that the government doesnt support this orchestra at all they get good conductors to work with them to achieve something with programmes that even a lot of symphony orchestras dont get to play this is a unique opportunity for musical growth and human growth
6343125 the sim n bol var orchestra is the most extraordinary musical education project ive seen these kids are in their twenties now and the kids 10 years younger are going to be even better i conducted the planets with an orchestra ranging from seven to 14 in the summer a few years ago it did seem that some notice of the need for music education was taken in britain and it seems to be better now than it was it can save peoples lives in so many different ways
6343126 part of the enjoyment that the audience can have watching a youth orchestra is because its fun to look at young people who are playing their hearts out its like going to the zoo and watching young lions and polar bears however the story that is behind youth orchestras is just as important nowadays in the music business as the quality of the orchestra you are thrilled by the skill of the sim n bol var orchestra and the east western divan but i hope any such institution which is riding upon a wave of attention and hype is sustainable enough that it will remain once the hype is over
6343127 among the young orchestras the verbier festival orchestra is the closest to a high professional level
6343128 the quality of the young orchestras is much higher now probably because the competition to get a job in the music world requires a very high standard i told them after three days of rehearsal in verbier dont lose the light and fire in your eyes
6343129 youth orchestras generally astound audiences with their technical virtuosity and they bring to it all the primal freshness of discovering great music

6343138 ive seen it all in my brief and pointless life here a good person cut down in the middle of doing good there a bad person living a long life of sheer evil so dont knock yourself out being good and dont go overboard being wise believe me you wont get anything out of it but dont press your luck by being bad either and dont be reckless why die needlessly its best to stay in touch with both sides of an issue a person who fears god deals responsibly with all of reality not just a piece of it

6343167 this type of expenditure should not be a priority for the council at the current time
6343168 ive never witnessed any serious attempt at curtailing elected members contributions to debates anyone would think the current people in charge just dont like what they hear in the debating chamber
6343169 i want to ensure that every councillor has an opportunity to take part in debate during council meetings
6343170 over the last year i have been concerned that certain councillors are either not aware of the time limit for speeches or are deliberately flouting standing orders
6343171 this system will ensure that councillors keep to time allowing time for more voices to be heard its a similar system to the one used at the scottish parliament to good effect and i think it will lead to more constructive and more democratic debate

6343219 there will also be an additional monetary fine beyond the amount announced by nascar earlier today which will be the responsibility of those involved

6343256 its the closest to hell that ive seen the bodies were boiling hot we burnt ourselves collecting them
6343257 i think what a lot of people here in spain will want to know and certainly the relatives of those who perished on the plane is if there was a technical issue with the flight which delayed its take off initially and it was then given the go ahead to take off why was that
6343258 what was the technical issue which caused the delay and why was the go ahead then given for the plane to at least try to take off and head for gran canaria

6343279 i think thats one of the real divisions between studying abroad in europe and studying abroad in asia

6343286 i was too hard on myself towards the end of the match as i was so keen to win i feel very regretful about losing the first three games so easily
6343287 even though there has not been a great deal of pressure on me i have met many strong players in this tournament
6343288 i know him well i knew that i had to take the initiative in attacking both of us are poor at defence whoever attacked more had a greater chance at winning
6343289 my back hurts a lot i travel a lot and sometimes i want to give up but i wanted to play in the olympics i will retire after this tournament
6343290 condannato p a brunetta sindacato non difenda fannuloni italiani sono con me il caso tolto alla madre perche comunista in affidamento al padre pubblicato da orizzontedocenti su agosto 21 2008 dalla mia tessera di giovane comunista per sostenere che mia madre non in grado di badare a me perch i comunisti sono un gruppo di persone che portano i figli su una brutta strada
6343291 dovrei stare con mio padre ma dopo unaggressione che ho subito ho deciso di andare da mia madre
6343292 lui non fa altro di associare i comunisti detto in tono dispregiativo sempre con droga spinelli alcol insomma una vita sbandata sregolata da non seguire mentre invece io mi trovo bene con il mio gruppo le nostre idee da quando io sono cresciuto sono cambiate io frequento un liceo che ha idee di sinistra invece lui detesta i comunisti
6343293 a seguito di queste continue insinuazioni mi madre mi ha portato in un centro medico dove sono stato sottoposto al drug test ho fatto il test per dimostrare che non facevo uso di droghe con il risultato davanti mio padre ha continuato a dire che io mi drogo e che il test era stato falsificato questo purtroppo un punto fermo sul quale lui crede di potersi appoggiare per vincere a modo suo questa guerra
6343294 adesso sto studiando dice perch devo recuperare i debiti formativi sino ad ora sono stato al mare mi sono abbastanza divertito negli spiragli di tempo che ho trascorso al di fuori di questo brutta storia
6343295 right now i have three boxers who are fighting to win gold medals for team gb and i will not allow anything to distract my lads from what they need to do in the ring
6343296 after 10 years of training we finally got out first olympic medal
6343297 we feel like were the luckiest here weve been winning championships and regattas but this is the most important win of them all
6343298 we broke our mast swivel and thats okay in 5 knots or under but it was really breezy out there
6343299 we want to play the defending champs its all about challenges and obviously we welcome all comers we know what a great team greece is
6343300 argentina is the defending champs you want to be able to play the guys who won it the last time i would love for us to have the opportunity
6343301 we all want argentina we all want revenge on that game
6343302 thats the game that we want to have i think they want to see us too i dont think theyre going to back away from us
6343303 if it does happen great but im not overlooking greece by any means greece is a very good team if they win wednesday night well see them whoever we play theyre just in our path for the gold medal
6343304 the point that im making is that when youre a champion you want to have the opportunity to defend your championship
6343305 and anyone who has aspirations to be a champion you understand there is a sense of pride that comes along with beating a champion thats all that comments about
6343306 theres a sense that its a cutting edge destination where they can be among the first to learn firsthand about another culture
6343307 theres something about being one of the first in your generation to really have a deep understanding
6343308 its probably the most different and most unorthodox place i could think of

6343320 i am really feeling sad and have no words to describe this pathetic show
6343321 frankly speaking i had no hopes of a medal from the team that was picked for the olympics but i was expecting pakistan to finish at least at fifth or sixth place not what they have achieved
6343322 our deep defense was nowhere near average what to talk about good and excellent
6343323 the only way we can move forward is by saying thank you very much to the senior players and start grooming youngsters for the asian games
6343324 defense was seen nowhere in any one of the group matches and we kept on interchanging our two goalkeepers salman akbar and nasir ahmed
6343325 we only defeated canada and south africa in the pool matches because these countries are still going through the progressive phase in international hockey but we have a name in international hockey which was badly damaged at beijing
6343326 i did not see any urgency in the forward line to pressurize opponents defense just because our players lacked in fitness and only occasionally they looked like threatening the opposition

6343328 the majority of the party thinks that asif zardari should be president
6343329 its impossible for me to return unless i surrender but thats out of the question so in other words im unable to return to burma at all
6343330 we got invited officially which reflects we believe indonesias support for the burmese democracy movement and that it also wants to see change in burma
6343331 we see indonesia as the third largest democracy in the world and the largest democracy in the region so we really see it as very significant
6343332 we shouldnt forget that indonesia is the largest democracy in asean so there is some symbolic import from this visit
6343333 i think its more significant to the mpu and perhaps to the junta then it is to the indonesian government as a whole although it is symbolic from the point of view of indonesian parliamentarians
6343334 but the fact that its not an official invitation from the government itself or from the president means that we should caution against reading too much into this
6343335 we are pretty sure that burmas going to oppose our participation so its a foregone conclusion that we are not going to be accorded observer status
6343336 but still the fact that we have some members that are speaking on our behalf sends a very strong message to the other members as well as the spdc the juntas state peace and development council that there is a need for change in burma

6343369 smaller than a pack of cigarettes the fs 488 quickly and accurately shows a car dealer if there is previous body damage on the car he is appraising or purchasing
6343370 in todays economy if a car dealer purchases or trades for a vehicle with previous damage he doesnt know about he can easily lose several thousands of dollars
6343371 we take the guess work out of determining a vehicles condition and help the dealer avoid serious losses
6343372 it was orange fairly large and heavy and the user said he paid over 700 for it i immediately saw the potential for the gauge and knew if someone could make a quality paint meter that was smaller lighter and more affordable it would sell like crazy

6343385 we were scrambling to find something that would get this virus out of our network
6343386 we tried everything we could think of but nothing was working and time was running out
6343387 obviously after avgs free product performed so well i owed it to the company to check out avgs commercial offerings
6343388 weve just renewed our subscriptions to avg for the fifth time
6343389 this time we decided to work with an authorized avg distributor to help the purchase and installation process go as smoothly as possible we selected walling data who ive since learned is the largest avg distributor in the country because they were offering free round the clock support as part of their already competitive license prices

6343420 many unstable countries change their currency every few years to help control runaway inflation and often to curb corruption the african country ghana just looped off three zeros in their currency this was done more to help control the rampant illegal diamond business in that country than to help inflation there was an estimated 25 percent of the currency in criminal hands outside the countrys banking system the turn in period was short only 60 days and the customer turning in old currency had to have an existing bank account
6343421 when the ruble became an international currency the first thing the russian government did was print new currency and give only 90 days to turn in old currency to convert to new currency
6343422 they also put a temporary freeze on new bank accounts being opened during the turn in period this left all the tens of millions of rubles outside russia as worthless a successful investor made several thousand percent in just the first year
6343423 today investors are interested in the chinese yuan the vietnamese dong and the iraqi dinar to name a few
6343424 the lesson learned is to make sure you comply with the issuing countries laws on their currency and business

6343640 because we cant concentrate on every region or profession although ive tried i offer a chance for domainers investors and website developers to pick up names at reasonable prices given the time and effort avoided in having us do the work ive always felt the value gain in a domain was generated by the holding period between when a domain is offered for sale and when its use can be developed or the right end user comes around our subscribers can add quality names to their inventory and still keeps their day jobs so to speak
6343641 ive really been able to pick up some great names due to jeffs work and appreciate the creativity and effort he puts in to finding the best names
6343642 jeff and i started a process to work together on future endeavors which led me to first add names to and then assume control over the geodomainlist newsletter our team is already extensively searching the daily drop free registrations and 10 15 expired names sites for top quality resale names and adding geo domains to our quest has increased our long term holdings substantially

6343651 a terrorist attack with a nuclear device would have catastrophic consequences for our nation
6343652 the greatest threat we face is not of a determined adversary willing to use nuclear weapons against us or our allies

6343670 now is the time to bring innovation and creativity to helping your businesss clients weather their own economic storms
6343671 too many entrepreneurs believe their real estate their patents their brand or their equipment are their businesses greatest assets when in truth their most dependable and leveragable asset is the loyalty creativity and productivity of their employees

6343710 fui a la universidad hace cuatro a os cuando corr a 10 65 segundos y l ha hecho un gran trabajo conmigo

6343722 with such a high demand we usually place our nurses within one day to three weeks
6343723 and on average traveling nurses can stay in an area as little as 90 days to as long as a year or more
6343724 a common misconception is that if you travel you do not have job security or benefits neither is true
6343725 each of our nurses receives a comprehensive benefits package on every assignment

6343736 besides the obvious beauty and charm of huatulco i was impressed that it is the only resort community in mexico to obtain green globe 21 certification
6343737 it only takes a short time to get to know the locals because of their openness and gracious hospitality
6343738 the people of huatulco are dedicated to preserving their environment history and culture while also welcoming tourists to discover their rich natural resources and contribute to the economy
6343739 we decided a private residence club made the most sense for this unique piece of land along tangolunda bay
6343740 this is the last oceanfront property on the bay to be constructed and were only developing the minimum amount necessary to create an intimate resort experience residence club owners purchase a fraction of a home and they typically visit often while were keeping the overall density low owners will keep the tourism dollars flowing to help sustain huatulcos economy
6343741 residence clubs are a sensible way to own in any market but especially now members own deeded real estate in a prime location and prices reflect todays economy not only is the purchase price commensurate with the amount of use but the insurance taxes utilities maintenance replacement reserves and staff expenses are shared amongst owners the club is operated for the benefit and exclusive use of its owners similar to an equity golf country club
6343742 paola brings a fresh and highly valued perspective to our board in the area of childrens public policy and advocacy and we couldnt be more delighted to have her join us

6343749 there is not a photograph that can describe how amazing it is to get up close to the exotic animals of the galapagos islands
6343750 we are strongly encouraging corporations that value their products and reputations to join forces with us in order to put those who steal your product out of business in jail or both hiring a former agent from the fbi or waiting for global law enforcement to help is a pipe dream with a serious global recession looming corporations cannot just sit by while someone else makes amp resells their product the epicenter of all of this is china and india
6343751 we had no idea how vast the problem is nor did we understand that virtually every legitimate corporate manufactured product is being counterfeited in china or india with the increasing probability of a severe global recession americas watchdog is urging corporations to utilize the very unique services offered by the global piracy amp counterfeiting consultants
6343752 the top ten global pharma companies are each losing billions of u s dollars a year to pharmaceutical counterfeiting the big tobacco companies are each losing billions of dollars per year to counterfeit cigarettes 200 billion of which are made in china auto parts manufacturers are losing billions a year sporting goods or entertainment companies are losing billions of dollars a year etc it has to stop and we have an integrated approach that will identify the counterfeit product retailers wholesalers and manufacturers there is nothing even close to our capabilities in the world
6343753 big pharmaceutical companies have done a pathetic job of protecting their brands and consumers are probably dying because of it
6343754 do not purchase any product on the internet unless you are 100 satisfied you are purchasing the authentic product amp it is produced by the legitimate manufacturer

6343947 the story is a long complicated one winding its way from china to france by way of the first world war the oil cartel the pharmaceutical cartel and iraq to its final destination a syringe full of something claiming to be a vaccine against the newly deadly avian flu
6343948 our best intelligence estimate is that pandemic avian flu has already been created through genetic engineering
6343949 as a physician i understand a basic virological fact that the public has not been told it is impossible to make a vaccine against a virus that does not yet exist public relations efforts to the contrary if a vaccine is being made against the avian flu virus in its pandemic form that means the pandemic virus must already exist so the fact that the avian flu vaccine is already being manufactured in china by sanofi pasteur reported to be a wholly owned subsidiary of total petroleum a french arm of the cartel supports our contention that the weaponized avian flu already exists as we saw in the case of the anthrax scare of 2001 an allegedly disgruntled government employee can release deadly toxins from even the most secure government facility
6343950 publicly available information shows the pharmaceutical industry and us government are both actively preparing for an avian flu pandemic this is shown through their own promotional literature and propaganda
6343951 the whole notion of an avian flu pandemic occurring without technological intervention is highly questionable to date there have only been around 385 human cases of avian flu identified worldwide assuming those identifications are trustworthy of course with 243 deaths to put the absurdity of this effort into perspective sudden cardiac death scd which many researchers believe is heavily associated with aspartame consumption is a leading cause of death according to the cdc for example scd killed 460 000 americans in 1999 and the numbers keep rising www cdc gov mmwr preview mmwrhtml mm5106a3 htm but aspartame a product of monsanto is an approved substance while the currently non pandemic avian flu is the focus of hugely expensive seemingly irrational preparations if there is no intent to create that very pandemic
6343952 given the shockingly obvious lack of any threat from an un weaponized h5n1 virus how can we explain the bush administration spending billions of dollars preparing each of the 50 states for what it drums into us is the

6344160 with general motors stunning second quarter record breaking loss of 15 5 billion chryslers failure to renew all of its 30 billion short term debt and ford motor co 8 7 billion loss because of a deep decline in u s sales and charges for job cuts plant closings and the falling value of trucks and sport utility vehicles the big three automakers are really taking a hit and clearly something must be done to aid american businesses
6344161 americas automakers who have been leaders in workforce diversity and developing minority dealers and suppliers as well as their employees are at risk
6344162 this proposal includes some very good ideas to address our countrys many energy related challenges and while i do not agree with every part of it i very much appreciate the bipartisan spirit in which it was constructed
6344163 our citizens and our government must recognize the importance of pillar industries such as the automotive industry for national strength technological expertise and economic vitality now and for future generations the automotive industry is critical to jobs in the united states north america and influences worldwide economies for every job created in the auto industry nine more are created to support it if our government invested 20 40 billion in the u s automotive industry today alternative energy for vehicles would increase dramatically and dependence on foreign oil would drastically diminish we need a distribution network for these energy alternatives and it is incumbent on the federal government to help fund and accelerate this network i believe the statistic is 49 000 fueling stations converted to accommodate alternative fueling systems such as hydrogen would supply over 80 of our needs punitive measures are not the only catalyst to increased fuel efficiency goals and diminished greenhouse gases incentives and investment will spur growth in innovative technologies much faster than avoidance of fines and special taxes
6344164 part of the reason this country has been so great is because of automotive manufacturing
6344165 it is a necessity for congress to support the american automakers their suppliers and employees
6344166 with americas workforce strained by increasing financial insecurity and rising prices we urge congress to enact comprehensive legislation to spur economic growth through tax credits and other business engage and invest in americas technology leadership its businesses
6344167 one of the biggest benefits of atm or pinbased cards for merchants is that they can cost up to 73 percent less than credit and signature debit cards
6344168 when those savings are multiplied by thousands hundreds of thousands or millions of transactions per year the bottomline benefit is easy to see

6344172 we knew the product would provide results but we were particularly impressed with the speed of efficacy and overall satisfaction among users
6344173 the clinical data underscores that this product can provide real results
6344174 however its terrific to see the results played out among real users

6344181 because of this ruling mr ainsworth will be able to rightfully sell his product throughout most of the world its not only a victory for him its a victory for prop designers throughout the film industry
6344182 we took on the infamous death star and lived to tell about it
6344183 the goal of our business and intellectual property practices always has been to give entrepreneurs and small businesses a voice to protect their legal rights to see that success play out on the international stage like this is truly gratifying
6344184 as more u s businesses expand globally working with affiliate firms in other countries expands our ability to help those businesses resolve legal disputes regardless of location
6344185 last year a staggering 21 percent of malware attacks were unleashed with no known anti virus protection
6344186 that means fully one fifth of the time users were 100 percent vulnerable there is no foolproof tool that can keep people safe knowledge is the only protection
6344187 the internet has given birth to powerful tools that many businesses would benefit from but most companies cant implement because of security and privacy issues taskwises productivity software www taskwise com fills this gap with a secure solution that can be implemented in house and that is completely scalable

6344189 we finished the season much stronger than we started off
6344190 old dominion is a tough team we missed some shots there in the second half that i thought could give us a little boost but we came up short
6344191 i really dont want to take off my jersey but im going to miss my teammates and my coaches because this is it
6344192 we want to defend our home floor were on a mission right now
6344193 i am quite relieved that the high court has taken a strict view in the matter and i hope that the system will improve with the verdict
6344194 they are senior advocates and they did not tender either conditional or unconditional apology for their conduct in the bmw case
6344195 this is utter despair because i am also a part of this system so i feel ashamed
6344196 no punishment is good enough but what can you do
6344197 in a way the sentence is much lighter than expected because there was blatant attempt at interference in administration of justice
6344198 the link between cancer and environmental factors such as pollution and pesticides is not strong with scientists believing these factors contribute to only about two percent of cancers diagnosed
6344199 more than half of those surveyed are also concerned about the link between stress and cancer but there is no conclusive evidence linking cancer and stress
6344200 what is surprising is that only a quarter of people surveyed highlighted uv radiation as a cause of cancer many are more inclined to believe myths than reality when it comes to what causes cancer
6344201 there are many causes of cancer that we do know about such as tobacco use sun exposure genetic risk factors and diet and lifestyle
6344202 good morning i am here yet again to make the impossible possible and push away the darkness that has tried to drown out your smiles
6344203 if youve got nothing to hide then why do you care whether the government is spying
6344204 if you arent doing anything wrong what do you have to hide
6344205 if im not doing anything wrong then you have no cause to watch me
6344206 because the government gets to define whats wrong and they keep changing the definition
6344207 its basically a post katrina history of the city it will be rooted in events that everybody knows

6344210 reproductive dysfunctions include a range of menstrual disorders sexual dysfunctions and pregnancy complications that include spontaneous abortion or miscarriage
6344211 teenagers who drink tend to have disruptions in their menstrual cycle as well as unplanned pregnancies
6344212 higher rates of reproductive dysfunction in adult women may reflect the cumulative effects of longer exposure to alcohol for older women than for female adolescents
6344213 to our knowledge this is the first study to examine alcohols effects on reproductive onset across reproductive development
6344214 most previous research has examined risks to teens or adults but not both our findings highlight a risk associated with ad in women that is not widely recognised a risk that has assumed increasing importance given the increased rates of alcohol misuse by women and particularly young women
6344215 we discovered that grapefruit and these other fruit juices substantially decrease the oral absorption of certain drugs undergoing intestinal uptake transport
6344216 the concern is loss of benefit of medications essential for the treatment of serious medical conditions

6344222 the majority of americans are completely unaware that their personal health and wellness has been compromised with ingredients that fuel the very diseases that they want to avoid
6344223 we think a great deal of this problem comes from the political influence of the food industry and a persistent disregard of consumer safety in favor of profits as far as were concerned its time the public were made well aware of the chemicals at play in the grocery products they buy to enable them to make better food choices for a healthier lifestyle and to beat the very conditions theyre trying to avoid

6344233 we are a little disappointed we are here for the gold but we missed it because we stuffed up at the start and we parked were still extremely happy about the silver
6344234 the conditions were really difficult today and we were quite nervous when we were out there we just reminded ourselves to concentrate more on the sailing and treat it like any other race
6344235 but we made up ground we were really pumped and just keep hanging in
6344236 todays bus service was arranged in order to clear the backlog of last week
6344237 sponges have one of the most ancient lineages and dont have nerve cells
6344238 so we are pretty confident it was after the sponges split from trunk of the tree of life and sponges went one way and animals developed from the other that nerves started to form what we found in sponges though were the building blocks for nerves something we never expected to find
6344239 what we have done is try to find the molecular building blocks of nerves or what may be called the nerves ancestor the proto neuron we found sets of these genes in sponges when we really didnt expect it
6344240 i cant do sex but i can give you a stickjob

6344258 the current economic conditions the uncertainties surrounding the general financial markets and mortgage availability will be defining factors in the return to a more normal housing market
6344259 until we see an improvement in respect of these factors it is difficult to predict the short term future with confidence
6344260 first time buyers are the people who have been hit hard we would say whatever the government can do do it for first time buyers
6344261 i cant foresee the future but i cant anticipate any further job cuts at this stage
6344262 the recent speculation regarding a change to stamp duty on housing transactions has undoubtedly caused further delay and uncertainty in respect of house purchases
6344263 i live here on less than a dollar a month
6344264 ive come here to chew bubble gum or kick ass and im all out of bubble gum
6344265 theres a sense that its a cutting edge destination where they can be among the first to learn firsthand about another culture
6344266 theres something about being one of the first in your generation to really have a deep understanding
6344267 its probably the most different and most unorthodox place i could think of
6344268 i kind of wanted that as opposed to england where the prestige is there but the life experience is kind of similar
6344269 i think thats one of the real divisions between studying abroad in europe and studying abroad in asia
6344270 even if it was harder than i expected it to be thats not necessarily a bad thing because i grew up a lot
6344271 were pretty sure that china can take more but exactly how many and in what fields and what would it take to double or quadruple the numbers thats something we as an industry will have to explore
6344272 i would have been sorely disappointed if i had left after the first semester
6344273 its now or never if it keeps spreading its going to become such a problem that were never going to be able to get a handle on it
6344274 if someone is spraying to control soybean rust and they have kudzu close at hand it could allow that rust to come back to their field
6344275 it was a story that had to be told and no one else could tell it
6344276 an incredible ambition and a huge amount of creativity and drive that ive never seen before
6344277 the census has been around for two hundred years and it is no longer gathering the right sort of data for modern public services
6344278 we are left in a situation where not only does central government not know where it should distribute public money but local councils do not have the information or flexibility to work out where best to spend money to tackle worklessness and crime or to gauge where future demand will be for care homes and schools
6344279 ive come here to chew bubble gum or kick ass and im all out of bubble gum
6344280 the students in general did very well in this years leaving cert results and most seemed to have achieved what they want
6344281 notting hill carnival is the highlight of the year for many thousands of londoners and visitors to our city
6344282 there is absolutely no excuse for anyone to take a weapon to the carnival and for anyone tempted to do so the message is clear you will be caught
6344283 carnival has a fantastic atmosphere and we see ourselves as key players in the overall event to allow people to enjoy all it has to offer
6344284 the large majority of people go to the carnival to enjoy the music and the sights but we want to make sure anyone who has other intentions knows what they can expect from us especially if they try to bring weapons to the event
6344285 mobile metal detection arches will be deployed throughout the tube network to detect and deter people carrying weapons
6344286 we are able to move the metal detectors at any time across the network sending a very clear message dont bring weapons to the carnival because we could be anywhere
6344287 when i was younger i always wanted to be a hog
6344288 that was the first thing i thought as soon as i got that offer that was how i felt then i started getting recruited by a lot more teams i just wanted to make sure i was making the right decision
6344289 the coaches were impressed with his physical ability and his speed
6344290 you dont find many 6 foot corners walking around with 4 28 speed plus hes 10 6 100 meter guy
6344291 a big physical corner winston has the size of a safety with the ball skills of a corner
6344292 he has excellent field vision in that hell find a way to get in on a play that is going away from him by peeling off of his coverage he uses his body well in coverage to establish position find the ball and shield the receiver without interfering and he has excellent ball skills in that he can contort his body to deflect a pass
6344293 if you want me to play bump and run i can do that if you want me to leave the receiver on the line ill leave him on the line if you want me to follow him down the field ill follow him down the field i feel like i can play man and i can play off man good i can also play zone real good i can read the quarterback i feel i can bring a lot to the team playing corner
6344294 hes a great recruiter he seems like hes down to earth hes very real hes not just going to tell me what i want to hear hes just going to tell me whats real
6344295 jay hop is the coolest cat besides ole miss coach houston nutt hes the coolest coach ive ever seen my brother was a coach and i got recruited so ive been around a long time i havent seen nothing like it
6344296 i looked at the top five schools on his list and got their depth charts
6344297 then i looked at all their corners that are sophomores and freshmen three schools jumped out more than other two arkansas michigan and ole miss a big key was the punt returning too darius has a chance to return punts at all of the schools
6344298 those are the only two schools he has visited but weve done so much research that he doesnt even really have to visit the other places
6344299 i feel like at arkansas they have great coaches and they have a great db coach
6344300 i grew up a coach nutt fan i worked for his brother
6344301 i made up my mind last week where i am going
6344302 i am just going to wait until sept 5 to announce my decision
6344303 he is a good vertical runner he gets that step in there and boom every time he gets the opportunity he is productive
6344304 but the new weight definitely helps me explode through the holes and be more aggressive i have always been aggressive but it seems like i am attacking the defense more than they are attacking me that is the biggest thing and i am more relaxed and having fun
6344305 i am not a flash back i am just that guy that finds a way to get it done i am a blue collar back i try to get what i can and if there is nothing there i get whatever i can that has always been my game
6344306 hes such a smart guy and such a competitive guy weve really been impressed with him
6344307 he is battling for a starting job at guard maybe by the first game
6344308 were not even hopeful hell be able to return this year
6344309 they were real excited with what i was doing the last two weeks
6344310 its a team thing coach rodriguez asked me gave me the decision but said hed really like me to do it i had to do what i had to do for the team
6344311 ive got to get coach rodriguez to throw me the ball
6344312 who you announce as the starting quarterback i think a lot of times is way overrated unless two guys are completely different styles theyre both the same style type of guy
6344313 i just think the competition is still out there that im not ready to declare a starter nick has had better days than steve and then steve had some days where hes done better than nick at the end of spring steve may have been a little bit ahead nick has closed that gap at least if not more so this fall its all speculation weve got another four or five practices before i declare for sure
6344314 i just knew we had to try to do something
6344315 apostoluen dantza ikuskizunari buruz une batean soka moztu egingo da eta alde batean zazpi dantzari geratuko dira eta beste aldean beste zazpi eta tartean jorgeren apostoluak dantza kate bat bezala jorgeri keinu bat da
6344316 in and of itself a breath of relief for many players who were wanting that kind of unabashed magic in the game and a cause for stomach churning for people who are really into the lore that think were going to suddenly turn it into flying wizards and stuff like that
6344317 the best thing for me is to get real game action
6344318 but you have to balance that against re injuring it
6344319 they are all gray and faceless people it is us getting better that is all this is about
6344320 i want to make sure this team improves on what we are doing our pace our tackling once you start looking at opponents it takes your edge off i am still looking at us in training camp mode
6344321 if god hates anyone based on what they prefer then god himself is a loser and should gtfo

6344324 hello my name is inigo montoya you killed my father prepare to die
6344325 a band of faithful brothers have given us this book to clear the fog present the truth protect us from wrongheadedness and help us on our way
6344326 i told myself as i was walking to the plate that if its out over the plate im going to swing at it and thats what it was
6344327 sometimes i have to do that because ill get too picky up there and not swing and not be myself
6344328 thats not a routine play because he did a good job to get in front of it and knock it down that would have been a terrific play if he could have made it
6344329 hes got to dive and knock a ball down and get an out all at the same time
6344330 that was a routine fly ball that ball should have been caught and i would not want to my pitcher saddled with three earned runs because of it am i arguing that its called an error all the time no but im making the point that ball should have been an out and the inning should have been over
6344331 id love to see joyce get three more rbi but if thats not an out this is not major league baseball
6344332 if no one touches it its not an error because the question is who do you give it to it was just a misjudgment between two of the outfielders you cant award an error for that
6344333 you feel the bad for the pitcher when that happens but i just think it should be a hit and thats not just because it happened to a teammate since ive been little to now if no one touches it its not an error
6344334 meanwhile the coaches who wanted to keep galarraga were both fired this month for the teams pitching failures so it goes in arlington these days
6344335 hes a bright kid evidently i dont know book wise but im not teaching biology baseball wise hes really made adjustments i dont know where wed be without him
6344336 but this is his routine right now he puts on his bib overalls no shoes or socks has a straw hat on and a case of beer next to him his hat is down over his eyes and he has a fishing pole next to him while he takes a nap
6344337 i read you are coming back next year jim that was never in question was it

6344367 nadie sab a lo que le pasaba se apag nunca volvi a ser el mismo ah me enter que otra t a le hab a recomendado a la madre de diego llevarlo al neur logo por d ficit atencional le dieron pastillas
6344368 no creo que todos los ni os tengan d ficit atencional no puede ser les dan pastillas para que se calmen pero es tarea de los educadores buscar formas para integrarlos para que tomen en cuenta lo que les ense as
6344369 el ritalin est en v as de trivializarse porque se presenta como a la insulina para los diab ticos

6344371 lo que pasa es que la gente quiere soluciones m gicas y como la pastilla act a r pido entonces creen que con eso solucionan el problema pero se equivocan a veces haciendo una intervenci n con los padres y a nivel escolar con la profesora jefe solicitando su colaboraci n en cuanto a un trato m s amable y cari oso con el ni o se logran resultados asombrosos

6344395 people have won medals in areas where we have been breaking new ground for the first time
6344396 but this week i believe that our olympic athletes and everybody else in our country will remember that you have shown exactly the same courage professionalism and dedication
6344397 you make our country proud every day of the week and every week of the year you are truly heroes of our country
6344398 you know that you are on the frontline of the fight against the taliban and you know that what you are doing here prevents
6344399 terror free afghanistan but also an afghanistan where there will be a democracy and people will have a stake in the future
6344400 well be pressing on the pakistanis themselves to be involved with us in fighting terrorism and making sure the number of terrorists coming into afghanistan from pakistan is limited
6344401 we will see that happening but in our view our strategy will be to build up the afghan army to build up the rest of afghan society
6344402 successful schools can be left alone to do their own thing while failing schools are subject to increasingly active levels of first support and then control
6344403 would be a move to a bottom up organization which has proved so successful in the rest of our society
6344404 we got rid of the school board anyone interested in market driven education should be watching new orleans
6344405 a real positive outcome would be if the experiment could translate the advantages of the top half of the selective schools into success for the rest of the public school children as well there is little evidence of that happening at this time

6344459 the track looks amazing and the location is fantastic so i am really looking forward to this grand prix the team has worked hard to prepare for this race because it is a new track for all of us but from a drivers point of view the important thing is to drive it for the first time and then you can start to understand more about the circuit i enjoy going to new venues because they are a new challenge and there is always something to discover every race is unique and i like that even though this is a new track for us i know valencia pretty well from all the testing we have done at the other circuit there it is a lively city and there always seems to be something going on so it should be a fun weekend i am expecting a competitive weekend as well because at the moment we are looking quite strong scoring more points is our target and if we challenge for the podium again that would be great
6344460 im still smiling after hungary that was an incredible result and a fantastic feeling i hope it will be the first of many podiums in formula 1 the important thing was that we showed just how competitive we are at the moment and moved further ahead in fourth place in the constructors championship there is a great atmosphere in the team and we are all working hard together to move forward which is why it was so satisfying to get on the podium in hungary but valencia is a new race and we must start again i did plenty of street races when i was racing in champ cars and in that season almost all the tracks were new to me so i have learnt to adapt quickly it looks like an interesting circuit and its quite long so it should be a good show we will have plenty of work to do on friday to adjust the car to the track but we are in good form at the moment so i am optimistic for this weekend
6344461 we are well prepared for valencia of course we started our preparations for this new track by looking at the fia information and that allowed us to put forward some speed profiles in order to estimate downforce and braking requirements for example we also sent staff to look at the inaugural race meeting there at the end of july and that gave us additional data with regards to speed profiles driving lines and track surface we expect the track to be in the mid range of downforce and quite severe on brakes at the beginning we anticipate grip will be quite low but that should improve throughout the weekend in terms of performance we clearly want to build on the competitiveness shown in hungary we are genuinely challenging to be the third quickest car based on the last few races valencia will also show how well teams can react to new conditions so it will be an interesting weekend and we have every reason to be feeling very positive

6344538 its a pretty active pattern for us the storms are pretty close together for august
6344539 i just saw the plight of people using the trains to get to work every morning they were jostling to get on board every time a train arrived there appeared to be no system
6344540 im not happy with this because the people are not getting satisfaction from riding the trains this we must fix
6344541 i found the trains really packed with so many passengers
6344542 theres no queue people push their way in women with children and old people are pushed aside
6344543 there were many more suggestions given me by the passengers for my attention i will strive for improvements i will propose changes

6344547 ninety per cent of the work is convincing people that the eyes are real
6344548 the subtlety of the timing of eye movements is a big one people also have a natural asymmetry for instance in the muscles in the side of their face those types of imperfections arent that significant but they are what makes people look real
6344549 theres always been control systems for different facial movements but say in the past you had a dial for controlling whether an eye was open or closed and in one frame you set the eye at 3 4 open the next 1 2 open etc this is like achieving that degree of control with much finer movements
6344550 for instance you could be controlling the movement in the top 3 4mm of the right side of the smile

6344569 wyomings life and property losses due to severe weather are among the lowest in the country this is due in part to the states very low population density and its geographical location clashes between contrasting air masses that produce severe weather are minimized in part because of the rocky mountains ability to separate and block prevailing air flows from the gulf of mexico north central north america and the pacific ocean as a result wyoming has had the fewest one billion dollar weather disasters in the us during the past two decades however severe weathers impact on transportation agriculture ranching tourism and industry is still a force to be reckoned with

6344607 bullying is a societal problem not one that is unique to washington county one solution would be to get children more involved and feeling more comfortable students need to feel that its all right to tell an adult when they overhear something that disturbs them too often bullying occurs when teachers and school administrators arent around to witness it so its not that the school isnt trying to do something about it often they are unaware she suggests counseling students that they should tell teachers counselors administrators or another adult when they are bullied or when they witness other children being bullied
6344608 i dont think theres a systemic widespread bullying problem do i think bullying exists absolutely the policy currently used is based on good research its a matter of educating parents and even staff that certain things shouldnt be tolerated he said additional staff development might be necessary and suggested sharing information with parents and children about bullying kids may not even realize what theyre doing eliminating bullying will require a system wide program of education for staff along with giving information to parents and students about bullying and its effects he said
6344609 bullying does take place and has for as long as kids have been kids what i would do is make certain that our administrators and teachers understand what constitutes bullying he said that might take additional professional development define it define what bullying is what the consequences are going to be and make sure we do it
6344610 he believes there is bullying in washington county just like at other schools across the nation

6344629 this new outbreak in dunfermline underlines the need for a full public inquiry on c difficile so that lessons can be learned from the recent tragedy at the vale of leven where 18 people died
6344630 families have an absolute right to know that when their loved ones go into hospital they will be cared for in clean and safe conditions
6344631 sadly nicola sturgeon the health secretary has been consistently complacent about c diff
6344632 we are spending a record sum of 54 million over the next three years and have one of the most comprehensive sets of policies and procedures to manage hais in europe
6344633 recent events at the vale of leven however show how vital it is for nhs boards to ensure that these policies and procedures are applied at local level to a high standard
6344634 i intend to raise the issue with every board during this summers annual reviews
6344635 i have asked the hai task force chaired by the chief nursing officer to ensure that a robust and comprehensive action plan for infection control is implemented across scotland we need to address hais on all fronts
6344636 the vale of leven got severely criticised because it was another hospital that was due to be downgraded and they werent spending money on maintenance
6344637 in the case of the queen margaret a large proportion of the wards come 2012 will be redundant
6344638 im not suggesting that theyre skimping on anything just now but im putting a warning out dont try to skimp on maintenance
6344639 i have no doubt that they will get rid of the problem but when will it crop up again it seems to be cropping up all the time in other countries they manage to get it hais down to virtually nil so there are obviously some things we are not doing right
6344640 they need to keep on top of this as best they can it spreads like wildfire it can be rife in nursing homes too
6344641 i was shocked to hear that this infection has affected seven patients in queen margaret hospital
6344642 i hope that the patients families and staff continue to work towards treatment and hopefully a solution in the very near future to remove the spectre of this very concerning disease from queen margaret hospital
6344643 im absolutely sure that the staff will be doing all they can to contain that and bring it towards a successful conclusion
6344644 the hospital doesnt offer any method of visitors cleaning themselves i would like to see all visitors from the moment they enter the hospital being made to wear paper shoe covers because they are coming in from a pretty mucky environment outside
6344645 people are walking across grass bits of ground that have been used by dogs as a toilet area for god knows how long and then coming up to the hospital to visit loved ones
6344646 how on earth can a hospital keep itself clean when it cant stop it at the front door staff too are allowed in with outside shoes the kind of possible source of contamination spreads right throughout the hospital every hour of every day
6344647 its a hellish disease its not enough just to clean your hands and clean your clothes the dirty clothes must be sterilised completely because c diff can exist as spores in clothes which makes it deadly
6344648 unless the clothes are either burned or thoroughly boil washed to kill the spores you are not going to get rid of it very quickly if your immune system is very low as most patients do have then theyre sitting ducks for it

6344862 he will be a great loss to the club on the field and also off it because of sheer amount of work he has done for the club in that area
6344863 he has been a tremendous ambassador for rugby league and for bradford bulls and for me personally getting my first head coachs job he has been a vital part of what i have done

6344928 this economy is actually a window of opportunity for those savvy enough and bold enough to take advantage of the downturn
6344929 in harsh economies too many small business owners are quick to think of their own needs profit yet fail to ask how well they are serving their customers
6344930 now is the time to bring innovation and creativity to helping your businesss clients weather their own economic storms

6344943 its unlikely that a broadcast network is ever again going to create a megahit like the cosby show which at its mid 80s peak drew as many as 50 million viewers an episode for several years now tvs top event has been foxs american idol last season it drew 28 8 million viewers a week
6344944 in many ways the networks themselves already have specific brand identities they just dont admit it for decades cbs has had the most elderly demographic among the major networks abc specializes in comedies and light dramas with strong female appeal fox with the exception of american idol is largely aimed at guys the fledgling cw is building on gossip girl and americas next top model to chase young women nbcs struggles are not unrelated to the fact that its still trying to be all things to all people

6344947 for a player its always hard to say when but i think the time is right for me now to make the ultimate decision
6344948 ive been at bradford for eight years and a professional for 15 and i have thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it but the old body is telling me to give it away
6344949 we have some great players coming through here players like sam burgess andy lynch and craig kopczak and i just feel the time is right to hang up my boots and enjoy the game from the sidelines
6344950 he will be a great loss to the club on the field and also off it because of sheer amount of work he has done for the club in that area
6344951 he has been a tremendous ambassador for rugby league and for bradford bulls and for me personally getting my first head coachs job he has been a vital part of what i have done
6344952 to have had joe vagana in the organisation to help me along the way has been a massive bonus for me and id like to thank him personally for that it goes without saying that we all wish him every success in whichever avenue he decides to take
6344953 it is my hope that reading these stories inspires some to plant their own seeds of change that when we see something wrong well do something about it whether that means writing to your representative in congress or researching a cure for a disease or simply speaking out against inequality and prejudice were all in this together and the first step toward change can begin with any one of us

6344956 the committee for the liberation of iraq was the brainchild of the bush administration

6344958 but it will limit itself to policy matters and will not deal with details it will eventually press for a competitive petroleum production sharing regime which could make opec irrelevant to iraqs oil output or supply decisions
6344959 sessions with opinion makers contacts for journalists and mass marketing when the time is ripe
6344960 by joining our efforts senators mccain and lieberman highlight their commitment to ending the threat posed by saddam hussein and freeing the iraqi people
6344961 with nato now set to enlarge from 19 members to take on seven east european nations including the three baltic states it is said that both the bush team and the committee for the liberation of iraq want the political mechanism of the atlantic alliance to replace the un security council in giving multilateral legitimacy to any major u s action outside north america
6344962 this is because unlike the un security council where the french or russians might block american action natos political decisions do not require consensus only natos military decisions require consensus
6344963 considering the nations including the baltic states signed on the group at the expense of creating a schism in the european union the scheunemann initiative was unanimously regarded as a diplomatic triumph for washington and a coup detat in brussels

6345117 obviously were keeping an open mind that it may or may not work we hope that it does work though because these would both be safe and widely applicable interventions that could help us in keeping older people healthy fit and independent
6345118 honestly i dont see how this has much to do with your election
6345119 the bottom line is they had sold these coffins to people and they were imitations of an american made casket and so they got a restraining order to stop doing that
6345120 should have been aware of this going on and here hes actively marketing foreign products undermining american made products
6345121 the product the chinese are offering us now its a quality product
6345122 you put a chinese casket next to a york casket or one of these other manufacturers you cant tell the difference

6345125 libelous containing many misstatements of fact and stating conclusions that are meant to do nothing but maliciously harm crowder funeral homes
6345126 i am quite relieved that the high court has taken a strict view in the matter and i hope that the system will improve with the verdict
6345127 this is utter despair because i am also a part of this system so i feel ashamed
6345128 no punishment is good enough but what can you do
6345129 in a way the sentence is much lighter than expected because there was blatant attempt at interference in administration of justice
6345130 they were trashing it so bad the city got onto me i said the city is the one that needs to help me with this
6345131 to say theyre not bothering anyone or doing anything wrong is a misnomer
6345132 do i think homeless people are bad no but theyre here because its easy and because we werent enforcing public order crimes weve received a mandate from the citizens to clean up the city and take back the neighborhoods so here we go
6345133 the ones that were usually out here giving us problems are in jail right now
6345134 i cant rest i understand some of it i dont like people begging me if youre not bothering nobody why do you have to move where do you want me to go
6345135 on the one hand the crude inventory buildup was quite strong but the gasoline draw was also very prominent
6345136 before that meeting were going to get quite a few statements from opec officials expressing opinions in the end i dont expect a production cut but they may push for greater adherence to output quotas
6345137 but putting things on the skin puts them straight into your blood stream

6345161 essendon is decimated i suppose but i can guarantee that essendon will put out 22 players on the field and theyll be having a red hot go
6345162 we do need to win we would probably go into the game as favourites but were going to go into it with an underdog attitude
6345163 weve got the confidence in our players and we think with just a few minor tweaks and adjustments in their attitude we can get the results we had earlier in the year
6345164 tommy wont play this week hell play the following week barring any setbacks

6345167 theres a great vibrancy around the club all weve got to do is win these last two games and hope some results go our way
6345168 we played really well against them early on in the year but theyve improved in terms of contested ball possession and clearance work which is what were good at so that will be a good challenge
6345169 i still think theyre a quality side i dont think where they are on the ladder is really what theyre capable of
6345170 theyve got some good players and i think their second half of the year theyve been in games where theyve only lost by a couple of kicks or that sort of thing

6345216 all of the games in umove are based on the dimension of movement and the gameplay will reflect this
6345217 sticking this extra control on existing games would have been easy but we felt it was a great opportunity to create a new kind of game really based upon the fact that you move hence the name umove
6345218 technology can be fun but our focus remains on the user experience we really wanted to package this into something utilizing the new possibilities that movement provides we believe that our umove product line is a good first step in really taking the mobile games experience to the next level
6345219 russian and georgian people have always been together we know that russians have saved georgians from enslavement and extermination more than once we know how we helped each other in our shared trials whether it was the great patriotic war or hardships of the soviet period when faith and church were persecuted
6345220 we know how rich are our orthodox christian cultures how many russian georgian families live in russia and georgia how many georgians live in our country and make their worthy contribution in its economics culture science and other spheres of life today its very important not to waste the potential of our friendship and our mutual help
6345221 only a madman can declare all georgians are enemies and kindle anti georgian moods in the country
6345222 politicians come and go conflicts are always crowned with peace but nations keep on living and we have to show wisdom good will patience and love so that our orthodox peoples could always feel their connection to one gods affair to one church of christ and always prefer peace to hostility and love to hatred

6345236 mit dem gro en meister auf der bank gewann die schweiz gegen zypern 4 1 dennoch w re es falsch den sieg zu hoch zu bewerten israel wird in der wm qualifikation bald ein weit st rkerer gegner sein
6345237 trotz dieses 4 1 erfolges vermochte die schweizer equipe nicht restlos zu berzeugen ob eine solche leistung im wm qualifikationsspiel gegen das unangenehme israel am 6 september reicht bleibt nach diesem ersten spiel unter ottmar hitzfeld fraglich ein erfolgreicher einstand war es aber allemal

6345261 wij zijn in volle expansie en wilde binnen enkele maanden een gedeelte van de zaak verhuizen naar een nieuw pand hier zou de outlet shop komen en iets verderop in de straat een meer moderne winkel met de nieuwe collectie ook de nieuw aangekochte stock voor onze zaak in peer die binnenkort opent lag hier gestockeerd
6345262 gisteren kon ik er onmogelijk in door de rook en de hitte het begint nu pas echt door te dringen dat ik vanaf nul kan beginnen de hele stock is waardeloos de binneninrichting is zo goed als afgebroken om het vuur te bestrijden
6345263 de brandweer heeft via onze binnenmuur het vuur bij de buurman bestreden op die plaats was de waterschade vrij groot ook de beschadiging aan de muren is aanzienlijk maar het ergst is het gesteld met onze stock de reuk is niet uit de kleding te krijgen en daardoor onverkoopbaar

6345276 er is een determinerende invloed op de identiteit van de betrokken regios en hun inwoners het gaat om regios die allemaal voor de uitdaging staan een nieuwe toekomst te bouwen maar het schept meteen ook vragen naar de identiteit van de bevolking en de wijze waarop de maatschappij hierop reflecteert en daarbij spelen media en beeldvorming een belangrijke rol het is belangrijk na te gaan welke actuele kracht uitgaat van de geschiedenis en het verwant voelen van die bevolking er mee
6345277 we gaan na hoe in de europese mijngebieden wordt omgegaan met beeld en identiteitsvorming onder meer met gesprekken maar ook door actuele en gearchiveerd fotografisch werk te bestuderen we maken er meteen ook gebruik van om ter plekke zelf voor een fotografische documentaire te zorgen in het donbasgebied gebeurt dit met de hulp van danny veys een docent aan de hogeschool sint lukas in brussel

6345321 im happy with the draw because the reaction of the team to the last minute was important and good
6345322 i think also in the first half we played good football with style we created a lot of chances to score goals and the team played together better with different style
6345323 i think this night we took another step im happy i saw things i have doubts about i think we are ready for the next game
6345324 only one thing i didnt like in the first half sometimes when the czechs countered we suffered
6345325 this is a problem and we have to do something about the problem

6345367 the conservatives are spending a lot on the creation side but the whole point with trade routes in the first place was whats the point in creating all this content if it isnt seen with a small amount of money we were able to maximize what we were already spending which was not insignificant
6345368 you would have an embassy presence and a calendar of events in the major capitals around the world and in just about every country something would be happening culturally for canada by canadians

6345370 it does seem like we shoot ourselves in the foot weve spent years building up a canadian presence abroad and there are industries and countries that are poised to actually see returns on that it would be nice to have a dialogue to know exactly what the thinking is because it seems shortsighted

6345510 der zeitplan war so angelegt dass ich nie l nger als drei tage pro woche arbeiten musste zudem hat der regisseur selbst vier kinder und reagierte sehr verst ndnisvoll wenn ich mitten in einer actionszene kurz mit meiner milchpumpe verschwinden musste
6345511 es f hlt sich an als w rden mir die augen jeden tag ein st ckchen weiter ge ffnet ich h tte nie gedacht dass ich jemals so m de sein einen menschen so sehr lieben und von jedem pups meiner tochter so begeistert sein w rde
6345512 dass wir an einem comicstoff arbeiten habe ich immer mal wieder vergessen weil alle schauspieler so ernst und qualit tsbesessen waren wie bei einem shakespeare drama ein gewaltiger unterschied zu all meinen kleinen filmen zeigte sich bei den kost men w hrend ich sonst meine eigene kleidung zum dreh mitbringe reichte das budget diesmal f r zahlreiche fabelhafte outfits die mir allesamt auf den leib geschneidert wurden

6345519 with the recent boom in the online gaming market were looking to hire 100 new employees in a range of different jobs
6345520 last month after the closure of ribeiro kalen inc we hired nearly half of all their admin staff in one week
6345521 and this has really helped our business in many ways and given these people another chance at having meaningful employment in this online gaming industry
6345522 this test is not meant to scare off prospective hirees
6345523 but we want to see how they can apply the skills they have to the real life needs of written communication and critical thinking
6345524 this new program has really helped our online gaming company
6345525 and it also allows us to see what other firms are offering to new job applicants this helps get an edge on the competition and strengthens our human capital greatly
6345526 its important for all our top hires to know individuals within the industry and individuals within our company this makes marketing and sales work much easier and more efficient so if your uncle bob at a major online gaming firm offers you a job youre advised to take it
6345527 we also want highly motivated individuals with a background in online gaming marketing on the internet
6345528 mostly because our internet sales division is booming and we need to explore all marketing opportunities within this important medium
6345529 we believe this time gives us an opportunity to evaluate new hires and decide if we made the right decision in offering them work if they dont pass this temporary evaluation period we offer the job to anyone on our waiting list

6345553 i said well there wasnt much difference between indianas success and iowas success last year she said i know i can help the hawkeyes win and its the hawkeyes i want to help that meant a lot to me
6345554 i think when the change was made she was very excited
6345555 one of the things we said is that we wanted to have it done as soon as possible but we also werent going to rush it ahead instead of finding the right person
6345556 wed like the person to start as close to the beginning of the season as possible
6345557 but we dont have a date where it must happen by this day but the sooner the better

6345559 we have all sorts of educational programs in place all sorts of things we do every fall and those things are continuing
6345560 i feel like digging a hole and burying myself in it right now

6345562 i didnt pull the trigger earlier i didnt really give myself a chance
6345563 you dont give yourself a chance how do you expect to win

6345565 its a big leap but definitely not out of the question for us
6345566 we definitely think its possible its definitely one of the big goals for us and it can be done
6345567 winning is going to be our biggest measurement we need to win and were going to win
6345568 we only lost one senior last year everyone is on the same page its not going to be easy but its doable its one thing were really excited about
6345569 our staff walked into a pretty nice situation there are 13 players here returning for us the biggest thing is just what we expect the expectation is to win and getting the players to have that same expectation
6345570 we wont lose matches because we get outworked if we lose matches its because the other team is better

6345580 nobody is good at everything but you must find your own niche while developing a broad commercial acumen
6345581 if you cannot consolidate your knowledge and experience in a job hopping from one position to another wont help
6345582 you must consider the growth environment that is being presented to you and leave the monetary prospects on the sideline
6345583 you may choose to feed the negative wolf and put the positive in the shade but how far can you go it is therefore essential to be positive and confident about your potential and capability and most importantly have the courage to go far
6345584 peter drucker1 advocates that were all knowledge workers knowledge sees no boundaries and the notion of knowledge acquisition is a mentality you must grow incessantly in a learning environment of your creation

6345600 with the release of ruth freemantles new casino computer programmer volunteers book were going to see record traffic levels
6345601 i think mivshek golass new docu novel leads readers astray there is too much focus on making the fictional characters function whereas more attention should have been paid to the facts
6345602 i like the fact that it reaches out to those outside of the literary world this is a wise decision and proves a good way to educate others about new things
6345603 in the literary world we seek to heighten public awareness about the casino computer programmer volunteers industry and how it works this is absolutely essential for those in the academic literary and research fields
6345604 because the work that has been done in the casino computer programmer volunteers literary area has been huge
6345605 i fully expect a sequel to be release within six months
6345606 typically we see interest wane a year after the initial release so it is important to stay on schedule and release subsequent books at pique points of public interest
6345607 pre sale polls show this new casino computer programmer volunteers book doubling gross sales figures of other recent releases
6345608 and i believe millicent strasterss book may be a complete blockbuster if trends stick well see marked sales numbers within two weeks that will demonstrate year highs
6345609 i think teaching this story will be highly educational for my casino computer programmer volunteers students irregardless of what critics believe
6345610 heck if we always listened to critics nothing would be sold they serve a purpose but i leave the fact checking to qualified historians and researchers
6345611 but were doing it to make sure no unauthorized copies get resold we want to avoid plagiarism and pirating as much as possible furthermore this will be our new procedure for future releases by author cornelia bisel who has pledged support for this system

6345617 emotions are indeed high compulsion to get even is blazing and to take actions without regard to cherished moral values are being pressed however army soldiers were reminded that they should not be provoked to pursue punitive actions against milf perpetrators beyond the armys treasured moral principles
6345618 army commanders stressed to their men that abandoning democratic principles to confront terrorism will run counter to the moral values that the military organization stands for
6345619 undisputedly the ruthless attacks against unarmed and hapless civilians and the pillaging of their properties and the burning of their houses were certainly acts of terror these milf deeds to coerce the government to submit to its demands though the use of ruthless violence depict the organization as a terrorist group rather than anything else
6345620 from ala moana to diamond head if you check its the only free parking left and we want to keep some parking to be able to come into waikiki and keep coming to waikiki

6345622 so the idea is to form a group where whatever your opinion is youll get in some way a chance to say it and get into it
6345623 we have been struggling with this issue many harbor users for many many years and its great opportunity for the public to have input into a public facility and how its best used
6345624 this is just our way to try to get on a committee to try and help the idea makers come up with realistic and user friendly ideas for the parking
6345625 people dont even know why they are here they dont know why because we have the officer here and he better explain

6345631 the time i spent there made me want to go into biology and medicine
6345632 as a field evidence based medicine is relatively new and its an area that is hard to teach and hard to learn
6345633 it was a challenge because im not a parasitologist or invertebrate zoologist or epidemiologist
6345634 i had to learn quite a few basic principles while designing the field exercises fortunately i had my father and other biology faculty to help and a great graduate student as a teaching assistant
6345635 evidence based medicine is often taught in lecture and small groups but its difficult to reproduce the real world aspects of evidence based medicine in the classroom
6345636 that was the driving force for building the field course
6345637 we did experiments to put theoretical concepts into a real world context
6345638 we were in the field daily to learn about cohort studies we did one to learn about statistical techniques we would apply them to actual populations rather than just read about them
6345639 its not right for every student but its ideally suited for those with an interest in academic medicine or research
6345640 we climbed barbed wire fences and got muddy and wet tramping across fields and through streams its not a course for someone who wants to sit in an air conditioned classroom all day but the students had a good time and the more time we spent in the field the happier they were

6345646 die teilnehmer haben unser innovatives konzept angenommen mit zahlreichen eigenen themen gef llt und wollen unbedingt weitermachen
6345647 es zeigt uns dass sich wissenschaft und wirtschaft interdisziplin r austauschen wollen um ergebnisse und qualit t voranzutreiben unsere n chste veranstaltung wird in 2009 stattfinden
6345648 der regisseur versicherte mir dass katie das total locker sieht und vor allem anderweitig verpflichtet ist ich schrieb ihr dennoch eine e mail weil mir ihr segen wichtig war als wir uns zuf llig bei einer modenschau trafen einigten wir uns darauf einem exklusiven club anzugeh ren batmans freundin d rfen nicht viele spielen
6345649 es kommt sehr selten vor dass man schauspieler trifft die in ihrer kreativit t absolut frei und furchtlos agieren heath war an diesem punkt und steckte jeden an der mit ihm drehte wir hatten zwar nur eine gemeinsame szene doch wir sa en in den pausen oft zusammen und sprachen auch ber unsere kinder er hatte ja auch eine kleine tochter matilda 3 anm d red
6345650 der zeitplan war so angelegt dass ich nie l nger als drei tage pro woche arbeiten musste zudem hat der regisseur selbst vier kinder und reagierte sehr verst ndnisvoll wenn ich mitten in einer actionszene kurz mit meiner milchpumpe verschwinden musste
6345651 es f hlt sich an als w rden mir die augen jeden tag ein st ckchen weiter ge ffnet ich h tte nie gedacht dass ich jemals so m de sein einen menschen so sehr lieben und von jedem pups meiner tochter so begeistert sein w rde
6345652 dass wir an einem comicstoff arbeiten habe ich immer mal wieder vergessen weil alle schauspieler so ernst und qualit tsbesessen waren wie bei einem shakespeare drama ein gewaltiger unterschied zu all meinen kleinen filmen zeigte sich bei den kost men w hrend ich sonst meine eigene kleidung zum dreh mitbringe reichte das budget diesmal f r zahlreiche fabelhafte outfits die mir allesamt auf den leib geschneidert wurden
6345653 sch n w rs ich sollte daf r eine vertragsklausel einbauen lassen aber privat trage ich ohnehin lieber bequeme sachen ich will nicht ber u erlichkeiten ein image kultivieren wie es heute so manche schauspielerin macht ich finde es spannender undurchschaubar zu sein als die eigene haut zu markte zu tragen
6345654 ich glaube nicht an das vorherbestimmte schicksal man entwickelt es selbst

6345660 we cant have the same kind of shoot first and aim second approach in our foreign policy weve got to have some kind of judgment in our foreign policy and restore our alliances around the world

6345681 trading conditions have been the most challenging in persimmons recent history our results for the period reflect this difficult market
6345682 there has been a major step down in activity since the end of march
6345683 the current economic conditions the uncertainties surrounding the general financial markets and mortgage availability will be defining factors in the return to a more normal housing market
6345684 until we see an improvement in respect of these factors it is difficult to predict the short term future with confidence
6345685 first time buyers are the people who have been hit hard we would say whatever the government can do do it for first time buyers
6345686 since the apple soho store moved in six years ago it has become the worst neighbour in soho
6345687 no bar nightclub or construction site comes close to ruining continually our quality of life like apple soho has
6345688 this concert attracted thousands of young teenage girls who screamed incessantly on the street for hours for their idols blocking traffic injuring one resident in the crush and inconveniencing scores of other people and businesses
6345689 flood lights on the roof often kept on all night glaring into peoples homes
6345690 crowds for apple soho on a regular basis that necessitate police barricades adding to pedestrian crowding preventing access to high end businesses on greene street and subsequent diminution of income as well as restricting residents access to their homes
6345691 subsequent litter left by these crowds who often number in the hundreds and who line up and even camp out overnight on public sidewalks giving soho the appearance of a homeless encampment
6345692 apple employees during their breaks lounging eating smoking littering in effect trespassing on nearby peoples stoops
6345693 residents and businesses of soho desperately need your help regarding constant problems we have with apple soho

6345696 theres an array of plants with an array of different chemicals and toxins that they attack from tobacco to coal to benzene which you find in paints to formaldehyde
6345697 in eduarda england the aspidistra plant which is also known as a cast iron plant was used to filter coal and tobacco smoke out of the house
6345698 to this day it is a wonderful house plant because it grows with almost no direct light and is a very easy to care for
6345699 the lady palm is also known as rhapis excelsa its a low light palm and it has the ability to remove ammonia from the air which means if you spend the day cleaning the house this is a wonderful plant to have
6345700 other great plants that are easily recognized are the great leaf ivy both the green leave and variegated the snake plant will live in absolute darkness and only takes watering once a week
6345701 the philodendron and of course the dracaena marginata will both work to filter the air and improve the quality of the life in your homes
6345702 while these changes will increase listings impact to the demand side of the equation remains to be seen
6345703 given that ebay made no change to financial guidance as a result of the lower insertion fees the increase to final value charges are clearly significant

6345712 hes been given all the tools now is the hard part putting that to practice
6345713 it hasnt been the most ideal summer for an outdoor pool
6345714 we maybe had two groups that came back with a little bit of flooding in their overnight shelters
6345715 i know its part of washington but its kind of sad because its august and its not supposed to rain in august

6345719 its kind of sad i love the sun and i love the heat
6345720 the items recovered from the locker can and have been used to construct improvised explosive devices
6345721 colins joined the army and kennys joined the navy and theyre here helping us out
6345722 weve never mentioned it as i dont like making an excuse but we have got quite an injury list with six players out when you carry a squad of 22 players six out certainly takes you down but weve just got to get on with it
6345723 they had a great result on saturday and theyve got some good young boys games against dalbeattie are as hard as the others
6345724 if you dont give teams the respect theyre due itll come back and haunt you we must get a level of consistency and have no complacency against anybody
6345725 you dont win things just by beating certain teams youve got to beat everybody thats put in front of you were trying to get consistency running in games
6345726 i expect a hard game but home advantage is nice and the boys will maybe be out trying to get a bit of revenge after dropping points to them
6345727 i just feel theyll mix in with the younger boys and give them a good balance but we wont be leaving it at that
6345728 when i took over we decided wed have a good look at it and were looking to keep on strengthening
6345729 crichton have been going really well well give it our best shot itll be much the same as the first game if i can maintain the attitude we had on saturday well be able to give it our best shot
6345730 im not promising any miracles but well keep disciplined and will play the style of football we like to play which is keeping it on the deck and passing the ball
6345731 we both had a few boys missing then and theyll be up for it theyll be out for revenge
6345732 weve got a full squad and should have bj fairhurst and neil mcwhirter back
6345733 its always a good place to go and i know a lot of the boys there from when i was there and im looking forward to it
6345734 we had a word with jason and we decided just to call it quits he wasnt happy either he knows himself he wasnt doing stuff
6345735 weve got two young keepers just now well see how these two young boys get on but you need an experienced keeper well be on the lookout for a keeper and if a good experienced one comes up well sign him and if not well go with what weve got
6345736 we know what were up against down there theyre probably even stronger now
6345737 theyre certainly scoring goals for fun and theyll be looking forward to playing us to try to get some more goals well just try our best
6345738 well go into it the same way as we go into any other game were certainly not worrying about it well give it a good shot we wont put 10 men behind the ball you dont win any games like that
6345739 ah well just run some cloud management software on a bunch of machines
6345740 success is in the eye of the beholder some would say that sixth avenue is quite successful others see it as a total failure it depends on your perspective
6345741 now its a victim of its own success theres no parking
6345742 the structures there are in appropriate scope and scale with the nearby single family residential neighborhoods we dont have skyscrapers next to family homes
6345743 if the building is designated as historic then it has the protections if the building is just old and has not been designated then its subject to demolition
6345744 but we have put some incentives in the code to discourage that
6345745 youre telling tcc that all future buildings on a 155 acre campus should be on the edges
6345746 in practice it would force tcc to submit variance requests for virtually all buildings
6345747 i think you will hear that tcc has been a very good neighbor
6345748 our neighborhood has changed dramatically since you changed the zoning
6345749 in all the years that ive been there i have not felt unsafe until now
6345750 my concern is you want to increase the population density and the infrastructure has to support that density
6345751 it hasnt been the most ideal summer for an outdoor pool

6345756 ninety degrees doesnt slow him down and this wont either
6345757 its kind of sad i love the sun and i love the heat
6345758 m s socialismo m s lenin y trotsky y menos guabineo
6345759 una arepa rellena de carne de hamburguesa y aderezada con guasacaca cebollas y papitas fritas
6345760 because of the concerns of parents we have modified the policy
6345761 it makes me like kind of scared anything can happen in two miles i can be hurt no one will know
6345762 if you dont believe children are still safe well transport them as we did last year
6345763 if they implement this again it shows they really care for our childrens safety
6345764 success is in the eye of the beholder some would say that sixth avenue is quite successful others see it as a total failure it depends on your perspective
6345765 now its a victim of its own success theres no parking
6345766 the structures there are in appropriate scope and scale with the nearby single family residential neighborhoods we dont have skyscrapers next to family homes
6345767 if the building is designated as historic then it has the protections if the building is just old and has not been designated then its subject to demolition
6345768 but we have put some incentives in the code to discourage that
6345769 youre telling tcc that all future buildings on a 155 acre campus should be on the edges
6345770 in practice it would force tcc to submit variance requests for virtually all buildings
6345771 i think you will hear that tcc has been a very good neighbor
6345772 our neighborhood has changed dramatically since you changed the zoning
6345773 in all the years that ive been there i have not felt unsafe until now
6345774 my concern is you want to increase the population density and the infrastructure has to support that density
6345775 jadi untuk perawatan atau peremajaan kulit tidak bisa hanya menggunakan krim saja karena krim hanya salah satu faktor percuma kita kasih krim sebagus dan semahal apa pun kalau perawatan hariannya dan pola hidup tidak disesuaikan
6345776 a lot of people have talked about this in theory for some time but it was fascinating to actually identify the chemicals
6345777 our hope is that by changing the sequence we can get sensors that respond differently to chemicals they are exposed to
6345778 out of dozens and dozens of other signals that are floating around
6345779 doesnt know in advance what it is going to encounter
6345780 when we organize ourselves as a region and we promote ourselves as a region were much more powerful
6345781 previous mayors have paid lip service to the notion of regionalism but its just never happened
6345782 the fact that mayor nutter made this an early priority and physically came out to the suburbs really spoke volumes
6345783 there are a lot of structural reasons for that animosity
6345784 the city and suburbs have competed for jobs residents for attention which often results in tensions
6345785 it was done in a way that tore at the fabric of regional cooperation
6345786 the county got bigfooted frankly by the arts world in the city and by the political leadership there in a way thats not particularly helpful
6345787 the fact that so many different organizations have to approve everything we work on that can be difficult because it can take a long time
6345788 what this usually requires is a central city mayor like richard daley in chicago to share the credit and work collaborative allow sometimes the suburban counterparts to take the lead on an initiative so that they have the buy in thats needed
6345789 when mayor daley goes to the caucus he goes in like any other mayor he sits in the back of the room and when he has a question he raises his hand i would expect to do the same thing
6345790 i just want to play an appropriate role in getting it started
6345791 but with all the americans coming the party on the fourth outgrew the embassy
6345792 the last three of four years its been held at this large resort hotel on the edge of the city
6345793 the longer tenured americans have assimilated to a degree meaning they speak chinese fluently have actual chinese friends as opposed to language partners and can generally move comfortably in chinese society
6345794 but the majority are here just to make money or enjoy the ease of expat life they speak just enough chinese to get by binge on black market dvds when theyre not in the bars and seem generally content to bounce around in their various bubbles
6345795 theyre the kind of communities that could be set down anywhere
6345796 there are pizza huts and ben amp jerrys out there for them the people that live there are commuters who might not even know theyre in china
6345797 its true there are a lot of americans in sanlitun
6345798 but whats really american about it are all the bars ten to 12 years ago the only american style bars you could find were in the hotels now theyre all over the place
6345799 despite a lot of the anti authoritarian swagger amongst americans here
6345800 many still spend quite a few of their nights in the sanlitun drinking district which the government set up in the early days of the reform period to keep foreigners ghettoized and hence easy to monitor
6345801 ive been here over six years and it used to be the one thing that most americans missed was cheese
6345802 but now there are shops where you can get almost any kind of cheese you can imagine
6345803 how a city with several passable to good french and fusion restaurants fails to produce a single edible enchilada is mystifying
6345804 that said whenever im back in the u s i long just as much for uighur food from northwestern china i hear rumors theres a few uighur restaurants in queens now but ive never been able to find them
6345805 ive been considering a job in north jersey so if prices continue to drop then i will go
6345806 but that is changing i think people are really aware now that when we put the pedal to metal that is costing them money
6345807 demand for gas is driven largely by increased demand in india and china
6345808 some people have found they get a certain amount of pride and satisfaction

6345810 we have high regard of lim and we respect him we welcome him if he intends to join the party

6345815 it could have gone either way if threave had won i could have had no complaints we looked a lot better in the second half and i felt we had the better of it
6345816 we dominated the first half and while they came back into it in the second half i still felt we should have won the game we were playing well and i was expecting us to kick on in the second half
6345817 i felt we should have won the game we just cant seem to beat crichton
6345818 the boys are starting to click into gear now they played good football were trying to drum into them to play the short ten yard pass and move and theyve cottoned on now
6345819 when they do that they make teams look very ordinary
6345820 we played a lot better than on saturday especially in the first half we had six boys missing again which makes it even better
6345821 some of the boys that came in did really well and we can take a wee bit of heart from it
6345822 the first half was probably the worst saints performance for years the crowd deserved to string me and the players up for it
6345823 we looked like total strangers and we were short of commitment and quality we came back better in the second half
6345824 credit to creetown they came and played to their strengths and performed quite well but it was way below our standards
6345825 we should have taken something out the game we had them on the rack for ages we were really unlucky my boys gave it everyone weve got
6345826 our 16 year old goalkeeper mark miller was absolutely superb he had a really steady game and made a big difference to the team

6345831 i can not imagine my life back in budapest in that dirty city stucked in traffic jam breathing exhaust gas instead of being here in this heaven
6345832 when trails are built in greenways and adjacent to existing development or future development
6345833 oh come on i know ive only known you for a week but weve been together every second here in school and its something thats hard to miss
6345834 well for me that is since i think ive gotten to know you pretty well
6345835 no no but like ive told you its only because weve been together all this time
6345836 but he only sees me as the kid next door
6345837 believe me its true hes been in my room countless times seen me in various modes of undress but trust me hes not affected
6345838 which means i cant drive you home today but dont worry i already called our driver and hes waiting for you outside
6345839 i didnt even know you knew how to take a cab
6345840 jason how old do you think i am of course i know how to take a cab
6345841 really youre acting crazy i take a cab when i have to thats all
6345842 was he jealous was he acting like that because he was thinking you were taking a cab to meet up with a secret boyfriend or something
6345843 and it most probably has to do with how he still sees me as a kid
6345844 better you clean up first take a shower in jasons room then use one of his shirts for the meantime while we have yours washed and dried by one of the maids im sure he wont mind
6345845 b but youre not supposed to be back till i dont know youre just not supposed to be here right now
6345846 ahh not quite i ahh need could you lend me a shirt
6345847 ill just have to finish changing first but you go ahead and use the bathroom okay

6345849 this is a significant step forward in the long term management of low back pain
6345850 the results of this study revealed that the alexander technique can help back pain it probably does this by limiting muscle spasm strengthening postural muscles improving co ordination and flexibility and decompressing the spine
6345851 this means that patients can have fewer activities or functions limited by back pain

6345875 bgh urteil zur benennung von nachunternehmern bringt gro e vorteile f r auftraggeber und auftragnehmer

6345877 der bieter muss nachunternehmer nicht binden und kann im zuge weiterer verhandlungen seine wirtschaftliche position verbessern auch das nachtragsrisiko l sst sich reduzieren da die nachunternehmer erst zu einem zeitpunkt gebunden werden m ssen zu dem einerseits der leistungsumfang klarer ist andererseits die ausf hrungstermine bekannt sind aber auch nachunternehmer profitieren weil sie sich nachtr glich an den siegreichen bieter wenden k nnen da er nicht an den vorherigen bieter gebunden ist

6345888 its most exciting today to see this idea taking off
6345889 inspiration came from a similar business model that was developed five years ago in vienna austria developed by former formula one driver niki lauda they now have a fleet of over 600 cars
6345890 we took this basic advertising model and based it around a rental model like the car sharing companies in north america
6345891 we gave yahoo maximum flexibility for their design i find it very eye catching they look very sexy
6345892 youd be able to choose a location on a map and have 24 7 access to pick up your car
6345893 weve already had 300 people sign up since last thursday when we kicked off our radio campaign
6345894 the list is growing every 10 minutes someone else signs up we want to give as many people the opportunity to drive one of our cars so customers will be limited to a two day rental in september come october they will be able to rent our cars for a week at a time
6345895 i think that theres been this dirty little secret among hardware manufacturers which is that the perception of free content even if youre supposed to pay for it on pcs is some sort hidden benefit that you get when you buy a pc like a right to download music for free or a right to download pirated movies and games
6345896 i think that if you went in and could see whats going on in their minds though they may never say that stuff and im not saying theres some conspiracy or something like that but i think the thing is they realise that trading content copyrighted or not is an expected benefit of owning a computer
6345897 i think that just based on their actions what they say is one thing but what they do is another
6345898 when it comes into debates about whether peer to peer file sharing networks that by and large have the vast majority im talking 99 per cent of the content is elicitly trading copyrighted property theyll come out on the side of the 1 per cent of the user doing it for legitimate benefit
6345899 you can make philosophical arguments that are difficult to debate but at the same time youre just sort of ignoring the enormity of the problem
6345900 you open the door to one of those studios and all you see is the big empty space whats the big deal
6345901 for me it gets the creative juices going the mega stage is my notre dame my cathedral i plan to worship there regularly
6345902 we know were going to go through a tough time for a while
6345903 even when times are tough the film industry does tend to get through hard times were very confident well get our share
6345904 five years ago where we stand today was essentially a wasteland
6345905 five years from today filmport will be the epicentre of the creative economy of toronto and will have put us very clearly in our rightful place on the world stage
6345906 recalling how washington saw the post cold war world and america s place in or atop it helps us understand why policymakers failed to anticipate deter or deflect the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001
6345907 there can be no business as usual with russia under present circumstances and the future of our relations will depend on the concrete actions russia will take to honor the words of president medvedev to abide by the six point peace plan which is not happening at the moment which is not happening as we speak he signed together with the president of georgia and which was brokered by the european union presidency france
6345908 it seems like nato is trying to make a victim of an aggressor and whitewash a criminal regime it is trying to save a collapsing regime and is taking a path to the rearmament of the current leaders in georgia
6345909 this is a system that is defensive and is not aimed at anyone it is nonetheless a system that establishes firmly again and reaffirms the strategic cooperation relationship and friendship between poland and the united states
6345910 for all of his talk about following osama bin laden to the gates of hell senator mccain refused to join my call to take out bin laden across the afghan border instead he spent years backing a dictator in pakistan who failed to serve the interests of his own people

6345915 now about 20 to 25 women remain tethered to the bracelets black electronic monitoring devices that dig into the skin of their right ankles leaving dark bruises and painful cuts some women try without success to protect their flesh with makeshift bandages fashioned from bandanas and shorn socks
6345916 and the women who happily embraced hard work are forced to subsist on donations from st bridgets and the local food pantry while they await court dates
6345917 last week the iowa labor commissioners office said an investigation had uncovered 57 cases of child labor law violations at the facility at agriprocessors which has also been cited for numerous safety and health violations the claims have prompted debates among rabbis about kosher laws protections for food workers and how orthodox oversight officials should involve themselves
6345918 we are going to parliament to defend our mandate our problem is with the convening of parliament not the swearing in of members

6345924 until recently we couldnt have done this people in government have been afraid of funding churches but now its politically ok
6345925 it doesnt on its face violate the separation of church and state
6345926 to the extent its used to violate the first amendment to proselytize or coerce disaster victims into joining christian groups that could be a problem
6345927 our work is the message and everyone has to be ok with that
6345928 some religious groups simply cannot avoid mixing pretty heavy duty evangelization with their relief efforts and thats not always what people in need are looking for
6345929 significant disasters every year in missouri that do not warrant a declaration but have considerable impact on residences and communities
6345930 in 2007 we assisted a lot of missourians who experienced loss without any assistance from fema or any other federal agency
6345931 beyond any assistance from homeowners insurance all other assistance came from not for profits such as the red cross and faith based organizations with a few donations from missouri businesses
6345932 i might hold a couple classes maybe for the united methodists women group then the mens group to try to get them thinking about how we should all be prepared for a disaster

6345942 those who do not stand are not criminals thinking differently is not a crime
6345943 they dont accept the company claim that this is nothing to do with union busting
6345944 the union members understand they must protect their leader to protect themselves
6345945 i have received a lot of comments on the matter and im disappointed and dismayed to see such an important public safety issue turned into a local political battle
6345946 rise above that fodder and turn our collective attention to a meaningful debate that might get something done thats for the advancement of all citizens of the state
6345947 speaking for myself driving and talking on the phone is serious and unsafe
6345948 the matter needs attention it requires statewide regulation not half baked hip shooting at the municipal level
6345949 with a number of cell phone companies giving campaign contributions through straw parties and directly this isnt about to hit the missouri legislature anytime soon for a vote
6345950 also this is not a real big issue in rural areas of the state
6345951 many cities passed laws banning open containers of alcoholic beverages in motor vehicles before a state law was passed
6345952 this is the most important decision the board can make on behalf of the citizens of this city
6345953 there had been some damage done on the hill with the governors office
6345954 if hal dulle would have remained as executive director we would have gotten nothing in the next legislative session
6345955 it was suggested to me that i had said something favorable about our attorney general that tweaked somebody on the second floor
6345956 whats that got to do with the performance of my duties
6345957 the veterans commission is independent and the decisions they make regarding personnel or any matter are made independently
6345958 why now why make a change now if i was ineffective in working with the legislature when were going to shuffle the deck in a couple of months
6345959 were not just going to give up this is ridiculous were going to do whatever we can
6345960 we dont necessarily want to move but well pick up and move 15 miles away if thats what it takes
6345961 on a whim people purchase these animals and think theyre fun pets
6345962 here in st andrews im sitting among the peaceful ruins of one of the oldest christian sites in scotland with the historian alex woolf on the rocks below by the playful sea a heron stalks about its awful business one thousand two hundred years ago though would the predators on the sea have been men and we on land their prey
6345963 its highly unlikely that we would have ended up in the markets of damascus or baghdad if our stroll at st andrews landed us in the back of a longship
6345964 before i became an opera reviewer for this network and chaplain to the royal academy of music
6345965 i was a member of the eighties pop band the communards
6345966 we dont even know how we purchased this property to start with or what rights we have to sell it
6345967 we feel theres a need here to provide hotels to the homes and area businesses

6345978 it is simply not true that either the private or the third sector has a consistently better record than in house staff wherever jobcentre plus has been allowed the same flexibilities and funding it has been able to match if not surpass the performance of contractors

6345982 gun to my head i suppose id describe myself as well off
6345983 well im a mixture of sometimes being quite radical and wanting changes and on the other hand being cautious and thoughtful about how to bring it about
6345984 when the conflict broke out after midnight the explosions were deafening
6345985 my eldest son ran outside and when he returned he said that the first floor of the house was destroyed they want to kill us i remember thinking why arent the russians coming
6345986 during a quiet moment our neighbours came running and told us to join them in their basement
6345987 then the georgians entered tskhinvali some ossetian guys came by in a car we grabbed some documents ran outside and without any possessions we tried to leave the city
6345988 when we got back to tskhinvali from vladikavkaz i found my house partially ruined a house opposite mine burned down everyone is crying non stop there were many funerals a woman i know had to collect the bits of her sons body into a box he was hit by a shell she buried him in her garden
6345989 russia protected us from georgias aggression if they hadnt come we would not have survived such heavy shelling but i have many friends among the georgians i feel sorry for those who had been killed i worry a lot about them
6345990 the georgians shelled peaceful people who were asleep it was direct artillery fire from 80 100 and 200mm guns they entered tskhinvali in their tanks and killed women and children
6345991 i am in a jewish part of town at the moment everything is ruined and destroyed tears are coming to my eyes there is nothing left from the house where my friends used to live there are tea kettles scattered around and the metal beds are burned and twisted
6345992 i would like to ask saakashvili what he wanted from this small piece of land of ours why did you come here at high speed with your weapons almost everyone here is a russian citizen our state language is russian we have nothing to do with georgia
6345993 in russia people believe what the mass media says 100 per cent the television here talks about the conflict as a result of the united states anti russian policies
6345994 i found out that the russian army had bombed georgia from independent news sources they showed the decomposing corpses of georgian soldiers but i couldnt watch this stuff i changed channels
6345995 this is putins victory he wanted everyone to think you dont mess with russia this is exactly what we are thinking now
6345996 there are 900 000 more people living in severe poverty than there were in 1997 the gap in infant mortality between the poorest and richest households has actually grown educational inequalities are expanding and social mobility is declining
6345997 the pursuit of self interest without any constraints does not lead to the fair reward of effort
6345998 where markets work well they arent just constrained by formal rules
6345999 but by institutions social norms self regulation and the character and personal responsibility of those who act within them
6346000 some young people are focusing their efforts on fewer gcses

6346013 a geographers assessment of all landscapes as cultural no land is realistically natural without counting its human residents would find no argument almost any place else in the world outside the united states
6346014 we did not think of the great open plains the beautiful rolling hills and winding streams with tangled growth as wild only to the white man was nature a wilderness to us it was tame when the very animals of the forest began to flee his approach then it was for us that the wild west began

6346017 occasionally he would imagine himself as a professor in somewhere like freiburg in the late 1930s and peter as a jewish colleague how hard not to have denounced him or at least watched the poor man being taken away and not felt relish

6346023 perhaps theres a serial murderer loose in the village picking us all off one by one i read a book by agatha christie which deals with that

6346032 i had planned to end this monster essay with a burst of my trademark pyrotechnics
6346033 i no longer believe in the markets self healing power
6346034 i think the whole nation is totally delighted and really proud at everything thats been achieved
6346035 the trouble is that focus groups are often dominated by the person who shouts the loudest brown never looks like he means it when policy is made this way look at british jobs for british workers
6346036 look gordon people think you dont do empathy and you look uncomfortable abroad so lets keep it simple on the olympics and let miliband deal with that messy south ossetia business
6346037 if he gives me a ticking off and tells me to get stuck in with my constituents ill thump him
6346038 this is the fourth genocide against the ossetian people by the georgians how can we ever go back to living under them
6346039 and may heaven open up and god strike the head of condoleezza rice
6346040 i was lying there in the basement and i called my sister on my mobile
6346041 we are dealing with a psychotic dictator an inadequate person whose actions cannot be foreseen whatsoever
6346042 it will take as many troops as possible for as long as possible to protect the citizens of south ossetia
6346043 but now theyve decided they want our land what can we do about it were such a tiny country
6346044 party leaders had imagined with mr obama vulnerable on multiple fronts
6346045 well i think that whether you are looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity you know is above my pay grade but let me speak more generally about the issue
6346046 whosoever does not know astronomy or anatomy is deficient in the knowledge of god
6346047 travel throughout the earth and see how he brings life into being
6346048 in the creation of the heavens and the earth and the alternation of night and day there are indeed signs for men of understanding
6346049 the sun and the moon follow courses exactly computed and the stars and the trees both prostrate in adoration and the heavens he has raised high and he has set up the balance
6346050 almost everything from relativity quantum mechanics big bang theory black holes and pulsars genetics embryology modern geology thermodynamics even the laser and hydrogen fuel cells have been found in the quran
6346051 it is impossible not to admit the existence of scientific errors in the bible
6346052 the quran most definitely did not contain a single proposition at variance with the most firmly established modern knowledge
6346053 we have created man from the essence of clay then we placed him as a drop of fluid in a safe place then we made that drop into a clinging form and made the form into a lump of flesh and we made the lump into bones and we clothed these bones with flesh and we made him into other forms
6346054 so verily i swear by the stars that run and hide
6346055 i swear by the moon in her fullness that ye shall journey on from stage to stage
6346056 what is meant to be allegorical and poetic is transformed into products of science
6346057 in such a way as to leave no room for doubt or question marks
6346058 we have sent down iron in which there lies great force and which has many uses for mankind
6346059 modern astronomical findings have disclosed that iron found in our world has come from the giant stars in outer space
6346060 glory be to him who created all the pair of things that the earth produces
6346061 in my own university around 70 per cent of science professors subscribe to the view that the quran is full of scientific content facts as well as theories
6346062 once met a former chief scientist to a defence ministry who told me excitedly he was refining a research paper that would use mathematics to prove the existence of angels
6346063 while man has sprung from sentient creatures these have sprung from plants and these in turn from combined substances
6346064 the two groups genuinely believe that the destiny of islam and christianity is to work together to defeat evolution and that this alliance is the answer to the clash of civilisations
6346065 i came of age during the 1960s a time of unrest sit ins student strikes mass protests and urban rebellions
6346066 the music that was being composed at that time reflected what was happening across the nation
6346067 hip hop for me was a continuation of that tradition at the beginning it was a very important contributor to community debate regarding the conditions that existed and still persist in us cities
6346068 i believe there is solidarity from the cuban government with the struggles we are involved in so even though the us might consider us criminals it depends who you are talking to or where you are in the world are you a criminal or a freedom fighter mandela was considered a terrorist but in reality was and is still a hero
6346069 in the late nineties a delegation of young people from the hip hop generation new york based writers and
6346070 and some of the individuals were friends with people in the us who are members of the organisation i belong to black august some of these people in cuba asked me along to the festival and i was like im not going to any hip hop concert i was really disillusioned with hip hop at that time
6346071 part of it was the kindness of young people inviting an old lady like me
6346072 it was the last night of the festival and i am sitting there and there was this song performed by primera base about malcolm x and i was like whoah it kind of overwhelmed me and all of us in that stadium the chorus was not to my liking
6346073 as a person who has struggled for the dignity of african people i found the usage of the word offensive
6346074 the cuban hip hop community had earned my respect to put on the festival like that they had worked miracles with the very few material resources available so i said i would make a commitment to the young people that it would be nice if those of us in touch with hip hop communities in the us would give material support to the cuban rappers young people from the havana hip hop community started coming to me and asking about malcolm x and various issues regarding progressive struggles in the us and other parts of the world so we just talk all the time it is very rewarding to me
6346075 it manifests itself as the retaining of certain ideas and language within people of a certain generation
6346076 in cuban hip hop most of the lyrics speak to what the artist feels she or he is confronted with daily
6346077 i of course cannot speak for them but i can safely say that they have been responsible for bringing to the stage topics that in the past were discussed or debated only in small intellectual circles and not made available to the public at large
6346078 i really hope that the democratic presidential hopeful barack obama wins
6346079 im not sure what i feel about this because if its generally known that people like me support him it will be used against him one day i hope i will go home one never loses faith he could bring that about if he was president he would have the power to do that though i doubt that he would
6346080 using the service delivery platform clients will be able to take advantage of cloud computing capabilities by storing their business data in ibms data protection vaults once the information is protected customers will be able to immediately recover that information by restoring and retrieving it from a centre directly to the clients business or to an alternative worksite recovery area in the event of a disaster
6346081 this is routine maintenance not a system upgrade this is normal for websites
6346082 admittedly they normally only do this at weekends but weve stressed how difficult this could be
6346083 we dont like school in a week go once dont like police cos they kick and they punch
6346084 you can be who you be but youre not who you are
6346085 struggle is the rule of the world and war is the father of all and the king of all
6346086 i think he should show more respect for his competitors and shake hands give a tap on the shoulder to the other ones immediately after the finish and not make gestures like the one he made in the 100 meters
6346087 he might have interpreted that in another way but the way it was perceived was catch me if you can you dont do that but hell learn hes still a young man
6346088 i would love him to show more respect for his competitors thats not the way we perceive being a champion but he will learn in time he should shake hands with his competitors and not ignore them hell learn that sooner or later but hes a great athlete of course
6346089 ryan itu pembohong besar tidak benar jika anak saya jadi korban ryan saya tahu mayat itu anak saya
6346090 saya yakin itu asrori karena dia anak saya di kakinya ada bekas luka kena knalpot dan dari giginya saya juga bisa mengenal dia
6346091 saya yakin anak saya tak kenal orang seperti ryan dia ryan itu pembohong tak benar pengakuan ryan itu
6346092 i think michael jordan is the best athlete in the world not only for how he played the game but for all he did to grow the sport of basketball
6346093 what he achieved no other human has or in my opinion will its hard enough surviving cancer but winning seven tour de france titles after that is amazing
6346094 has the ability to drown out all distraction and focus in on the moment i feel like i am in a similar situation in swimming since swimming is an individual sport how you perform can impact only you
6346095 jackie joyner kersee is the perfect athlete because she dedicates every day of her life to perfecting herself
6346096 its not so she can be the greatest athlete for her own selfish reasons but so she can deliver hope to a younger generation
6346097 they know what it takes theyve been there and they understand what we have to do
6346098 those are two of the leaders in here and your leaders have to step up and thats what theyre doing
6346099 weve been around for a lot of things good times bad times
6346100 we understand theres a sense of urgency but i think everyone understands that
6346101 its our job to go out and try to prove people wrong
6346102 when people think youre out you almost want to prove them wrong more
6346103 when we need him to come up clutch he always does it
6346104 hes a great leader on this team and he leads by example
6346105 i was hitting my spots and where sometimes im missing three or four inches inside i was able to get that ball in there for strikes tonight and get some outs
6346106 he used all of his pitches his curveball and changeup were great tonight he had great location with his fastball and he kept them off balance he got a lot of ground balls and gave us what we needed
6346107 he had some trouble with his control and with a team like the yankees you cant do that
6346108 some days you can be real good some days you can be ok some days you can be terrible and yesterday i was terrible
6346109 after giving up a four spot with peavy on the mound you look down and start seeing what bullpen guys can get you through the game
6346110 i knew he didnt want to load the bases and i kinda guessed right
6346111 you dont really expect to score a lot of runs against one of the games best pitchers
6346112 i obviously didnt have good stuff today but i battled and tried to give the guys a chance to come back
6346113 giving up four in the first to him peavy obviously i didnt like my chances
6346114 hes usually in and around the plate especially when he has the lead that wasnt typical jake
6346115 i just didnt have it i couldnt throw the ball where i wanted to throw it i just didnt make pitches thats all there is to it
6346116 i told myself as i was walking to the plate that if its out over the plate im going to swing at it and thats what it was
6346117 sometimes i have to do that because ill get too picky up there and not swing and not be myself
6346118 thats not a routine play because he did a good job to get in front of it and knock it down that would have been a terrific play if he could have made it
6346119 hes got to dive and knock a ball down and get an out all at the same time
6346120 that was definitely a break to move that inning along
6346121 le gouvernement est profond ment attrist comme le sont tous les espagnols
6346122 im kind of hurt that you forgot i hate sushi
6346123 woohoo beer and titties huh i wonder if this girl likes me
6346124 i havent broken the world record because of the weather but it was better than a sunny and hot day

6346126 i started my olympic career with silver and im ending my olympic career with a silver
6346127 ive been working so hard for the olympic games and that was the best i could do but im a little disappointed

6346130 his toms behavior was entirely unacceptable to my wife paula and to the rest of the world

6346132 latest evidence on ptsd may bring changes in dsm v
6346133 recently we discovered that grapefruit and these other fruit juices substantially decrease the oral absorption of certain drugs undergoing intestinal uptake transport
6346134 i am satisfied that the state has failed to show a prima facie case against the accused and therefore i find the accused not guilty
6346135 he was quite interested in computers at home so we started taking him to special classes when he was six
6346136 because he was quite good they suggested he sit the gcse and it just went from there
6346137 i didnt realise i was good at ict until after id done the gcse exam
6346138 it was easier than i thought it was going to be and i feel proud now that ive done it

6346141 after the injections were given the patients started vomiting and the condition of few patients was so critical that they had to be given oxygen for breathing
6346142 i was admitted yesterday morning and my condition was stable but after the doctor gave me the injection my condition worsened my parents are planning to shift me to a private hospital
6346143 the injection in question is broadcef this is a new injection and i have already spoken to my seniors who will soon be investigating the matter
6346144 theres a big negative feedback loop and theres no way out of it
6346145 as the stock falls more and more its more likely the government steps in and more likely equity holders get wiped out

6346154 i pretty much knew a lot of it already so i didnt have to revise a lot
6346155 i found it quite easy because ive been reading science books for a long time before i did the course
6346156 i was a little bit nervous and i was quite excited especially to get my results
6346157 id like to find a source of renewable energy that gives more energy than solar power but still doesnt give off any co2 or other gases
6346158 i had to explain to her a bit about limestone but she did pretty well otherwise
6346159 im very proud of him i think its absolutely fantastic
6346160 he found it quite easy to be honest i had to do a lot of studying for it to make sure that i got a result that i wanted but he just did a bit of reading every now and then
6346161 you could see quite a few people looking thinking thats a bit peculiar a little one coming in
6346162 theres no f in way im wearing that in public
6346163 i think if you look in aggregate at what weve put in place as a state and in the measures that we are proposing here we are still very much at the forefront in terms of efforts to stop smoking
6346164 the effects of passive smoking are harmful especially to children and that harm increases when the child is in a confined space such as a car
6346165 one thing is certain and that is there will be point of sale changes theres going to be reform in terms of 11 or so thousand retail outlets it will not be business as usual for them and thats very very important
6346166 victoria is in catch up mode and the premier if he is really serious about fighting cancer should have brought in some of these measures over the past 12 months

6346177 nobody talks to me directly about it but they do it in passing anybody who approaches me in person will need thorough sensitisation in fact i am ready for any challenge especially from ratsie setlhakos great grand children because they have to do something to inherit and benefit from their grand fathers hard work they really have to do something about it
6346178 let us respect those composers and producers so that they also feel accepted and the contribution recognised
6346179 it is high time the national radio stations started to play locally produced music only and leave international music to commercial radio stations local musicians must also be treated equally because the current trend has demoralised many of them
6346180 i did this because i realised that segaba players are not well recognised in the country
6346181 on the one hand the crude inventory buildup was quite strong but the gasoline draw was also very prominent
6346182 before that meeting were going to get quite a few statements from opec officials expressing opinions in the end i dont expect a production cut but they may push for greater adherence to output quotas
6346183 when i read that my wife was dead i thought thats funny she looked fine when she went out of the door this morning anyway dont you usually get a policeman coming to your door instead of a letter about your council tax
6346184 i was absolutely gobsmacked i just couldnt believe what i was reading i thought is someone playing a prank on me or something its a very strange experience to be told youre dead
6346185 she said that she would pass it on to a colleague because she was going on holiday
6346186 i thought is that it is that all theyre going to say i want a proper apology for this its just not on
6346187 its beyond a joke the fact that this happened in the first place is bad enough but you would at least expect someone to say sorry
6346188 i dont want anything from the council i just want them to accept that theyve made a really stupid mistake
6346189 the rapid rise in fuel costs since december last year is unprecedented and the impact has been felt across the aviation industry and the world economy
6346190 when you have to pack up its a sad day
6346191 its just you there nobody with you and youve got to pack up and go home thats a lonely feeling
6346192 i always tried to see it as a blessing in disguise
6346193 sometimes maybe the situation just doesnt suit you and maybe somebody on another team will see you
6346194 then i got released and i wondered how in the world do you go from being a starter to getting released
6346195 i dont have an extravagant lifestyle so it was easy to maintain
6346196 so instead of working 9 to 5 every day i used that time to keep training
6346197 i had a pretty good game and obviously somebody was watching
6346198 my job is to anchor down and create havoc in the middle
6346199 i dont mind doing the dirty work it frees up the linebackers and other defensive linemen were the unsung heroes up there most people dont want to do it but if they want me to clog it up plug it up thats fine ill be happy to do it
6346200 we tried to negotiate with the organisers for a better price but we could not reach any agreement for this reason we came to the conclusion that we should not take part as our participation will not be cost effective
6346201 this is one event where our soldiers interact freely with the people and explain our various roles and responsibilities
6346202 there are also other organisations that are taking part in this fair and we hope they will play the same role that bdf has played for years

6346204 i do not know why they want to behave like we did not explain all these things to them
6346205 as far as we know they are supposed to either destroy the structures or move them
6346206 people should know that the consumer fair is different from bitf in the current scenario we incur a lot of expenses in preparing for the event and our charges should be relative to the expenses
6346207 he hosted a dinner and promoted me he told me he has been inundated with calls from batswana requesting that i should be rewarded for my talent
6346208 we just improvise we sit down with the pr unit and look at the prevailing crime situation in the country and the tactics the criminals apply then we act the scenes out
6346209 i am a member of the police band i play the guitar and sing i am very talented i come a long way with music i used to have a band way back and we used to play at a defunct nightclub at broadhurst but later i decided to give my time to the police band which is a unit of the special support group the band plays in state functions
6346210 just recently one of my band members decided to stay away after i confronted him about his drinking problem especially before and during performances he is normally a well behaved person but when he is drunk everything changes he would start complaining about fellow band members not respecting him and even threaten to stop playing in the middle of a show now he was angry and has since left how is he going to cope without a job and just because he needs all the time to drink
6346211 have you seen how many people attend gospel music festivals the last time oleseng was there it was fully packed more people than those who normally come to our shows where beer flows freely there are a lot more music lovers who never miss a show even if there is alcohol at times some who are normally drunk would just come even when they do not have money for alcohol
6346212 i had high hopes for those young boys and they could have gone far because it was during those years when there were not so many kwaito groups around they had the potential and used to drive people crazy at our shows but then they the drunks messed it all up for me and themselves

6346234 they are craving for someone to help them learn and show them what a winning program is
6346235 they know how to lose they just dont know how to win yet
6346236 yelm for many years hasnt had a winning program but yet its 100 times better than what i took over at hoquiam im really excited to get this second chance

6346242 d sormais plus personne ne peut dicter la pologne ce quelle doit faire ces temps sont r volus nous ne permettrons plus quiconque de nous intimider
6346243 les derniers sondages d montrent quaux yeux de 63 de polonais leur gouvernement a eu raison de se joindre au programme am ricain de bouclier antimissile par ailleurs pour 65 dentre eux la russie constitue une menace pour leur pays
6346244 voil qui est tr s surprenant dans la mesure o au d but de mois de juillet les opposants au bouclier taient encore majoritaires
6346245 ce sont sans doute les v nements en g orgie qui ont provoqu ce revirement de lopinion publique polonaise
6346246 nous avons appris aimer le bouclier par peur de la russie
6346247 il est clair que les propos mena ants des g n raux et des politiciens russes prof r s contre la pologne ont bien t entendus

6346256 theyre very different supercr3w is phenomenal at tricks people respect who they are as artists soreal cru are real cool i like their style
6346257 i definitely give them inspiration i speak from the heart so it might come out with passion but you have to tell them what you didnt like about the performance and why or how else can they improve
6346258 i was so excited that missy was there for that challenge
6346259 it was an incredible show and the crews all gave phenomenal performances
6346260 be taking a bit more time between seasons which will give people ample time to get their crews together practice and prepare
6346261 i believe that the first group of dancers that came in said to themselves wow i want to be a part of this show and i want to be the best crew they really had that passion
6346262 this seasons group was more about being on television i dont think they really had the same drive

6346264 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
6346265 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
6346266 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
6346267 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors

6346271 that has been a trend that has been happening since 2003
6346272 the gcse results are most significant for the pupils themselves
6346273 i think if you look in aggregate at what weve put in place as a state and in the measures that we are proposing here we are still very much at the forefront in terms of efforts to stop smoking
6346274 the effects of passive smoking are harmful especially to children and that harm increases when the child is in a confined space such as a car
6346275 one thing is certain and that is there will be point of sale changes theres going to be reform in terms of 11 or so thousand retail outlets it will not be business as usual for them and thats very very important

6346292 encuentro por la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural traw n itrofillke che ka zugu g tramgealu
6346293 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
6346294 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
6346295 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
6346296 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
6346297 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos
6346298 aspectos jur dico pol ticos de la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural
6346299 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
6346300 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
6346301 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
6346302 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre
6346303 los pueblos originarios son los primeros que sufrimos la extranjerizacion
6346304 asumir la interculturalidad como hecho de todos no solo los indigenas qus somo interculturales a la fuerza
6346305 en san martin de los andes la confederacion con el pueblo mapuche puso un lote a disposicion del barrio entero
6346306 el art culo 53 es una herramienta de lucha para el pueblo mapuche
6346307 referente a los derechos humanos suiza es la capitalde la cruz roja suiza nunca tuvo colonias a nivel estatal
6346308 nuestra vinculacion con la pelicula est en que el empresario domenico panciotto viene de suiza y la realizadora fausta quattrini es suiza
6346309 los pueblos indigenas me han cambiado la forma de ver e l derecho
6346310 los funcionarios del estado aparecen en el documental ridiculos y sin comprender ciertas cosas
6346311 el secretario de derechos humanos de neuqun ve a la pelicula como muy pol tica y la criticaba por eso
6346312 el inciso 17 se introdujo por cansancio el convenio 169 se ratifico sin leerlo porque si lo leian bien no lo hacian
6346313 roca hizo una ciudadan a de escritorio nos homogeneiz es importante que los pueblos originarios llamen a revertir eso
6346314 los pueblos originarios nos son negocio pol tico porque est n aislados por eso se los invisibiliza hay que salir de la invisibilidad reconociendo la realidad y fortaleciendo su lucha
6346315 un consejo a los abogados no se disfracen de originarios son abogados de la v citma no la v ctima asi se cumple mejor la funci n
6346316 ser a bueno por ejemplo que el colegio de abogados organice una comiison de derecho indigena propuso zaffaroni ganandose el aplauso de la concurrencia tambien hacer un congreso de derecho indigena
6346317 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
6346318 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
6346319 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano
6346320 desmiento cualquier vinculaci n con patria roja no hemos recibido ninguna llamada del congresista isla no tenemos nada que ver con hugo ch vez no tenemos nada que ver con ning n partido pol tico porque stos lejos de solucionarnos los problemas nos traen m s
6346321 ellos paran la movilizaci n y nosotros reiniciamos el di logo
6346322 existe una soluci n en el fondo del problema que un ente arbitral como el tc puede resolver sobre la nulidad o no de estas normas lo que ah tenemos es una luz sin que esto impida que se extiendan con mayor profundidad los mecanismos de concertaci n y di logo
6346323 lo que parec a ser una gran noticia resulta en una garant a sin contenido una ges para unas pocas mujeres que por distintas circunstancias pueden hacer uso de este derecho
6346324 una rep blica que se apresta a celebrar 200 a os de existencia y una econom a que busca incansablemente su asociaci n con la elite mundial no parece condecirse con las pr cticas de represi n y hostigamiento a las movilizaciones sociales y la brutalidad policial como las que se registran en este informe
6346325 la preocupante situaci n de las corporaciones de asistencia judicial las que constituyen el principal soporte del sistema de asistencia jur dica gratuita del pa s toda vez que cuentan con un presupuesto insuficiente y una estructura organizacional atomizada y asentada en la figura de los egresados de derecho que realizan su pr ctica profesional
6346326 que viera gallo tranquilice a la derecha asegur ndoles que de ning n modo lo ser
6346327 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo
6346328 i dont know who they are but i am glad theyre doing it

6346330 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
6346331 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6346332 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
6346333 ive watched sammy throughout the years tying him its ok i guess
6346334 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6346335 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6346336 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
6346337 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
6346338 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana
6346339 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso
6346340 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6346341 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6346342 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
6346343 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
6346344 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
6346345 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
6346346 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
6346347 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto

6346373 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
6346374 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
6346375 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6346376 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
6346377 were trying to target a flat line year on year outcome for our ict costs and possibly a little bit lower so certainly thats caught up in our overall cost improvement program
6346378 but you have to consider that we had some high one off costs its a reasonable it spend
6346379 we moved that out of it into our sales and distribution category because its more fairly represented a cost of distribution and sale than an it cost
6346380 hin is basically an import car show but it embodies the whole kind of youth culture
6346381 because last night i was reading that book you gave me at the same time that i was eating dinner
6346382 why is that unusual most of my books have food stains on them
6346383 well its just that i dont usually you know read so my parents think its weird that im not putting this book down like ever
6346384 influenciar a vontade do eleitor mediante subterf gios que violam a pr pria normalidade e equil brio do pleito eleitoral
6346385 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
6346386 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
6346387 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
6346388 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
6346389 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
6346390 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
6346391 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
6346392 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
6346393 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible

6346395 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
6346396 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
6346397 esperamos que las autoridades de gobierno se abstengan de seguir interviniendo a favor del citado proyecto para que pueda ser evaluado correctamente
6346398 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
6346399 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
6346400 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior

6346403 thuram mengoper bola kepada ribery dari lapangan tengah ribery menggiring bola dengan melewati satu pemain dua pemain dan tiga pemain sampai akhirnya ia oper kepada henry yang telah berdiri tepat digaris kotak penalty ia tidak langsung melesakkan bola ke gawang lawan mengingat di depannya masih ada satu pemain belakang lawan dengan satu dua gerakan dia mencoba mengecoh pemain itu sampai pada gerakan ke tiga dia terjatuh oh apa yang terjadi di sana prittttt wasit menunjuk titik putih tanda akan ada eksekusi penalty pemain perancis pun bersorak sorai mendapat hadiah penalty tapi kita lihat gerakan slow motion pada siaran ulang oh ternyata henry melakukan diffing tampak sekali kaki bek lawan sama sekali tidak menyentuh kaki henry tapi apa dikata wasit telah meniup peluit menunjuk titik putih ribery melakukan tugasnya sebagai eksekutor dan gooolll stadion bergermuruh oleh luapan kegembiraan suporter perancis
6346404 sangat cantik kita tidak melihat penaltinya kita melihat proses golnya yang begitu menawan luar biasa
6346405 saya pikir henry terlalu mempolitisir keadaan dia menggunakan segala macam cara untuk mencapai tujuannya tapi ya itulah politik sepak bola

6346408 woodlands and the open spaces within them have a vital contribution to make towards conserving scotlands threatened habitats and species
6346409 we are very fortunate in scotland to enjoy a wealth of biodiversity that is for the most part robust and healthy
6346410 however some elements are extremely fragile and making sure that they thrive will require some large scale thinking and landscape scale vision both of which are forestry sector strengths
6346411 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
6346412 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
6346413 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
6346414 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
6346415 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
6346416 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
6346417 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
6346418 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
6346419 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
6346420 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
6346421 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
6346422 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
6346423 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
6346424 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
6346425 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
6346426 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
6346427 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
6346428 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
6346429 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
6346430 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
6346431 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
6346432 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
6346433 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
6346434 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
6346435 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
6346436 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
6346437 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
6346438 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
6346439 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
6346440 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
6346441 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos
6346442 our tasking today was to come out and focus mainly on the air conditioning units here at the school friday august 01 2008
6346443 when was the last time you were in the end zone
6346444 the bad news was that he got hurt early last year but it worked in his favor a little bit
6346445 he was able to get those things taken care of and rehabbed
6346446 vs some other players who kind of played through the year with some nagging stuff and by the time they rehab it its kind of rolled into the season
6346447 the good news was that he really got off to a good start in 08 and thats carried over to the spring and training camp
6346448 i mean injuries are always frustrating but ive tried my best to get healthy and pay attention to everything thats going on
6346449 first time out after youve been out a while youre shaking off the rust
6346450 but football is football and its exciting to be out there and doing what you love doing
6346451 i think hes doing well i think hes working on the stuff he needs to be working on and he has a good attitude so i think that goes a long way
6346452 i just worry about whos here and what our job is and the next game and the next practice and whatevers next is whats most important right now i just want to make sure that we do a good job stringing plays together and stringing practices together
6346453 when you miss time youve always got things you can work on
6346454 as a tight end youve got to be able to block both in the run game and pass game run routes get open catch the ball and run with it so it was important coming off the injury just to be able to improve on all that and to get back into the swing of things
6346455 hes done a good job with that hes not a 280 pound road grating tight end and thats not his style but he can be an effective blocker and hes shown the ability to do that which is the same thing he did in college
6346456 game day is always game day and its fun and youre excited to be out there but its important to do your job
6346457 the things we do now are going to carry on from these preseason games into the regular season so its important to get a good foundation started right now
6346458 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
6346459 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
6346460 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
6346461 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
6346462 hes been through this before and i just wanted confirmation that im not the only dunce in here because this is a tough system to pick up
6346463 you play this long and feel like you should be able to come in and pick something up right away but there is a lot to this system
6346464 at times i feel like its coming slow but then i look at the calendar and realize ive only been here four days rodney has been good with that he went through it and hes helped me as have a lot of the guys
6346465 john is a guy that you look at yourself and gauge yourself against future hall of famer nine time pro bowler a guy who really plays the game the way it should be played
6346466 so im definitely going to welcome him with open arms i think hes one of the greatest safeties to ever play this game
6346467 hes one of the guys at the top of his craft in our profession specifically in what we do
6346468 hes a tremendous player and hes going to be a tremendous player no matter what uniform he puts on
6346469 its a story for the media to sit back and hate on him and wish that he does terrible because he didnt sign here all in all hes a friend of ours and we wish him the best
6346470 i was at home with my wife when i got the call about 7 or 8 oclock monday night
6346471 i got the call and i was flying out at 7 oclock the next morning from grand rapids mich i got here and they ran me through some conditioning tests and i was out there practicing tuesday all within 12 hours so im a little jet lagged
6346472 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6346473 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6346474 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6346475 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
6346476 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
6346477 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
6346478 we are proud to welcome julian artop in our company
6346479 his knowledge and experience within the internet sector speaks for itself and it is a great pleasure for us that he has chosen to join moneybookers
6346480 its a great new challenge to work for moneybookers one of the leaders in this space and one of the fastest growing companies in europe
6346481 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
6346482 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
6346483 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
6346484 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
6346485 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6346486 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6346487 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6346488 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6346489 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6346490 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6346491 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6346492 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6346493 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
6346494 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510

6346504 post traumatic stress disorder ptsd is an anxiety disorder that can develop after exposure to one or more terrifying events that threatened or caused grave physical harm 3 it is a severe and ongoing emotional reaction to an extreme psychological trauma 4 this stressor may involve someones actual death a threat to the patients or someone elses life serious physical injury or threat to physical and or psychological integrity overwhelming usual psychological defenses coping in some cases it can also be from profound psychological and emotional trauma apart from any actual physical harm often however the two are combined
6346505 the diagnostic criteria for ptsd per the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders iv text revision dsm iv tr may be summarized as
6346506 the person experienced witnessed or was confronted with an event or events that involved actual or threatened death or serious injury or a threat to the physical integrity of self or others
6346507 mir sind schon viele gesch ftsideen unterbreitet worden aber dessous sind eine leidenschaft von mir wie singen und schauspielerei
6346508 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
6346509 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6346510 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6346511 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6346512 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6346513 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

6346526 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6346527 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6346528 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
6346529 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6346530 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6346531 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
6346532 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
6346533 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
6346534 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6346535 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
6346536 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
6346537 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy

6346545 wir haben wirklich eine deutsche sportlerin bei den olympischen spielen die geht
6346546 wer gehen mal ausprobiert hat wei dass man die technik nicht auf anhieb beherrscht und dass es auch gar nicht so einfach oder komisch ist wie es vielleicht aussieht
6346547 ich habe mich so gefreut an dem tag gab es auch keine medaillen f r deutsche sportler das war mein gl ck und so durfte ich als f nfte sogar zu beckmanns olympia nacht die medien haben so positiv berichtet weil ich mich so gefreut habe eine almsick h tte man wegen eines f nften platzes verh hnt
6346548 wenn der sportler zeigt wie viel die eigene leistung wert ist wissen die medien das auch wertzusch tzen und wenn die dann mitspielen und dich pushen dann w rden die leute viel mehr ahnung haben und auch den sport fter gucken die medien haben es in der hand
6346549 genauso professionell wie ein fu baller tennisspieler oder 100 meter l ufer aber geher stehen nicht so im mittelpunkt

6346554 president robert mugabe would like to convey his heartfelt condolences on behalf of government and the people of zimbabwe
6346555 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6346556 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6346557 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6346558 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6346559 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6346560 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6346561 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6346562 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6346563 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6346564 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
6346565 on the brink of the precipice a human rights account of kenyas post 2007 election violence
6346566 the violence was largely instigated by politicians throughout the campaign period and during the violence itself via the use of incitement to hatred
6346567 it became increasingly predictable which church or church leader would support which political stand depending on which politician was advancing it and invariably the underlying reason was ethnic loyalty

6346580 were trying to target a flat line year on year outcome for our ict costs and possibly a little bit lower so certainly thats caught up in our overall cost improvement program
6346581 but you have to consider that we had some high one off costs its a reasonable it spend
6346582 we moved that out of it into our sales and distribution category because its more fairly represented a cost of distribution and sale than an it cost

6346631 one of the main attractions of a home based franchise opportunity such as music bugs is that mums really do have the flexibility to choose working hours that suit their own families individual needs
6346632 firms and businesses are simply not doing enough to provide working parents with the flexibility they need to balance work and family life and we are now seeing a growing trend of mums who have decided to take the matter into their own hands
6346633 more than 60 per cent of new businesses are now started from home thats 1 400 new businesses every week and mums are leading the way as they seek to readjust their work life balance

6346652 the changes had been on the cards for sometime now both the chief of naval staff adekeye and chief of defence staff azazi have overstayed their service years they ought to have retired last december but the president allowed them to stay on because he wanted to take his time to find their replacements
6346653 yusuf and azazi are sworn enemies they bicker all the time and this is known within the armed forces especially within the army they hardly agree on any issue so it was felt that if one should go the other should too
6346654 one was in charge of co ordination and the other was in charge of command and operations they held different views on some issues yes but their differences are exaggerated there was nothing special to it azazi had reached retirement milestone last december while yusuf was also due for retirement in any case
6346655 the best is dike in terms of intellect professionalism and integrity his records have always impressed the president so it was felt he should stay in meetings his contributions are usually the best even while he rarely spoke he has done so much in terms of training for the air force and usually returns unspent money sometimes in billions of naira every year
6346656 to appoint unto them that mourn in zion to give unto them beauty for ashes the oil of joy for mourning the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness that they might be called trees of righteousness the planting of the lord that he might be glorified

6346663 it was a very emotional journey over to the isle of man and it reflected exactly how we wanted to say goodbye to bobby
6346664 ironically as it was so foggy and the sky was like a white mist when we scattered his ashes the wind took it into the mist and it kind of danced around it looked quite beautiful
6346665 we watched as his ashes fell to the mountainside and we were all either crying or tearful
6346666 it was a sad moment my wife said some words about bobby to help us say goodbye
6346667 we will never get over losing bobby but scattering his ashes was something we wanted to do for him in somewhere special and now we can take that place and hold it in our hearts while we try to move on
6346668 nothing will bring bobby back christina went to sleep crying in my arms last night saying she wanted her baby back
6346669 we want him back but that is never going to happen so instead we have to do what is right by bobby and when justice is done we have done all we can
6346670 losing our son has been the hardest thing you could ever imagine but each day we pull through and we stick together and help each other
6346671 we got back from the isle of man on tuesday and on wednesday i sold my triumph daytona 600 2003 model as i have promised never to ride again
6346672 i am sure bobby will be looking down from heaven telling me not to sell it but riding without him would not be the same and i will not risk putting my family through further pain if i ever had an accident
6346673 they say your first serious accident on a motorbike is your last
6346674 we will give them a voucher that they can take out into the community
6346675 these 35 units will come online rapidly and 35 people who are now presently homeless in battle creek who have served their country their homelessness will come to an end

6346684 i like to invoke lots of pictures i like to rhyme its really hard for me not to rhyme i dont know why that is but rhythmically works and the way that you can fit words together in a stanza it appeals to me
6346685 i find that im most passionate about the people in my life
6346686 and when they do things to me or i do things for them or vice versa it kind of works its way into a song it helps me deal with my personal issues
6346687 ive listened to so many songs that have touched a string in my heart thats made me look at a situation im in in a totally different way songs have a way of touching the inner parts of our souls that we almost dont understand it

6346695 does not himself kill attempt to kill or intend that a killing take place or lethal force will be employed
6346696 thats why i think this issue may come back to the supreme court

6346702 early in the game they made a lot of tough shots
6346703 we were doing what we were supposed to be doing and they made tough shots but sooner or later well impose our will i dont know if you can keep up with us for 40 minutes
6346704 i think theyre going to be very very very tough to beat
6346705 theyve been the most difficult team for us to defend
6346706 theyre a force to be reckoned with they caused us a lot of problems
6346707 in the third quarter we said the first three or four minutes we need to pick it up a little bit defensively and make the extra pass offensively
6346708 brad has changed my sister a lot they have an extraordinary bond and ive never seen any sign of tension between them and if it keeps going the way its going theyll be together for life

6346710 the children delivered via gestational surrogacy are healthy and already under rickys full time care
6346711 ricky is elated to begin this new chapter in his life as a parent and will be spending the remainder of the year out of the public spotlight in order to spend time with his children
6346712 theres something for every woman and thats very important to us

6346716 we can never be surprised at what vile evil comes from the mouth of a confessed victim of child abuse at the hands of her own parents
6346717 roseannes parents responded to the accusation by going on air and slating she is a psychopathic liar and her sister agreed
6346718 that gave us an insight into who she is and what she is capable of saying and doing

6346723 theres only a handful of events of this caliber in the u s and the world
6346724 derzeit ist es sehr schwer einfluss auf werbung dachgestaltung oder farbigkeit eines geb udes zu nehmen
6346725 ein geb ude wie das des architekten david chipperfield f r den kunstsammler heiner bastian erf llt alle diese kriterien und ist unbestreitbar zeitgen ssisch
6346726 es gibt genug bereiche wo die moderne sich austoben kann
6346727 und das ist n tzlich selbst wenn in einem einzelfall davon abgewichen wird
6346728 der pariser platz s he heute nicht so aus wie er jetzt meist bewundert wird wenn es damals nicht gestaltungsregeln gegeben h tte
6346729 auffassung vertraten dass die gro en geister der akademie in ihren gestaltungsabsichten nicht von kleinlichen bauvorschriften beschr nkt werden d rfen
6346730 das beispiel des genehmigungsverfahrens f r den rosa betonbunker des kaufhauses alexa am alexanderplatz zeigt doch dass trotz massiver einflussnahme der landespolitik ja sogar trotz eines wettbewerbs und eines guten architekten am ende etwas entstehen kann was keinem gef llt
6346731 ich bedauere dass stagnation vor der dynamik das konservatorische vor dem innovativen auftrieb hat dies ist schlimm denn das innovative ist ein weicher standortfaktor der menschen die etwas schaffen k nnen anlockt mit entw rfen wie dem f r die satzung besch digen wir diesen standortfaktor eigentlich dachte ich so was w re mit der ra stimmann vorbei
6346732 the beijing games would be a factor in my decision but on the same level as salt lake city turin and athens
6346733 as far as i am concerned the games are going as i wished but the olympic family is not just me the athletes are happy the nocs are happy and so are the international federations if
6346734 i will announce my plans for the future after the games are over my decision will be sent to the ioc members and then i will inform the media
6346735 first though i am going to go back home and sort out my huge file of mail then take a few days of rest and come back here for the paralympics and in october i will return to lausanne where the ioc has its headquarters and go back to the routine day to day work
6346736 i have been dogged by questions over my future ever since i was elected i remember and this is not a joke that i was elected on july 16 2001 in moscow the same meeting where beijing also got chosen as hosts
6346737 on july 17 i was flying back to brussels and three or four belgian journalists approached me and asked me will you run in 2009
6346738 i knew what samaranch had to do in his role as president as i had been an ioc member since 1991
6346739 i had since that time been handed the responsibility of being in charge of the coordination commission for the 2000 games in sydney and then for athens though that was only 50 percent as having been elected president i handed over that responsibility to denis oswald
6346740 i have to do things that are not that pleasant during the games such as the protocols like raising funds
6346741 i didnt break the world record because of the weather
6346742 it was better than a sunny and hot day i didnt feel it was very slippery
6346743 i was in good condition i think my regular training is the most important factor contributing to my victory
6346744 i think the team just came together the first time we played them cuba kicked our butts but that didnt deter us
6346745 we always fight we came together as one unit when we first started playing we played individually it was ugly and we made a lot of errors
6346746 the us team played very well however we didnt especially on service and reception
6346747 there were two points that differed from the preliminary game where cuba did very well on serve and reception
6346748 the us did it very well and we didnt they were very well prepared and played to their potential
6346749 my teammates had enough confidence in me to set me the ball to win the match and i was just thinking is this me did i just do that
6346750 it may well be that we will have to act
6346751 the ioc said that whoever tests positive will not compete at the next olympics maybe we will do that for the next world championships
6346752 we need to say if you test positive you will not compete at the next world championships were looking into it with our legal department
6346753 we have every reason to be satisfied so far with the way the olympic games are going
6346754 the track is fast we had a fantastic 100 isinbayeva confirmed what we expected things have gone extrordinarily well
6346755 the crew member who gave the white star badge to roberta also gave her his lifejacket and put her in the lifeboat theres a direct link between robertas story and the film i think they used it as the inspiration for the film
6346756 how is it possible that officials didnt know there had been a technical mistake
6346757 the us have the right to protest but why when officials disqualified spearmon did they not notice churandys violation
6346758 i dont understand it if i stood on the line then why did the jury not disqualify me at the same time as spearmon it was at least 90 minutes before they told me i was disqualified
6346759 we recognise that the race footage indicates a technical mistake we will examine however whether the rules make it possible to disqualify an athlete in this way
6346760 its a pity for a big country like the united states to make such a small statement
6346761 the leukemia has taught me to think step by step
6346762 when you are in hospital and feeling so much pain and feeling so tired you dont want to want to think about the next day or week you just think about the next hour
6346763 it teaches you to be patient when you are lying in a hospital bed and that was almost the same strategy i chose here to wait for my chance in the pack
6346764 its going to take a while for it to sink in
6346765 i gave it everything and now i have something to show for it its a once in a lifetime experience
6346766 i was shattered at the finish i just wanted a lie down and have a sleep but before i knew it i was on a stretcher
6346767 i was adament this time last year i wasnt going to do it but i might have a rethink now and i have to work on my tactics a lot more
6346768 i knew maarten finished well so i was trying to stay with him
6346769 i had to battle with the group with 700 metres to go and i lost a lot of strength in the fight to stay in the race
6346770 that cost me silver but i am happy with bronze
6346771 its the first time that i have got two cards in my career
6346772 during the operation more than 30 militants were killed and a large cache of mortar rounds and ied improvised explosive device materials were destroyed by the commandos
6346773 the festival director and staff know we count on our family of volunteers to support the festival without everyone who chooses to contribute their time the festival wouldnt run nearly as smoothly
6346774 plus the people who have been involved with this festival in the past are some of the most fun loving and amazing people i have ever met
6346775 weve always had to work harder and thats what we do

6346780 these latest drill results are very exciting as they demonstrate the continuity of mineralisation and tenor of grade within the plutus prospect we have now completed drilling across the existing plutus resource area at a drill hole section spacing averaging 200m and are now well positioned to complete a new higher quality resource model with more closely spaced data covering a longer strike length than the previous 2007 resource model
6346781 plutus is a significant part of the total mineral resource at boseto and the recently completed pre feasibility study did not consider any of the 75 holes drilled at plutus since the last resource model was announced in december 2007

6346809 bloggers can bring a depth of reporting that some traditional media organizations arent able to achieve because of space and time limitations
6346810 the internet today is like the american west in the 1880s its wild its crazy and everybodys got a gun
6346811 si sab an que el avi n estaba roto por qu lo utilizan
6346812 i think we are all a little bit disappointed with how we played there were some pluses and some negatives to take away from the game but overall i think the feeling is disappointment
6346813 i think the fans will be disappointed with what they have seen i think there are three or four positives and maybe four or five negatives from the game
6346814 it is down to the manager now to sit down and address it with the players
6346815 on the next trip weve got 10 days away and if we can address it before those two games and thrash things out before the world cup campaign starts we will be okay
6346816 it is not just this game where there have been problems there have been other games and there will be problems in the future that will occur
6346817 we need to sit down and address it and address it very quickly otherwise it stays around the squad the manager will thrash things out and we will get things off our chest
6346818 that will be very private the manager makes the big decisions we can give our opinion but he is the one who makes those big final decisions
6346819 we are still encouraged by what we can do in zagreb against the czechs we wanted to do better than we did but at the same time there will be points to be played for with andorra and croatia
6346820 hopefully we can get off to a good start and win against andorra and take the confidence to croatia we have to go there and stand up and be counted for
6346821 we want to join the olympians and have great success it has made us very proud
6346822 it was disappointing we didnt play that well but we are not going to win any medals or qualify for world cups in a friendly
6346823 this training program was initiated because in terms of the tunes nowadays the liturgical hymns are out of control and they need to be controlled
6346824 but band songs destroy the beauty depth and spirituality of liturgy
6346825 need to control the use of musical instruments in the liturgical celebration
6346826 there will be no more loud tunes but union and harmony in tunes is a must to express the depth of spirituality
6346827 the liturgical hymns must express that the eucharist is the mystery and the center of our life
6346828 theyre pretty much the same as far as i can see
6346829 i threw away my vote on ron paul just on impulse knowing he couldnt win
6346830 but i think obama would have a lot of trouble with the politicians who have been around for a while
6346831 i woke up one morning and all of my stuff had been stolen and replaced by exact duplicates
6346832 i couldnt repair your brakes so i made your horn louder
6346833 it doesnt bother me whether im up alone or with james or anybody else i just want to be part of the team and playing
6346834 but i was up front with james and i felt we linked up well and both of us could have been on the scoresheet
6346835 if we get the nod in a couple of weeks hopefully it will get better
6346836 it was another game under the boss and another positive performance
6346837 yes the result was disappointing but we feel we should have won the game and barring a couple of really good saves from their keeper we would have won the game
6346838 but it was good preparation for the big one in the couple of weeks time
6346839 as always we defended well as a team but i thought the midfield were outstanding the movement passing and their energy was fantastic so we have to take positives
6346840 theres no doubt we can go away to macedonia and iceland and win both games and thats our aim
6346841 i am sick and tired of the president of the united states embarrassing me the world we live in is too complex to entrust it to someone else whose idea of intellectual curiosity and grasp of foreign policy issues is to tell us he can look into vladimir putins eyes and see into his soul
6346842 the advantage of the incomprehensible is that it never loses its freshness
6346843 for many years i was a self appointed inspector of snowstorms and rainstorms and did my duty faithfully though i never received payment for it
6346844 the bewilderments of the eyes are of two kinds and arise from two causes
6346845 either from coming out of the light or from going into the light which is true of the minds eye quite as much as of the bodily eye
6346846 im not sure how cohesive the industry has been in relation to politics
6346847 obviously theyre gonna put their money where they think it will have the most benefit
6346848 there is that wing of the republican party who are not friends of gaming
6346849 theres that idea of greasing the wheels of government and theyll figure that democrats will continue to control congress so lets make sure we get in on the ground floor
6346850 im not sure hes had that much influence outside of his own casinos
6346851 hes not always had a smooth relationship with other casino bosses theres bad blood between mr adelson and wynn resorts chairman and ceo steve wynn theyve have had a feud for a while now
6346852 the causes will have to be provided not only by the company but also by the black boxes which compile all the flight data
6346853 deeply saddened to learn of the dreadful loss of life
6346854 philip joins me in sending our warm and heartfelt sympathies to the families and friends of those who have died and our best wishes for a speedy recovery to those who have been injured
6346855 at this difficult time all those affected by this tragedy are in our thoughts and prayers
6346856 the prime minister was deeply sorry to hear about todays tragedy in spain
6346857 his thoughts are with the spanish people and all those affected by the tragedy
6346858 you know that you are on the front line in the fight against the
6346859 what you are doing is part of an incredibly important process of creating not only a terrorist free afghanistan but an afghanistan where there will be democracy and people will have a stake in the future for the long term
6346860 this week we are celebrating the olympics where we have had great success
6346861 but this week also i believe that our olympic athletes and everybody else in our country will remember that you have showed exactly the same courage professionalism and dedication
6346862 you make our country proud every day of the week and every week of the year you are truly the heroes of our country i wish to say how proud i am of you today

6346866 the thing about fibromyalgia is that when you see me i can look perfectly normal
6346867 family members look at you and think nothing is wrong with you
6346868 the doctors in the old days they just wanted to say you were a hypochondriac or crazy and wanted to medicate you with uppers or downers
6346869 fibromyalgia is a mechanical musculo skeletal disorder that manifests as all over body pain fatigue anxiety and depression
6346870 one of the things thats very important is that fibromyalgia is not inflammatory or autoimmune in nature which differentiates it from lupus rheumatoid arthritis and polymyalgia rheumatica
6346871 i ran into somebody the other day that said they didnt believe in it
6346872 its a complex disorder and understanding fibromyalgia is difficult what people dont believe in is the fact that there isnt an actual cause and effect phenomenon that were used to
6346873 there are substances that cause pain and they are elevated in the brain of fibromyalgia patients theres a substance called substance p and another one called glutamate
6346874 my own impression is that fibromyalgia patients have stress like everybody else but they never escape from the stress
6346875 if a doctor does a pressure point test and if they touch any one of them most of us will go sky high
6346876 if you take a group of young adults and deprive them of sleep especially the deepest stages of sleep they will have fibromyalgia symptoms after a couple of days
6346877 people get caught up in vicious cycles of body pain increased anxiety and depression the worse the anxiety and depression is the worse the sleep is it goes in both directions
6346878 these are symptoms that are hard to treat because they are not symptoms that damage tissues just symptoms that cause pain
6346879 the reason antidepressants work is not because of the antidepressant effect
6346880 the thing we are very concerned about is that its important for kids to understand and reflect their own culture

6346884 to hand over responsibility to iraq just as rapidly as conditions on the ground allow
6346885 would be wrong to set artificial timetables for the withdrawal of our troops
6346886 i am still waiting to hear from say sir menzies campbell or conservative arabists like oliver miles the honest statement that they would prefer to see saddam hussein still in charge of iraq killing torturing defying the un with the terrible cost of sanctions on his people and sponsoring and endorsing suicide bombing terrorism in the region
6346887 there was no pure platonic ideal of the perfect invasion to support no abstract idea we lent our names to there was only bush with his cluster bombs imf ed up economic model bogus rationale and unmistakable stench of petrol offering his war his way
6346888 is there such a thing as a conservative foreign policy
6346889 with 650 000 iraqis enjoying the company of their families rather than their ancestors
6346890 denis is withholding a lot of respect at the moment
6346891 an analysis of camerons article suggests that it might have been written in downing street

6346894 i am still waiting to hear from say sir menzies campbell or conservative arabists like oliver miles the honest statement that they would prefer to see saddam hussein still in charge of iraq killing torturing defying the un with the terrible cost of sanctions on his people and sponsoring and endorsing suicide bombing terrorism in the region
6346895 in britain dennis mcshane the foreign office minister responsible for latin america described chavez in the times of london on saturday as a
6346896 the alternative to toppling saddam would be to still have him there defying today the 25th un resolution and creating turbulence and instability in the region i will listen to all who say the current situation is worse than 2003 but i will only respect those who say they are prepared to live with saddam still in power anything else is hypocritical persiflage
6346897 do you want america to win in iraq or not it has become his new litmus test of american citizenship it is such a mind numbing dibate stopping innane questions that even americans are making fun of this new approach
6346898 he has been an mp for five years and a party leader for 12 months and only now has he found the time to visit the epicentre of britains 21st century foreign policy and military engagement
6346899 eight million iraqis defied terrorism to cast votes for their government a million iraqis have formed free trade unions for the first time in the nations history
6346900 have you heard that in america fox news host oreilly has developed a new mantra
6346901 do you want america to win in iraq or not it has become his new litmus test of american citizenship
6346902 the honest statement that they would prefer to see saddam hussein still in charge of iraq
6346903 lord salisbury a tory prime minister at the end of the 19th century once proclaimed that he would no more give democracy to the irish than he would
6346904 he is shown in profile with his hands in his pockets and his eyes cast downward as if in deep thought the pose subtly recalls the white house portrait of john f kennedy in which he stands with his arms folded and head lowered
6346905 first and last names inconveniently rhyme with iraq osama and whose middle name taken from his muslim grandfather is of all things hussein
6346906 when gov george w bush of texas first hit the presidential campaign trail in june he wore monogrammed cowboy boots the perfect accessory for his folksy affability and casual self assurance
6346907 when bush visited new hampshire early last week he was shod in a pair of conservative shiny black loafers that seemed to reflect more than the pants cuffs above them they suggested an impulse by mr bush to put at least a bit of a damper on his brash irreverence which has earned him affection but is a less certain invitation for respect

6346931 with the first link the chain is forged the first speech censored the first thought forbidden the first freedom denied chains us all irrevocably
6346932 but the limit of tolerance for these human foibles is obtained when the proponent of a questionable scientific doctrine endeavors to maintain it against all possible odds by misrepresentation misinformation and suppression of contradictory data and by insinuating unfairness in opponents of his views
6346933 man stands alone in the universe a unique product of a long unconcious impersonal material process with unique understanding and potentialities these he owes to no one but himself and it is to himself that he is responsible he is not the creature of uncontrollable and undeterminable forces but his own master he can and must decide and manage his own destiny

6346939 the slapdash release is being done by warner without any consultation to me whatsoever
6346940 it is in breach of their terms as laid out by them in an agreement made with my ex manager

6346942 i dont recall saying mr lennon i think that was something the press elaborated on that didnt happen he didnt turn i shot him in the back
6346943 i just saw his face and it seemed like it all came together the solution to my problem of being confused and feeling like a nobody and i said wouldnt it be something if i killed this individual i would become famous i would be something other than a nobody and that was my reasoning at the time i perceived him at the time and wrongly judged him to be a phony here he is at this ritzy building and he had been singing of love and other things at that time it angered me
6346944 i have great concerns about petitioners habitual consumption of prescription painkillers ambien sleeping pills and rum or vodka each night and during the day i have observed petitioner wake up on many mornings in a stupor from her nightly cocktail petitioner is in no condition to drive in the morning i have warned petitioner on numerous occasions to refrain from transporting our children in the car when she is in such a state
6346945 one of the weirdest conversations ive ever had was explaining im a celebrity to margaret thatcher i said you dont understand lady t your daughter is on this programme its on the third channel its on the third button at nine oclock set the video she got quite excited actually i think i was the first person to really explain to her what was going on
6346946 ive been very busy margaret what with christine being in
6346947 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
6346948 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
6346949 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
6346950 once word got out that our concept was franchising in the southeast the response from experienced restaurant operators and investors from all around the country was extremely positive now with our course mapped out for national expansion we are excited about the growth of this unique brand and look forward to an increased presence nationwide
6346951 einstein bros is a neighbourhood brand that has built a good name around the country with a strong presence of company owned restaurants along with licensed outlets primarily in campus locations we believe that our guests feel at home when they visit our restaurants we cannot wait to share that experience and great food with a greater number of guests around the country
6346952 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
6346953 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
6346954 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
6346955 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
6346956 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
6346957 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
6346958 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
6346959 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
6346960 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
6346961 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
6346962 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
6346963 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
6346964 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
6346965 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
6346966 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
6346967 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
6346968 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
6346969 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
6346970 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
6346971 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
6346972 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
6346973 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
6346974 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
6346975 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items

6346977 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
6346978 it was a fairly minor crime with a fairly major consequence
6346979 we are a compassionate company that believes in giving back to the community so a portion of all proceeds will be donated to children charities in the respective countries

6347219 peleado lo que no est escrito durante todo el campeonato
6347220 ahora mismo vamos a descansar vamos a asimilar lo que hemos hecho hoy y despu s empezar a trabajar duro para poder estar otra vez en lo m s alto
6347221 hemos estado liderando la clasificaci n durante toda la competici n desde el principio y eso a lo mejor te carga un poco m s de tensi n y m s que nada para celebrarlo con todo el mundo que nos ha seguido durante estos diez a os ahora vamos a disfrutar un poco de esta victoria
6347222 hemos hecho una pedazo de salida y en la segunda manga hemos tenido algunos problemas pues el australiano se ha acercado mucho y el argentino estaba justo detr s no s porqu raz n hemos dejado de correr al principio de la segunda ce ida no s si por un pl stico o algo pero de repente nos hemos visto muy lentos despu s hemos vuelto a alargar igual es que est bamos en un zona mala y luego la popa ha sido aguantar a veces tir bamos nosotros o que los australianos no quer an forzar pues ten an asegurada la plata y hemos estado ah tanteando unas veces a tope y otras veces relaj ndonos pero con presi n total hasta el ltimo segundo
6347223 no nos hemos enterado en la segunda ce ida los alemanes ya nos han dejado de preocupar pues los dos primeros estaban bien colocados y ellos si quer an estar en disposici n de hacer algo deb an estar en esos puestos nos hemos olvidado de ellos y nos hemos concentrado en el australiano y sabiendo que los argentinos estaban detr s

6347229 el dolor que se siente es muy dif cil de reducir pero lo que s es posible es no permitir que se aumente ese dolor con variables extra as como una comunicaci n de noticias de manera inadecuada o informaciones no contrastadas

6347234 he might have interpreted that in another way but the way it was perceived was catch me if you can you dont do that but hell learn hes still a young man
6347235 i would love him to show more respect for his competitors thats not the way we perceive being a champion but he will learn in time he should shake hands with his competitors and not ignore them hell learn that sooner or later but hes a great athlete of course
6347236 bolt must be considered now the same way like jesse owens should have been in the 1930s bolt has a bigger edge than owens on his rivals of course owens had the long jump too so you cant compare people if he maintains that in the future bolt will be someone that probably leaves a mark like jesse owens

6347256 herr joost ist auf unserem grundst ck unerw nscht er verunsichert investoren
6347257 das b rgervotum gegen die milliarden investition kann nicht einfach baurecht und st dtebauliche vertr ge aushebeln die stadt kann es sich nicht leisten investoren zu verschrecken
6347258 im rahmen der befragung haben uns viele partner darauf hingewiesen dass bei einem gro teil der kleineren abschl sse ein hoher aufwand betrieben werden muss der nicht mit dem erzielten ertrag bereinstimmt
6347259 obwohl wir prim r im industrieversicherungssektor t tig sind haben wir die anregungen der makler in bezug auf unsere personenversicherungen sehr ernst genommen herausgekommen ist nach einer mehrmonatigen entwicklungszeit nun ein konzept von dem wir absolut berzeugt sind und an das wir gro e erwartungen kn pfen wir rechnen damit dass wir noch in diesem jahr rund 1 000 neue partner f r ace mastercover gewinnen werden zumal unsere tarife eine echte kampfansage an den markt darstellen

6347267 retail sites no longer make customers choose between convenience and price
6347268 buy it now format as of sept 16 sellers will pay only 35 cents u s to list an item for 30 days a reduction of about 70 per cent in upfront fees
6347269 clearly theres a strong buyer preference for fixed price said lorrie norrington president of ebay marketplace
6347270 i think the auction was a novelty at the beginning but now people want what they want when they want it
6347271 this management is more willing to ride along with it
6347272 despite the strong headline number for retail sales if you look at it in real terms stripping out the price effects retail sales were actually down
6347273 is consistent with an economy thats just struggling to turn out growth of any variety
6347274 it now looks like gdp gross domestic product managed to eke out a tiny advance in the second quarter
6347275 the underlying story in this retail sales report is consistent with that
6347276 there is a little bit of slowing occurring in the canadian economy and that squares with what weve seen with a lot of the other economic data out recently
6347277 what we saw through the second quarter is that exports and manufacturing really pulled up the slack in the economy
6347278 the leading indicators for the second month in a row were flat
6347279 planning directed primarily at making investment recommendations is not financial planning
6347280 never before in the history of our energy industry have we taken the bold steps we are taking today
6347281 we the people of newfoundland and labrador are stepping forward and proudly taking our place as full partners and active participants in energy resource development
6347282 whether they paid too high a price to get into this project remains to be seen
6347283 the coffee is cold and the doughnuts are stale by the time information gets down to the end of the table
6347284 any time anybody operates such a service and they dont have to comply with all these regulatory burdens then its unfair competition in my clients view
6347285 they do erode substantially what really is a low margin business
6347286 were being innovative and thats what premier dalton mcguinty wanted
6347287 were looking for someone high enough up to step in here and say were going to review this because its just wrong what were saying is lets be reasonable here
6347288 do we just have to draw a big map around ontario and say sorry folks we cant help you that just doesnt make sense and thats why were going to challenge it
6347289 its not just the housing picture that one has to fathom but its also public policy what is the government going to do
6347290 we continue to be concerned about what dilution would be required to stabilize fannie and freddie and what that would leave over for existing shareholders
6347291 as you would expect we have been in communication with the companies for months to receive updates and weve been communicating with their regulator and the federal reserve
6347292 food prices tend to go up pretty quickly and they tend to stick on the way down
6347293 basically theres only a few cents worth of corn in a box of corn flakes so food prices are much slower to react to the downside than energy prices
6347294 as long as were in this world of expensive oil and commodities the prices that youre seeing now in the grocery shelves are not going away
6347295 thats going to have some serious consequence at the retail level
6347296 the only thing left is for prices to go up
6347297 our previous work produced important data but it involved short term acute interventions
6347298 this study will be the first long term investigation into whether nutritional supplements and aerobic exercise benefit normal but sedentary older people
6347299 obviously were keeping an open mind that it may or may not work we hope that it does work though because these would both be safe and widely applicable interventions that could help us in keeping older people healthy fit and independent

6347335 he was a brave soldier who made the greatest sacrifice anyone could make for everyone elses freedom
6347336 he realized that by being over there he was going to make a difference in the lives of those people
6347337 he always looked out for the other guy never thought of himself he volunteered to go to c co before our first deployment so that one of the guys from our platoon didnt have to deploy early and would have a chance to marry his fiance thats koch for you always looking out for his buddies
6347338 he had no problem he was dedicated to the fact that people over there needed help he was always concerned about other people he loved children he was a nice soft hearted kid

6347356 we want to play the defending champs its all about challenges argentina is the defending champs and you want to be able to play the guys that won it the last time
6347357 the point im making is when youre a champion one you want to have an opportunity to defend your championship and anybody who has aspirations to be a champion you understand that theres a sense of pride that comes with beating the champion
6347358 you try to play them one way and as soon as you think youve got stops and momentum they change the way of the game and all of a sudden the momentums gone with them
6347359 what we tried to do was different from every other team and not play them off the dribble we tried to pass and move it around on them thats what we tried to do but they adjusted and played really smart in the second half
6347360 weve been in games in this tournament with teams that have been within one point or maybe tied at the end of the first quarter
6347361 what we try to do is remain calm we understand that our biggest strength is our depth
6347362 so we want to be a team that applies pressure for 40 minutes and wears you down
6347363 if it happens midway through the first quarter great if it happens in the fourth quarter thats fine too the important thing is that it happens eventually

6347368 in altri termini sulla nostra mappa sessuale che si crea a partire dalle esperienze infantili e si basa sul modo in cui percepiamo lidentit e laltro e sul vissuto di eventi significativi arrivando a costruire il percorso sul quale si muove il nostro immaginario erotico

6347374 wrongs are often forgiven but contempt never is our pride remembers it forever it implies a discovery of weakness which we are more careful to conceal than a crime many a man will confess his crimes to a friend but i never knew a man that would tell his silly weaknesses to his most intimate one

6347383 despite the best efforts of police the trial powers were ineffective in assisting police to apprehend drug couriers on a sustained basis mr barbour said in a statement today
6347384 i have considerable reservations about whether these or similar powers will ever result in the cost effective detection of person involved in road based drug trafficking
6347385 overwhelmingly drug detection trial operations resulted in the detection of persons involved in minor possession offences rather than those involved in the supply or trafficking of indictable quantities of drugs mr barbour said

6347388 it is of no little significance that the ipccs value for the coefficient in the co2 forcing equation depends on only one paper in the literature that its values for the feedbacks that it believes account for two thirds of humankinds effect on global temperatures are likewise taken from only one paper and that its implicit value of the crucial parameter depends upon only two papers one of which had been written by a lead author of the chapter in question and neither of which provides any theoretical or empirical justification for a value as high as that which the ipcc adopted

6347400 si hay alguien interesado en reunirse con las gremiales ese soy yo solicit el a o pasado reunirme con la asi ya me hab an dado la fecha y por intervenci n del presidente de la anep esa reuni n se frustr
6347401 tambi n tenemos que hacer un esfuerzo para hacer m s recursos no estoy planteando que vamos a incrementar los impuestos a las empresas o que vamos a incrementar las tasas impositivas sino hacer mayor esfuerzo de fiscalizaci n para reducir los altos niveles de evaci n fiscal contrabando y corrupci n por supuesto que no iba a explicar en 45 minutos o una hora c mo es que vamos a financiar nuestro programa de gobierno eso requiere m s tiempo m s dedicaci n
6347402 no es control de precios sino estabilizarlos introduciendo mecanismos de competencia
6347403 no me vengan a decir que aqu no hay grupos econ micos que han crecido y aumentado los niveles de rentabilidad porque han crecido bajo las faldas del estado
6347404 sencillamente esta es una relaci n pol tica que se ha construido y que no supone ning n delito supone m s bien un problema de car cter tico de tal modo que no tengo que presentar pruebas a nadie
6347405 sostengo la visi n con respecto al ejercicio patrimonialista que se ha hecho del estado
6347406 he dicho que por su afinidad y eso explica sus declaraciones tiene que pagar la factura pol tica para seguir gozando de ese favor y de esa protecci n
6347407 es una campa a sucia de algunos medios de comunicaci n de organizaciones fantasmas manejadas por la derecha y por algunos militares en situaci n de retiro que tienen un expediente negro con graves acusaciones a violaciones a los derechos humanos
6347408 prometiendo no promover reformas constitucionales que lesionen su estatus como instituci n permanente del estado
6347409 el promover fortalecer el rol constitucional de la fuerza armada en funci n de la consolidaci n de la gobernabilidad democr tica
6347410 no hemos sido nosotros quienes tenemos abandonada a la instituci n armada no hemos sido nosotros quienes hemos utilizado y manipulado pol ticamente la fuerza armada
6347411 fortalecer el sistema previsional as como mejorar el funcionamiento del hospital militar y la pensi n a los lisiados de guerra nada de eso ha hecho este gobierno amigos compa eros militares

6347418 fully fledged work in the interests of the russian side
6347419 the public has a right to know how far politicians will go beyond the boundary where political battles end and the betrayal of national interests begins
6347420 i hope that there are not people in russia who are hankering for the days of u s soviet confrontation because they are over
6347421 what the secretary general was referring to is fulminating about how youre going to attack poland because there are 10 interceptors aimed at long range threats of the future from countries like iran when youve been offered all kinds of measures to demonstrate
6347422 they russia must know that the united states would never permit an attack on the territory of an ally under article 5
6347423 what we have to prevent is the notion that we can draw a new line at ukraine and georgia
6347424 this was not so much about punishing russia the issue was helping georgia and making very clear to russia that if what was intended was to intimidate nato from deepening its relationships with ukraine and georgia they didnt do it
6347425 frankly the more the russians say things like well we are doing this as peacekeepers the more ridiculous that sounds
6347426 you know peacekeepers dont bomb civilian cities and tie up highways and prevent civilian ports from being used
6347427 would like to see the united states provide assistance to the georgian military self defense equipment that will help them defend and deter against russian aggression in the future
6347428 we asked them what security needs they had and they were quite specific and quite defined
6347429 were not going to let this aggression stand the world is behind you
6347430 we cant let a bully do this because if they do it here theyll do it other places and if we dont stop it here well have to stop it in a much more difficult way
6347431 not going to prevent the american people from helping you
6347432 our open house in germany provided top north american printers with an indepth education on how to decide on one of our popular presses from a long perfector 41 inch press to a large format press
6347433 this was accomplished by showing them makereadies for commercial packaging and label jobs including hybrid technology and comparing costs and throughput on both types of presses
6347434 but there is no reason to believe that there is an agreement yet
6347435 there are still issues concerning exactly how our forces operate
6347436 ultimately the prime minister has to make the call on moving forward
6347437 a chance for me to meet with the prime minister and see what we can do from washington to get to closure
6347438 i think if you look in aggregate at what weve put in place as a state and in the measures that we are proposing here we are still very much at the forefront in terms of efforts to stop smoking
6347439 the effects of passive smoking are harmful especially to children and that harm increases when the child is in a confined space such as a car
6347440 one thing is certain and that is there will be point of sale changes theres going to be reform in terms of 11 or so thousand retail outlets it will not be business as usual for them and thats very very important
6347441 victoria is in catch up mode and the premier if he is really serious about fighting cancer should have brought in some of these measures over the past 12 months

6347547 this is my first online gaming economy award and i will surely treasure it for life i worked really hard and it paid off big time
6347548 the demographics we gleaned in this online gaming economy poll are invaluable
6347549 and with this data well be able to produce a great summary of important data points
6347550 usually i just sign off on results and make sure they are published in a timely matter but this time i really wanted to get hands on with this online gaming economy subject matter so i decided to aide my fellow employees with statistical measurements and data analysis personally im very curious about local online gaming economy ideas and trends
6347551 i loved the opportunity to meet and greet the online gaming economy survey takers and speak to them one on one i want to get the most accurate and colorful data possible for my work also i want to get personal ideas and view points that will offer some important perspective about the level of online gaming economy integration in our society
6347552 for those surveyees that took part in all three of the online gaming economy survey sections we offered three different forms of compensation a cash gift of 50 gift certificate to a local restaurant or a gift card for the upcoming holiday season at the local mall
6347553 im very excited about tallying the data from this important online gaming economy survey
6347554 this is the first time weve asked for public participation in our scientific research and were absolutely flattered and grateful by the turn out i expect preliminary results will be tabulated by next month at which point well release general findings about important online gaming economy trends in this society to the local media
6347555 weve seen some very interesting commonalities across cultures ethnicities and various different societies online gaming economy survey takers were very considerate in their answers and this helped us greatly to further tune our hypotheses in the end well have a great set of data to analyze and study for the future as we continue to review how online gaming economy factors work in society
6347556 i was impressed with the publics awareness of online gaming economy trends in their daily lives ive been studying them for months now and some surveyees raised questions that i couldnt readily answer in those cases i referred them to write their comments down and submit them to our directors for further review
6347557 i chose not to answer that question because it had nothing to do with the study of online gaming economy and everything to do with my personal finances as a result i did not qualify for a compensatory gift but that is fine privacy is important even if were collecting data for academic purposes

6347615 in den letzten jahren konnte ich als gesch ftsf hrer dazu beitragen dass stock austria und die marke stroh zu aush ngeschildern der sterreichischen spirituosenindustrie und zu gesch tzten partnern in lebensmitteleinzelhandel und gastronomie wurden die erzielten erfolge waren f r mich eine gro e motivation jetzt vom management auf die unternehmerseite zu wechseln
6347616 der neue spirituosen codex der eu sichert sowohl die bezeichnung inl nderrum als auch den jagertee als eindeutig sterreichische spezialit t im ausland ab damit k nnen wir mit den verschiedenen produkten der marke stroh international noch st rker und mit gr erem wiedererkennungswert am markt auftreten ich bin daher zuversichtlich dass dem sterreichischen exportschlager stroh und somit dem gesamten unternehmen eine gro e zukunft bevorsteht
6347617 politik betrifft uns alle es darf uns daher nicht egal sein wer sterreich regiert es darf uns auch nicht egal sein wenn verantwortung f r sterreich der politischen taktik geopfert zu werden droht denn nur eine gute politik ist die basis f r eine erfolgreiche zukunft wir glauben daher dass es zeit ist farbe zu bekennen

6347621 ik begin er pas in december aan en dan vooral in itali
6347622 al zal ik wel af en toe naar belgi afzakken
6347623 straks rij ik nog de vuelta daarna las ik een rustperiode in
6347624 toch schrijf ik het veldrijden zeker niet af vermoedelijk is er in 2013 weer een wk in treviso daar wil ik bij zijn
6347625 de regering zal er alles aan doen om de families van de slachtoffers te steunen na deze tradegie
6347626 de russen stelden een ultimatum ofwel een ruil ofwel zou tbilisi aangevallen worden
6347627 ik heb vroeger bij vreemdelingenzaken gewerkt en begrijp een beetje hoe men tewerkgaat maar nu deze meisjes zijn moeten vertrekken zal het gezin echt niet volgen ze kunnen gewoon niet terug
6347628 but there is no reason to believe that there is an agreement yet
6347629 there are still issues concerning exactly how our forces operate
6347630 ultimately the prime minister has to make the call on moving forward
6347631 a chance for me to meet with the prime minister and see what we can do from washington to get to closure
6347632 anledningen till nedl ggningen var l nsamhetsproblem enligt burger kings nordenchef stefan eriksson
6347633 alicia tell me again what you believe your role is as division manager on the phoenix project
6347634 my role is to put the team together assign the leadership make sure there is consensus and that the project stays on track
6347635 yes at the end of the day i am responsible for the phoenix project
6347636 and as the division manager have you abdicated your responsibility as a manager to a watered down decision making protocol called consensus in an effort to appease everyone and get everyone to play nice
6347637 i think richard will prove to be an excellent signing for the club
6347638 he knows the club and the players from his loan spell here last season so there wont be a bedding in period
6347639 its been a long summer for myself with regard to my future i had quite a few options but in my heart of hearts i always wanted to come back to carlisle
6347640 this was the best move for me and i cant wait to get going again
6347641 im looking forward to playing for the manager and this football club
6347642 women who get drunk are more likely to be raped than women who do not get drunk
6347643 men who take advantage of women by raping them drunk or sober should be severely punished for this wicked treacherous action however stupid the victim may have been
6347644 but it does mean that a rape victim who was drunk deserves less sympathy
6347645 what happened last year was a crime and i was part of this crime against the jewish nation
6347646 the administration is sensitive to public sentiments and the president is also committed to upholding the constitution
6347647 in doing so she will seek a new agreement within the boundaries of the law set within the constitution
6347648 the president will not allow adventurism by milf forces to pressure government to sign any agreement even if it is for peace
6347649 the focus of our peace talks shall shift from armed groups to the community
6347650 shifting of focus is not abandonment of negotiations with the milf
6347651 authentic consultations with the people and not negotiations with armed groups
6347652 as far as the milf leadership is concerned the moa ad is already a done deal
6347653 even if it means an indefinite postponement of the 11 year old peace process

6347657 comodo firewall pro plus offers students the assurance that they will go back to school with a clean machine and the assurance that the machine will be kept clean for the entire school year
6347658 members belonging to our party in the parliament have asked asif to become the next president
6347659 there was an understanding between the coalition partners that the presidential candidate would be decided by mutual consensus
6347660 they have unilaterally floated the name of mr zardari it is their prerogative but we have not been consulted yet

6347662 we had to look at the viability of the whole foundation our numbers here at the dining hall continue to go up
6347663 with the help of the case management and staff we gained our self respect and on top of that they gave me time to heal
6347664 for women it is especially a nightmare because if they are put outside they are vulnerable to violence
6347665 at the same time stronger authentication must be simple and convenient for users or they will not use it
6347666 the only time they change is when people are injured or die
6347667 the key to financial success is to have a simple automated system that drives 1000s of real prospects to your website without spending a dime on leads build your team 10 times as fast with half the effort learn what really works right now
6347668 you need a starting off point when youre playing with a baby that isnt talking
6347669 its a long day to sit and stare at a baby so to have something that lights up and makes music is so wonderful i grew up in a household where there was classical music all the time so i find it very nostalgic and comforting to hear a little bit of vivaldi or beethoven
6347670 its great we have so many products available now but i think my mom did a great job with what she had too
6347671 this historic agreement opens up a new and final chapter in the long history of russias psychotic aggression towards the poles
6347672 over the centuries russia has brutally attacked its tiny neighbour on hundreds of occasions without the slightest provocation well not any more
6347673 brave poland we salute you we take comfort in your strong christian faith and know that one day we will all dance together in heaven
6347674 i have better idea why not just get whole country to stand at border wearing putin is c nt t shirt that should do trick
6347675 still at least now us back us up just like they do for brave georgia i start dig large hole buy beans
6347676 ive spent 1 billion making this place at least as bad as the eternal firey torments of the underworld
6347677 for the last 20 years our corporate strategy has been to make this place so comprehensively vile that you would just kill yourself because whatever awaits you in the afterlife cannot possibly be as bad as sitting in a heathrow departure lounge for six hours
6347678 our latest customer survey showed more than 90 would rather be roasted on a spit and have the flesh ripped from their bones by a horde of fire breathing shit covered demons than endure another minute in one of our check in queues
6347679 you only get that sort of result through continued investment an upbeat customer facing corporate philosophy and above all attention to detail
6347680 i got a letter from a frequent flyer last week who said he wouldnt force hitler and the nazis to go through security at heathrow thats why i get out of bed in the morning
6347681 such actions create mistrust and spur an arms race on the continent and beyond its borders
6347682 missile defence of course is aimed at no one it is in our defence that we do this
6347683 such a battery can have nothing to do with parrying imaginary iranian threats
6347684 for that reason no one who has good intentions toward us and toward the western world should be afraid of it
6347685 poland by deploying the system is exposing itself to a strike 100 per cent
6347686 a well placed official in the russian ministry of defence
6347687 born in balikpapan grew in makassar wandered in bandung and finally stranded in this cosmopolitan city jakarta
6347688 the idea used to be that you had to bring indian kids off reserves to save them
6347689 now were trying to work with the communities to ensure that the answer is from home because thats the best place to find answers no system can replace the family
6347690 although kids may still be taken away from parents for alcoholism or whatever they generally now have the opportunity to stay in the same community
6347691 tikinagan has helped to dramatically improve services in the north new partnerships with first nations help keep children safe and connected to their family and cultural identity
6347692 the active recruitment and training of community members helps establish a strong local presence and quicker response times the result is strengthened families healthier children and youth and a stronger sense of community pride
6347693 the answers lie within the communities is a very challenging statement when you try to live by it
6347694 this award will expand our ability to respond and test innovative ways that can help our children discover their past seize the present and anticipate their future
6347695 the excellence of tikinagan can be measured by the thousand daily acts to counter hopelessness deep poverty and alarming rates of teen suicide among young people in our north
6347696 recibo con orgullo esta bandera y espero poder honrarla trayendo una medalla de vuelta
6347697 estos son atletas de alto rendimiento que han tenido que clasificar en sus respectivos deportes y espec ficamente estos tres hicieron la marca a para estar en beijing
6347698 la nica forma de trascender en el deporte es participando exponi ndonos no tengo duda de que estos atletas nos representar n dignamente
6347699 a young person today is relatively more comfortable talking to a parent talking to a public health nurse talking to a doctor about their sexual and reproductive health
6347700 youth have become progressively more knowledgeable about sexuality and as a result they are far more reflective in terms of making decisions about their sexual behaviour
6347701 that is why we see fewer kids deciding to be sexually active
6347702 we believe that when you talk to young people about sex and sexuality it delays their first sexual encounter
6347703 we were not lateee the time just shot passed like an arrow
6347704 this was shocking to all of us to the medical community
6347705 this was the first time in history that a baby was reported dying from breast milk
6347706 if that duplication of the gene may be 5 per cent which we believe it is for the canadian public in general this is 5 000 babies a year just in canada that may be exposed to that risk of mom being an ultra metabolizer
6347707 an innovative measure designed to reduce the dropout rate among african canadian students
6347708 the toronto system is an example of how we can address the challenges of globalization migration and demographic change
6347709 when the bertelsmann people came this spring to observe our programs they were interested that we treat diversity as a strength not a problem
6347710 we see that diversity itself creates value for all students who need to know about their world
6347711 no matter how good you were then you are not certain of how good you are now
6347712 it has been eight years since i worked and that is a long time to be away
6347713 one of the biggest challenges is finding ways to update yourself
6347714 there have been dramatic changes in things like corporate governance and the ways businesses operate
6347715 finding the best most suitable jobs usually depends on who you know
6347716 i can handle all the home computer stuff but i have never used things like a blackberry
6347717 my life raising a family is so far removed from my past life in business trying to return involves considerable culture shock
6347718 if i went back full time i would not want to find myself in a job that demanded all of my time
6347719 i want a rewarding career but i want a rewarding personal life as well
6347720 helping academically qualified women with managerial experience resume their careers is essential for the future of this country
6347721 fast changing demographics mean we face a dramatic shortage of trained professionals in the years ahead women who left the workforce can help fill that need
6347722 they need the academic qualifications because there isnt time in the course to teach them things like accounting
6347723 and more than six years away suggests their skills and familiarity with todays business practices are too outdated for us to be able to help in such a limited time frame
6347724 on the surface we look very affluent but theres a whole underclass there who are struggling
6347725 that alone is an indicator that we should be worried
6347726 thats the tip of the iceberg because it takes an awful lot of effort for people to come into a food bank
6347727 food is a basic human right and people shouldnt have to be begging on the streets for a meal or settling for junk food just because those are the cheaper options
6347728 within my program i had people who are organic farmers who for their whole life have been working at growing food
6347729 they now realize theres a certification they can get to know some of the other issues associated with food not just growing it there are health and nutrition issues
6347730 people who own restaurants take the program too they just want to make their menus more local
6347731 hearing that one professor talking about how much she was going against government lobbying people for a bird i thought i personally want to invest my time working on issues that fight for peoples rights
6347732 in my introductory course i expect students to go out on their own initiative to a community food resource in their own area like a food bank or community garden
6347733 the value of this is it gets out to a wider group of people were getting people who are professionals in social services in civil service organizations in government agencies
6347734 we are actually linked for our urban agriculture courses to ruaf resource centres on urban agriculture and food security in the netherlands we have dutch instructors and we also have a kenyan instructor so theyre bringing in international perspectives on things
6347735 were talking about people working in community development here and overseas health education social services basically what were trying to make folks realize is that your actions and the policies you design have an impact on food security
6347736 its not just fries and hamburgers things that just fill you up and give you lots of carbs and fat
6347737 sometimes i feel like the issue of food security is so big i wont be able to do a single thing but thats probably also what drives me
6347738 i believe that the administrations of the future will recognize both the threat that we face and the substantial commitment that our allies have now taken for missile defense
6347739 strengthens the global positioning of the most powerful country in the world
6347740 the first woman in american history to win presidential primaries in our nation
6347741 this is a defining moment in the history of our nation
6347742 we have a choice to make we can choose to stay the current failed course or we can choose a path that builds upon the best of who and what we are that reflects our highest values we can have more of the last eight years or we can rise together and create a new kind of government
6347743 my screen is divided up into half a dozen little pictures and each one of those pictures is one of my students they have webcams on their computer as do i and we sit and talk to one another it brings a whole other level of personal touch to distance education
6347744 if you can do email and you can find a website then thats all you really need
6347745 much different from students who tend to succeed in regular courses
6347746 after that its up to the students to set their own schedule
6347747 find it easier to post a comment online than stand up in a classroom with 40 pairs of eyes staring at them while they speak
6347748 im not bound by a schedule that says i have to be in a classroom every monday at 3 oclock
6347749 when im teaching a course my classroom is open 24 hours a day seven days a week
6347750 part of what it means to do philosophy rather than to read it is to actually discuss ideas with other students
6347751 the discussion board facilitates that type of personal interaction between students
6347752 if you have questions or if there is something you dont understand you simply send an email to the professors
6347753 there is no waiting in line to ask a question
6347754 most importantly this provides insights into the invention process and technologies in healthcare and the medical devices industry
6347755 coming up with scientific ideas doing experiments to validate them and getting a patent makes you understand what it takes
6347756 i struggled through high school and i thought working with my hands would be better for me
6347757 i probably wouldnt even be in school if it wasnt for this program
6347758 when trucks come through i use my site safety traffic control that i got through local 183 i drove a few machines at 183 too and drive some of those at the golf course now
6347759 i knew i didnt want to be doing something after school that involved sitting in an office i wanted to be working outside this sounded like it was perfect for me
6347760 we have summer students who work in the office or the yards but most arent ready to work with a crew like buddy was
6347761 i think its great hes done a good job for us
6347762 they often see young people come to the trades with little or no exposure to these certifications
6347763 then we tell them to do some research to determine why the bridge failed
6347764 it introduces the students to the fact that its not just hammering nails and wood together theres a lot more to it the business aspect of it and the importance of math skills knowing areas and volumes dimensions
6347765 the average age of an apprentice is 24 to 30 years old im trying to get these students in at 15 16 17 years old
6347766 it obviously would have been better if he had won a gold medal but the chinese people and the sponsors are not going to turn their back on him
6347767 hes still an icon hes well respected he still has the attention of the population
6347768 theyve already been eating the cake for the past four years
6347769 liu xiang represented something more to china than just athletic performance
6347770 he represented china being able to achieve success in areas theyve never previously had success in
6347771 china is a country whose economy is in a transition its moving from being a low cost manufacturer into much more higher added value intellectual based industries
6347772 its breaking down the barriers of what people perceived of made in china and i think liu xiang in many ways catches that spirit
6347773 thats not good with your expecta tions to say yeah i think im going to get sent down after each start
6347774 but the last couple starts its hard to think they can give me any more opportunities than they have in this stretch especially with only a month and a half left in the season and the pennant race as close as it is now
6347775 youve got to send guys out there that you believe theyre going to go out there and give you a win or give you six seven innings and i havent been doing that so i hate to say it was the right decision but i believe it was
6347776 i think we felt like we need to give him a little bit of a renewed start
6347777 because its obviously not working right now i think we all believe strongly that it will work but at the moment its difficult
6347778 to me youre putting a lot of pressure on yourself
6347779 with the game the way it was we had a lead we kind of had the upper hand on them you dont want to give them any opportunities and i think that kind of opened the door a little bit
6347780 hes got as good stuff as anybody on this team when he realizes that and believes in that hes going to be back and big for us
6347781 you feel an obligation certainly never to hurt anybody but also you see guys jumping over the fence trying to make plays
6347782 up here youre in a pennant race ive never been one to say that pressure was too much for me but ive felt like ive had a lot of weight on my shoulders just trying to be perfect trying to do everything as well as i could to help this team win and it hasnt been near good enough
6347783 the decision was coming it had to be made soon they had given me ample opportunity to help this team and to help myself out up here and it just hasnt worked out
6347784 el dolor que una persona siente en estas situaciones es muy dif cil reducirlo lo que si es posible es no permitir que se aumente ese dolor con variables extra as como una comunicaci n de mala noticia inadecuada o una contaminaci n de informaci n no contrastada
6347785 las normales en estos casos consecuencia del cansancio y nerviosismo
6347786 lo normal despu s de la confusi n y la asimilaci n de la tragedia pasa a ser una situaci n controlada al contrario de lo que se suele creer
6347787 ha sido un milagro apenas tiene quemaduras est esperando para ser operado de las fracturas que sufri en el f mur y el tobillo
6347788 mi hijo ten a billete para un vuelo anterior de air europa pero lo cambi ayer mismo para volar un poco m s tarde ha sido una fatalidad
6347789 he perdido a mi hijo de 27 a os estoy destrozada
6347790 en primer lugar podremos probarlo en un test abierto a todo el p blico en la games convention 2008 de leipzig aqu podremos probar las nuevas caracter sticas del juego las cuales proponen la delicia de los aficionados a este juego
6347791 they have experienced some of these natural disasters and after a lot of hard work and support they are able to stabilize
6347792 thats what i think their challenge is and they seem to continue to have met it over the years
6347793 the real issue is whether or not were in a period where these floods are occurring more frequently or not
6347794 one of the most beautiful magnificent places in the world and should be seen by everyone
6347795 it really truly is among the most beautiful places on earth
6347796 when you get down by havasu falls its as though kodak made an outdoor movie set
6347797 im excited and it doesnt hurt i dont have any pain my vision is good again
6347798 this is my third pair of contacts in my left eye this week and it feels real good and im seeing pretty good out of them
6347799 theyre not really happy times for me but its still alright
6347800 its frustrating if you work hard especially with all the rumours going on and then you dont play
6347801 sunderlands interest is very much for real and im looking to see in the next week whats going to happen because you know im 31 in november so sitting on the bench or not playing is not an option for me
6347802 if i cant make the starting line up at blackburn then im wasting time
6347803 he ince has made his intentions clear he doesnt want me to go he wants me to stay and from my point of view i respect the manager
6347804 i cant have any complaints jason was awesome at everton and i cant see the reason why he should be taken out of the starting line up and obviously roques fantastic as well hes scoring goals
6347805 those two deserve to play but if i cant get in the team then yes i would want the move to sunderland
6347806 obviously it was a distraction you knew you could have gone there chelsea and you end up not going and you get frustrated and you know things arent going as well as they could be because of all the things going on around you you get dropped and then you get frustrated
6347807 blake is a fagget ass x dealer anyway why are
6347808 im excited and it doesnt hurt i dont have any pain my vision is good again
6347809 this is my third pair of contacts in my left eye this week and it feels real good and im seeing pretty good out of them
6347810 that was one of the worst performances that second half was dire
6347811 what positives can you take from that the players are not recognisable from the ones we see in the premier league every saturday and sunday they dont look the same players
6347812 weve produced one of the finest midfield players in the world in steven gerrard he is a colossus we stick him on the left wing hes not a winger he has got to be in the middle of the park where he can influence the game we are killing him
6347813 its unbelievable i came here full of optimism when i looked at the team we keep changing managers but the performances dont improve whats the reason its so difficult to get to the bottom of
6347814 if steve mcclaren had been in charge of that team there would have been uproar wembley would have gone barmy
6347815 we could all pick the same players everybody would pick nine out of those 11 players no danger we keep picking them we see them every week in the premier league when they play here for england for some reason they dont look the same players
6347816 what i think is the problem is you get people who play for their clubs and they are loved they play for chelsea like frank lampard and the fans idolise them
6347817 they come off here and they are booed by 70 000 people
6347818 that was one of the worst performances that second half was dire
6347819 what positives can you take from that the players are not recognisable from the ones we see in the premier league every saturday and sunday they dont look the same players
6347820 weve produced one of the finest midfield players in the world in steven gerrard he is a colossus we stick him on the left wing hes not a winger he has got to be in the middle of the park where he can influence the game we are killing him
6347821 its unbelievable i came here full of optimism when i looked at the team we keep changing managers but the performances dont improve whats the reason its so difficult to get to the bottom of
6347822 if steve mcclaren had been in charge of that team there would have been uproar wembley would have gone barmy
6347823 we could all pick the same players everybody would pick nine out of those 11 players no danger we keep picking them we see them every week in the premier league when they play here for england for some reason they dont look the same players

6347825 they come off here and they are booed by 70 000 people
6347826 theres a sense that its a cutting edge destination where they can be among the first to learn firsthand about another culture
6347827 theres something about being one of the first in your generation to really have a deep understanding
6347828 its probably the most different and most unorthodox place i could think of
6347829 i kind of wanted that as opposed to england where the prestige is there but the life experience is kind of similar
6347830 i think thats one of the real divisions between studying abroad in europe and studying abroad in asia
6347831 even if it was harder than i expected it to be thats not necessarily a bad thing because i grew up a lot
6347832 were pretty sure that china can take more but exactly how many and in what fields and what would it take to double or quadruple the numbers thats something we as an industry will have to explore
6347833 i would have been sorely disappointed if i had left after the first semester
6347834 we are delighted to congratulate the reach scholars who earned high marks on rigorous college level exams
6347835 i would have thought for kids who were on the borderline that they would have seen an improvement
6347836 im not gonna say im never gonna do drugs again
6347837 when you add outlanders superior crash protection to its combination of styling performance fuel efficiency and value it doesnt take a back seat to any vehicle in the crossover segment
6347838 were extremely pleased that the iihs has confirmed our commitment to safety
6347839 theyre not really happy times for me but its still alright
6347840 its frustrating if you work hard especially with all the rumours going on and then you dont play
6347841 sunderlands interest is very much for real and im looking to see in the next week whats going to happen because you know im 31 in november so sitting on the bench or not playing is not an option for me

6347865 he has apologised if that suggestion has been taken and his apology has been forwarded to the judiciary
6347866 their role is to be as consistent as they possibly can and i know they spend hours and hours each week reviewing incidents and comparing them to previous incidents to try and ensure that they are consistent

6347953 but if you have a computer you can make a simple spreadsheet
6347954 producers can add 5 per hundredweight by castrating calves and when you have a 500 pound calf to market thats an added 25 per head added value
6347955 the entire success of this process hinges on whether or not you can get a functional rumen
6347956 provide a high quality palatable diet getting calves to consume an adequate ration
6347957 you will need to interact with those calves to alleviate depression and stress

6347962 tropical storm fay is not expected to be over the gulf of mexico very long if at all on friday we will continue to monitor fay for any significant deviations to the forecast the most significant change to our forecast for this weekend is seeing a decrease in rain chances and hotter temperatures into the mid and upper 90s
6347963 the most significant issue regarding the slow motion is that fay will likely continue to dump torrential rains along its path and will probably be remembered as a very wet storm
6347964 the turn to the northwest and west northwest keeping fay over land is consistent with most of the computer models
6347965 but i just think getting help has become less taboo in my opinion people nowadays are less embarrassed to seek treatment
6347966 for the last year and a half one of our main efforts has been this anti stigma campaign
6347967 there are a lot of myths associated with mental illness that prevent them from getting help
6347968 people need to understand that this is an equal opportunity disease
6347969 anytime someone has journeyed your journey they can understand you in ways some professionals cant

6347984 i am afraid that russia poses a threat to the world peace if the democratic world fails to find enough reasons to come to an agreement on its united position towards russia moscow would be more and more often provoking its neighbours trying to deprive them of their independence
6347985 russia will again try to restore its political military and economic influence in the region which it describes as its close neighbourhood
6347986 or through a democratic position that russia will not be a member of the unless it starts behaving in a more civilised manner or by denying russian representatives an invitation to g7 group meetings

6347995 hemos estado liderando la clasificaci n durante toda la competici n desde el principio y eso a lo mejor te carga un poco m s de tensi n y m s que nada para celebrarlo con todo el mundo que nos ha seguido durante estos diez a os ahora vamos a disfrutar un poco de esta victoria
6347996 hemos hecho una pedazo de salida y en la segunda manga hemos tenido algunos problemas pues el australiano se ha acercado mucho y el argentino estaba justo detr s no s porqu raz n hemos dejado de correr al principio de la segunda ce ida no s si por un pl stico o algo pero de repente nos hemos visto muy lentos despu s hemos vuelto a alargar igual es que est bamos en un zona mala y luego la popa ha sido aguantar a veces tir bamos nosotros o que los australianos no quer an forzar pues ten an asegurada la plata y hemos estado ah tanteando unas veces a tope y otras veces relaj ndonos pero con presi n total hasta el ltimo segundo
6347997 no nos hemos enterado en la segunda ce ida los alemanes ya nos han dejado de preocupar pues los dos primeros estaban bien colocados y ellos si quer an estar en disposici n de hacer algo deb an estar en esos puestos nos hemos olvidado de ellos y nos hemos concentrado en el australiano y sabiendo que los argentinos estaban detr s

6347999 im excited and it doesnt hurt i dont have any pain my vision is good again
6348000 this is my third pair of contacts in my left eye this week and it feels real good and im seeing pretty good out of them
6348001 i am very pleased to complete this deal which gives us five senior strikers and provides the manager with a good array of attacking options at his disposal
6348002 that was one of the worst performances that second half was dire
6348003 what positives can you take from that the players are not recognisable from the ones we see in the premier league every saturday and sunday they dont look the same players
6348004 weve produced one of the finest midfield players in the world in steven gerrard he is a colossus we stick him on the left wing hes not a winger he has got to be in the middle of the park where he can influence the game we are killing him
6348005 its unbelievable i came here full of optimism when i looked at the team we keep changing managers but the performances dont improve whats the reason its so difficult to get to the bottom of
6348006 if steve mcclaren had been in charge of that team there would have been uproar wembley would have gone barmy
6348007 we could all pick the same players everybody would pick nine out of those 11 players no danger we keep picking them we see them every week in the premier league when they play here for england for some reason they dont look the same players
6348008 what i think is the problem is you get people who play for their clubs and they are loved they play for chelsea like frank lampard and the fans idolise them
6348009 they come off here and they are booed by 70 000 people
6348010 if you liked the apprentice and want to see the ultimate in a high maintenance boss then youll love i want to work for diddy
6348011 the series is a big glossy reality entertainment brand full of intense emotions with plenty of humour tears and drama that will fit neatly into primetime on virgin1
6348012 we are excited to see the on screen chemistry and emotion this incredibly talented husband and wife team will bring to our show
6348013 fans are in for a treat and we couldnt be more thrilled that they chose er to make their first tv appearance together
6348014 when we started off there was a new album so we started off with that and made it the centerpiece of the show
6348015 we still play songs from it but weve brought the new album down to its essence down to the last four or five songs in the set and thats the same every night
6348016 say what bruce wants to say about the new album theyre about where we are as americans and where we are with the iraq disaster
6348017 its a lot of material that tends to hold together
6348018 you see everything written on those signs though obviously we dont know all of them
6348019 bruce wouldnt pick a song we didnt know but if its a song we havent done for many years we might attempt it
6348020 youre on stage and every time you look over there you miss him
6348021 its weird not having him around and its a shock youre never really going to recover from he was the first of the original founding members to go
6348022 you couldnt hope for a nicer guy to do that difficult job
6348023 unless theres a drug or drinking problem the tendency is to keep getting better why wouldnt you
6348024 and weve never changed our attitude about going on stage and presenting the best rock n roll show anyone has ever seen whether we succeed in that lofty goal or not its always in your mind we treat every show like its the last show and the first show
6348025 weve gotten that offer every year for the last 25 years and weve never done it
6348026 i think were just waiting for the right moment because you can only do that once you want to save some things for the right time
6348027 there hasnt been a mid week eviction this series so nobody will be expecting it it will be cruel on the pair that go but a great surprise for viewers to witness

6348039 the worst is yet to come in the us kenneth rogoff former chief economist at the international monetary fund and harvard university professor of economics said this week
6348040 i dont think simply having a couple of medium sized banks and a couple of small banks going under is going to do the job
6348041 we previously said 19 to 20 per cent so some may regard that as a slight upgrade and in my mind it is
6348042 we dont dwell on the past when it comes to acquisitions
6348043 weve gone out and spent some money on pmi and weve got a pipeline of acquisitions were looking at
6348044 just to mention a couple other tours this is obviously not an ozzfest its not a warped tour
6348045 i see warped as being a more screamo emo punk thing and i see ozzfest as being a more metal tour and i wouldnt use those words to describe this tour although there are elements of those things in some of the bands on the bill
6348046 we hope our fans see in our music something that is new and original
6348047 hes been doing this for longer than we have hes got one of the most original voices in rock original style and has done many different things i think a lot of young kids will look up to and say thats really cool
6348048 if you come from the beginning to the end of the show youll get a lot of different sounds and experiences
6348049 my stepdad is going to do carpeting for the theater room and right now weve got house renovations going on at same time so ill go to the studio at night to dry to carve in some part of the day for personal writing time
6348050 ive had to learn to jump from one thing to another
6348051 i dont have the luxury of having all this space and time
6348052 for me in songs like losing my ground and voodoo doll i was able to be vulnerable and let people into a subject that a lot of celebrities would just try to hide
6348053 for me it was just letting it all out there and letting people in people arent perfect and i have issues too
6348054 why wouldnt i want to do more albums with the peas i love doing shows with them and i love doing solo shows why would you want to give up one if you didnt have to
6348055 plus being with the guys is like having all these big brothers its not so much about me its about unity and group union i love being part of a team and i love having an outlet where i can sing something about my personal life that would be too self indulgent on a group record
6348056 i got all these offers to do huge tours and i could have made a lot more money i love the crowds the fairs are just such a fun crowd to perform for everyones in a festive mood and there are people of all ages people who wouldnt necessarily come see my shows i wanted to do less shows and keep some balance in my life
6348057 theres been no real kind of downtime id like to have some time to put in a closet my grandmother just got diagnosed with cancer so ill go and see her i need to see my dogs and see my man so its a balance my whole life is trying to make a good balance and be the best person and artist i can be
6348058 im not sure whether youd call her a prostitute or maybe the boys just give her some coins for a little touchy feely
6348059 im not sure how far that goes considering the period ill have to discuss that more with rob when we get together
6348060 rob did and he flipped for her it was very quick she came up met rob and she was in the movie
6348061 i really feel like god has been a huge part of my life and i do believe that prayers work something people might not know about me i have a very close relationship with my higher power
6348062 opportunities are presented to you and whether you take advantage of them and put in the work yourself is up to you
6348063 i had some people in high school who thought it was a joke that i was pursuing a musical career i got good grades and they thought i was throwing my life away i could go to an amazing college and get some really great job and they thought pursuing this singing thing seemed silly
6348064 its definitely helped me to improve my times being able to wear something so comfortable and im sure it will help me to give my best performance at beijing i hope that my wearing the hijood sports top will inspire other women to see that modesty or religious beliefs dont have to be a barrier to participating in competitive sports
6348065 i looked around the internet for a few luxurious minutes and vastly enjoyed cranmers blog which i intend to read more regularly in future
6348066 his grace investigates with moral seriousness and intellectual rigour bringing some refreshing common sense to some of the touchiest subjects in british politics
6348067 i take advice in matters spiritual and religious from the ghost of archbishop cranmer his blog is a role model for niche blogs of all descriptions thoughtful erudite and provocative
6348068 for sheer intelligence erudition and fun iain dales diary cranmer and devils kitchen are so far ahead of the rest i dont see how they can figure in a top ten they are the beatles stones and who of the blog world the astair bogart and marlon brando of the blog world the gerswin porter and novello of the blog world the dot cotton pat butcher bette lynch of the blog world
6348069 the floor of the hall is damaged and it will have to be repaired for normal activities involving our church organisations but we will be able to use it briefly on sunday before moving out
6348070 its important that we meet in our own premises to help galvanise the congregation for the challenges that lie ahead for us
6348071 we are grateful for all this help and our neighbours at the church itself have been very supportive
6348072 i would also like to thank the fire and rescue service and our own congregation for their help during the flooding
6348073 the ct is known to attract tremendous response and this extra readership adds even more value for our customers
6348074 why write a story if you dont have a publisher why draw a picture no one will show in a gallery
6348075 we heat with wood cook with wood grow as much of our own food as we can
6348076 the fifth grader version of me would be delighted to look down the time tunnel and see how it all turned out the punk rocking college student version would be horrified
6348077 ill be telling jokes and probably singing giving a whole lot of examples of how images are still very much a part of everyones life and letting people know that working with images still brings the same kind of relief we got when we were kids the difference is that as adults we think that we need to get some money for playing or some recognition
6348078 i did want to make a book that would make people itch to make a book of their own
6348079 that itchy feeling you got when you were a kid when you saw someone doing something interesting how you just wanted to try it so bad to play with it mess around with it make something
6348080 its kind of like giving directions to someone who is in an unfamiliar area
6348081 i know a way to get there for me teaching is a lot more like taking people on a travel route im familiar with i didnt make the route or the place ive just been there a bunch of times so i feel confident about guiding and i also love this place this image place where stories happen
6348082 making things with our hands and this includes handwriting is much older than pushing buttons to make things happen
6348083 there is something we trade in when we push buttons
6348084 one way to put it is to remember what your neighborhood was like as a kid what the streets and houses and alleys and all the elements of a neighborhood were to you mostly because you couldnt drive you couldnt just drive away or go very far so you walked you hung around the small neighborhood was huge because of it all the little details that arent there for us when we drive the same is true with handwriting
6348085 everything is free except food gifts and henna hands decorative body art
6348086 we anticipate enormous numbers of emus in tower grove park
6348087 a new band and a new art form for our festival
6348088 bosnians do a very distinctive kind of singing called sevdah its like the national song form its about the pain and beauty of love
6348089 weve expanded it because it was so crowded last year
6348090 typically what i see with the brand new ethnic groups is they come and look and say wheres my culture i say please work with me and next year well have you included and theyre so excited
6348091 theres this drive i think especially in st louis because ethnicity is kind of hidden here people dont show their ethnicity much on a daily basis
6348092 the phrase they always use no matter where theyre from is we want to show people who we are and where we came from
6348093 its a chance to reach out and share something about themselves with their new neighbors
6348094 its wonderful because it is a chance to actually rub shoulders with all these people and find out what their culture is like
6348095 its a tremendously positive experience people are smiling and laughing and talking to people from different countries i especially like watching the kids from all different groups together its so touching
6348096 we so often look at the barriers between us and not on what brings us together a good time brings everybody together
6348097 you dont have to blow your whole budget on one thing
6348098 in cause of huge physical psychological and moral overwork some servicemen especially young ones have hard time to adjust to rapid changes of working conditions and are not able to understand adequately professional risk level lack of needed skills in some extreme conditions make them unable to fight stress
6348099 la fin du sms pour la grande majorit des utilisateurs de twitter
6348100 die aktuelle finanzierung dient vor allem dem ausbau des europ ischen und nordamerikanischen marktes und dem aufbau neuer m rkte insbesondere in asien dar ber hinaus investieren wir auch in die weiterentwicklung unserer technologie und produkte
6348101 it resulted in a significant inconvenience to canteen and classes
6348102 however children were fed and those whose classrooms were involved were housed with other classes for the day
6348103 we only served stuff that could be heated up we didnt have time to make sandwiches because the clean up took so long
6348104 its very disappointing because we had to dispose of most of the pre primary toys craft supplies and blankets which the children will be without until we can replace them
6348105 i was very impressed by the efficient and swift action of the staff involved
6348106 they pitched in and got on with dealing with the problem together
6348107 disruption was kept to a minimum because of their quick responses
6348108 i would rather not see any more stories about the latest outrage bush democrats omg
6348109 i wouldnt say it was my best performance in a northern ireland shirt we should remember it was only a friendly
6348110 its nice to receive a big bottle of champagne but its not going to get drunk in celebration ill simply put it in a cabinet
6348111 im content though with my display it was really nice to play at centre half i dont think though it gives the manager a selection headache with aaron coming back hopefully for the slovakia game
6348112 we have players such as aaron gareth mcauley michael duff chris baird and myself who can all step in and play centre back well so i dont think it will be a major problem for him
6348113 im happy to play anywhere for my country and if that means centre half right back or left back then ill do it
6348114 it was a good workout and a good all round team performance against what is a decent scotland team
6348115 this significant investment in the further development of the highly successful ramada belfast hotel shows our confidence in the continued growth of the tourism business travel wedding and convention sectors
6348116 in the circumstances and being a friendly i think the referee could have got away without showing two yellow cards
6348117 his first booking was down to enthusiasm and the second foul was completely innocuous
6348118 no one was hurt but still the referee chose to send him off but he will be okay
6348119 he should be delighted to have made his debut against scotland at hampden park and im sure he will see that in time i know he has the strength to deal with what has happened he is very disappointed but hell get stronger and im sure he will be a terrific player for us
6348120 thats the blueprint for what we hope to do during the qualifiers
6348121 weve said for some time that we needed to do something about the away results and i think this is the answer
6348122 we limited scotland to few chances and although we didnt create a great deal ourselves we showed great strength to get a draw now slovakia are in our sights but make no mistake about it they are a decent side
6348123 weve been tuned over in countries like that before but we are confident of picking up points away from home now we could even have won it only for mcgregor to pull off a wonderful save from davids penalty but im not worried about that
6348124 the little man has promised me he wont miss again in the qualifiers and that is more than good enough for me
6348125 the milestone of one million calls received in the uk shows that people are willing to use the crimestoppers service but spreading that message to all in belfast regardless of nationality or ethnicity is an essential part of our work
6348126 with increasingly diverse communities evident in northern ireland and belfast each person must know they can safely help in the fight against crime as we all have our part to play as its not just the sole responsibility of the authorities
6348127 we now produce a range of multi lingual information leaflets translated into many different languages which have been distributed to local council offices and community centres so that all living in belfast can help
6348128 literally anyone can phone crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 at any time with anonymity guaranteed and if required a translator will be made available to take their call
6348129 the crucial fact remains that identities have never and will never be revealed and calls are neither traced nor recorded the ethnicity of the individual is not simple relevant a factor as long as helpful information on crime is passed on to crimestoppers
6348130 shows a lack of responsiveness to the interests of airlines and passengers that we would not expect to see in a business competing in a well functioning market
6348131 american kids dont grow up playing this sport american kids grow up throwing baseballs and practicing jump shots
6348132 in china from the first day kids look at a television or go to a rec center they see the correct strokes and the way players should move their feet
6348133 this is the part that makes me feel most excited a lot of people are cheering for me because im chinese
6348134 i hated my first year of law school so much
6348135 i played four hours a day in the dorms and i got really good for having no idea what i was doing i played in the finals of the intramural tournament at duke and i faced the north carolina state champion lost 21 2 and then 21 3 i was totally mutilated
6348136 i started the next week at a club playing in a league
6348137 i began taking lessons and started going to training camps
6348138 at the u s olympic festivals we used to run
6348139 he wanted to have some type of animal not a dog
6348140 i kind of had a problem with that because it didnt seem like i could hide a dog
6348141 im taking it steady and leaving nothing to chance but im getting closer every day when i get the go ahead i guarantee ill be back in great shape and hopefully in a position to make an immediate impact for both everton and australia
6348142 the longer you are out the more you appreciate what it means to play at the top level and theres no doubt in my mind ill be back bigger and better than ever
6348143 the operation went well but the rehabilitation has taken a little longer than id have liked
6348144 republicans must step out of their ideological corner on the right and democrats must step out of their ideological corner on the left
6348145 i dont really view this as anything different than what hes been saying for a couple of months
6348146 it would have been nice if it had been a few months ago
6348147 its very pleasing that what began as a theoretical idea is now being used in motor sport
6348148 hopefully it will gradually be incorporated into other types of vehicle as well
6348149 man muss die zielgruppe kennen um die richtigen produkte ausw hlen zu k nnen
6348150 dougie did a good job for us last season there is no doubt about that
6348151 but hes 34 is an east london boy hes got four kids is happily married and hes obviously not going to move his family up here for what would be only a one or two year contract it would not be fair to ask him to live in a hotel for 12 months
6348152 we have to look forward not back our future is in youth
6348153 this will be my second season at liverpool and hopefully i can take my game to the next level
6348154 im just focusing now on getting my fitness levels back up to 100
6348155 well assess the situation on thursday where george is concerned
6348156 its his thigh mainly but this is a guy who almost went off in a neck brace and then collapsed needing oxygen in the changing room
6348157 er bestaat een zeer fiscale beperkte stimulans waarbij enkel een verzekeringstaks van 9 25 procent wegvalt
6348158 en dan enkel bij de zogenoemde onkelinx polissen waarbij de sector de contractvoorwaarden en de prijs oplegt het is dus logisch dat die rechtsbijstandspolis niet veel succes kent
6348159 its a real life spin city focusing on the day to day life of a mayor running a major american
6348160 his body brings to mind the beautiful michelangelo statue in florence
6348161 i was on the chubby side and used to swim with my t shirt on
6348162 islamic courts troops and some local militias clashed today tuesday
6348163 although the fighting has ceased and calm has returned the town is still tense
6348164 we need to improve on one or two things from saturday of course we do
6348165 revitalising the chamber the role of the back bench member
6348166 subjects for topical debates would be announced by the following consultation with the business managers
6348167 there are advantages with a predictable slot for topical debates we believe however that taking them on thursday has led to lower levels of participation than could have been expected on other days
6348168 the speed of the water was absolutely terrifying it came across the road like a river and swept everything away
6348169 it got to the stage where i had sandbags for display purposes and had those out round the doors weve lived beside the river for years but it has never come that way before it filled the field opposite us and burst the banks of the river and came charging towards us literally within seconds it became a raging torrent
6348170 i was supposed to be doing a display for the air training corps next week but the anti aircraft gun is under four or five feet of water at the moment
6348171 there were ammunition boxes with clips and shells ww1 and ww2 general equipment such as a wash hand basin that folded out there were stretchers a trailer bicycles it all got swept away i found a lot of if but some of it will probably never be seen again
6348172 anything that floated went the furthest they washed round the golf course and towards the sixmilewater i was able to get some of the wood enamel boxes which were still round the golf course but some of the stuff was three quarters of a mile away it washed away with such force
6348173 its a bit of a shambles but at least nobody was hurt
6348174 worst affected were the recently completed clubrooms of the red knights gaa club and a number of new dwellings in the riverdale and cooley meadows estates
6348175 i must pay a warm tribute to the public spirited actions of the nine local farmers who answered the call for help of their distressed neighbours
6348176 i must however be critical of the doe planning service for granting approval for these two housing developments in the first place
6348177 i believe appropriate action by the rivers agency can prevent it happening in the future
6348178 the response of the farmers demonstrated that a lowering of the river bed at the western end of the village can enable water to escape before it reaches dangerous levels
6348179 bolt like michael johnson took sprinting to another level in fact human experience in general
6348180 i was lucky enough to be in the stadium when he won the 100 that was one of the best sporting moments i have seen
6348181 he looks like a once in a lifetime champion he has got charisma which the sport really needs its scary how good he might become
6348182 find a container thats portable and use your tap water its terrific tap water its to the highest standard thats what i think people should do
6348183 before you were the thoughts emotions and reactions now you are the awareness the conscious presence that witnesses those states
6348184 in the moment of seeing of noticing that your relationship with the now is dysfunctional you are present
6348185 which compares and contrasts how sports and athletics are valued both in china and in the u s
6348186 like most chinese high schools no 19 has no sports teams and no gymnasium chinas elite young athletes may be winning a lot of medals at the olympics but in china organized sports still arent really something for regular kids less than 3 of chinese secondary school students attend schools with sports teams children with exceptional athletic prowess or physical attributes are pulled out of ordinary schools early on and sent to the special academies that train the countrys sporting elite that poses a big challenge for sporting goods companies such as nike inc and adidas ag both are looking to china and its 1 3 billion people to drive sales growth and both have set out to transform chinese youth sports that is the opposite of the situation in many suburban u s communities where children start playing organized sports such as soccer and tee ball at an early age many u s high schools face criticism for devoting too much attention and resources to sports programs and shortchanging academics or other extracurricular activities such as music and art
6348187 one view particularly common among first generation working class chinese americans maintains that sports are an unnecessary impediment to academic and professional achievement according to interviews with chinese american athletes students educators and community leaders in new york
6348188 using physical strength to make a living is not respected its a confucian ideal
6348189 youre wasting your mind using your hands is just not a career
6348190 i think theres a perception that being queer is still seen as a white thing
6348191 some construction workers asked for a picture but tom politely said sorry guys i cant stop
6348192 our findings suggest that msc therapy could become a useful treatment for inflammatory bowel disease
6348193 several previous studies have observed these cells ability to inhibit specific subsets of t cells and relieve symptoms in particular autoimmune disorders but this is the first demonstration of their ability to suppress a broad based autoimmune reaction and protect gastrointestinal tissue
6348194 we needed to develop a concise and efficient synthetic route to make enough largazole for animal studies
6348195 my labs next task was finding the origin of lagarzoles biological activity
6348196 it could be a very good drug candidate for the treatment of various cancers
6348197 we are targeting 9 percent growth in the medium term and getting up to 10 percent
6348198 may look ambitious with a slowdown in the global economy but is achievable in the medium term
6348199 we will be able to deal with any implications arising out of the salary hike
6348200 hi i live right below you and i cant get any writing done with all the noise from the vacuum
6348201 you know i have a puzzle downstairs i could lend to you if youre bored or in heat
6348202 in the first three weeks of september the global board of reed business will give a management presentation to potential acquirers
6348203 the community is in state of shock my sympathy goes out to this ladys family
6348204 an absence of any clear coherent and agreed strategy for maternity services
6348205 would be in the top performing quartile in the uk when viewed against almost all of the recognised major performance indicators
6348206 a wider review of maternity services was undertaken by a second team of independent experts who were asked to provide an overview of the service including patient safety
6348207 we have noted the assurance in the independent report that maternity services at antrim are safe
6348208 the independent experts confirmed that the units performance in respect of maternal death perinatal deaths and other accepted indicators is rated in the top 25 of maternity services across the uk
6348209 despite the two tragic deaths it is clear that antrim hospital and causeway hospital both have safety records which compare well with other maternity units across the uk
6348210 the trust and local people can be reassured by that
6348211 all i remember was once i hit the ground people were running around me they were telling me i had an accident but not to worry as they had rang for an ambulance
6348212 i knew then that i must have been seriously injured as they had phoned for the ambulance i knew i had a lot of pain in my legs my memories are a bit sketchy after that
6348213 i remember feeling a lot of pain while in hospital in america when they had to remove a tube from my throat
6348214 i was heading towards my 100th jump that was my 97th
6348215 i wouldnt say it was a miracle it was more of a mistake
6348216 but i dont think i will ever get back to sky dive
6348217 i am recovering slowly i can lift my right leg about three inches and my left leg a little but i havent been out of bed
6348218 i am just taking it one day at a time
6348219 it would be closer to family and friends it is hard for them to come and visit as much as they would like
6348220 i know i have a long road to go it can get boring
6348221 i just want to thank everyone for their letters cards prayers and messages of support and all the people who visit they have given me strength
6348222 i know there is a long way to go but i suppose i have to stay positive it is hard at times but it could have been so much worse
6348223 it has been a fantastic week for him i was there at the stadium and spent time with him before he got called out getting him ready for the race
6348224 its a great achievement thats what we were aiming to do winning both events was fantastic he is something special
6348225 he is also a really great guy a very down to earth guy he is very popular and he is a good example for other kids
6348226 when i met usain it was when he won the junior world championships at just 15
6348227 he was offered lots of things at that stage to study in the us or go professional and he chose to go professional
6348228 il faut positiver je courrai plus vite lann e prochaine et je serai aussi plus attentif la prochaine fois

6348232 frank it became clear that when you were asked about why so many ceos do not have the confidence there is an obvious reason no one discussed it used to be that you wanted a leader who knew it all and they had to pretend when they didnt know it all today we need ceos with a confidence that makes room for wisdom where he can find it in the relationships he brings with him to make that team that delivers confidence lies not just in faith in yourself but in your team each with the confidence to bring their treasured skills to the mix needed to invent the future frank what suddenly impresses me most about you my friend is something that is now obvious you are a treasure to have on a team youre an encourager an optimist a visionary that listens you make other leaders better how did you get all these great positions you earned it by making every team better for having you you make us better at our gold coast mastermind group you are the encourager the mirror that lets the light of others shine brighter you are the greatest like all of us youve confessed that you struggle with confidence may i suggest you expand your definition to include the people and memories that reside within you and in your expanded and powerful network there is no one richer i am better for knowing you
6348233 i want you to know that you are my reward ive been working hard to get out from under a pile of work and you are my payoff for making good progress
6348234 der adler zeigt ein normales verhalten wenn er seinen horst verteidigt
6348235 we hope they patients get better but we dont make any promises
6348236 weve made some important discoveries were almost certain that weve unearthed the capital of dacia malvensis something archaeologists were searching to find for hundred of years
6348237 were waiting for a confirmation that it really is malva our experts from the university of craiova are currently analyzing an inscription weve found it is the first time an inscription bears the name of this roman city
6348238 it was important to make sure my future beyond next year was sorted out as soon as possible especially now that i have a young family said kaufusi who is originally from bundaberg in north queensland
6348239 when the cowboys showed an interest it made sense that i signed with them considering im from queensland and its a little bit closer to home
6348240 while theyve struggled a bit this year the cowboys have some great players and with a bit of luck i can enjoy as much success there as i have in melbourne
6348241 the goal should not be to see how much money you can raise from stuggling families in south jersey
6348242 but there needs to be money available to be sure the bridges are in safe condition
6348243 its never popular to vote on a toll increase but it is my conclusion that it is the appropriate thing to do
6348244 it is our responsibility to make sure these bridges are operational and safe the public can be assured that 100 percent of the money will go into these structures
6348245 the drpa is a public authority run on public money and should give credence to public input
6348246 the public must be involved and not ignored before any future increases are implemented
6348247 older people dont like anything changed we dont like the modern stuff
6348248 there are problems with e zpass why would they insist on us using that
6348249 i would view the power i would inherit from president bush as a ceiling not a floor
6348250 with musharraf out its not clear whether or not the open door jewish organisational leaders have had in islamabad is in danger of slamming shut
6348251 its a big plus for the jewish people to have an opening to the worlds only nuclear armed muslim country
6348252 i hope the idea of being open to american jews doesnt get thrown out with musharraf
6348253 i know everybody wants to talk about musharraf the individual who was at the centre of the stage for the past few years and everyone wonders what happens next
6348254 our reason for having initiated the contact and his reason doesnt change with the new administration for moderate muslim leaders around the world which includes pakistan they want to engage america they want to engage the west they want to have a dialogue with members of other faiths that doesnt falter with musharraf leaving
6348255 it will be a bad day for the democracy and country if judges are not reinstated
6348256 i or anyone else in my party are not the presidential candidate

6348265 i think that was something the press elaborated on that didnt happen he didnt turn i shot him in the back
6348266 i just saw his face and it seemed like it all came together the solution to my problem of being confused and feeling like a nobody
6348267 and i said wouldnt it be something if i killed this individual i would become famous i would be something other than a nobody and that was my reasoning at the time
6348268 i perceived him at the time and wrongly judged him to be a phony here he is at this ritzy building and he had been singing of love and other things at that time it angered me
6348269 i love horses ive learned from them just watch how a horse walks it does it without self consciousness
6348270 ive seen so much so much human self consciousness since an early age in this business of acting in truth actors are possibly the most self conscious people on earth
6348271 but watching horses and riding horses ive learned a lot about nature about being natural once you master a horse but it also masters you you gain more confidence in yourself
6348272 a horse is after all a pretty large animal when you can mount it and move it and move along with it that is a hard won and very real accomplishment
6348273 it involves posture and coordination respect for the animal also timing and esteem for yourself cooperation and a flow and a rhythm thats rather zen like
6348274 the issue should be solved by having talks rather than by getting engaged in violent protests i appeal on behalf of all muslims in india that whatever measures are necessary to restore peace and stability in the region should be taken
6348275 nothing of the sort should happen that the wishes of the people of jammu and kashmir should be sacrificed such a medium should be adopted which leaves the people of both regions satisfied said abdullah

6348286 the data speaks for itself it took a good three years for the industry to recover from the downturn in 2001 when it had a 5 drop in capacity and a 7 drop in flights steady annual growth since 2002 looks set to plummet in the fourth quarter this year with an unprecedented global decline of 7
6348287 commercial aviation marches in lock step with the global economy closely reflecting growth and declines in gdp with on average a steady 3 4 growth year over year
6348288 in the last 10 years this steady growth has been interrupted twice first by the meltdown of the global economy in 2001 following the burst of the internet bubble which was compounded by a year of crises with the traumatic events of 9 11 the gulf war and the sars epidemic within asia and second on the immediate horizon by the extraordinary impact that the rising cost of oil is having on the global economy
6348289 from oags statistics it looks quite possible that we may be facing a far more severe global downturn than we have experienced before the industrys resilience will be pushed to its limits in the coming months with carriers airports and passengers alike all waiting and watching for a glimmer of light at the end of the tunnel
6348290 i wish i would have followed my instincts earlier in my career rather than looking for others approval while its easy for people to be their greatest critics it took me years to become my own best advocate
6348291 in no way did i go home going well we didnt have the two guys i went home going well we should have made more plays our team was interrupted were just excited to have the opportunity to fight for the championship i dont want to give in to any self fulfilling prophecy it can only affect you negatively if you start thinking about all the bad breaks and the bad luck weve had the woe is me sets in and youre setting yourself up for a lack of growth

6348299 i thought it was a bit harsh to send the youngster off in the circumstances as the match was a friendly
6348300 the first challenge was enthusiasm thats all and no one was hurt but the referee has made a decision and we have to live with that
6348301 i am just disappointed for the boy because he did extremely well he will remember what happened for the rest of his life
6348302 on the one hand he was delighted to make his senior debut but on the other hand he is hugely disappointed with the decision
6348303 but that is part of being a professional player ryan has an old head on young shoulders so he will deal with this very quickly
6348304 david is fine he has no problem with what happened the keeper made a very good save
6348305 he has promised me after what happened tonight he wont miss in the world cup campaign and that is good enough for me
6348306 there were a lot of very good performances and it shows the group is getting stronger
6348307 the game was a great exercise and a blueprint of what we are looking for away from home
6348308 i dont know i heard we are workin that night let me call you back in an hour to see if we are
6348309 awww so he gits to go on a vacation with his family while his band is sittin at the house huh yall aint hardly worked all summer and he been constantly workin wit everybody that was true you sittin around here talkin about you not gonna go see your family that you aint seen in years and you gittin ready to turn down some work bein laid in yo lap cause you got integrity cause you tryin to keep yo word

6348316 a talented guy pro bowler super bowl champ definitely has the accolades so its definitely gonna be a great competition
6348317 they have a lot of threats and this is gonna be a very competitive game
6348318 i try to keep all quarterbacks who are behind me healthy
6348319 but obviously you want to keep that guy healthy as well
6348320 my whole goal is to make sure that i execute my assignments to the best of my abilities and that means blocking my guy or creating holes or creating pass protection so my role is to make sure that goes smoothly as possible
6348321 if that means giving more time to the quarterback or giving better holes to the running back then thats how i kinda grade myself
6348322 i think we do have a good chemistry but i think the real tell tale sign of that will be seen throughout each game
6348323 he got the guys out of curfew tuesday night because he could answer a question on what our teams core values trust communicate focus finish were i thought i had him i dont know how he pulled that one out room exploded we did a modified name game and he was able to name the number i asked for so he was playing for the group and he won what did he win hour off the meeting and no curfew
6348324 its still hard to believe its a cool deal hes one of the best ever the way hes down to earth and the way he communicates with you you can see why hes successful im just trying to pick up stuff from him while we have him

6348332 having plax and toomer over there i have to take advantage of having those guys around so i can learn from them
6348333 hopefully theyll be stronger and ready to come right back today
6348334 hopefully those guys will get back soon where we get good practice
6348335 for now the young guys and the new guys who are out there are playing well

6348361 i was interested to see what it was because ive worked with a team of people involved in monitoring and forecasting aphids those of greenfly and their relatives in this country
6348362 i looked at it with my team and we thought we could identify it down to the level of genus but we had no idea what the species was
6348363 he discovered that it was something that hadnt been described before
6348364 its not uncommon to find insects in amber but im not sure that one has turned up on ebay that has been undiscovered before
6348365 its a rather unusual route to come by a new species
6348366 ah well just run some cloud management software on a bunch of machines
6348367 this years superb results reflect the hard work commitment and dedication of our students we are delighted for them and their achievements are thoroughly deserved
6348368 our accelerated entry policy has also continued to be outstandingly successful with 76 of the year 10 students who took selected gcses in one year and one year early achieving a and a grade passes and 97 of all passes at a c we are very proud of them
6348369 we are delighted with this years results which confirm the high standards we have been achieving at theale green in recent years
6348370 the results are a real tribute to the commitment and hard work of students and teachers
6348371 theyve got a very good approach they dont try to do too much and stay behind the ball you see them taking the ball to the opposite field with a nice level swing its hard to teach in kids that young
6348372 i was looking for something over the plate i had two strikes on me and he got a pretty good changeup he broke my bat later in the game
6348373 he wanted me to chase the changeup i got one 1 2 and i took it and he came back with a fastball and i was able to punch it up the middle
6348374 it comes down to every time we get up there we want to have a quality at bat
6348375 he has been cleared to play baseball but at this point its getting in baseball shape well see how it goes
6348376 that was awesome being a part of that a standing o
6348377 mike has evolved into one of the bright young pitching stars in the national league no question
6348378 hes very impressive from where he came early in the season we were questioning whether or not to have him on the staff have him in the rotation
6348379 i just think im not the same guy that early in the year was trying to be so perfect and nibble at the strike zone
6348380 i feel more confident and know that when i throw the ball over the plate and keep it down we have guys behind me that will make plays
6348381 he said to throw a sinker here and well give up a run for two outs
6348382 he had 26 saves last year and as i told you guys were going to have to be looking for guys who maybe arent having the best years and hope a change of scenery will help
6348383 i spoke to him he had a chance to go to another team a major league team but he chose to come with us to the minor leagues for the opportunity to pitch in a pennant race here in september
6348384 mike has evolved into one of the bright young pitching stars of the national league
6348385 these games we have to be able to at least score three four or five runs to help these guys
6348386 the one thing is i dont think we should play passive or let the games come to us
6348387 we need to make the plays early in the games to drive in runs
6348388 we need a win and he is a guy who can help i hope we get the real carl pavano
6348389 we dont care how its done he will be received like anybody else and we will be happy to have him
6348390 i am obliged to protect the lives and dignity of russian citizens no matter where they are located
6348391 this undoubtedly indicates a double standard in russian policy and a determined effort to weaken the separatist regions ties with georgia
6348392 since russia is the legal heir of the soviet union it is obliged to give these people its citizenship
6348393 people had a right to choose some got georgian passports but the larger part of the population got russian ones
6348394 given the sham like nature of the granting of passports in so many cases russias basing its forceful actions on protection of nationals abroad is invalid

6348415 the aestethe is inherently selfish living with the sole concern of what is interesting for him at the moment his life is experimental and relative he will pursue particular pleasure just as long as it is of interest to him when it ceases to be of interest to him it ceases to be of value to him and so it is abandoned
6348416 i am an aesthete an eroticist who has understood the nature and meaning of love who believes in love who knows it from the ground up and only make the private reservation that no love affair should last more than six months at the most and that every erotic relationship should cease as soon as one has had the ultimate enjoyment

6348421 i was looking for some makeup because we were flying back to l a to do the merv griffin show
6348422 i picked some up and said to the clerk do you have any of this in dark then i put it down picked up another one and she was gone
6348423 she fainted i was like hello anybody so i put five quid down and left but yeah she was lying right behind the till
6348424 i felt the band could go with a different direction and not just rely on the tartan pants
6348425 but they said no which destroyed the band in my opinion
6348426 but when you live with someone like that youre literally in the same room with five guys every day and sh happens there were fights and im not talking arguments im talking fists
6348427 i love the fraternity brothers because theyre so young and such a contrasting team
6348428 one takes his time to think things out the other one loves to rush and go at a million miles an hour theres definitely tension between the two of them while theyre making decisions during the race
6348429 they are small we wanted to make sure that there wasnt anything to prevent us from putting that pack underneath the seat in front of us when we got on a plane we didnt want something to happen where we got delayed because of our luggage we thought that would help us go faster
6348430 we did extensive research on what to wear what was lightweight and would help us move the fastest
6348431 i think it was the longest i ever went without wearing a logo on my t shirt if you see me on the street im usually wearing a superman bizarro or batman t shirt on a constant basis but we had to utilize more multi use clothing for the amazing race
6348432 we both tried to do some training along the lines of going down to our little gym but that was pretty much it
6348433 we have an emerging farm so we do a lot of work out there splitting wood and taking care of the horses

6348437 ive never seen it all the way through because i had quite a trauma in the middle where my cartilage snapped
6348438 i know when it happened and i know what i had to do afterwards on torn cartilage we had to stop every minute because my knee grew to such a size we had to get rid of the water and put tight bandages on to continue
6348439 they are working in situ all this week with the choreographer
6348440 if theres real talent exceptional talent you really can spot them from day one its extraordinary you can see it right from class dynamism charisma something more than just doing the steps
6348441 that exceptional person just isnt around we dont give the gold medal every year
6348442 we dont dress up or wear costumes or even talk to the audience its a show about nothing
6348443 its not a high hat its not a shaker its something weird
6348444 you had the email for six weeks you should have it down man
6348445 it has to be part of our dna for this to work
6348446 it is math at times it is like james brown singing on top of algebra its that insane there are all these flowery guitar licks its very unrock and roll to go up there with charts but we require that attention to detail this is classical music to me this album will be played in 50 years will we be playing 50 cent i dont think so
6348447 i listened ad nauseam and pretty much learned this whole record when it first came out
6348448 i was playing at blues on bellair and one night prince showed up and jammed with us
6348449 it was around the time he married chicky baby from toronto and moved up here wed started a funk jam and he took it everywhere id offered him my guitar but he said i want to jam with you and used someone elses guitar it was total validation for me
6348450 the most challenging aspect is getting all the parts verbatim and knowing everyone elses parts ill be channelling prince as much as possible
6348451 i spoke to him on the phone and knew right away that he understood this music and loved music
6348452 he had an attitude miles davis said you can tell how a guys going to play by the way he takes his horn out of the case and i respect that comment
6348453 were like an orchestra stepping on stage to play bach
6348454 everybodys in both i think itll be great for the audience to watch actors switch to diverse roles and i think thats part of the pleasure of watching this double bill with this cast
6348455 theyre both such ensemble pieces that there really arent any small parts
6348456 so theyre both really challenging for the cast to make the switch and to go into the two different worlds they cast certainly realized early on the kind of demand they were in for
6348457 somewhere down the line somebody had the bright idea to put these two hound and black comedy together it makes an interesting double bill
6348458 the challenge for the director is to create clarity and precision you really feel like an orchestra leader in many ways because both playwrights have given you such a clear structure to work from that they both feel like pieces of music its not unlike learning a piece of music
6348459 when the lights are bright on stage its as if its dark for the actors if you dont know whats going on its a little odd
6348460 its a really outstanding play that celebrates life its a very funny very sexy love story
6348461 thats whats totally crazy i dont know if im ready to understand what the shows done for me

6348481 ive been beaten up in costume by rickshaw drivers and hot dog vendors who want my spot on the street ive had to share my performances with the odd drunk on a bench nearby ive been robbed ive been kicked and knocked off my pedestal stones have been thrown at me by people who want to know if im really a robot
6348482 we reach the most diverse audience on the planet in britain 90 per cent of arts funding goes to support six or seven national companies to which 10 per cent of the population the wealthy has access our audience is black white rich poor young aged healthy and handicapped
6348483 besides were our own bosses and have complete artistic freedom thats worth more than fame what stops us from accepting invitations to join major circus companies is the fear that wed lose the energy and imagination to create imagination is key to our survival
6348484 its never boring and youre constantly being tested the idea is to make people stop what theyre doing and pay attention the performance grows organically youre always updating always changing i also love the freedom and self sufficiency of the buskers life you dont find that in any other performance medium
6348485 north america because people there embrace the circus culture and live performance and theyre used to tipping in the u k theyll pay if you make them laugh in australia where tipping isnt a common practice you have to put on an exhibition of great skill before theyll part with money you can earn a lot in japan but it costs so much to live there its almost not worthwhile canadians are generous and kind
6348486 sophie and i learned fire spinning around the same time but she was in india and i was in perth australia when i was very young i loved the ninja turtles and their feats of physical magic i saw a fire spinner whod performed at the byron bay busker festival and i thought to myself if she can do it so can i thats how i started
6348487 i started busking on canada day 1999 before that growing up in toronto i watched second city and after high school i took to improv and got a degree in theatre arts studying russian clowning and developing a character that eventually became tallulah when i moved to vancouver i saw lots of street theatre on granville island and i knew thats what i wanted to do
6348488 ive been a performance artist for 25 years ive developed 64 characters for 60 different acts im also a mask maker a dancer a clothes designer an actor a composer of film and tv music i make musical instruments drums and rainsticks out of non recyclable materials about half my time is taken up with silver elvis performances which started 10 years ago after i had a suit made out of holographic material that made me look like an elvis robot in the second week of street performing at the queen st entrance to the bay i was booked on a cross canada tour of busker festivals 279 performances in two and a half months
6348489 you learn not to go to the wrong places or you dont eat
6348490 dont fly budget airlines if you have more than one piece of carry on luggage i have a 25 kilogram suitcase for my props and costumes and a smaller bag for personal items you keep it as light as you can
6348491 people assume our natural working environment is among beggars and street sweepers but busking is a noble profession the second oldest in the world with a long history going back to the middle ages when travelling from one place to another and performing for passers by was the only way artists could survive
6348492 its not an isolated life thats another misconception i have friends all over the world were like family were well taken care of when we perform at sponsored festivals we stay in nice hotels we get personal drivers were treated like stars we get to put all my energy into the performance
6348493 ive been filming my performances for quite some time collecting footage for a mockumentary about what i do
6348494 you can teach i suppose ive met 65 year old acrobats who are still working the busker circuit i know comedians magicians jugglers and mimes in their 60s and 70s who have no intention of quitting this is a lifestyle in which you live in the moment and make use of everything on the street you work with what you can make work and theres no end to it because we love what we do

6348499 according to a report published in the semi official chinese news portal china
6348500 angry netizens internet users are rallying together to denounce apple in offering songs for tibet for purchase they have also expressed a wish to ban the albums singers and producers most notably sting john mayer and dave matthews from entering china
6348501 bare laura og barney hunden er de eneste som st tter meg
6348502 george w bushs presidency appears headed for colossal historical disgrace
6348503 the guys who have played well so far are mainly the younger players and not the old hands
6348504 im trying to get into the heads of the more experienced players
6348505 im going to make it clear that if i cant win matches with the experienced players in the team id rather lose with inexperienced guys
6348506 if their sell by dates have come and gone ill have to act accordingly weve had hard words and now we need to see if we can turn it around
6348507 we can turn it around but what concerns me is that the guys are not able to keep their performances at a high level
6348508 a part of the worlds freedom is at stake here this is where the fight against terrorism is being waged
6348509 al qaida is on the run it is hiding it doesnt have the luxury of free movement
6348510 also the other militant organizations who were having a field day in the area have been restricted there is a great effect on the border crossings which were being done freely

6348518 it were fair and rich kids had to go to war too
6348519 worship me or suffer the why do the christians say that christianity is about love when in fact all the preach is fear who found this interesting
6348520 if you look at the split between male and female medals its more out of synch than any other sport
6348521 if you look at someone like victoria pendleton theres only one medal available for her which seems a bit unfair
6348522 it should change for london hopefully i know the guys who run the whole programme and we are in constant dialogue not only about the whole programme track world cup development of the sport at grass roots level
6348523 you could argue that the quality of the female field drops off exponentially or you could argue that the quantity of medals available would increase the quality of the field if you have only one place available to women sprinters its not going to encourage world class sprinters into the sport
6348524 wenn man bigtable nutzt nutzt man das wozu diese plattform besonders gut geeignet ist will man seine technik dann zu einem anderen anbieter verlagern funktioniert das aber nicht
6348525 jede kleine firma im plattformgesch ft braucht diesen aspekt weil es das risiko f r die kunden reduziert
6348526 the main reason why theres this rush of activity is to lead to the establishment of a consortium and for people to be selected to be part of the consortium
6348527 one of the factors the courts look at is first to file
6348528 if youre joe blow and you file quickly and theres some serious players in the commenced actions they may make you part of the consortium sort of buy you off
6348529 the majority of the party thinks that asif zardari should be president
6348530 but of course we then have no choice but to sit in the opposition
6348531 our central epidemiologist looked at trends and we finally nailed it down and found it seems to be in some nursing homes and packaged meat products
6348532 is the organism they found in the production line the same one we are waiting to find out it is listeria we know that
6348533 post sars all our health units are linked up in live time
6348534 here we have what seven or eight cases in a month that would catch someones attention
6348535 we anticipate hearing of more cases with this same strain as there is a rather long incubation period with listeria
6348536 laboratories when they get samples of e coli or salmonella or listeria they input it into the system and it matches them up
6348537 food gets distributed across the country quickly using the system speeds up the process
6348538 most bacteria that cause human disease like to grow in warm temperatures but listeria tends to prefer cooler temperatures
6348539 with listeria it sometimes can be hard to sort out what the source is it requires a lot of epidemiological work it is not always obvious because there are so many potential sources and people dont have a good recollection of what they ingested
6348540 a young person today is relatively more comfortable talking to a parent talking to a public health nurse talking to a doctor about their sexual and reproductive health
6348541 youth have become progressively more knowledgeable about sexuality and as a result they are far more reflective in terms of making decisions about their sexual behaviour
6348542 that is why we see fewer kids deciding to be sexually active
6348543 we believe that when you talk to young people about sex and sexuality it delays their first sexual encounter
6348544 i think were going to have to do something theres no doubt about that but what exactly were going to do were not sure yet we prefer to wait for all the information to come in
6348545 armed with that information im prepared to do whatever it takes to protect public safety there are a variety of options that might flow from that and im not going to limit myself i think thats our responsibility in government
6348546 its got to be safety that prevails and thats what well look at
6348547 the government is accountable its important when youre regulating public safety that it be done through legislative authority
6348548 im not sure the self regulating model which is what it essentially is is appropriate
6348549 the governments actions or inaction on these issues is sending a disturbing message to ontarians that their government is unwilling or unable to respond effectively to significant issues
6348550 we need to see what the status of these inspections is and what issues if any emerge out of this
6348551 we at tssa are extremely confident in our safety record and our ability to deliver on that huge responsibility thats been given to us
6348552 its dear to my heart ive been dreaming about this for years
6348553 anyone who wants to cast aspersions on our drug testing program i can say just one thing they can go to hell
6348554 ive raced with him four times this year and ive never seen him definitely pushing the tape before
6348555 that was the best record still out there and he wanted it hes a phenom thats what we call a phenom im just happy to be a part of history
6348556 ive written history it means a lot to me it means a lot to jamaica i know everybodys out dancing in the street
6348557 i dont compare myself to michael johnson im trying to be just me
6348558 the 100 is a product of me not wanting to run the 400
6348559 he is a mentor he is a coach he is a second father to me
6348560 when i first heard about the possibility of being allowed to protest i was very happy my issue could be resolved but it turned out all to be cheating i feel stuck in my heart
6348561 what the two old ladies did is nowhere near that
6348562 we are a communist society with the people the leaders and owners but basic citizens rights cannot even be realized today how sad it is
6348563 the way things are is the opposite of the people oriented ideology of the country when it was founded
6348564 our second priority will be getting repaid by sunrise propane we will work on that through appropriate legal channels
6348565 could the city be on the hook in the end yes of course thats possible
6348566 but the important thing was to get the asbestos cleaned up so the neighbourhood was safe
6348567 our planning staff believe we may have some ways to regulate hazardous sites a little bit better
6348568 as a father you have to be with your daughter when shes turning 13
6348569 i think its very important for fathers to be with their family i think torontonians understand that
6348570 for a woman who just lost her partner she said family is important
6348571 so he returned to his family for what is a very important birthday in a young womans life
6348572 we do have another case right now under investigation but we cant confirm its linked to the provincial outbreak
6348573 the general information we have received is this production line as far as we know doesnt do the little packages you get at the local grocery store
6348574 these products have been distributed nationally primarily to food service institutions such as restaurants hospitals and nursing homes
6348575 these products may also be sold at retail and deli counters
6348576 we want to be extra extra sure that were not selling recalled products
6348577 its not like salmonella most people have never heard about it
6348578 he was a loyal moderate party man who did his best to pull things together after the cultural revolution
6348579 but hua lacked both the vision and the courage that deng showed
6348580 i was told that he gave identical notes to other top leaders
6348581 this meant that a clean break could not be made with the bad old days of the cultural revolution
6348582 in early october of that year came the happy day when i heard jiang qiangs dulcet tones
6348583 coming apparently from a cell right across the little courtyard from mine
6348584 i knew that if she was in i was on my way out
6348585 mir tut es aufrichtig leid dass wir die zusammenarbeit mit der universit t witten herdecke nicht fortsetzen k nnen

6348588 we have been informed by the hong kong authorities that mr gadd was denied entry to hong kong and has returned to bangkok mr gadd was in contact with us seeking consular assistance
6348589 this clearly illustrates why its so important to have binding agreements between countries which will prevent sex offenders hopping from one place to another and possibly going underground where they will pose a serious threat to children
6348590 offenders like glitter can and should be chaperoned while being deported back to the uk where they can be properly monitored it is disappointing this latest development was not anticipated and proper arrangements put in place to make this work
6348591 this case is important because it highlights how easy it is for uk offenders to move around freely when they are overseas even those who pose a high risk to children
6348592 die civ versicherungen sind mit einem exzellenten neugesch ft in das jahr 2008 gestartet trotz langer unsicherheiten wegen des neuen aktion rs hat der citibank vertrieb sehr gute leistungen im versicherungsverkauf erbracht ich bin froh dass wir mit dem neuen aktion r cr dit mutuel das gesch ftsmodell beibehalten werden und bin zuversichtlich dass wir unseren erfolgreichen weg mit unserem bankpartner fortsetzen werden

6348595 the calf was in much worse condition than they originally thought and the injuries were a lot worse than they thought as well probably from a shark attack
6348596 profit taking off recent gains and the fact commodity prices are edging higher once more is ensuring that the dollar retreats further from the highs it saw earlier in the week
6348597 surprisingly oil has edged back above 116 a barrel despite yesterdays far bigger than expected build in crude inventory whilst gold is also back above 800 an ounce again adding to pressure on the dollar
6348598 a well placed official in the russian ministry of defense
6348599 to freeze all military cooperation with nato and allied countries
6348600 it is our understanding that other nato countries will receive similar notes
6348601 if this indeed is the case it would be unfortunate we need to work with russia on a range of security issues but we are obviously very concerned about russian behavior in georgia
6348602 it is a recipe for disaster when you mix them together you have a cocktail for a terrorist attack
6348603 what is rare is a manual which provides the directions of how to use this knowledge effectively in a coordinated manner to have a real impact
6348604 we aim to be the most competitive marketplace online and this new incredibly low pricing helps us achieve that goal
6348605 a 35 cent listing fee virtually eliminates the upfront cost for sellers to put more of their great inventory on ebay and creates more opportunity than ever for sellers to build successful businesses
6348606 today items paid with cheque or money order are 80 per cent more likely to result in an item not received than those paid with credit card or paypal
6348607 also buyers who pay with check or money order are 50 peer cent more likely to leave negative feedback than those who pay with electronic methods so starting in late october 2008 we are moving to 100 per cent electronic payments credit cards propay or paypal
6348608 the web has moved on and ebay is stuck in still waters
6348609 the main challenge ebay faces is that it is becoming easier and easier to find things to buy on the web simply by searching for what you want on google during the early days of the web people needed a few big ecommerce sites they could trust and that could organize everything that was for sale online that need was filled by amazon and ebay
6348610 partly that is because ebay has done such a good job creating a semi professional class of online sellers that it is harder and harder to actually find bargains there
6348611 now ebay is going to try to take the competition to amazon
6348612 i think its a big mistake they claim their reason for changing the focus to fixed price sales is that that sector of their site has grown more than the auction sales growth in the last quarter auction sales growth has slowed but is still growing its all about how much money they can make
6348613 amazon doesnt favour its buyers over its sellers by a margin of 2000 1 the way ebay does
6348614 amazon sellers are not going to start selling on ebay its too expensive and ebay favours the buyers over sellers and so ebay can forget about luring amazon sellers away from amazon
6348615 i have not had one non paying bidder nor have i had any checks bounce
6348616 ebay is lying when they say they are doing this for the good of the buyers they are doing it to increase their bottom line pure and simple
6348617 to steal ideas from one person is plagiarism to steal from many is research
6348618 most us consumers are happy with dvds according to a recent study by abi research and dont believe blu ray provides as big of a quality jump as dvds did over vhs tapes

6348620 to steal ideas from one person is plagiarism to steal from many is research
6348621 never let the facts get in the way of a good rant
6348622 the majority of the party thinks that asif zardari should be president
6348623 my goal was to continue to work and not let them tell me rockys going to come back faster
6348624 that just wasnt going to happen to me after working hard and seeing how my knee was feeling out here i knew i could get back
6348625 it think its a real tribute to them and any player thats had to go through a severe injury the long road back way back in february when they were trying to motivate each other i think it was hard to visualize what it will be like when you finally do get back and now theyre realizing it
6348626 but just us having the same injuries we were out there trying to work hard compete against each other and so far so good
6348627 as a corner i think the sleeve will hold me back
6348628 if its going to swell up its going to swell up with or without the sleeve the sleeve aint going to stop somebody from hitting me im just going to go out there like ive never had anything wrong
6348629 i was starting to have a really good season last year then came the injury now im back so i need to have a really good year im anxious to go out there and show the real carlos
6348630 i was khary for a little minute but you guys got me

6348643 the most important thing is youve got to be happy where you are last year i wasnt happy at all
6348644 it seems if youre in a situation you dont like its not that you dont go out and try but a lot of times the results arent as good
6348645 we had a lot of good at bats up and down the lineup a lot of clutch hitting todd was working real hard it was a nice cushion to give him it wasnt an easy game for him
6348646 he knows most importantly he can go out there every single day and get the job done unfortunately its a game of failure sometimes you let that get in your head from what i saw last year some of the failure started getting to him now he knows that it doesnt matter if he fails or has a great start hell bounce back next time out
6348647 there were a lot of things going through my mind
6348648 can i go to second i actually hit the ball then when i was in the process of going down it was kind of a slow motion effect im just glad i got back to first it was crazy

6348671 sponges have one of the most ancient lineages and don t have nerve cells
6348672 so we are pretty confident it was after the sponges split from trunk of the tree of life and sponges went one way and animals developed from the other that nerves started to form
6348673 what we found in sponges though were the building blocks for nerves something we never expected to find
6348674 what we have done is try to find the molecular building blocks of nerves or what may be called the nerve s ancestor the proto neuron
6348675 we found sets of these genes in sponges when we really didn t expect it
6348676 but what was really cool is we took some of these genes and expressed them in frog and flies and the sponge gene became functional the sponge gene directed the formation of nerves in these more complex animals
6348677 if we increase the tax band then more people will pay zero tax im thinking on a suggestion of a person earning up to rm35 000 a year dont have to pay any tax
6348678 this will provide immediate purchasing power to the people especially the lower income group
6348679 i think a lot of soldiers are bored i really do but some are happy there s not a lot of kinetic operations going on and some are happy they get to go out and talk to people on the street and see that we re making things better for them
6348680 long term threat to the security of iraq and its people
6348681 thats what i think their challenge is and they seem to continue to have met it over the years
6348682 the real issue is whether or not were in a period where these floods are occurring more frequently or not
6348683 one of the most beautiful magnificent places in the world and should be seen by everyone
6348684 it really truly is among the most beautiful places on earth
6348685 when you get down by havasu falls its as though kodak made an outdoor movie set
6348686 it also means its our turn to be as corrupt and irresponsible to the democratic process as their white predecessors have been

6348688 mariners navigating in a westerly direction across breydon water area advised to leave posts seven to 11 at least 10m starboard and to proceed with caution
6348689 mariners navigating in the opposite direction towards breydon bridge are advised to keep well over towards the red posts where there is ample water in order to give room to vessels navigating in the opposite direction
6348690 this year weve looked at the figures weve got and its been reported that a couple of people have got stuck on it and three or four people have touched it as theyve gone past
6348691 the port have been dealing with it and are still dealing with it but we havent found it a major problem
6348692 the handover was made within the past two days in line with cooperation between the two brotherly countries and under the security cooperation agreement
6348693 i thought wow if this thing was turned loose and went a little bit that way this could actually be amazing and people could really get into it
6348694 i grew up in the hood in the south in baton rouge and there were crews around all the time dancing so i wanted to try to expose america to that
6348695 we began this because we just felt that the hip hop dance community was not being exposed to a larger audience
6348696 when you look up on the stage you see so many backgrounds
6348697 even though were getting exposed to the dance culture were also watching personal stories
6348698 you want to also look at their stories who are they where are they from
6348699 thats one of the hardest things when youre so tight like that and you have to separate being friends from the competition its just really heartbreaking to do
6348700 last season there were a number of crews who stood on the sidelines watching saying is this for real
6348701 opening up business avenues and a commercialization that dancers have never had before
6348702 expand their dance classes and travel around the country performing
6348703 what people dont understand is that everything that has entertainment has a little dance behind it
6348704 you got movies commercials tv videos video games all these things have dance
6348705 he was quite interested in computers at home so we started taking him to special classes when he was six
6348706 because he was quite good they suggested he sit the gcse and it just went from there
6348707 i didnt realise i was good at ict until after id done the gcse exam
6348708 it was easier than i thought it was going to be and i feel proud now that ive done it
6348709 with musharraf out its not clear whether or not the open door jewish organisational leaders have had in islamabad is in danger of slamming shut
6348710 its a big plus for the jewish people to have an opening to the worlds only nuclear armed muslim country
6348711 i hope the idea of being open to american jews doesnt get thrown out with musharraf
6348712 i know everybody wants to talk about musharraf the individual who was at the centre of the stage for the past few years and everyone wonders what happens next
6348713 our reason for having initiated the contact and his reason doesnt change with the new administration for moderate muslim leaders around the world which includes pakistan they want to engage america they want to engage the west they want to have a dialogue with members of other faiths that doesnt falter with musharraf leaving
6348714 the issue should be solved by having talks rather than by getting engaged in violent protests i appeal on behalf of all muslims in india that whatever measures are necessary to restore peace and stability in the region should be taken
6348715 nothing of the sort should happen that the wishes of the people of jammu and kashmir should be sacrificed such a medium should be adopted which leaves the people of both regions satisfied said abdullah
6348716 it will be a bad day for the democracy and country if judges are not reinstated

6348720 we are very serious and committed to continue investing in this long term business though we would suffer in the first few years
6348721 due to such co operation he was at the top of al qaedas target list and dodged three assassination attempts
6348722 we only wish the coalition government that will now have to govern has shown signs that it is up to the job
6348723 his government co operated in the capture of 9 11 plotters ramzi binalshibh and khalid sheikh mohammed among others and he put dr aq khan a scientist involved in nuclear proliferation under house arrest he defused tensions with india and appears to have cut off terror infiltration routes across kashmir due to such co operation musharraf was at the top of al qaedas target list and dodged three assassination attempts
6348724 however like other military men who take power in coups he was a clumsy politician he struck a deal in 2006 with tribal chiefs along the border with afghanistan creating a sanctuary for the taliban which is now resurgent and threatening both countries and he turned a blind eye to seminaries that were breeding grounds for jihadists
6348725 he also misjudged pakistans public mood inflaming the opposition last year with his decision to fire the countrys highest ranking judge jailing lawyers and civic leaders and declaring martial law those decisions squandered whatever legitimacy the general had built in restoring order after the last chaotic democratic government

6348824 microsoft is under tremendous market pressure from customers to enable interoperability with open source solutions their partnership with novell enables them to accomplish that within the framework of what microsoft views as appropriate intellectual property practices
6348825 if you look at the two fastest server operating systems youll see windows and linux microsoft figures there is going to be so much linux in use it had better get involved
6348826 theres a lot of linux out there much more than microsoft generally signals publicly and their customers are using it so its important that microsoft have a good interoperability story on that front linking up with a linux vendor is a good way to do that
6348827 novell is a relatively weak player in the linux market and therefore more malleable they also have a good partner channel and partners tend to be more opportunistic than vendors themselves so microsoft could realize some incidental sales through that channel
6348828 time has indicated that this partnership is good for both companies
6348829 novell has received a healthy boost in its linux revenue thanks in large part to the microsoft suse linux subscriptions both companies have leveraged the linux windows harmony story to gain significant new customers microsoft has managed to attach its name and potentially software to enterprise linux adoption
6348830 microsoft gains more indirectly as it enables them to pursue interoperability within their ip framework approach overall however microsoft gains more since this helps them shore up their formidable revenue base which dwarfs novells
6348831 customers win two ways for those that work with novell this is good since technical interoperability and direct partnership help them use novell better other open source companies customers also benefit since much of the work done in collaboration between novell and microsoft also applies to other open source products
6348832 customers are pretty much the reason for this so they do end up winning and not just novell microsoft customers but linux windows and multi os users too
6348833 whats key to this relationship is that to take advantage of it customers must be using or considering microsoft software
6348834 so microsoft learns about some of the challenges that customers face what workloads theyre using linux for and which theyre using microsoft for
6348835 while you can get numbers for the number of servers that go out with linux on them or red hats license revenues a great many customers simply download the product and in many cases install it multiple times

6348857 losing vickerman elsom and lyons is a really really big hole in that waratah forward pack let alone the waratah team
6348858 thats something that really we need to focus on and its an opportunity for other guys to step up so thats a challenge
6348859 the waratahs do need to replace those guys and theres a fine line there youll have some good young talent and its whether or not theyre ready
6348860 the relaxation of being able to look at some other players overseas certainly gives you that option of bringing in maybe some seniority which ushers through the junior guys
6348861 what i saw from slightly arms length but i did spend a bit of time with the tahs this year was a pretty good values system if you like within the team
6348862 theres no substituting that experience but at the same time i think what you will have is younger guys stepping into a group that has a history of the right sort of mentality going into seasons and thats going to be helpful
6348863 i dont think you ever leave a job feeling like its all done youre always looking at whats next and how to improve
6348864 i was offered the job initially for two years to the world cup and i said look what im seeing its going to take three years for discernible change
6348865 on finishing the job my attitude is from now to the end of the year theres still a lot of improvement to be sought and gained but you walk away saying what ive promised ive hopefully delivered
6348866 for the senior guys and the young guys to experience the hype of still being in the hunt at this time of year is fantastic
6348867 theres a great vibrancy around the club all weve got to do is win these last two games and hope some results go our way
6348868 we played really well against them early on in the year but theyve improved in terms of contested ball possession and clearance work which is what were good at so that will be a good challenge
6348869 i still think theyre a quality side i dont think where they are on the ladder is really what theyre capable of
6348870 theyve got some good players and i think their second half of the year theyve been in games where theyve only lost by a couple of kicks or that sort of thing
6348871 i love big challenges were both two totally different players hes got the height and i try to use my speed and agility around the ground

6348884 dons comments at the time raised questions and we sought clarification as to what he meant by unfair after the hearing
6348885 he said he regretted the choice of words and as much as he may disagree with the decision he did not intend any suggestion of bias or lack of procedure by the panel the judiciary chairman or the judiciary staff
6348886 he has apologised if that suggestion has been taken and his apology has been forwarded to the judiciary
6348887 their role is to be as consistent as they possibly can and i know they spend hours and hours each week reviewing incidents and comparing them to previous incidents to try and ensure that they are consistent
6348888 but the fact is each case has its own particular features and no two cases are ever completely alike and then it becomes a matter of judgement
6348889 but you always draw the line at any suggestion theyre being less than professional and honest in the way they carry out their duties

6348898 the anecdotal evidence is mounting severance packages are being negotiated that allow the injured party to claim publicly that theyre leaving of their own free will the temptations of this deal are obvious say youve gone freelance and you avoid the embarrassment of the pink slip you also sound proactive youre no victim of tough economic times youve simply made an alternative lifestyle choice

6348900 some make a beeline and come and see how were going
6348901 they try to get off the subject really when they come over they dont really want to get onto the deep and meaningful
6348902 the work of brotherhood members in america is a kind of grand jihad in eliminating and destroying the western civilization from within and sabotaging its miserable house by their hands and the hands of believers so that it is eliminated and gods religion is made victorious over all other religions

6348934 the fact is that the private system exists and like it or not it is here to stay
6348935 we need to accommodate it in order for the public system to prosper
6348936 we have one of the most costly and least efficient health systems of any industrialized country
6348937 its not for everyone its not all doctors who will go to the private side thats for sure and its not feasible everywhere
6348938 does it make sense in the face of a shortage of operating rooms to ban surgeons who provide 90 per cent of their services in a hospital from performing 5 to 10 per cent of their surgeries in a private clinic
6348939 the use of information and communication technology ict to support integrated healthcare services in elderly homecare is becoming more established in particular ict can enable information exchange knowledge sharing and documentation at the point of care poc the aim of this study was to explore these effects using the old home prototype old home was perceived to contribute in developing horizontal links for communication between individuals who work together independent of geographical distance or organizational affiliation and to contribute to increased work efficiency the prototype was further seen to reduce professional isolation by providing a holistic overview of the care process user centred design and implementation of old home was considered key to facilitating acceptance of organizational changes participation of care professionals not only led to a better understanding of the needs of involved organizations but also increased end users involvement and commitment stimulating them to test and improve the prototype until the final version

6348945 but i know that you want to see the cave dont you ill show you
6348946 its odd standing here in the same area where my ancestors were buried i felt really strange when i had the bones the skull of my great great great grandfather dating back 120 generations in my hands
6348947 i cant describe it the hairs on the back of my neck stood on end it wasnt exactly a nice feeling but it was an incredible experience that i wont ever forget the 3 000 year old bones are so far removed from our lives today and these 120 generations thats so long ago
6348948 we have no idea what happened during this time we dont know what happened to these people
6348949 it is a unique discovery while we were examining the prehistoric bones of the male individuals we found genetic patterns which are unique
6348950 we wanted to find out whether these genetic patterns were still present in the living population of this area so we put an advert in the local paper and we asked people to take part in our project 270 people came forward we were very surprised that so many wanted to help us
6348951 the local residents had to give a sample of saliva we extracted dna from the saliva and looked for the genetic patterns on the y chromosome in the end we found two men who have a very similar genetic pattern to the prehistoric one and that genetic pattern is unique
6348952 i saw the advert in the paper and i thought it was an interesting idea
6348953 they took a sample of saliva using cotton wool buds they put it in a plastic tube and then sealed it the scientists also had their mouths covered to prevent any mixing of the dna samples
6348954 i didnt expect it at all to end up being the direct descendant of the cavemen its amazing especially as on that particular day i had such a dry mouth i thought the dna sample wouldnt work
6348955 your appearance is determined by both parents by the mother and father we were investigating the y chromosome from father to son in our project its a modern phenomenon that we move around in the old days people normally lived and stayed in the same place where they were born
6348956 i definitely think the shape of the head is similar to the caveman but after 3 000 years and 120 generations im sure personalities have changed
6348957 you want it then after all youve said about me what was it you called me moron wasnt it ill show you whos a moron
6348958 oh yes harder faster give it to me you bastard

6348964 our central epidemiologist looked at trends and we finally nailed it down and found it seems to be in some nursing homes and packaged meat products
6348965 is the organism they found in the production line the same one we are waiting to find out it is listeria we know that
6348966 post sars all our health units are linked up in live time
6348967 here we have what seven or eight cases in a month that would catch someones attention
6348968 we anticipate hearing of more cases with this same strain as there is a rather long incubation period with listeria
6348969 laboratories when they get samples of e coli or salmonella or listeria they input it into the system and it matches them up
6348970 food gets distributed across the country quickly using the system speeds up the process
6348971 most bacteria that cause human disease like to grow in warm temperatures but listeria tends to prefer cooler temperatures
6348972 with listeria it sometimes can be hard to sort out what the source is it requires a lot of epidemiological work it is not always obvious because there are so many potential sources and people dont have a good recollection of what they ingested
6348973 microsoft is under tremendous market pressure from customers to enable interoperability with open source solutions their partnership with novell enables them to accomplish that within the framework of what microsoft views as appropriate intellectual property practices
6348974 if you look at the two fastest server operating systems youll see windows and linux microsoft figures there is going to be so much linux in use it had better get involved
6348975 theres a lot of linux out there much more than microsoft generally signals publicly and their customers are using it so its important that microsoft have a good interoperability story on that front linking up with a linux vendor is a good way to do that
6348976 novell is a relatively weak player in the linux market and therefore more malleable they also have a good partner channel and partners tend to be more opportunistic than vendors themselves so microsoft could realize some incidental sales through that channel
6348977 time has indicated that this partnership is good for both companies
6348978 novell has received a healthy boost in its linux revenue thanks in large part to the microsoft suse linux subscriptions both companies have leveraged the linux windows harmony story to gain significant new customers microsoft has managed to attach its name and potentially software to enterprise linux adoption
6348979 microsoft gains more indirectly as it enables them to pursue interoperability within their ip framework approach overall however microsoft gains more since this helps them shore up their formidable revenue base which dwarfs novells
6348980 customers win two ways for those that work with novell this is good since technical interoperability and direct partnership help them use novell better other open source companies customers also benefit since much of the work done in collaboration between novell and microsoft also applies to other open source products
6348981 customers are pretty much the reason for this so they do end up winning and not just novell microsoft customers but linux windows and multi os users too
6348982 whats key to this relationship is that to take advantage of it customers must be using or considering microsoft software
6348983 so microsoft learns about some of the challenges that customers face what workloads theyre using linux for and which theyre using microsoft for
6348984 while you can get numbers for the number of servers that go out with linux on them or red hats license revenues a great many customers simply download the product and in many cases install it multiple times

6348998 i am more bullish than bearish i think the market has too quickly discounted geopolitical risks and was too concerned with demand destruction we should be trending back towards 120 125 a barrel

6349003 while speed fatigue and alcohol are factors in 37 per cent of tasmanian car crashes aamis research shows inattention is the number one reason drivers crash into another vehicle or stationary object
6349004 its easier said than done but when people consider the consequences of what driver inattention and distraction could mean i think people should heed the warning and pay attention to what theyre doing

6349030 i think we are all a little bit disappointed with how we played there were some pluses and some negatives to take away from the game but overall i think the feeling is disappointment
6349031 i think the fans will be disappointed with what they have seen i think there are three or four positives and maybe four or five negatives from the game
6349032 it is down to the manager now to sit down and address it with the players
6349033 on the next trip weve got 10 days away and if we can address it before those two games and thrash things out before the world cup campaign starts we will be okay
6349034 it is not just this game where there have been problems there have been other games and there will be problems in the future that will occur
6349035 we need to sit down and address it and address it very quickly otherwise it stays around the squad the manager will thrash things out and we will get things off our chest
6349036 that will be very private the manager makes the big decisions we can give our opinion but he is the one who makes those big final decisions
6349037 we are still encouraged by what we can do in zagreb against the czechs we wanted to do better than we did but at the same time there will be points to be played for with andorra and croatia
6349038 hopefully we can get off to a good start and win against andorra and take the confidence to croatia we have to go there and stand up and be counted for
6349039 we want to join the olympians and have great success it has made us very proud

6349111 i think theyre going to be very very very tough to beat
6349112 a contest the americans led by only seven points midway through the fourth quarter
6349113 theyve been the most difficult team for us to defend
6349114 theyre a force to be reckoned with they caused us a lot of problems
6349115 and would have been closer if not for missing four easy shots in the half
6349116 in the third quarter we said the first three or four minutes we need to pick it up a little bit defensively and make the extra pass offensively
6349117 it was great except for the elves with 5 oclock shadows
6349118 tits and fatalities aside age of conan sucks flaccid donkey genitals
6349119 will this game be the wow killer will this game gain self awareness attack the blizzard server farm with a targetted nuclear strike then start searching for sarah connor does this game have the potential to learn kung fu
6349120 throughout the course of the day and into this evening congresswoman tubbs jones medical condition declined
6349121 unless we stand to fight and defend against the enemies in our own country poverty and racism we are hypocrites in the eyes of the world
6349122 punched a clock day in and day out one as a skycap the other as a factory worker
6349123 she has a lot of energy shes very bright and shes very effective she also has a big heart and has never forgotten her roots
6349124 we are going to start getting ready for boston college right now
6349125 tonight the coaches are getting together to start game planning for boston college and then we start practicing for boston college tomorrow well have a walk through in the morning and then the fun begins
6349126 thats the best news of camp that we are a really healthy football team right now
6349127 that was our no 1 focus for camp and came through without any injuries our no 2 focus we re ally wanted to emphasize our kicking game during training camp and i love what ive seen from guys like matt rinehart and josh pleasant
6349128 i knew pleasant was going to be good when we recruited him but hes even better than i thought he was
6349129 i wanted to see us become a team that can make things happen in the kicking game during this camp and i think weve done that with those guys
6349130 defensively i like what we are doing and i think our personnel is better than it has ever been we are a little more diverse than we have been in the past offensively quarterback julian edelman is playing his best football since weve been here and weve given him a few more weapons with guys like linebacker turned tight end jameson konz and defensive back turned wide receiver sam kirkland all in all id say we had a very successful camp
6349131 they have very strong skills they are just a lot better than us
6349132 i am from xinjiang province and we dont have volleyball there
6349133 ik geloof dat de speculatie werd gevoed door onze interne codenamen windows server 7 en windows 7 server en hoe we hem publiekelijk zullen noemen windows server 2008 r2
6349134 this is a really deserving group of people who have worked very hard
6349135 they dont have a lot of funds so this has really lifted their spirits
6349136 it is very hard to decide who deserves it most because they all do
6349137 it is a needs based thing and we like to give charity a real hand
6349138 one of the reasons was its language or communication issues rather than a cognitive impairment issue
6349139 one of the problems is that when an older deaf adult is being tested by somebody theyre automatically going to look like theyre demented even though theyre not and theyre going to look like that because of a language issue
6349140 there are a lot of people that think they can interpret because they know a couple signs and you really have to be careful of that
6349141 there are a lot more nuances than if you are just translating from spanish to english
6349142 in fact our findings raise even more troubling concerns for 1 aprotinin has been on the market for three times as long as vioxx yet few comprehensive safety studies have been conducted since approval 2 the life threatening complications with aprotinin found here occurred far more frequently than those with vioxx and 3 far less expensive generic alternatives to aprotinin which are equally effective in limiting bleeding have been available but have been underused
6349143 our findings raise serious concerns regarding the safety of an approved drug intended to limit blood loss in at risk patients undergoing surgery
6349144 in good conscience i could not administer trasylol to this group of patients especially given the availability of safer alternatives
6349145 units of the follow up forces which were earlier brought into the conflict zone are being pulled back now
6349146 credibly and demonstrably privatised federal reserve bank of richmond president jeffrey lacker said this week such a move would signal a capitulation on the part of the us government
6349147 if you have a squirt gun in your pocket you may have to take it out us treasury secretary henry paulson said in july when requesting the power to grant unlimited credit to the companies
6349148 if you have a bazooka in your pocket and people know you have a bazooka you may never have to take it out
6349149 the worst is yet to come in the us kenneth rogoff former chief economist at the international monetary fund and harvard university professor of economics said this week
6349150 i dont think simply having a couple of medium sized banks and a couple of small banks going under is going to do the job
6349151 i stuck it out until 6 a m and then woke my parents
6349152 im not allowed to lift so i cant show my goats but i can watch id rather be here than in a hospital bed
6349153 i was just so thankful i could get to be here
6349154 the fuselage is destroyed the plane burned i have seen a kilometer of charred land and few whole pieces of the fuselage it is all destruction
6349155 we want to be on location there are many questions
6349156 i am a complete foodie luckily i am blessed with good genes
6349157 he tried to explain to her that theyre as much mine as they were hers she kind of dragged him into the middle of all of this
6349158 i am a complete foodie luckily i am blessed with good genes
6349159 i am a complete foodie luckily i am blessed with good genes
6349160 the new playground equipment started going in right after our summer school program was over so i think most of the students will be surprised
6349161 a lot of our students live in the inner city and they dont have an opportunity to experience a nature trail or see a family of deer we hope to make this a space that they can enjoy but also learn from
6349162 when we decided that we would keep the building which was built in 1917 we knew we would have to change things to make it work for our current needs
6349163 our students are not homogeneous they each come with different skill sets and different situations including a growing number of students who are not deaf but hard of hearing
6349164 we wanted to include a sound field system that would allow students who have cochlear implants or are hard of hearing to be able to hear their teachers
6349165 the annual hse budget for audiology services in the southeast has run out mid year and there is no more funding forthcoming for the remainder of 2008
6349166 audiology services have taken on no new clients since june
6349167 and this seems set to continue unless the badly needed extra funding becomes available
6349168 prior to this latest blow the service in the region was already operating well below par with only two audiologists covering the four community care areas in the south east
6349169 realistically to provide an efficient service there needs to be one audiologist allocated for each community care area
6349170 they dont want to go out because they get embarrassed and frustrated when they cant hear people properly they dont want to go to family or social gatherings because they feel stupid and to be honest people treat you like an imbecile when they think you cant understand them
6349171 as regards patients on the routine waiting lists for hearing aids
6349172 the hse is working to address this issue within its resources however in the case of urgent or emergency referrals hearing aids are being provided
6349173 i have been trying to get him an appointment with an audiologist and have not been able to get one then about three weeks ago the audiologist rang me and he said there was no point bringing donnchadh in because he wouldnt be able to get him a hearing aid
6349174 i think his language is dropping and a lot of the time he cant understand what is going on hes a fantastic lip reader but his frustration is just building he is now doing his junior cert hes extremely bright but now were looking at him having to do ordinary level in the exams because he cant follow exactly whats going on in class
6349175 smashed to bits it must have got smashed in the post
6349176 he said there was no money for hearing aids and gave me a complaint form to send off to the hse i left there very down i miss the hearing aid because when im sitting in a room with people i cant hear whats going on the audiologist said he might get me one in a few months
6349177 it makes me very very angry i pity anyone living on their own or children
6349178 if we lived in galway or dublin donnchadh would get his hearing aid its just because were in the southeast
6349179 as regards patients on the routine waiting lists for hearing aids
6349180 die markts ttigung halte ich bei 3500 patentanw lten f r erreicht davon sind wir aber in deutschland noch weit entfernt

6349184 das schulsystem in toronto zeigt uns welche konsequenzen wir angesichts der herausforderungen durch globalisierung migration und demographischen wandel ziehen m ssen
6349185 auch deutschland ist ein einwanderungsland hat aber daraus f r sein bildungssystem noch nicht alle notwendigen lehren gezogen bei uns h ngt der bildungserfolg noch zu sehr an der sozialen und ethnischen herkunft da k nnen wir uns an einem land wie kanada und einer stadt wie toronto orientieren
6349186 wir k nnen vom toronto district school board vor allem lernen dass die grundlage jeder gelingenden integration die wertsch tzung von vielfalt ist
6349187 auch die systematische aus und fortbildung von lehrkr ften um mit der heterogenit t produktiv umzugehen m ssen wir in deutschland vorantreiben
6349188 es ist eine frage der fairness dass lern und lebenschancen in unserem land nicht schicksalhaft durch die herkunft entschieden werden wir brauchen ein bildungs und schulsystem das integration und teilhabe erm glicht und allen kindern faire chancen er ffnet
6349189 als kontinuierlich wachsendes unternehmen sehen wir die professionelle ausbildung unserer k nftigen mitarbeiter als eine unserer kernaufgaben an wichtig ist uns hierbei das ausbildungskonzept flexibel an die anforderungen des marktes und unserer kunden anzupassen dadurch sind unsere auszubildenden f r die allt glichen arbeitsabl ufe gewappnet und wir stellen langfristig die motivation unserer mitarbeiter bei gleichzeitiger hoher kundenzufriedenheit sicher

6349194 well last year we really struggled the only place we can go is up from there
6349195 its one of the more contemporary offenses weve seen it all over the country and it is very successful
6349196 obviously it creates a lot of confusion for defenses to have two or three run threats in the backfield
6349197 it also offers one guy to protect and a receiving option in the backfield
6349198 im hoping optimistic that well be more productive on offense
6349199 instead of concentrating on business growth and innovation we are now turning our heads to efficiencies and cost cutting we are in the process of devising our budgeting for next year and it plans have changed in line with the new business strategy
6349200 keeping the departments morale during tough times is no easy task but communicating the changes is essential
6349201 it is a question of doing different things as opposed to stopping doing anything and telling people that projects may be slightly different to what we had planned originally in the next two years the focus is driving efficiency as much as we can so that we are well positioned to return to growth and innovation when the downturn is over
6349202 the recession represents an opportunity for process rejuvenation while we have yet to see this start in anger we expect a sea of transformation type deals to be signed in vertical markets from public sector to retail and financial services as companies see the downturn as an opportunity to de layer current business practices

6349204 last year barney show got a phenomenal response we had received lots of requests to bring more of such performances to india we are very excited to be back in india with noddy live show this year

6349209 he is working all the time so scarlett wants to hold off until the election is over
6349210 i am a complete foodie luckily i am blessed with good genes
6349211 i think he should show more respect for his competitors and shake hands give a tap on the shoulder to the other ones immediately after the finish and not make gestures like the one he made in the 100 meters
6349212 he might have interpreted that in another way but the way it was perceived was catch me if you can you dont do that but hell learn hes still a young man
6349213 i would love him to show more respect for his competitors thats not the way we perceive being a champion but he will learn in time he should shake hands with his competitors and not ignore them hell learn that sooner or later but hes a great athlete of course
6349214 bolt must be considered now the same way like jesse owens should have been in the 1930s bolt has a bigger edge than owens on his rivals of course owens had the long jump too so you cant compare people if he maintains that in the future bolt will be someone that probably leaves a mark like jesse owens

6349216 who is singing is this a new cover version did you record this
6349217 there are no new singers here i just changed the vocals of the original song a bit with this software

6349222 i think indian stocks are starting to find bottom around that 13 000 14 000 level the big problem for india is inflation which remains in the system and that is prompting speculation of further interest rate increases from reserve bank of india
6349223 to be honest with you i dont know how to explain it
6349224 at first my boyfriend loves kobe then i love him more than my boyfriend
6349225 most important is his faultless performance on the basketball court
6349226 what kobe has given china before this the olympics is a sign of respect as if saying youre good enough so im going to keep coming here he has showed them respect over the last few years and its been reciprocated at a very high level its unbelievable really
6349227 i love yao ming and kobe but i love kobe more
6349228 i began to know kobe when i saw the games of yao ming i havent heard that kobe comes to china at least once a year to do training clinics but i think chinese medicine is good for a player you see yao ming received it and it works well
6349229 the other day it was pouring down raining and there was still a group outside of about 100 kids just waiting chasing the bus in the rain theyre dedicated
6349230 i thought i was famous until i got here with kobe
6349231 were not back in the u s right now were in china he can leave that back in the u s
6349232 youre still a laker and nationally theres always someone who wants you to lose badly in the nba 29 cities probably respect equals boo there here respect equals cheer
6349233 im just a sports junkie so for me to hop around from event to event and see so many great teams this is a once in a lifetime opportunity
6349234 it wasnt fair it was like taking candy from a baby they demolished those poor girls they havent lost in like two years now
6349235 serialnr is force must be a 12 digit nuber e
6349236 every pub has to change their prices and this came in the middle of the change
6349237 i am a complete foodie luckily i am blessed with good genes
6349238 we are shutting the facility for four days to do a comprehensive sanitization essentially dismantle two production lines that may be linked to the bacteria called listeria
6349239 i strongly advise the public especially those at high risk for listeriosis to make sure they avoid consuming these products
6349240 20 of people who get listeria will die from it
6349241 who could have distributed them to someone who say wanted 100 grams of meat
6349242 some construction workers asked for a picture but tom politely said
6349243 they are huge i thought they can be used as a nice shawl or maybe something for halloween
6349244 empty condom packet amp a photo of the tarts knickers
6349245 of course not the montreux convention stands on its own it has been around for almost a century and its a component of the legal foundation of the turkish republic there can be no changes in the montreux convention
6349246 there is absolutely no intention or desire i have ever heard in my government to have any impact on the montreux convention its a fact of international legal life
6349247 well do nothing that would undermine being not in accord with the montreux convention were bound by it we must observe it full stop
6349248 i was surprised by this announcement of a caucasus stability pact by the turkish government
6349249 i hadnt been briefed that that was going to happen we have a partnership with turkey on the caucasus and i presume that well be able to work together very closely now with our allies in turkey since we do have clearly shared interests not to mention values throughout the caucasus with our turkish ally
6349250 i am proud of all that weve done in the past two years
6349251 we saw and tested the movie and we believe a strong movie deserves a strong play date
6349252 gdp per capita in turkey has reached 9 500 but the public workers share remains at 2 150 no one should think we are calm politicians must see the storms and laments behind this silence
6349253 i wish that the pay raise deserved by public workers will be made possible through collective negotiations but the real matter is to proceed to a collective agreement
6349254 fiscal year 2008 amounted to ytl 48 6 billion whereas in 2009 the total was ytl 56 3 billion we try to shape our demands in line with this 16 percent increase we doubt that bureaucrats and politicians will take a clear stance we are thus basing our demands on three alternatives
6349255 the system desired to be financed with warm capital flow
6349256 it is not intelligible for the european union to impose its views on every topic but international labor organization
6349257 the european court of human rights has decisions on granting mass negotiations rights to public workers government must pass laws according to these rulings
6349258 the democratic culture of the government is weak and it seeks refuge in the law kesk deems inappropriate the mockery of public workers by the government and denies surrendering to akp governments will
6349259 recently we discovered that grapefruit and these other fruit juices substantially decrease the oral absorption of certain drugs undergoing intestinal uptake transport
6349260 the concern is loss of benefit of medications essential for the treatment of serious medical conditions
6349261 a key drug uptake transporter called oatp1a2 involved in shuttling drugs from the small intestine to the bloodstream
6349262 blocking this transporter reduces drug absorption and neutralizes their potential benefits
6349263 by contrast drugs whose levels are boosted in the presence of grapefruit juice appear to block an important drug metabolizing enzyme called cyp3a4 that normally breaks down drugs
6349264 im sure well find more and more drugs that are affected this way
6349265 our objective is to increase investment develop trade and encourage the transfer of technology and information to contribute to the development of logistical infrastructure between turkey and african countries
6349266 wir haben f r die bvb fans einiges geplant so werden wir z b bei den heimspielen mit unserem neuen petitbistro snackmobil direkt vor dem stadion unsere leckeren supersnacks und kaffeespezialit ten verkaufen

6349271 testing is going well but the delays have been caused by a difficulty in getting access to the trains
6349272 i cannot believe that trains are running all the time there should be a way to ensure the technology is fitted whether that is done overnight or during maintenance
6349273 if there are issues in getting access to trains virgin trains should have worked out ways to mitigate that beforehand with some good planning perhaps their announcement that onboard wi fi would be available in 2007 was a bit p remature
6349274 i am a complete foodie luckily i am blessed with good genes
6349275 we need to show them there is a price to pay which is a cross border project worth ytl 600 000 we havent signed it and told them why
6349276 we sent them a letter condemning their decision to recognize the so called armenian genocide
6349277 it will be a one day working visit to istanbul for talks on regional issues
6349278 in their pursuit to monopolize the vast resources of sudan foreign influences incite hatred and tarnish the image of the country through false allegations
6349279 most of the people in darfur enjoy peace for over 80 percent life is normal
6349280 we went with a very high ranking group from the african union to negotiate peace but many of the main groups in darfur did not even attend the meeting and instead started setting government buildings on fire
6349281 the latest of their efforts against sudan was the attempt to use international justice against the country
6349282 which is really just an attempt to encourage the rebel groups to continue their destruction in hopes to topple to the regime in khartoum
6349283 the icc is for complimenting national systems not a substitute for them
6349284 will never surrender any of our citizens to be tried outside sudan
6349285 human suffering agitates all no matter which religion ethnicity or language those who suffer belong to everyone needs to do their part to alleviate this pain
6349286 the police did a very good job and foiled a big bomb attack
6349287 he wanted to help get children away from a life of crime and violence
6349288 thats why hes the king of comedy he never lost his soul in chicago
6349289 was having some health issues but he always said to me every morning that he was always good
6349290 he always had time to shake a hand he was always that kid from chicago who wanted to make everybody happy and everybody laugh
6349291 thank you bernie for showing that good people do come from englewood
6349292 i presented to you on aug 11 a document on di lis 1 million deal with akademi ofset in exchange for using his political force nine days have passed and the prime minister is still keeping his silence
6349293 remaining silent is disrespectful to politics parliament and the people no matter who they are names tainted with bribery do not have a place in politics i wish the prime minister protected the retirees as much as he protects di li
6349294 we are delighted to hear some commonsense from the akps media if we are to create a common ground in this country we must build it on honesty we must ensure a dominance of honest practices in politics the prime minister has enormous duties in this process i invite him to do his share
6349295 a thief is a thief no matter if he is from the left or right
6349296 i just saw his face and it seemed like it all came together the solution to my problem of being confused and feeling like a nobody
6349297 turkey extends its condolences to the families of the victims and the government and people of algeria
6349298 despite some problems the two countries have had in the past our relations have been running on the highest levels for the last decade and i think that our meeting today will be fruitful in assessing all issues regarding security
6349299 our daily life here in sinop was much affected by the bird flu this is funny but at the same time quite tragic an ancient species has been destroyed in our city because of a silly phobia
6349300 we have lost the genuine hac kad ns and now he have a cardboard replica of it displayed at the museum
6349301 we humans have been losing one by one the assets of our global village and we have gradually been disturbing the natural balances
6349302 without a detailed research on them it would not be correct to make any comments
6349303 i hope that the initiative will continue i hope cemevis will be granted official status and initiatives on alevism for religious classes will be made i continue to study the subject
6349304 ncirliks use for sending aid to georgia is not an exceptional case
6349305 i allow myself to taste the meat but further than that i do not eat it
6349306 istanbul is not the first place where indian cuisine is being promoted there are lots of indian food festivals all around the world our food and culture are being promoted extensively
6349307 there are 27 districts in india and each has its own food
6349308 the flavors and ingredients are amazing the limits are endless
6349309 even though the spice bazaar offers a lot of good spices i brought some ingredients from delhi myself
6349310 the goal is first to preserve the jewish culture and heritage
6349311 its especially important in turkey because the jews here are still not known well enough
6349312 having a self control mechanism of course will not be harmful
6349313 but we should consider that parliament is a political board and the legal commissions established in parliament have always felt the influence of the politics
6349314 the commission will be able to initiate an investigation on its own and upon applications it receives it will also support activities that aim to enhance a culture of political ethics
6349315 i worked in similar commissions and understood that even though those commissions were composed of the jurists they cannot inspect the parliamentarians
6349316 they cannot abuse their authority and position as parliament members to earn personal benefit in execution of their profession or managing their enterprises they cannot use their parliamentary or cabinet titles
6349317 a parliamentary decision will be needed for a deputy to accept a paid administrative or political duty given by a foreign state or international organization
6349318 a self control mechanism is fine it may at least have a psychological force
6349319 however the real solution may be lessening the deputy immunities in all the spheres expect the political and legislative issues
6349320 a horse is after all a pretty large animal when you can mount it and move it and move along with it that is a hard won and very real accomplishment
6349321 we may not have diplomatic ties but turkey recognizes armenia
6349322 we have vital interests in securing durable peace and stability in the region
6349323 we shall start a signature drive soon currently we are readying for it artists and scientists will also support us kemal akan and aziz as well as a number of archaeologists and professors will say no to the construction of a cement factory in castabala
6349324 although the council for preservation of cultural heritage held three meetings no concrete decisions have come about yet it is not certain by now whether they approve or disapprove of the construction of the cement factory
6349325 i heard coincidently about the cement factory project while i was buying a bread from the bakery then i asked the preservation council and the governor about it
6349326 the factory will be constructed on gravestones it will cause great damage both physically and chemically to the area
6349327 however no news has yet appeared signaling the project has been canceled
6349328 i am looking forward to turning over a new leaf and for new revolutions
6349329 we have been through many chaotic periods and downturns during these seven years and in this period we brought t m to the turkish agenda
6349330 turkeys aggregate export volume was 26 billion when we took office seven years ago
6349331 that figure reached 130 billion in these seven years and we have set a 500 billion worth export volume target for 2023
6349332 we have never allowed t m to be a part of any political party or public organization in this periond
6349333 we firmly believe the same tradition will be followed here and t ms structure will be strengthened more and more
6349334 i am looking forward to paving the way for people to stand as candidates for the presidency the race is now open to everyone
6349335 i have not thought anything but t m during these seven years i may consider everything including politics i will be looking forward to using the knowledge that i gathered here on every possible occasion including politics or academia in terms of the countrys interests
6349336 the candidates want to stoke the speculation with nods hints and winks to get as much visibility as they can for the ultimate announcement
6349337 its highly unlikely any of those choices are going to decisively impact the election
6349338 it could make a difference at the margins but the choice is much more about governing
6349339 the best way of remaining faithful to your comrades is to continue the work to lift your heads to be professional
6349340 i dont have any doubt about that we have to be here
6349341 i tell you in all conscience if it had to be done again i would do it
6349342 the rise in violence is attributed directly to our lack of attention the allies and all of us to the sanctuaries to the training grounds to the financial resources of terrorists and the taliban
6349343 a part of the worlds freedom is at stake here this is where the fight against terrorism is being waged
6349344 we are not here against the afghans we are with the afghans so as not to leave them alone in the face of barbarism
6349345 the terrorists should know that the only way for them is to give themselves up
6349346 as the president of the republic has said many times the state will unflinchingly fight terrorism with a strong determination until its total elimination in our country
6349347 at the same time algeria will not deviate from the path of national reconciliation chosen by the nation and which has already given major progress in the consolidation of security across the national territory
6349348 zu alternativen investments z hlen alle anlageformen die keine traditionellen investments wie beispielsweise festverzinsliche wertpapiere oder aktien renten und sonstige investmentfonds sind
6349349 es handelt sich damit zum einen um l ngst etablierte anlageklassen wie immobilien und schiffsbeteiligungen zum anderen um noch nicht lange beachtete wie rohstoffe und eher exotische wie kunstobjekte oder wein
6349350 anleger sollten allerdings beachten dass sich alternative investments in der regel nicht so schnell verkaufen oder aufl sen lassen wie traditionelle anlagen
6349351 ben tigt ein anleger dringend geld und muss sich deswegen von seinem investment trennen ist es m glich dass er zun chst keinen k ufer findet oder einen schlechten preis erzielt
6349352 hier sollten anleger unbedingt darauf achten dass die fondsmanager langj hrige erfahrung haben und in der vergangenheit bereits erfolgreich alternative investments gemanagt haben
6349353 denn der renditeabstand zwischen den besten und schlechtesten managern von investments im bereich private equity schiffen und immobilien ist wesentlich gr er als bei aktien oder rentenfonds
6349354 so k nnen sie sicher sein dass die fonds auswahl unabh ngig erfolgt ausschlie lich auf der qualit t der einzelnen beteiligungen basiert und die fondsgesellschaft nicht versucht eigene schlecht laufende fonds unterzubringen
6349355 my diet has a lot to do with my getting into shape
6349356 in france we lost the culture of the bike after the war when it was seen as old fashioned or for poor people

6349359 yes i work out and take care of myself but i also like a cold beer once in a while
6349360 thuram mengoper bola kepada ribery dari lapangan tengah ribery menggiring bola dengan melewati satu pemain dua pemain dan tiga pemain sampai akhirnya ia oper kepada henry yang telah berdiri tepat digaris kotak penalty ia tidak langsung melesakkan bola ke gawang lawan mengingat di depannya masih ada satu pemain belakang lawan dengan satu dua gerakan dia mencoba mengecoh pemain itu sampai pada gerakan ke tiga dia terjatuh oh apa yang terjadi di sana prittttt wasit menunjuk titik putih tanda akan ada eksekusi penalty pemain perancis pun bersorak sorai mendapat hadiah penalty tapi kita lihat gerakan slow motion pada siaran ulang oh ternyata henry melakukan diffing tampak sekali kaki bek lawan sama sekali tidak menyentuh kaki henry tapi apa dikata wasit telah meniup peluit menunjuk titik putih ribery melakukan tugasnya sebagai eksekutor dan gooolll stadion bergermuruh oleh luapan kegembiraan suporter perancis
6349361 sangat cantik kita tidak melihat penaltinya kita melihat proses golnya yang begitu menawan luar biasa
6349362 saya pikir henry terlalu mempolitisir keadaan dia menggunakan segala macam cara untuk mencapai tujuannya tapi ya itulah politik sepak bola

6349373 agamis board has decided to shut the company down as the efforts to raise further capital didnt materialize in time its really unfortunate but that is true
6349374 the company is going through a process of the liquidation of assets so i dont have any more details than that
6349375 he was wiping out our phones as we were sitting there

6349381 some critics say japanese mobile technology tends to be quirky like the galapagos islands
6349382 but asian nations such as taiwan and south korea have for years expressed great interest in japanese cell phones

6349385 yeah you can say that didnt know you were into street food
6349386 just trying to get a taste of indian street culture after all this is the next big market for the greatest product that mankind has ever seen
6349387 but you have priced it at 800 for the base model who do you think will buy it
6349388 oh you underestimate the brand value of an apple product we have been over pricing our products for the past 20 years and successfully i might add
6349389 but still it costs 199 in the us it is 4 times the price in india dont you think you are fleecing us
6349390 look let me get something straight that 199 is just a marketing thing ok
6349391 but still that makes it twice the price here and you still have a 2 mp camera without flash or video recording the iphone still isnt mms ready the software keyboard frankly sucks no stereo bluetooth no instant messenger no cut and paste sir my rs 8k nokia has all that and more
6349392 i dont remember the last time i got to sit in one of our crummy buses but thats beside the point last i heard 3g networks are still quite a way off in this country did you check that before you decided to use the indian market as your retirement fund
6349393 lets not get nasty here let me explain why we have priced the iphone so high here just for your ears considering you look murderous right now
6349394 you know about all those near stampedes that the launches in the us created they were bad enough with people lining for days outside the stores and all dont get me wrong all good for business but you know someone can get hurt bad pr now can you imagine what kind of response we would have got for our sexy product in india if we priced it competitively man it would be pandemonium someone will get hurt your cities are already so chaotic we didnt want to add to it so the high price
6349395 oh i see and it is not because india has one of the fastest growing upwardly mobile populations in the world and you want to make a quick buck while the hype lasts
6349396 then i wish you luck mr jibes just so that you know i dont believe a word you say and i think your product has more style than substance we may be an upwardly mobile and brand conscious people but we are not dumb we can see through your charade i think i will stick to my nokia meanwhile what the heck are you doing in the back alleys of andheri

6349406 the federation council is ready to recognize the independent status of south ossetia and abkhazia if that is what the people of these republics want
6349407 there are no major movements or sign of a withdrawal
6349408 wir freuen uns sehr nun auch einen beitrag in diesem f r unsere branche so wichtigen und kreativen organ leisten zu k nnen in seiner interdisziplin ren ausrichtung bietet der rat f r formgebung ein einmaliges forum f r den branchen bergreifenden austausch in den bereichen design und gestaltung
6349409 this is an agreement that will establish a missile defence site here in poland that will help us to deal with the new threats of the 21st century of long range missiles from countries like iran or north korea
6349410 prior to 9 11 and hurricanes katrina and rita few business in the u s outside of power companies telecom and financial services bothered to prepare for disasters
6349411 the stakes are higher because businesses are expected to remain operational 24 7 and globalization requires they do so in multiple geographic locations
6349412 we know one third of the bay areas resales in july were homes fresh off foreclosure said john walsh mda dataquick president
6349413 who knows how many more involved a desperate seller and a lender who accepted a short sale
6349414 emin n tahtakale regions are no longer considered the major localities in the city meanwhile the mobility on beyo lu stiklal street has moved to the area which lies between the i li mosque and the business centers and plazas in maslak district
6349415 the i li ayaza a line has enhanced its mobility and the major centers of commerce in istanbul continue to move toward the northern parts of the city
6349416 we clearly observe the mobility in the ile and sar yer zekeriyak y regions meanwhile mobility in the new districts of the city such as ekmek y and arnavutk y clearly demonstrate the movement toward the north
6349417 ekmek y district which lies between beykoz and cumhuriyetk y is among the districts with the highest rent on the asian side of the city while arnavutk y emerges as one of the most recent attraction centers of the european side of the city
6349418 some of the areas in arnavutk y such as yenik y will further improve in the upcoming periods meanwhile although the exact location of the third bridge has not been disclosed yet dividers and tunnels in the ile aya z and elmal regions located in the asian side of the city and the ongoing construction of the sar yer ay rba tunnels and hasdal yass ren dividers in the european side of the city constitute yet further indicators of mobility toward the northern parts of the city
6349419 the common belief is that the third bridge will be built between the sariyer yenimahalle havantepe region and anadolu kava ceneviz kalesi yu a tepesi region we should also bear in mind that the highways that will be built on the third bridge are major alternative exit roads that citizens will make use of during a natural disaster such as an earthquake and hence they should be constructed immediately we will not be able to use the existing roads that are adjacent to each other in case of an istanbul based earthquake
6349420 the general expectation is that these roads located in the northern parts of the city will connect with the third bridge meanwhile the third airport is also expected to be built to the north of the third bridge
6349421 the owners of the stores noted that the number of elite customers visiting the shopping center by far surpassed that of other luxury shopping centers
6349422 we are extremely pleased with the number of visitors coming to viaport in three days we expect to reach 600 000 visitors per month for the upcoming periods ninety percent of the visitors come to viaport with the purpose of shopping
6349423 we are operating with 75 percent occupancy rate while many brands are opening their stores toward the end of this month meanwhile there is a vital demand for the vacant stores in the shopping center
6349424 the reasoning of the court says that the legal preparation was not accomplished for the process
6349425 the draft law regarding the privatization of the bridges and motorways was delayed until the next legislative period beginning in september after parliaments summer recess
6349426 the code was already prepared according to the changing conditions and we have been waiting for its finalization
6349427 as soon as the code takes effect the grounds of the state councils decision will be removed
6349428 in autumn there will be news from liberty city the first episodes of gta iv will be available for download exclusively on xbox live underlining xbox 360s leadership role in the field of digital entertainment
6349429 american newspaper companies have violated the principle of supply amp demand by failing to adapt their core product to a radical change in consumers supply of news and information during the past 15 years the other and minor one is how far too many of those companies have deviated from their local roots
6349430 we aim to offer better physical conditions for young tennis lovers
6349431 we pushed him a lot and didnt let him get inside
6349432 of course we are disappointed but we have no regrets
6349433 we were only able to get a spot in the top eight with the level were at now but at least we have closed the gap to the top
6349434 thats thanks to all the matches weve played against european teams and to our own progress in recent years
6349435 they will organize a cuba business day for the businessmen in the aegean region on aug 25 cuba a leader in the sector of protective health products will introduce the habanos cigar and havana club rum as well as the health products
6349436 the biggest problem in bilateral relations is that trading directly between cuba and turkey is not possible at the moment we have to use intermediary countries for importing and exporting the cuban firms want to enter into a commercial partnership with turkish businessmen we hope that zmir international fair will offer this chance to them
6349437 will get wet make sure you take water guns with you
6349438 we can confirm that two british nationals died and seven were injured in a road traffic accident whilst on a jeep safari in turkey
6349439 we understand the driver of the jeep they were in is being detained
6349440 we as denizli chamber of architects are not owners and processors of the project we just presented it to the governorship our aim is to support and contribute to the efforts to save the white heaven not become a part of problem we want everybody to perceive pamukkale as an outdoor museum
6349441 as denizli governorship we are trying to do our best to protect and preserve pamukkale and hierapolis the most important issue for us is to avoid a decrease in the number of tourists visiting pamukkale what we should do is promote healthy tourism explaining the historical importance of the region
6349442 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
6349443 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
6349444 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
6349445 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
6349446 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
6349447 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
6349448 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
6349449 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
6349450 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
6349451 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
6349452 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
6349453 i fear the day when you israelis and palestinians stop squabbling since when that happens the economic force of cooperation between these two talented peoples will be hard to match in the middle east
6349454 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
6349455 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
6349456 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
6349457 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
6349458 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
6349459 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
6349460 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
6349461 this initiative opens up possibilities for fraport as an airport operator and ground handling provider to apply its extensive know how actively and to help define standards within the framework of the cargo 2000 quality management system
6349462 f r immobilienkunden ist es von elementarer wichtigkeit einen vertrauensvollen dienstleister an ihrer seite zu wissen denn der kauf und verkauf einer wohnung oder eines hauses ist meist eine einmalige t tigkeit im leben die sicher und zuverl ssig abgewickelt werden muss ein makler der beispielsweise mit renommierten banken zusammenarbeitet kann beste sicherheitsstandards und eine hohe erfolgsquote aufweisen
6349463 wir wollen unangenehmen besichtigungstourismus vermeiden und bieten daher optimale vorab informationen im internet
6349464 so kommen nur wirklich am objekt interessierte zu den besichtigungen
6349465 welche leistungen sind f r sie bei einem makler am wichtigsten
6349466 they have higher figures because air intervention is the most common way to tackle forest fires in the world but it is ground forces who actually intervene in the fire in our country intervention on the ground is a more effective method and ground organization is very successful here
6349467 a war cant be won without soldiers it is same for the forest fire
6349468 intervention in a forest fire requires different techniques than an urban fire
6349469 the basic instruments in extinguishing a forest fire are a rake an electric saw and a bulldozer helicopters and planes have no place in this rank as they merely provide secondary support
6349470 the dispersed settlement of forest villagers is a main barrier to building fire security lines and creating a system for confining fires
6349471 also their dispersion makes it difficult to gain access to those areas in the fire
6349472 on the other hand we understand forests are the habitat for villagers
6349473 they earn money from it and treat the forests as a family member so rural development projects should be produced to diversify job opportunities for them
6349474 i believe that it would be more effective to include role models and celebrities in such projects to raise public awareness
6349475 the only thing officially we have done is appoint councilman bradley huson as mayor pro tem
6349476 we initially tested a sample of approximately 500 refugees primarily somalians ethiopians in kenya under consideration for us resettlement through the p3 program
6349477 after the samples suggested high rates of fraud we expanded testing to ethiopia uganda ghana guinea gambia and ivory coast
6349478 so the program has been suspended and the department of state and department of homeland security are looking into it further to see what we can do with regard to this particular program
6349479 it was just to see the relationship or lack of relationship among the applicants of the p3 program
6349480 a lot of these work related accidents occur due to limited space we need larger areas to manufacture ships here we use large work spaces and working conditions are good
6349481 it is unbelievable how they can work in such limited spaces in tuzla they are writing history
6349482 according to the new regulation companies will have to apply first to the real estate registration office their application will then be taken to the governors office to be discussed by a commission governorships will also ask the national military command centers whether there is a problem in the sale of the land after these procedures the commissions under the governorship will decide whether the land is appropriate for sale or not
6349483 in my view this process will take a minimum of six months in overpopulated cities such as istanbul it might even be longer
6349484 i was a university student in petergorski but i wanted to transfer to another school when i applied for my transfer russian officials told me that my visa had expired and i needed to go back to sudan in order to renew it so i got on a ship and came to turkey but because i didnt do the paperwork to leave russia i wasnt allowed to enter turkey
6349485 i went back to russia but this time they didnt let me in i have been going back and forth between russia and turkey for the past 18 days all of this happened because i didnt know the right procedures
6349486 i called my family but couldnt reach them all i want is to go back to my family renew my visa and come back
6349487 we let the officials know about bilal and we are waiting to hear back
6349488 there has been an adverse finding in her a sample against her blonska
6349489 and there is a process being followed against her however she has not been stripped of her medal there will be a disciplinary commission hearing about her case on thursday morning and because she is a medallist it will be then passed to the executive board
6349490 weve taken the decision to start dynamic integrity testing of the line today before a move to full operation
6349491 this will involve some limited and intermittent flow of oil through the pipeline
6349492 for ship scheduling purposes the lifting program at ceyhan will be updated today to start loadings from the beginning of next week
6349493 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
6349494 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
6349495 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
6349496 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
6349497 we both fought for gold and i got the gold
6349498 wrestling has always been the driving force of turkish sports
6349499 we have previously stated that we want to do better than we did in athens where turkey won only one silver and two bronze medals in wrestling and now ahin has ended our drought
6349500 the results make us think about the situation deeply i too am responsible for that
6349501 one athlete u s swimmer michael phelps can get eight gold medals but as a country we win three or four and none of them are gold turkey is only there in individual sports and nowhere to be found in team sports that we need to overcome
6349502 i was 90 percent sure of winning the gold medal because i am the reigning world champion in that category
6349503 my opposition was strong as well he beat me once and i beat him once last year now i won again and i am very happy
6349504 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
6349505 doa ku tak putus untuk mu ibu st hanum lubis
6349506 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
6349507 si zapatero quiere hundirnos se va a hundir con todos nosotros
6349508 filed under business apple iphone users worldwide are complaining of dropped calls and its looking increasingly likely the cause is the phone itself
6349509 we have been experiencing 80 percent growth year on year in the asia pacific australia and new zealand regions this year and expect this to continue
6349510 we havent embedded links throughout the text except for example when listing web sources or in diary type pages and of course we do it in our blogs
6349511 one of the reasons is we dont want to interrupt a news story by sending the reader off the page in the middle of a sentence
6349512 way of testing whether we can make background content quicker and easier to add find and access without getting in the way of those readers who dont want to be distracted by it
6349513 nous sommes tr s tr s proches dun accord sur le sofa status of forces agreement mais ce nest pas fait
6349514 il est incontestable que les n gociateurs ont beaucoup avanc vers la finalisation de laccord mais il ny a aucune raison de penser quil y a un accord
6349515 il reste encore des questions r gler concernant le futur mode op ratoire de nos forces et cest tout fait normal
6349516 lexplosion sest produite dans une voiture vide stationn e sur les lieux de la d flagration nous pensons que celle ci a t provoqu e par des explosifs d clench s distance
6349517 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
6349518 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
6349519 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
6349520 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
6349521 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
6349522 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
6349523 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
6349524 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
6349525 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
6349526 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
6349527 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
6349528 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
6349529 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
6349530 the best values from trusted sellers become better and better
6349531 i have no control i have to comply with anything they choose to do and i have no voice in the matter
6349532 id be giving up a months income to get that done thats the only thing thats keeping me on ebay the inconvenience of leaving
6349533 i talk to other people who have done what i did and theyre happy with their decision theyve been able to get their business to the ebay business levels or beyond
6349534 many times you feel like theyre really pushing it to see if youll give them some kind of a refund
6349535 theyll float the suggestion that this isnt exactly what i expected
6349536 when ebay makes these dramatic changes it can make you very nervous
6349537 but again ebay is doing what ebay believes it has to do to protect its marketplace
6349538 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
6349539 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
6349540 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
6349541 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
6349542 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
6349543 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come

6349546 we dont know whats going on in the artcs infrastructure management system and it needs to be determined that there are no other level crossings that are dangerous like this one was
6349547 in the last day or so the market has begun to question the fundamentals of the recent us dollar recovery he said
6349548 we have seen particular focus on rumours and innuendo about us investment banking
6349549 i still stand by the view interest rate differentials are less us dollar supportive he said
6349550 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
6349551 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
6349552 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
6349553 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
6349554 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
6349555 he just locks down and cant get the words out
6349556 for such a fine speaker its really quite remarkable that hes had issues
6349557 this new program has really helped our e gaming photographic images company
6349558 and it also allows us to see what other firms are offering to new job applicants this helps get an edge on the competition and strengthens our human capital greatly
6349559 this test is not meant to scare off prospective hirees
6349560 but we want to see how they can apply the skills they have to the real life needs of written communication and critical thinking
6349561 our hr department is by far the largest unit at chantay faiella inc
6349562 and rightly so with stock par values increasing by the month we need more and more hirees to satisfy our growing corportate needs
6349563 and we realize that as a result we provide new e gaming photographic images business hirees with substantial benefits to stay onboard and grow their career with us
6349564 its important for all our top hires to know individuals within the industry and individuals within our company this makes marketing and sales work much easier and more efficient so if your uncle bob at a major e gaming photographic images firm offers you a job youre advised to take it
6349565 with the recent boom in the e gaming photographic images market were looking to hire 100 new employees in a range of different jobs
6349566 we believe this time gives us an opportunity to evaluate new hires and decide if we made the right decision in offering them work if they dont pass this temporary evaluation period we offer the job to anyone on our waiting list
6349567 last month after the closure of diamond fiaschetti inc we hired nearly half of all their admin staff in one week
6349568 and this has really helped our business in many ways and given these people another chance at having meaningful employment in this e gaming photographic images industry
6349569 one has to balance artistic talent with the rigors of usable multimedia
6349570 and as a result we tend to only hire those who are from accredited design universitys such as risd
6349571 we love using intense flash graphics for our weekly work
6349572 certainly from the perspective of the school for the deaf we see it as a strong move forward
6349573 it also means its our turn to be as corrupt and irresponsible to the democratic process as their white predecessors have been
6349574 i recall john f kennedy president of the united states when he became president he recommended his brother right
6349575 our common welfare comes first personal recovery depends on aa unity
6349576 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
6349577 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
6349578 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
6349579 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
6349580 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
6349581 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
6349582 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
6349583 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
6349584 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
6349585 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
6349586 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
6349587 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
6349588 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
6349589 who are open to doing something on the production side
6349590 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
6349591 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
6349592 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
6349593 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
6349594 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
6349595 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
6349596 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
6349597 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
6349598 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
6349599 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
6349600 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
6349601 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
6349602 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
6349603 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
6349604 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
6349605 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
6349606 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
6349607 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
6349608 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
6349609 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
6349610 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
6349611 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
6349612 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
6349613 the site visit was a highly productive event with recognition for our researchers such as drs paul dudis assistant professor in the department of linguistics at gallaudet and jill morford associate professor in the department of linguistics at the university of new mexico albuquerque as engaging in transformative scientific advancements we believe the center has the potential to transform the education of all deaf individuals and other visual learners in general giving us great hope for the future

6349632 if the business case of terria is reliant on telstra taking a substantial equity stake they need to go back to the drawing board incoming group managing director of public policy and communications david quilty said through a spokesman
6349633 telstra has made it totally clear it is not interested in playing lovey dovey with its competitors
6349634 like any equity player you cant be a shareholder in a company unless you own some shares if we win the bid they will then have the option of coming on board

6349678 we left the house we left everything and came on foot because to stay there was impossible
6349679 they are burning the houses from most of the houses they are taking everything they are stealing everything even such things as toothbrushes and toilets they are taking the toilets imagine they are taking broken refrigerators

6349683 the political mind why you cant understand 21st century american politics with an 18th century brain
6349684 the nature of the campaign is changing less than a week before the convention starts
6349685 obama felt he was sitting with dr phil and he was trying not to offend anybody mccain seemed to understand he was running for president his answers were more direct and aimed at the electorate
6349686 the primaries are preseason you can make mistakes but now were into the first game that really counts
6349687 obamas folks are reading their own press clippings too much and theyve got to understand theyre in a dogfight
6349688 the party is very bad at labeling things that provide an umbrella for other positive memories
6349689 which reagan used to evoke a feeling of hope and promise in the country
6349690 when you talk about religion and faith based values you have to be nuanced i thought he was really earnest trying to explain who he was to an audience that largely disagreed with him these werent his guys
6349691 the reason why the statistics are so alarming is men dont go in for check ups even though oral cancer is more prevalent in the african american community
6349692 by the time we as black men have oral cancer it is advanced
6349693 many of them have insurance and they just dont go either because of fear or preconceived notions or complete ignorance about what goes on in a dentists office

6349699 it was brought up for discussion during the cabinet committee for public transport meeting

6349701 lance armstrongs dedication on behalf of cancer survivors is a true inspiration
6349702 likewise i believe the commitment of the lance armstrong foundation to its employees and family members in achieving gold standard accreditation will further inspire business leaders to recognize the valuable role they can play in the workplace to help us win the battle against cancer

6349705 despite the best efforts of police the trial powers were ineffective in assisting police to apprehend drug couriers on a sustained basis mr barbour said in a statement today
6349706 i have considerable reservations about whether these or similar powers will ever result in the cost effective detection of person involved in road based drug trafficking
6349707 overwhelmingly drug detection trial operations resulted in the detection of persons involved in minor possession offences rather than those involved in the supply or trafficking of indictable quantities of drugs mr barbour said
6349708 when yang wei won his gold medal there were fireworks and crying and shouting everywhere like he was our own son
6349709 you can have as much money as you like but in the end it depends on finding the right kids and training them right and thats what we do
6349710 i didnt really like galactic city that much galactic city is cool but its not like my favorite place but ive never been to tatooine so i dunno
6349711 it is pretty safe to assume that the pass rate at a and a is going to be 20 or more this year
6349712 there has been a lot of effort put into improving maths standards
6349713 we could be starting to see some of the fruits of that
6349714 the gcse results are most significant for the pupils themselves
6349715 we have got to be reasonable because it takes time to turn schools around
6349716 it was a disappointing result and its up to us to bounce back on friday
6349717 irvine vics have obviously improved since last season and theyll be really fired up for the game
6349718 its taken on a real meaning now however our fate is in our own hands and while a draw will see us through well be going all out to win the match
6349719 im really looking forward to it it should be a decent game and its up to us to make home advantage count
6349720 maybe we could have won by more but we dominated the majority of the game and created by far the better chances
6349721 the only downside is that we cannot afford to pass up these goalscoring opportunities thats two missed penalties and about seven or eight really clear cut chances weve missed so far and we must be more clinical in front of goal
6349722 confidence is high going into the meadow game but we know it will be very difficult for us
6349723 they will be hurting after that shock loss to hurlford and will rightly be heavy favourites
6349724 its crucial that we take our chances and it is also important that defensively we get it right straight from kick off but its a game i really enjoyed as a player and wish i was getting the boots on again this friday
6349725 the last thing i will say to my players is that this is not mission impossible
6349726 i won there two years ago with in my opinion a weaker irvine vics side so they should go for it they have nothing to lose
6349727 its vital that we get off to a good start in the league
6349728 unwillingness of the post office to give any information into the closure selection
6349729 we can only conclude decisions have been arrived at to make the most financial savings and issues of customer service have been secondary
6349730 i am concerned that this hit list has been drawn up purely on financial figures with absolutely no consideration about the effect they will have on the community
6349731 we must make the post office aware that this is not just about money the post office is a public service whose job is to serve the public
6349732 for the first time ever we will genuinely see these celebrities eat sleep and shower in the most disgusting prisons in the world

6349736 to look after this little whale you need to suckle it for 11 months thats never been done anywhere in the word before for a whale this size or for that long
6349737 you then need to get it to the antarctic where its food supply is letting it go off sydney its got a 2 000 km trip to make it doesnt know how to avoid killer whales or how to find krill
6349738 even getting it out to sea doesnt mean saving the whale

6349747 but i think he should show more respect for his competitors and shake hands give a tap on the shoulder to the other ones immediately after the finish and not make gestures like the one he made in the 100 meters
6349748 he might have interpreted that in another way but the way it was perceived was catch me if you can you dont do that but hell learn hes still a young man
6349749 i would love him to show more respect for his competitors thats not the way we perceive being a champion but he will learn in time he should shake hands with his competitors and not ignore them hell learn that sooner or later but hes a great athlete of course
6349750 bolt must be considered now the same way like jesse owens should have been in the 1930s bolt has a bigger edge than owens on his rivals of course owens had the long jump too so you cant compare people if he maintains that in the future bolt will be someone that probably leaves a mark like jesse owens

6349774 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered
6349775 we are targeting 9 per cent growth in the medium term and getting up to 10 per cent
6349776 may look ambitious with a slowdown in the global economy but is achievable in the medium term
6349777 we will be able to deal with any implications arising out of the salary hike

6349784 after we win this gold medal nobody will ever remember 2004
6349785 after 04 we were at the lowest point as far as usa basketball was concerned
6349786 i know on a team like this youre not supposed to worry about how many minutes you play and things like that but guys like myself and lebron james we were expected to play in 2004 but we didnt so that kind of takes down a notch of your confidence
6349787 he had problems with me a lot of people never really got a chance to really hear what i have to say but i dont really have nothing to say thats over with for me im in 2008 right now
6349788 in 06 he probably was in the best shape i have ever seen him
6349789 last year he was still there this year he probably was one step off that when he showed up last month for training camp in las vegas
6349790 now hes gotten it back going full blast this is probably the best defensively i have ever seen him play he started out shooting poorly and he didnt have all three of those guys before james wade and bryant theyre really scorers
6349791 i get tired of people saying i cant play no defense
6349792 hes been playing great defense the last game he rebounded the ball like an animal six in 14 minutes against germany obviously the numbers are going to be skewed for everybody hes been fantastic
6349793 hes funny as hell thats my guy thats my dude hes just funny and he and i we get along extremely well
6349794 im happy for him when we get that gold medal hes going to be one of the happiest men on the podium
6349795 im happy im having a lot of fun on the court just hanging with the guys and visiting and talking with players from different countries
6349796 weve got a chance to redeem ourselves and we cant wait for that moment
6349797 were knocking on the door and trying to accomplish what weve been waiting to do for four years

6349801 i cannot vouch for the authenticity of it but i trust the friend who sent it to me
6349802 none of us thought we were being used or abused by the syrian regime but we will see over time
6349803 i urged him to move ahead in the israel syria negotiations as much as possible so that whoever is the next president would not start from too far down the track
6349804 i did not say anything about obama or mccain i said whoever is the next president is not going to want to inherit a process that isnt going anywhere
6349805 if one of senator obamas advisers has been to damascus we just wonder how many have been to tehran
6349806 thats ridiculous of course no advisers have been to tehran
6349807 help barack get out the vote in pennsylvania if you can get to pa between now and 4 22 reply to this msg tvl and your name ex tvl ann please fwd msg
6349808 we just kind of felt like in news reports lately it was like what are we going to do with them trying to sweep them under the rug
6349809 we thought we could help some of denvers homeless residents by giving them a fresh look giving them real good self esteem and helping them feel part of the dnc so they look their best
6349810 even if we stipulate that he has foreign policy chops how does that make him a good veep choice it strikes me that any pick designed to cover up a flaw in obama i e lack of foreign policy credentials only accentuates those flaws
6349811 let s review the list of people who will not be barack obama s running mate hillary clinton because she would poison him jack reed because he isn t interested tim kaine because of the eyebrows
6349812 now aside from joe biden himself is there anyone that thinks that biden brings much of anything to this ticket aside from hair plugs and an over inflated sense of self worth that is
6349813 leaking the names of bayh biden and kaine seems odd when obama s playing everything else so close to the vest almost seems like a deliberate decoy designed to draw us away from the actual nominee so that when the announcement drops it ll go off like a nuclear blast
6349814 the timing cannot be coincidental mccain rolling out his vp on the 29th is sure to distract the media from obsessing over his age and take some of the afterglow away from obamas historic nomination speech
6349815 hopefully i can provide some assistance in the future to this school and all that it can be
6349816 i know you are working very hard and struggling to bring up this school but i have said i will assist the school and i will do so
6349817 there was no doubt among us teachers that is what he meant we interpreted his words as meaning he would help fund the school either personally or by raising sponsors or both in order to give our school desperately needed modern facilities and a facelift
6349818 when he comes down here he will change the face of the school and believe me our poverty in kogelo will be a thing of the past
6349819 senator obama has not honoured the promises he gave me when we met in 2006 and in his earlier letter to the school he has not given us even one shilling but we still have hope
6349820 a sense of balance and fairness in our tax code
6349821 it is time for folks like me who make more than 250 000 to pay our fair share
6349822 w e will save social security for future generations by asking the wealthiest americans to pay their fair share
6349823 the first part of my plan is to tax the windfall profits of oil companies and use some of that money to help you pay the rising price of gas
6349824 well charlie what ive said is that i would look at raising the capital gains tax for purposes of fairness
6349825 michael phelps would be worth 40 or 50 million to nike

6349827 we dont discuss contracts and that extends to future or potential sports marketing relationships
6349828 does evil exist and if so should we ignore it negotiate with it contain it or defeat it
6349829 the horrifying story that terrorists used two women with down syndrome to carry bombs was a sensation in february but the new york times later suggested it hadnt happened that way
6349830 psychiatric case files of two female suicide bombers who killed nearly 100 people in baghdad this month show that they suffered from depression and schizophrenia but do not contain information indicating they had down syndrome american officials said wednesday
6349831 what do you think the reaction would be if former secretary of state colin powell a republican introduced democrat obama at his big acceptance speech at mile high stadium after being made the nominee
6349832 it would seal the deal it would be the presidency
6349833 not long ago in baghdad al qaeda took two young women who were mentally disabled and put suicide vests on them sent them into a marketplace and by remote control detonated those suicide vests if that isnt evil you have to tell me what is
6349834 i would like to apologize to you for assuming that your private assurances to me regarding your desire to cooperate in our efforts to negotiate bipartisan lobbying reform were sincere

6349838 john mccain helped pave the way for foreign owned dhl to take over an american shipping company
6349839 its tough times when its a foreign entity coming in and sucker punching us
6349840 cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who arent like them or anti immigrant sentiment or anti trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations
6349841 here s the leader of the chinese team at the age of 20 cheng fei
6349842 during one school year at columbia obama was a telemarketer in midtown manhattan selling new york times subscriptions over the phone wearing a headset
6349843 im certainly going to ask a question about jesus christ in this forum no doubt about it
6349844 president must withdraw the u s russia civil nuclear cooperation agreement submitted in all its na vet to an appropriately hostile congress back in may
6349845 what duties are owed to a non viable child born alive
6349846 are these babies medical waste or persons protected by the constitution obamas reaction was to consider them non entities under roe v wade until they were viable even when they were gasping outside the mother
6349847 his plan would not raise any taxes on couples making less than 250 000 a year nor on any single person with income under 200 000

6349849 the most technologically advanced museum in the world we wanted more flat screens than anyone in attracting people here to learn about a free press we wanted to give the visitors a wow experience
6349850 i think that the pro life position is one of the important aspects or fundamentals of the republican party
6349851 and i also feel that and im not trying to equivocate here that americans want us to work together you know tom ridge is one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro choice and i dont think that that would necessarily rule tom ridge out
6349852 i think its a fundamental tenet of our party to be pro life but that does not mean we exclude people from our party that are pro choice we just have a albeit strong but just its a disagreement and i think ridge is a great example of that far moreso than bloomberg because bloomberg is pro gay rights pro you know a number of other issues
6349853 john mccain believes roe v wade is a flawed decision that must be overturned and as president he will nominate judges who understand that courts should not be in the business of legislating from the bench constitutional balance would be restored by the reversal of roe v wade returning the abortion question to the individual states the difficult issue of abortion should not be decided by judicial fiat
6349854 john mccain shot from the hip a very aggressive very belligerent statement
6349855 its just an example they politicize these issues without understanding that national security is not something thats a political issue same thing with the surge its in keeping with sort of the path that theyve been on to politicize national security for their perceived short term political interests
6349856 well im more concerned about the situation there number one number two is people will make their own judgment but i think people will obviously conclude that his inexperience and his lack of knowledge of this region and the issues are very apparent but i think people will reach that conclusion
6349857 surely pelosis concession is due to the fact house republicans have taken over her house over august recess protesting her decision to close the chamber without allowing a vote on offshore drilling
6349858 on october 1st without that extension of the moratorium the ocs and shale formations become available for exploration if pelosi wants to control that at the federal level before the states start issuing leases and permits she has to cut a deal with the republicans all this means is that pelosi has recognized political reality
6349859 probably more accurate to say that she is open to not being crushed in november she can read the polls and an overwhelming majority of americans support the republicans position that it is important to develop our own energy resources pelosi says she could support drilling or a vote anyway if drilling is part of a broader strategy
6349860 so much for saving the planet nancy pelosi needs to save her skin
6349861 on the central issue of energy policy the greatest economic challenge and opportunity of our times bush has been utterly obstructionist
6349862 obama is supported by 77 of democrats while mccain earns the vote from 85 of republicans
6349863 china s communist rulers while basking in the glow of their olympics bash are surely checking the tea leaves for what this might presage about u s support for another u s ally the democratic republic of china on taiwan if the u s will not stand up to north korea will not stand up to iran will not stand up to russia then where will the u s stand up what are the real rules of this new world order
6349864 independent groups can talk to constituencies where the obama campaign or the dnc arent credible messengers the best example would be working america and its reach into white working class communities
6349865 there are some groups that are ready to take more donations working america votevets the choice groups and acorn to name a few otherwise it is almost too late to get a new ground group going a new advertising outfit could be put together by experienced independent campaigners in a few days the key is not to fund the grab ass efforts that are mostly a consultant hustle instead invest in really good work
6349866 resulted in part from the lack of a neutral and effective peacekeeping force operating under an appropriate un mandate
6349867 we have no good options a us national security council official told
6349868 to pass a strong resolution getting the russians to show some restraint
6349869 we cant allow a second munich when the international community climbed down to hitler
6349870 that led to world war ii to a huge tragedy and millions of victims
6349871 were afraid of setting a precedent we could see a repeat of the sudetenland in czechoslovakia
6349872 our friends have been subjected to military aggression and we should use all the means we have to stop it
6349873 youd imagine that someone like the senator who is constantly traveling and constantly on how can he return these personal e mails
6349874 the strong support of the senate for the declaration of the north atlantic treaty organization at the bucharest summit that ukraine and georgia will become members of the alliance
6349875 i learned firsthand what it means to be fed by a georgian
6349876 russian forces are occupying gori georgian armed forces received an order to leave gori and to fortify positions near mtskheta to defend the capital this is a total onslaught
6349877 instead of looking presidential in making this announcement obama looks like a parent trying too hard to be hip around his kid s friends
6349878 this modern tech announcement gimmick of course also has the added benefit of presumably getting thousands of people to offer the campaign their e mail addresses and cellphone numbers a priceless free recruiting and fund raising tool
6349879 of course the skeptics in all of us recognize this is a great way for the obama camp to harvest more email addresses and cell phone numbers
6349880 i think a campaign would be mad to announce the running mate during the olympics and particularly with the news cycle were having right now the day of the announcement we could have russian planes bombing the georgian capital or some cinderella story of a little known american winning gold or some detail in john edwards story being contradicted further
6349881 shes waiting to see what commitments each makes on international relief issues
6349882 for many years i have warned against russian actions that undermine the sovereignty of its neighbors unfortunately we have seen in recent days russia demonstrate that these concerns were well founded
6349883 this afternoon i spoke for the second time since the crisis began with georgian president saakashvili
6349884 given this threat to euro atlantic security i am pleased to see the united states the european union and nato acting together by sending a delegation to the region in an effort to broker a cease fire this is an important first step
6349885 the united nations has been prevented from taking any meaningful action by russian objections in view of this i welcome the statements of democratic nations defending the sovereignty of georgia and condemning russian actions
6349886 i strongly support the declaration issued by the presidents of poland estonia latvia and lithuania and their commitment that aggression against a small country in europe will not be passed over in silence or with meaningless statements equating the victims with the victimizers
6349887 i am pleased the u s has agreed to facilitate the transfer of georgian troops serving bravely in iraq who are now unfortunately needed to defend their own country
6349888 now is the time for georgia and russia to show restraint and to avoid an escalation to full scale war
6349889 they got a major asset with that airport in wilmington where they have two runways and they can run flights 24 hours a day with no neighbors complaining
6349890 and they just bought 8 percent of the entire u s small freight market theyll need some more capacity to grow that so maybe the new building at the cincinnati airport could become a mega hub for the region the real key here is the ground network which is what dhl has been missing
6349891 during this time of economic uncertainty these workers will know they have a written agreement that protects their jobs and their futures
6349892 i am and have been willing to take any test necessary to establish the fact that i am not the father of any baby and i am truly hopeful that a test will be done so this fact can be definitively established
6349893 well he said he was above having to answer that question
6349894 made a quick stop at the manger in bethlehem where he was born
6349895 the transportation association says people took 2 6 billion trips on public transportation nationwide in the first three months of 2008 almost 88 million more than last year

6349899 offering 4 billion more in tax breaks to the biggest oil companies in america including 1 2 billion to exxon mobil a company that last quarter made the same amount of money in 30 seconds that a typical ohio worker makes in a year
6349900 is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second
6349901 through june exxon employees have given obama 42 100 to mccains 35 166 chevron favors obama 35 157 to 28 500 and obama edges out mccain with bp 16 046 vs 11 500
6349902 i spoke up against the administration and congress and sen obama when they gave us an energy bill with more than giveaways to big oil and really no solution to our energy problems
6349903 i want to take a minute here on this issue cause i think sen
6349904 it had 2 8 billion in corporate welfare to big oil companies and theyre already making record profits as you know
6349905 sen obama voted for that bill and its big oil giveaways i know he hasnt been in the senate that long but even in the real world voting for something voting for something means your support and voting against something means you oppose it
6349906 i am so pleased that senator obama shares my commitment to universal health care
6349907 canadians for the most part place importance on education skill modesty and politeness
6349908 on being introduced the customary greetings are firm handshake customary hello or bonjour in quebec
6349909 i think we could have avoided at least some of this if we had agreed to do the town hall meetings
6349910 is part of the politics of the past that we have to move beyond
6349911 he moved gracefully mr bush slouched and stayed coiled tight but mr kerry seemed at times to be waltzing with his partner the lectern mr kerry moved his hands almost continuously at one point folding them over his heart like a french mime as he explained that he felt nothing but respect for tony blair and british soldiers serving in iraq
6349912 i think kerry did a better job on meet the press then almost everybody i have recently seen
6349913 john doesnt mind in the least engaging as he did with lieberman

6349915 we are no longer going to give refuge to those traitors that would hit our young innocent people with reckless and mindless violence
6349916 people who have fought the civil rights battle economically politically legally as we have since the 50s would often talk about look what would happen if we have an african american president
6349917 it doesnt look like its going to be what we all thought it was going to be
6349918 this is what happens when you have gerrymandered safe districts
6349919 like a spy behind enemy lines i arrived every day at my mid manhattan office and sat at my computer terminal checking the reuters machine that blinked bright emerald messages from across the globe
6349920 sometimes coming out of an interview with japanese financiers or german bond traders i would catch my reflection in the elevator doors see myself in a suit and tie a briefcase in my hand and for a split second i would imagine myself as a captain of industry

6349928 if theres a one percent chance they do you have to pursue it as if it were true
6349929 the objective of any form of art is not political
6349930 i dont look like the president on a dollar bill or a five dollar bill
6349931 john mccain and george w bush are going to try to scare you about the way i look and that i dont look like other presidents

6349938 at a time when we ve got bigger challenges than any time in our history and you re running ads with hillary and er
6349939 but its deeply unfair to suggest his criticism of obama was race based president clinton was a force for unity in this country on this subject every american should be proud of his record as both a governor and president but we knew it was coming in our direction because they did it against a president of the united state of their own party

6349957 there used to be some sensitive events and days when we would be watched such as june 4th
6349958 but now its happening more and more it seems to me that extra sensitivity will continue after the olympics
6349959 the pressure is building in the pressure cooker and theres no current avenue for it to be released
6349960 i believe we will see many calls both inside and outside the party to put some sort of reforms on the agenda again

6349968 argentina is the defending champs you want to be able to play the guys who won it the last time i would love for us to have the opportunity

6349971 if it does happen great but im not overlooking greece by any means greece is a very good team if they win wednesday night well see them whoever we play theyre just in our path for the gold medal

6349973 and anyone who has aspirations to be a champion you understand there is a sense of pride that comes along with beating a champion thats all that comments about

6349980 i think if you look in aggregate at what weve put in place as a state and in the measures that we are proposing here we are still very much at the forefront in terms of efforts to stop smoking
6349981 the effects of passive smoking are harmful especially to children and that harm increases when the child is in a confined space such as a car
6349982 one thing is certain and that is there will be point of sale changes theres going to be reform in terms of 11 or so thousand retail outlets it will not be business as usual for them and thats very very important
6349983 victoria is in catch up mode and the premier if he is really serious about fighting cancer should have brought in some of these measures over the past 12 months
6349984 theres a sense that its a cutting edge destination where they can be among the first to learn firsthand about another culture
6349985 theres something about being one of the first in your generation to really have a deep understanding
6349986 its probably the most different and most unorthodox place i could think of

6349990 were pretty sure that china can take more but exactly how many and in what fields and what would it take to double or quadruple the numbers thats something we as an industry will have to explore

6349993 heavy marine traffic in the sydney area could interfere with the mothers ability to hear and locate her calf thats a possibility
6349994 a boat could have physically come between the mother and her calf and cause the separation as well a recreational vessel for example
6349995 calves could have been separated from their mother in a storm they could have been separated by the mother being attacked by orca killer whales or sharks it could be sonar destruction through vessels it could have just been bad luck
6349996 calves generally stay within two or three body lengths of their mother and if a calf strays beyond that we frequently watch mothers immediately respond to get them back
6349997 the bond between the mother and the calf is so intense that youd have to imagine that something has occurred that forced the separation other than abandonment even if the calf is sick
6349998 when calves do get separated the mothers do get stressed and they go searching for them
6349999 if the calf is born while travelling north and this is not uncommon this adds to the risk of potential separation because the mother is not likely to stop out in the open ocean because there are things that could hurt her such as the orca whales
