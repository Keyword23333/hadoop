4360449 above all it seems that the americans changed their opinion as a result of the situation in the caucasus

4360451 we will have here in poland not one but two american garrisons we will have one base used to protect the whole of the north atlantic treaty against long range ballistic missiles
4360452 we will also have a battery of 96 patriot missiles located in a spot chosen by poland according to our defence needs

4360456 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4360457 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent

4360525 as this parliament ends its five year mandate i would like to commend you lawmakers for the selfless attitude with which you executed your duties during the five years of your tenure
4360526 the function today is a milestone in our countrys democratic process
4360527 this has helped in boosting self confidence in women and we hope the number will increase in the next parliament and should continue being an example to other parliaments the world over
4360528 i have been asking the same question every time i come to this parliament how far has the renovation work gone the renovation started when you were starting your term and you have left it still incomplete
4360529 today marks a great milestone in the history of our nation we are saddled with the painful but important task of completing the implementation of the international court of justice icj judgment by handing over the peninsula to cameroon
4360530 as painful as it is we have a responsibility to keep our commitment to the international community promote international peace and cooperation and advance the cause of african brotherhood and good neighbourliness
4360531 in other ways to re assure the displaced people that they remain accepted members of the world
4360532 as we reach the ultimate phase of the implementation of the judgment by the icj of 10 october 2002 relating to the bakassi peninsula i have the honour and the exceptional privilege to carry out such a pleasant duty that of paying homage and deference to the architects of the event which has brought us together here today and whose example will illuminate the images of our two states in africa and in the world namely presidents paul biya of cameroon and alhaji umaru musa yaradua of nigeria as well as mr ban ki moon secretary general of the united nations un whose resolute determination and commitment to ensure peace between cameroon and nigeria made it possible for the process started in august 2006 to be completed
4360533 beginning with the withdrawal of nigerian troops from bakassi two years ago and culminating in this ceremony the case of the bakassi peninsula has proven the viability of a peaceful and legal settlement of border disputes when it is done with the full support of the international community and in a spirit of mutual respect good neighbourliness and cooperation
4360534 international court of justice icj judgment was not binding i thought the president will take the deliberate lacuna created by the former president olusegun obasanjo that there was no recourse to national assembly and wait for our resolution
4360535 in the international scene the good boy attitude is never rewarded so the decision of the yaradua administration to cede and hand over bakassi to prove whatever is very annoying and so disappointing so many nigerians are saying so
4360536 every time it rains the water sweeps down here like a tsunami carrying logs and everything else
4360537 its not unusual for the water to rise to the bridge handrail and when it does i come out with my torch to try and warn people in cars to turn back
4360538 council comes and cleans it every now and then not often enough but you can see the overgrown weeds are all still there
4360539 because of what happened in 1998 with that fellow youd hope theyd bother to look after the creek more than they do
4360540 i think if the same thing happened again it would have the same result
4360541 whenever it rains junk gets washed down and you see things out of peoples backyards it gets caught in the crofton weed and we hold our breath
4360542 this city has massive waterways and i think we have to take responsibility for that and do more
4360543 we are dealing with an environment thats been built up going back to the early 1900s
4360544 if we were able to go back and do all the things wed do now things would be totally different
4360545 i came into the kids bedroom and saw the fire which was only little but then it just took off
4360546 we havent got anything nothing at all we dont even have clothes for our children we dont know how we are going to get help my wife is totally upset
4360547 i dont know where we are going to go if we cant get emergency accommodation
4360548 i ran back into get the kids pet rabbit weve only had it for two weeks
4360549 we know what youre made of and we are not afraid
4360550 weve found that octopuses effectively have six arms and two legs
4360551 i wish i could hear you breathing and tell you i will be leaving
4360552 ganesh acharya had promised me that akshay kumar would be making a guest appearance for one of the songs mash a allah the next thing i know ganesh himself was dancing on screen in that song yeh ek bhanyankar surprise thaa it was a terrible surprise for me
4360553 it was something beyond my imagination to see ganesh in akshays place there was a vast difference between what ganesh had said and what he finally delivered
4360554 film ko badi maar maari hai critics ne critics have trashed the film
4360555 from now on ive decided to be only an actor in a film theres no need to advise the director specially if he thinks he knows best
4360556 i dont know how it happened even members of ones own family stop listening to you after a point ganesh felt i shouldnt interfere in his writing skills and that i should just listen to him on the sets
4360557 thoda ussmein director jag gaya the director in him become aggressive
4360558 he never discussed it with me i didnt even know about this characters existence in the plot when i finally saw the film i asked ganesh bhaiyya yeh kya hai i think somewhere while discussing the commercial angle with me ganesh lost his way
4360559 i cant figure out when prem chopraji came into my picture and why hes a senior actor and i felt ganesh was portraying him crudely i did tell him that
4360560 but ill say this my films usually speak a language of innocence that was lost in money hai to honey hai i thought i was doing a film about team spirit little did i know that so much bitterness would creep in even in the choreography i found upen patels song to be dicey
4360561 i dont believe in poking fun at people who have achieved so much i didnt know about ekta but i was told about vijay mallya and laxmi mittals names being used i was told they were being mentioned with reverence so i kept quiet
4360562 my film is not at all any movies remake it is inspired from a village folk tale about a brahmin it is a modern version of a desi indian story it is a commercial film that leaves a message with humour
4360563 im waiting for the film to release so that audiences can see for themselves what its about even sanjay dutt was surprised after watching the film at a preview he told me that he had previously thought it was a remake of the english film
4360564 it is a custom in the industry to predict and guess the story of a film after seeing the initial rushes
4360565 considering the title of my film and that amitabh bachchan is playing the almighty who wears only white clothes everyone concluded that it is a copy of the hollywood comedy however no one noticed that even rishi kapoor played god and wore only white clothes in thoda pyaar thoda magic
4360566 i wanted to direct a film that no one had ever attempted to considering the technical aspects i have used in the film god tussi also has special effects to keep audiences glued to their seat
4360567 i didnt face any problem while directing the film the film went very smoothly as amitabh and salman had already been pushing me to direct a film for a long time
4360568 i didnt take up direction earlier because i wanted to learn its technical aspects also i needed to find the right subject i wanted to work on
4360569 writing is my first love if i get an exciting offer ill definitely do it as of now my entire focus is on direction every person looks for a change however ill write at least one film every year
4360570 i dont fear any movie my movie is also commercial but different giving audiences a paisa vasoool complete satisfaction film has always been my forte
4360571 we like to think shopping with us is exciting enough already
4360572 above all it seems that the americans changed their opinion as a result of the situation in the caucasus
4360573 in washingtons eyes this conflict proved that russia was not a stable partner for the states
4360574 we will have here in poland not one but two american garrisons we will have one base used to protect the whole of the north atlantic treaty against long range ballistic missiles
4360575 we will also have a battery of 96 patriot missiles located in a spot chosen by poland according to our defence needs
4360576 this is the beginning of the strengthening of the polish defence capabilities and making the polish american alliance concrete
4360577 did you hear that sound it has been there for a while

4360581 how to get the right merchandise to the stores on time has been its biggest problem youd often not find the goods you want in reliances food and grocery outlets
4360582 it didnt take reliance long to realise that retail was a different ballgame altogether its not just about some long term government policy or certain business competency which its known to manage well the variables in retail business are far too many there could be a number of factors such as general economic downturn terror scare shorter wedding season cricket season like an ipl or a political protest which can affect store sales you need to be able to manage that
4360583 i understand that its our job to take on the missions no one else wants to
4360584 climate change is not only a challenge it is also an opportunity
4360585 a paradigm shift to a low carbon economy by 2050 has the potential to drive forward the next chapter of technological innovation it will require a third this time a green industrial revolution
4360586 fifty per cent is an average internationally and the g8 will have to show strong leadership and push for more
4360587 given these are mainstream companies saying we need global action and it has to be at least 50 by 2050 theres no excuse for governments not to go further
4360588 while some uncertainties remain applying a risk management perspective to the available information we conclude that a responsible approach is for all leaders of businesses and government to take action now
4360589 and there goes my life passing by with every departing flight
4360590 i want this generation to be the one that bucks that trend to be the generation that finds a way to combine economic social and environmental progress
4360591 we will only do that if we develop a strategy for realistic environmentalism not ignoring economic realities and just pressing on regardless but understanding economic realities and using them as a spur to innovation and imagination
4360592 i understand that right now the cost of living is the number one concern for britains families
4360593 and i understand with that backdrop why people might think fighting climate change seems a costly diversion
4360594 the truth is its not that we cant afford to go green its that we cant afford not to go green
4360595 my driveway is ferrari ready it doesnt mean its going to get one any time soon
4360596 its time we got on and really made this technology happen we need to use the economic momentum behind coal to drive the ccs agenda
4360597 that when times are good we can indulge ourselves with a bit of environmentalism but when the economic going gets tough the green agenda has to be dropped i want this generation to be the one that bucks that trend
4360598 the era of cheap oil is well and truly over
4360599 we are not going to drop the environmental agenda in an economic downturn but neither will we ignore the rising cost of living
4360600 so we will take forward our green agenda in a way that strengthens the economy not green or growth but both
4360601 we will not allow unabated coal to continue but we recognise there is a future for coal in the uk and there is certainly a future for coal in the rest of the world we would like to see kingsnorth as a candidate for a ccs trial thats entirely possible
4360602 we welcome any new thoughts on ccs and continue to believe that the uk needs a diversified portfolio of power sources
4360603 it would lead to us having to build a lot of gas fired power stations in the meantime with all the uncertainty surrounding that sector
4360604 neither will we ignore the rising cost of living and the fact that people are hurting
4360605 i understand that right now the cost of living is the number one concern for britains families
4360606 and i understand with that backdrop why people might think fighting climate change seems a costly diversion
4360607 weve got to wake up to the fact that relying on oil and gas isnt just bad for our wallets isnt just bad for our environment its also bad for our national security
4360608 we are not going to drop the environmental agenda in an economic downturn but neither will we ignore the rising cost of living and the fact that people are hurting
4360609 the truth is its not that we cant afford to go green its that we cant afford not to go green
4360610 when oil is moving towards 140 a barrel when families are being hit hard every time they pay their gas bill fill up their cars or do the weekly shop are you telling me we shouldnt we cant go green weve got to the era of cheap oil is well and truly over
4360611 we are not going to drop the environmental agenda in an economic downturn
4360612 realistic environmentalism not ignoring economic realities and just pressing on regardless but understanding economic realities and using them as a spur to innovation and imagination
4360613 its the kind of measure that gives green taxes a bad name because it does not change behaviour

4360620 vi m bringe h b og fred vi har f et s megen velsignelse fra gud og som maria jacobsen sagde skal vi bringe det videre det er ikke alle armeniere der har fred indeni nogle vil gerne forts tte hadet derfor er det vigtigt at bede om styrke fra gud for man kan ikke selv

4360622 for the first time in our history we have had four years of nearly 9 percent economic growth india is among the worlds fastest growing economies
4360623 but there are new challenges that we face we have the challenge of inflation i know how much each one of you is concerned about the recent rise in prices
4360624 but while making these efforts we should avoid doing anything that hurts growth
4360625 our economy must grow at the rate of at least 10 percent every year to get rid of poverty and generate employment for all
4360626 there is a new dynamism in our railways new roads are being built many new seaports and airports are being developed
4360627 irrigation watershed development rain fed areas development flood management all received special attention our effort at increasing investment in the rural areas and reducing debt burden of farmers has turned our farm economy around
4360628 we now have had record production of food grain cotton and sugar our warehouses are full again
4360629 now a skill development corp will be created by the government with the active participation of the private sector to give special training to our young men and women our workers and our technicians
4360630 personal faith is your worldview and that determines how you will lead
4360631 the question at this point is the level of enthusiasm
4360632 is an opportunity for barack obama to talk about his values
4360633 people will have to make a decision on whether they want to stand there and smile or run away i think theyll run away depending partly on the national media coverage
4360634 if he decides to go its an exercise in poor judgment to put people in damaging situations
4360635 i dont think the party itself will do that but i hope his handlers will help him see that
4360636 every day kwame is in trouble every day he puts on that tether every time they march him to jail is a day the democrat party loses favor with the voting public
4360637 michigan voters know that mayor kilpatricks troubles are his own and that barack obama is focused on bringing people together to solve the serious challenges we face
4360638 these kinds of silly political attacks dont help a single person afford health care dont create a single job or help a single michigan manufacturer
4360639 theres a lot more racial tension in michigan than in other states
4360640 unfortunately there are those who have issues with race on a fundamental level
4360641 what the mayor does by his own behavior is play out all these negative stereotypes making it easier for people to try to tie obama to kilpatrick and his behavior
4360642 this is their opportunity to indict an entire people for the very public foibles of a few
4360643 to stand there and praise mayor kilpatrick as a great mayor who is to be emulated all across the country is kind of laughable

4360645 im glad that we could reach this deal with roche the products strengthen our marketing affiliates position in key therapy areas therefore good market synergies are expected
4360646 we are very pleased with the tremendously successful launch that we had
4360647 but this is where the real journey starts for age of conan in the months ahead we will be putting a lot of effort into expanding and improving on the game and we look forward to using the games convention to unveil some of the locations content and features we have in the pipeline
4360648 i just wanted to step on it in the first 50 a little bit and try and get out to an early lead
4360649 i knew in the first half if i got a big enough lead i thought i could hang on and thats all i wanted to do
4360650 la sibiu persista un sistem invechit de relationari si de teama fata de administratie
4360651 im very disappointed with the result however i had given my best shot i ran as fast as i could
4360652 he ran well in the first 70 meters already in the fourth place but he forced himself in the last 30 meters and as the consequence his technique was wrong and his pace slowed down
4360653 she looked in the vehicle saw the keys in the ignition and decided to hop in
4360654 she indicates that by the time she realized there was an infant in the seat it was too late
4360655 both suspects admit they are the people in the surveillance tape they admit they are driver and passenger in that vehicle
4360656 the truth lies somewhere in between what these two women are telling us
4360657 definitely we are happy we are one step away from the gold we will play all out in the final whoever our opponents will be
4360658 we were tensed and nervous thats why we couldnt play our best
4360659 we like playing the drives against them but we should be better otherwise we would have been lost
4360660 we have known from the beginning that indonesia expects a gold from us hopefully we can deliver it
4360661 poland and the poles do not want to be in alliances in which assistance comes at some point later it is no good when assistance comes to dead people
4360662 poland wants to be in alliances where assistance comes in the very first hours of knock on wood any possible conflict
4360663 it is this kind of agreement not the split between russia and united states over the problem of south ossetia that may have a greater impact on the growth in tensions in russian american relations
4360664 i cant believe he did it this is amazing im so happy i can only jump up and down
4360665 the first thing i thought of was my parents and my coach
4360666 we are proud descendants of the great ghengis khan and tuvshee proved the strength of mongolians in the olympics
4360667 it is so exciting that our mongolian flag was raised in beijing and tuvshee won in the judo competition
4360668 me and several of my friends have bought mongolian vodka to celebrate this wonderful news it is going to be a very exciting night
4360669 right after the june 29 election we were in central square protesting election results and throwing stones against policemen and interior troops this time we are all here to cheer and support our athletes participating in beijing olympics
4360670 feelings are a great gift but theyre treacherous if thats all we live for they drive us back into ourselves you see what

4360691 should safe passage be given to someone who has done this to pakistan
4360692 he wants safe passage by breaking pakistans law he wants safe passage by breaking pakistans constitution he is asking for safe passage by selling out pakistans sovereignty
4360693 the faa believes the large total amount of the fine for these violations is appropriate because american airlines was aware that appropriate repairs were needed and instead deferred maintenance
4360694 in intentionally continuing to fly the aircraft the carrier did not follow important safety regulations intended to protect passengers and crew
4360695 we do not agree with the faas findings and characterizations of americans action in these cases
4360696 in accordance with faa procedures for handling these matters we have requested to meet with the faa after we have had time to thoroughly review their findings so that we may discuss the issues since these matters are ongoing with the faa we will not have any further comment at this time
4360697 for government if you can do something in less than two years its a miracle
4360698 there quite easily could be a doubling of a monthly payment
4360699 i dont see any prospect for the use of military force by the united states in this situation
4360700 were concerned about reports that russian forces have entered and taken positions in the port city of poti that russian armored vehicles are blocking access to that port and that russia is blowing up georgian vessels
4360701 we have found that a lot of the initial reports that we have received on things going on in georgia have not been accurate
4360702 our latest information for example is that the commercial port at poti is intact and usable and we think that the russians never actually imposed a blockade
4360703 we do not need nor do we intend to take over any air or seaports in order to deliver humanitarian assistance to those caught in this conflict
4360704 the greater fear right now is missing the next big rally
4360705 inflation numbers were bad but they are probably going to get better
4360706 investors have different opinions as to what the value of those companies are given the tremendous difficulties they face
4360707 there has been a sufficient amount of pessimism to warrant a short term rally
4360708 they pull out a bit about a speech to hartford technical college which is a made up school the bit was me pretending i was a jerk but no one in their right mind would think i would actually say it but they used it to say how much of an litist i am
4360709 minnesotans if they hear people saying things they think are inappropriate they want an explanation i think its good he confronted it and talked about it
4360710 occasionally i go oh theres a kind of joke i dont do anymore i used to not care if a joke could be misinterpreted now i do care if a joke can be misunderstood

4360720 its disappointing that this scheduling error has resulted in the upcoming championship not being played at fenway park but we look forward to being at fenway in 2010
4360721 we believe the ncaa has treated ben differently than it has other athletes with very very similar circumstances
4360722 the facts are that he only got to play three years
4360723 thats ludicrous to even think that we would put him on the field and put our football team in harms way
4360724 despite being a model student athlete and person for the ncaa and despite having earned the ncaa significant revenues the ncaa has wrongfully arbitrarily and capriciously denied mr mauks request to participate in a fourth year of athletic competition for reasons completely beyond mr mauks control
4360725 we look forward to explaining more fully our reasons for the decision and the careful review given not only by our staff but also by representatives from our member schools

4360771 there are people who are advising him to avoid confrontation but i dont think he has made up his mind
4360772 it is at the moment that pakistan cannot afford confrontation
4360773 and its obvious that the present government and president musharraf cannot get along so it is in the best interest of pakistan that some way is found whereby this mode of confrontation can be changed or can be more conciliatory
4360774 should safe passage be given to someone who has done this to pakistan
4360775 he wants safe passage by breaking pakistans law he wants safe passage by breaking pakistans constitution he is asking for safe passage by selling out pakistans sovereignty
4360776 the united states spent 45 years working very hard to avoid a military confrontation with russia i see no reason to change that approach today
4360777 i think what happens in the days and months to come will determine the future course of u s russian relations
4360778 my personal view is that there need to be some consequences for the actions that russia has taken against a sovereign state
4360779 to punish georgia for daring to try to integrate with the west
4360780 if tomorrow president saakashvili signs these documents then the withdrawal of the russian troops can start
4360781 one thing thats possible is that she was still owed money from what shed done before for the political action committee but obviously there are less charitable explanations
4360782 i talked to john tuesday and hes not doing well
4360783 hes just to be very frank with you hes just not doing well he needs to be concentrating on himself and his family at this point in his life hes a good boy he just made a hell of a mistake
4360784 i did not even have a moment to relish that i was a candidate
4360785 im sensing some resistance and hesitation for people to embrace change
4360786 theyre very active and very sincere folks but some of the people i talked with didnt even know what precinct they vote in
4360787 all of a sudden theyre active good im glad but some might say they should not start at the top
4360788 its been like this as far as i can remember we build houses then fighting occurs we leave and return home and build our houses again
4360789 being alive after all the troubles just makes me thankful despite the difficulties
4360790 the other hotels around the area all have health care that is provided by the boss and have been able to get wage increases
4360791 at the other hotels in the same classification for the same work the workers get paid 2 to 3 an hour more
4360792 clearly were disappointed that unite here local 681 has spent more time protesting
4360793 publicity stunts are not productive and are extremely disruptive to the resort district
4360794 disneyland is being unfair with us because were fighting for our health care and theyre trying to take it away
4360795 theyre trying to cut our hours and take away our seniority
4360796 the most important is health care we need that and they want to take it away
4360797 at the end of the day what it means is that workers are going to be priced out of health care
4360798 gottlieb was one of the most incredible people i have ever seen
4360799 on setting up diplomatic relations between the two countries at the level of ambassadors
4360800 one of the steps that has long been required is the establishment of a proper embassy for syria in lebanon and vice versa
4360801 now if the syrians will go ahead and demarcate the border between lebanon and syria and respect lebanons sovereignty in other ways then this will have proved to be a very good step
4360802 to reactivate the work of the joint committee to demarcate the lebanese syrian borders within a mechanism and a set of priorities
4360803 it is not possible to mark the borders in shebaa farms as long as there is still israeli occupation the occupation must end
4360804 to activate and step up the work of the joint committee on people missing from both countries
4360805 the agreement is designed to provide rapid recovery of fair compensation for american nationals with terrorism related claims against libya
4360806 it will also address libyan claims arising from previous u s military actions the agreement is being pursued on a purely humanitarian basis and does not constitute an admission of fault by either party
4360807 we had to figure out what mulder might be doing and where he might be doing it at this point and at the time we are investigating this particular case in the story basically some things are the same these two characters work for the fbi dana scully is a doctor and a rationalist and my character fox mulder is a guy who believes in the paranormal and ufos they are a kind of bickering couple who take on these cases that no one else can seem to solve
4360808 it is not so hard for me i dont mind because i get to go back into my trailer in between takes and get warm it is hard for the crew because they have to stand there for fourteen hours straight physically i am fine with the action i always try to stay in good shape i do a little of everything i cross train
4360809 its a thriller it is mysterious and scary and as always with the x files i try to inject some humor into it on occasion the ongoing relationship between mulder and scully is the foundation of the whole film and it really gets complicated in this one it is the developing story of these two people told through this new case which opens up the whole can of worms again after all these years
4360810 i would say gillian is probably closer to that than i am i am probably more of a skeptic than gillian i am open to spirituality but not to quackery and things that are clearly ridiculous but if i saw as much evidence to point to the existence of the paranormal as mulder did i would be open to it all certainly however in my own life i have not seen what mulder has seen
4360811 my family is great and my kids dont care about the work i do children just care about having a stable home having a mom and dad tea and i just try to work at different times so we are not both away too much the children have been young enough so that we could pick them up and take them with us on location but they are getting to the point at which we might get arrested if we keep taking them out of school so much laughs so in the future we will have to be in one place for most of the time and we are working it out so we are not both working away from home at the same time
4360812 absolutely i would love to that was always what i wanted to do i loved the show but i wanted it to end when it did it was the right time i got tired of the grind of making a network television show but i never tired of the character or the possibilities of the show i definitely didnt want the x files to end completely so i am delighted we are making this film

4360826 this was the 2nd time that i ve seen jamiroquai perform and the best
4360827 i was lucky enough to be one of the select few at the exclusive gig on wednesday night
4360828 the venue was amazing it was such an intimate gig with the band squeezed onto a tiny stage
4360829 they performed all the classics kicking it off with cosmic girl it was great to hear jay say that the band aren t retiring so hopefully i ll get to a lot more gigs in the future and look forward to hearing their new material they rocked
4360830 in the 21st century there should be no place in our world for zoos or circuses that use animals the conditions these animals are kept in are often beyond words just imagine yourself being locked behind bars for the rest of your life for human entertainment

4360835 we like tom beltons comic girl remix hes done a really good remix of one of the new tracks too
4360836 playing argentina because we hadnt been there for five or six years to go back and get that sort of reception was fantastic so for me that was like a really good highlight

4361434 he was in the right frame of mind and wanted to play nothing would have stopped him so that is pleasing
4361435 i have no idea what will happen between now and the end of august
4361436 he knew the consequences of playing tonight so the decision was very much his
4361437 i could not think at all about the game on sunday until we had played tonight but i was very pleased with some of the football we played
4361438 we obviously need to tighten up our defence if we could but i was very pleased to win
4361439 since it is obvious we dont have any chance in the second leg we will concentrate on the league
4361440 i dont think this game will break us down i doubt well play against a team as good as this again this summer
4361441 the game was over before it began we let in two goals in six minutes when there was a total lack of concentration
4361442 i do not know if players showed aston villa too much respect which was not necessary
4361443 if you go two goals behind against such a team at home obviously it will be difficult but we tried and showed sometimes that we are a good attacking team
4361444 but in football you must also play defence and that we did not

4361446 how becoming of you to arrive at my doorstep in the rain after we stopped talking for months i suppose you thought it was romantic to walk two miles through the barrio without an umbrella are you drunk
4361447 i dont know how you got here you look like you can barely stand up
4361448 alcohol helps me keep warm while i walk through the freezing rain with a broken heart i think im composing myself rather well for someone in my condition
4361449 and what is your condition exactly terminal stupidity making promises of grand adventure and travel to keep someones heart captive while you sat in your room and played guitar all day not writing any songs asking your mom for money while the girl you love worked a 40 hour week at the library to support someone who doesnt love them enough to even make it in open mike gigs to show some effort for this great dream you never made happen
4361450 look i didnt come here to be berated i came here because of that email you wrote me
4361451 four months ago the one that i wrote to inform you i was getting married the goodbye letter
4361452 and you wait that long to come here to try to win me back did you wait for it to rain so you could come play bogart and trick me into sleeping with you
4361453 actually i was thinking it was more like high fidelity with a twist of hope
4361454 you can hope yourself into rehab again at least im with someone who understands what practical love is all about and not building castles in the clouds you cant move into
4361455 you cant be serious about marrying mr responsible hes a complete prude i bet he wears tighty whities he doesnt know you
4361456 you never knew me you only knew how i would fit into your little romantic story about sweeping a girl off her feet and travelling around the world making a living off of a trade you cant even ply in your own hometown i believed you for a long time before i decided to get smart and kick your ass out of my place and stay with someone who actually wants to build their life around me
4361457 he had to work late hes working on an advertising deal with starbucks if he gets this deal hell write all of the newspaper ads in the city for the local shops
4361458 wow so he can write the ads while you fill out the crossword puzzle and clip the coupons living life to its fullest eh
4361459 fuck you thats a man who knows how to live in the world not create some dysfunctional fantasy
4361460 it isnt black magic to make some popcorn and whiskey sours while watching eternal sunshine on the spotless mind on a rainy night with the lights out i wrote this poem for you
4361461 double fuck you i cant believe you have the balls to bring in your dog and pony show after insulting me i had to rebuild myself after i found out what a fuck you were
4361462 shut the fuck up i cant believe you have the balls to read your pathetic shit to me
4361463 if i heard the song of your eyes whispering amethyst dreams into my mind i would have quietly taken my own life in an alleyway somewhere with this as my epitaph written on a bar napkin like a solemn sacrifice to the beauty of your soul a useless dog dying in vain for nothing more than to prove to god that you love are stronger than the vulgar urge to exist without the one thing that makes a broken heart complete
4361464 and youre the best thing that ever happened in my life
4361465 why did you come here i dont even know who the hell you are even after all this time im supposed to get married in two months and you just come barging into my life like nothing happened its not fair
4361466 do you still have my sweater its kinda cold out here im dripping wet and half drunk
4361467 yeah its kinda destroyed though his dog got ahold of it he got me this lab puppy a few weeks ago still training him and whatnot
4361468 how suitable that was my warmest article of clothing on the coldest day of my life but thats alright ill just catch pneumonia on the walk back

4361474 yes smallville may have been a target before but that was never validated the information about ecstasy being sourced in smallville actually came out back in 2005 2006 from one of the principal suspects of a murder parricide case he said then though not reflected in the sworn statement that he got ecstasy in smallville there is no ecstasy trade in iloilo or western visayas but if we can validate it i assure you we will conduct a raid
4361475 we just dont have the trade here or elsewhere in western visayas
4361476 from our end we only act within the bounds of law we never and will not go beyond that now if anybody can tell us of a better way to do it then go ahead and tell us and let us see if we can make it work
4361477 they deal one on one and pay in cash there are no middlemen here and that makes our job doubly difficult but our agents with our operations all within the procedures prescribed by law
4361478 that is one way of deterring spread of shabu ecstasy and all other illegalities here by exposing it then these drug pushers and drug users will not be as bold with their acts they are bad news for us businessmen in the area they destroy the image of major investments here
4361479 he was too young to die he just got married
4361480 no amount of praise and assistance could bring my son back
4361481 i had urged him to just finish his course and become a policeman because the work is safer than becoming a soldier but he always believed that there was no escaping fate if it was his time to die
4361482 he wanted a stable job and steady pay so he could let us finish college
4361483 he never neglected us and did not fail to send money every month even after he got married
4361484 he would always tell me to do some walking for my hypertension
4361485 he was struggling hard to live but the evacuation came too late kulang katama ang bulig sang gobyerno the government support was too lacking
4361486 its painful and we have to accept it but his death has become painful because he was still alive for four hours why was there no help for four hours and why was he evacuated by a us helicopter and not one of ours
4361487 if he was evacuated earlier he could have survived because he died four hours later on board the us helicopter
4361488 the government knows that their soldiers put their lives on the line every time they go to battle they should have been prepared to give support
4361489 we want to avoid a hasty investigation we will let them referring to arevalo police do this slowly but surely and we do not want fall guys so no deadline for now to our arevalo police yet all efforts are being exerted to round up those responsible in the killing for now what we can tell you is that there are at least two attackers
4361490 i have already directed the city director to oversee the investigation
4361491 yes we certainly welcome any help on the investigation but the actual conduct of police work should only be done by the philippine police
4361492 i understand mayor tre as formed a committee to study the options available to the city government for it to be able to choose the one which would be most beneficial to the city and they came up with a recommendation to the mayor in favor of the back to back loan although the ira is deposited at the land bank of the philippines we found it best not to specify a particular bank with which to enter into the loan agreement to give the city a freer hand to choose which bank would offer us the best terms
4361493 canadian professional chuckwagon association competitors lost seven outriding horses and the pull horse of mine
4361494 thats eight head of horse that we had to put down this weekend on this track
4361495 we were too close so i couldnt get around him
4361496 it was lucky mitsuings wagon didnt veer left or it would have been a big mess
4361497 the other two gorst and waldenbach had infractions when they left the start
4361498 i guess its a win but its not how i wanted to win it
4361499 if it wasnt for the misfortune i would have had the pcs championship
4361500 this is the worst track weve ran on all season
4361501 the track is so beat up the surface is totally screwed
4361502 they need to resurface the whole thing if they are going to keep running horses on it
4361503 usually youre unlucky enough to have eight through a whole summer
4361504 and thats a very high number for a whole summer
4361505 the worst track weve run on all season the track is so beat up the surface is totally screwed
4361506 we dont like to see that here but it certainly is not related to the condition of the racetrack
4361507 we have professional equipment operators who have been doing this for years and theres no problems with our racetrack whatsoever
4361508 our guys know the conditions and they got the thumbs up from the cpca people when we had the track ready for them they checked it themselves and theres no issue with our track
4361509 when you have that many outriding horses dying that pretty much tells you the base of the track is shot
4361510 the horses run on a good surface all of a sudden they break through that base and they hurt themselves real bad that has to be what happened there
4361511 when the base gives way theres nothing more dangerous than that thats why it would be outriding horses theyre carrying the weight on their backs a wagon horse is just pulling they dont have weights on their backs so they wouldnt break through as much as an outriding horse
4361512 instead of a casual just review it were going to tell them before you guys get on this track were not going to get blamed for anything
4361513 well be taking this to our education committee to see whether we should have a position on it
4361514 at this point we recognize that its a legal sport and youd hope things would be as safe as possible for both the horses and drivers it sounds like the conditions of the track need to be looked at to ensure that its safe
4361515 these animals are really well taken care of and they love to run
4361516 there are equine events where theres higher risk and more injuries more issues but this is a highly promoted sport and it draws attention
4361517 ive been around it my whole life my grandpa did it my dad did it
4361518 since my dads been driving ive wanted to outride i knew that right away
4361519 the better the outrider you are the more heats youre gonna ride in
4361520 i was riding the heat jumping into the wagon box then id jump off the wagonbox onto the outriding horse and not even miss a heat
4361521 i really want to concentrate on making calgary stampede i got to start concentrating on driving
4361522 its a team thing its tough to get into this sport without a family
4361523 i was going to quit but instead of quitting i decided to go over there to the cpca for a year
4361524 i wanted to go to new venues meet new people and show the people my face instead of on tv its been great so far
4361525 in the wpca youve just got more top end competitors
4361526 the cpca still has lots of good drivers and lots of tough drivers but theres a few more of them in the wpca

4361543 nobody can do the things he does and nobody ever has so its just an inspiration to be in the same race
4361544 hes absolutely just a phenomenon hes absolutely incredible isnt he i told him after the race i hope you get your eight golds because it would be such a spectacle to see almost once in a lifetime to see someone accomplish something of that magnitude

4361547 state and local governments businesses organizations and concerned citizens have all worked together tirelessly in this fight against needless loss of lives and futures while todays announcement is great news there is no acceptable level when it comes to traffic fatalities so we cannot let up
4361548 the decline in traffic deaths in 2007 is very encouraging
4361549 the reduction in the number of lives needlessly lost is the result of a lot of people working together in traffic safety education and enforcement the messages are out there drinking and driving speeding and not wearing a seat belt kill theres still a lot of work to do our mission will be to continue to reduce traffic fatalities so that more people go home alive at the end of each day

4361637 there is no other variable of such ecological importance to coastal marine ecosystems that has changed so drastically over such a short time
4361638 keep fertilisers on the land and out of the sea
4361639 they certainly dont want to see their dollars flowing off their fields scientists and farmers need to continue working together to minimise the transfer of nutrients from land to sea
4361640 we believe it would be unrealistic to return to pre industrial levels of nutrient input to oceans but an appropriate management goal would be to reduce nutrient inputs to levels that occurred in the middle of the past century
4361641 the new projections move up some of the changes that are happening the minority population now will become the majority eight or nine years earlier than we had thought
4361642 it means theres going to be a young old divide
4361643 but the over 65s will primarily remain white and will stay that way the challenge for any national politician will be appealing to such diverse interests at both ends of the spectrum
4361644 au 21e si cle les nations nenvahissent pas les autres nations
4361645 le ciel nous lavons construit de main de ma tre et nous en largissons constamment le domaine
4361646 i had a gut feeling about it he made me look good
4361647 it was a disappointing week it turned into a disappointing 10 days
4361648 we needed to play better and we didnt we have to find a way to get productive
4361649 after that two walks really hurt after drew got the hit it gave them a chance to have a big inning
4361650 in the morning i woke up with a little pain
4361651 when i got here i tried to play and tried to squat a few times and it was kind of painful
4361652 i just think its serious enough that you just dont want it to be something thats going to hold him back from life
4361653 the kid gave every bit of himself and hes a tremendous competitor
4361654 physically his bodys just not to the point where hes going to be ready to play
4361655 they made huge inroads last year but obviously they fell away
4361656 i thought they were very close two or three games that was all it was there were games they were up in against the big teams that they lost and it looked very hopeful but there has been a bit of unrest in the summer by losing a couple of key players
4361657 those gaps have been filled by the youngsters who have come through and look as if they are going to get a chance this year but i still think they are two players short i am a bit worried about the start of the season
4361658 we are certainly not a selling club but these young players get their heads turned
4361659 they are moving on to bigger and better things in their mind but i dont see that as an onlooker if you leave arsenal there are not many places you can go on an upward step
4361660 i think flamini had his head turned with money and going to such a so called big club but i think he has made a mistake and i think the other players will see that
4361661 ill challenge you to name anyone who has left and gone on to bigger and better things there arent many places you can go and enjoy your football so much
4361662 you can go to other places and earn more money and maybe that is a sign of the modern player
4361663 arsene has always wanted to keep an english core but he has found it difficult
4361664 when we all left it was the decline into an all foreign team and he was more disappointed than anyone but he has struggled to bring in english players and nurture them to first team capabilities now he has a crop he really believes in
4361665 there is no doubt in my mind that having an english core in an english team is beneficial to the club you need to have that affiliation for your home club
4361666 i feel over the years that has been lost they have produced some brilliant football but the actual loyalty and commitment to the club long term are not there
4361667 im very much a believer you have to get the league right
4361668 it is more important than the champions league and more important than cups in the league you play 38 games thats the most important and that is wengers philosophy
4361669 he will be more disappointed than anybody that they have not put a really good challenge up for a few years now
4361670 it pains me to say it because i want us to challenge and win it but i just feel were a little bit short
4361671 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4361672 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
4361673 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
4361674 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
4361675 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
4361676 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
4361677 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
4361678 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
4361679 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
4361680 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
4361681 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
4361682 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
4361683 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4361684 the kid deliberately put his pedal up high and hit the front of the car
4361685 i turned and i was going to walk to the front and look at the damage and he the other person clocked me from outside my view and hit me hard enough to do the damage to my lip my black eye and the skull fracture on this side
4361686 he doug was he was kind of laying on his side at the back corner of the car and all i saw was a pool of blood coming out
4361687 i think my first thought was oh my god im a widow and then oh my god i need help and then oh my god what happened
4361688 i think if theyre not stopped one day its going to be yours or yours or yours i dont think they show any remorse
4361689 i think theyre going to kill somebody someday and they better watch their back
4361690 we have a lot of respect for him and obviously hes been not only part of the national team program but hes been a part of major league soccer from early on so the ability to talk to him about what were going through here and get his advice and input is invaluable
4361691 wed be honored and privileged if bruce was part of the organization but the conversation tonight was really geared toward his input and his feeling on what weve done right and what weve done wrong with this franchise
4361692 if i could convince bruce to join aeg and join the galaxy hed be the ideal guy to come in here
4361693 theres not a better candidate theres not a better potential coach he knows more about the game mr phil anschutz has great respect for bruce wed be honored to have him
4361694 ive been put in the position a little bit sooner than i expected but when it comes to the job i think im up for it
4361695 obviously it takes time for things to work out the way you want them to
4361696 a lot of responsibility falls upon those guys to be the ones that lead this team to be the ones that make things happen to be the difference makers
4361697 thats what i expect the team expects and all the fans expect to see something special from those guys
4361698 i was lying on the couch watching tv and i heard this little pop and then i heard a car spin off and the kids started hollering
4361699 first i thought it was a big fight you know all the kids fighting
4361700 a guy laying flat on the ground on his back and all the people upset
4361701 then there were a couple of the football parents performing cpr

4361706 its common sense organic food is good food good to eat good for the environment good for the small scale farmers and farm workers who produce it
4361707 when he settles in when there are runners on base he executes pitches
4361708 he gets comfortable gets in his delivery and gets in the flow of the game and really pitches well
4361709 we got all those runs near the beginning of the game so i should have been able to go out there and get outs at a better pace but i wasnt able to
4361710 i felt like i was struggling to get into a good groove all game
4361711 of course youre embarrassed were all embarrassed because we feel were better than that
4361712 our bullpen definitely didnt need to be in there for nine innings i wish i would have done better
4361713 you dont find as much originality in sundance films these days and for a simple reason in the beginning the festival was a home for the homeless for a rambunctious outlaw take on filmmaking there was no need to be cautious since indie films were rarely hits but as sundance became the showcase for a form of movie gaining marketplace pull young directors naturally made films to fit the new mold trying to get your intellectual fill with sundance films is like choosing homemade popcorn over the concession stand variety higher quality little nourishment
4361714 in one word film is heavy its gone just gone
4361715 at the present stage there is merit in the contention that the article put up by the defendant on the blog site is defamatory
4361716 i understand that they would like us to change the definition of death but they cant do that by themselves its very problematic to start treating a baby as an organ donor before its dead
4361717 uses of the real originality conditional objects and action documentation contemplation

4361734 some say the commander is dead while the other are saying that he is injured but i cannot say anything of sure in this regard
4361735 i would see this as very on line with what forster recommended
4361736 he recommended a flatter structure greater performance greater accountability increased transparency and ensuring that the majority of our 8 5 billion budget is directed at clinical services
4361737 this will allow larger and better resourced districts to deliver local health services and important hospital building programs
4361738 more than anything people are saying to me there is confusion and some lack of clarity which can be rectified and there needs to be a decision as to where the accountabilities lie
4361739 waiting lists have continued to grow and not enough new beds have been delivered despite numerous promises rhetoric and now more restructuring

4361744 eine liebesgeschichte find die details klasse they also had some
4361745 it was very difficult to pick myself up from that stage i came so close to reach the final and yet failed for me olympic was over then and there
4361746 anyway i have another event 50m rifle 3 position day after on saturday and ill give my hundred per cent
4361747 i did not say all this earlier because people would have thought we were making excuses even before competing in the olympics
4361748 but the fact remains that we did not have enough ammunition and this is not the way you compete with world class shooters
4361749 i am sure there will be a bit of ribbing at home after this
4361750 three medals for one family at the olympics is phenomenal i could not be happier
4361751 as i said to you after her first match i am just looking to find my rhythm which i did
4361752 i was happy not to spend too much time on court
4361753 what makes him hard to stop is his ability to run and pass the ball
4361754 he just has good instincts on when to throw the ball and when to tuck it hes dynamic
4361755 what we know about dan is that hes always going to get some kind of positive yardage
4361756 he is such a competitive guy that he never likes to have any negative play on any snap
4361757 i dont think he ever forces anything or makes bad decisions with the ball in his hand
4361758 as an offensive lineman he takes the pressure off us
4361759 you arent going to be forced to pass protect for too long hes going to make his first and second reads and if they arent there hes going to take off
4361760 hes helping offensive linemen with our stats because if hes taking off downfield we arent going to be marked for a sack
4361761 he said if you try to explain how you play football then you are in trouble
4361762 all i know is that when i decide to run it makes a lot of sense to me i can feel the pocket collapsing or something is happening that makes me believe i should run
4361763 hes extremely accurate and hes got great knowledge of our offense and he has great confidence
4361764 he puts in his work all week and he watches so much film
4361765 hes always learning and hes always trying to find the next best way to do something
4361766 that is an act of terrorism against the nation its terrorism from within during a water crisis
4361767 i switched from my dress sweats to my parka shoes threw my cap and goggles on and then they pushed us on out no time
4361768 but i think theres going to be a lot of time for me to rest over the next 18 hours or so and ill be able to be ready for tomorrow mornings 100
4361769 tomorrow is going to be a tough race for me to be a player in that race i have to be closer at the 50 if im not then it will be tough i was over a body length behind at the 50 in the prelims and came up a bit short so i have to be there
4361770 i touched the wall and was like thank you finally
4361771 you can start by not worrying about what everybody else thinks
4361772 nobody knows what ive really gone through in the last eight years and what has gotten me to this point besides myself and a few people that i know well so its my own personal deal at this point
4361773 thats the theme of the meet you have to break a world record to win i gave it my all and i had nothing left
4361774 im very proud of what ive done ryan swam well he earned it
4361775 its been a long road to get here and i really cant believe that just happened
4361776 i really couldnt breathe that last 50 i was just digging deep and couldnt breathe
4361777 a silver medal is still a silver medal in the olympics i gave it everything i couldnt have given more

4361783 an important step towards ensuring that we can compete effectively with rival alliances and manage through the challenges of record fuel prices and growing economic concerns
4361784 because the industry is hurting that should not be an excuse to nod through a grouping that is not in the public interest
4361785 our industry needs consolidation but i recognize there are significant barriers the biggest are ownership and control restriction
4361786 the faa believes the large total amount of the fine for these violations is appropriate because american airlines was aware that appropriate repairs were needed and instead deferred maintenance
4361787 we do not agree with the faas findings and characterizations of americans action in these cases
4361788 i take the note and saturday night live producer lorne michaels gave the note as well to me
4361789 its something we started this year and saw immediately copied by our competitors so we know that it worked a little bit
4361790 but obviously we need to modify it to ensure that we dont turn off any of the audience
4361791 what do you mean by you its been so long so much money how could you forget
4361792 parrots make great pets they have more personality than goldfish

4361801 we will continue to reduce the number of british troops in iraq of course future decisions will be based as i have always said on the advice of our military commanders on the ground
4361802 but just as last year we moved from combat to overwatch we would expect a further fundamental change of mission in the first months of 2009
4361803 although it is hoped that the uk military presence in iraq will decrease significantly in the future it is still too early to discuss the size and shape of a reduced uk forces footprint
4361804 in his statement to the house of commons on july 22 the prime minister set out our intent to make a fundamental change to the uk mission in iraq in the first months of 2009
4361805 as ever this will be based on conditions on the ground the plans of our coalition partners and the military contribution requested of us by the government of iraq under a long term bilateral relationship
4361806 as a key coalition partner the us is intimately involved with the development of our future plans

4361823 saya tidak ingin berpolemik saya tidak kecewa tapi pidato presiden akan menjadi catatan bagi komisi i kami tidak melihat ada komitmen dan keinginan pemerintah untuk mendukung penuh keamanan dan pertahanan khusus untuk defence and security dalam kaitannya dengan pembangunan wilayah strategis di perbatasan juga anggaran untuk pertahanan dan keamanan

4361825 it is typical for chinese performers to wear different apparel from different ethnic groups there is nothing special about it

4361835 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer

4361901 the us may want to put more american soldiers into basra
4361902 information we get in real time is preliminary and may be subject to change when we get a fuller account of what happened we didnt have any real reason to go back and question what we were told initially nobody called us to question that
4361903 there are many situations in which a pilot declares an emergency and in the vast majority of cases the pilot lands the plane safely declaring an emergency gives that aircraft priority and ensures there is rescue equipment available in case there is a real problem
4361904 has unequivocal to leave her day to day responsibilities and go to her in the first place warmth which is producing films
4361905 my characters veritably in a state of arrested unfolding which i observe totality the time
4361906 menandwomen slip ont want to increase up so its party of the humor that my constitution could be seized of existence 20 she could be 30 she could be 40 and shes in her habiliments from when she was in seventh rate of ascent and thinks that thats sensual we see it all the era we inquire it in the tabloids people not dressing their ages and my character loves that and looks up to those people

4361910 i have never believed that one should make national security policy on the basis of trust i think you make national security policy based on interests and on realities
4361911 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4361912 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4361913 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4361914 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4361915 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4361916 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4361917 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4361918 another thing that comes to mind when i think back to school is plaid maybe its because when i was going to school pleated plaid skirts were trendy who knows the argyle print on a lot of the a muse notecards is perfect for that look amp feel
4361919 i wrote this for my broken people those called to be the broken people chosen as the broken people

4361921 we have no idea what theyre doing there why the movement where theyre going
4361922 one explanation could be they are trying to rattle the civilian population
4361923 i think the world should think very carefully about what is going on here
4361924 we need to stop everything that can be stopped now
4361925 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4361926 thou shalt not kill unless the court says its okay

4361930 i think our bigger fear was that we didnt want to offend any religious people
4361931 but looking at the discussion that unfolded from this thing what we had was a good sizable group of players that we might call militant atheists and the rest of the players seemed very tolerant including all of the religious players
4361932 i didnt expect to hit hot buttons on the atheist side as much i expected it on the religious side
4361933 but so far ive had no critical feedback at all from anybody who is religious feeling that we were misrepresenting religion or it was bad to represent religion in the game it was really the atheists
4361934 obviously as the player youre coming in and playing something like a god directing the evolution of a species but we never really state who you the player are
4361935 ive always been very much into constitutional rights and gun rights
4361936 it seems retarded that you cant protect yourself on an open campus its ridiculous
4361937 people think were trying to force guns everywhere and its going to be a bloodbath but thats not the case
4361938 i dont have a lot of confidence that a college kid with a gun or any untrained person for that matter will get into a successful shootout with a bad guy
4361939 this is one of the craziest ideas anyone has ever thought of
4361940 the permit holder might be the all american kid who has never done anything wrong in his or her life
4361941 but what if they live in the dorms the roommate might be a moron
4361942 its unfortunate but when a kid goes on campus and starts shooting it gives attention to our cause
4361943 voy regularmente a los estados unidos y cuando vi la foto directamente sab a que se trataba de la ciudad estadounidense no de la nuestra

4361947 when you are ready lana you contact me i will be here
4361948 you dont have to do those things if you dont want to
4361949 yo ve a que mi familia gastaba muchos recursos en dietas para poder bajar de peso pero nada les funcionaba y entonces yo me dije soy igual a estas personas por lo que a m tampoco me va a funcionar
4361950 yo tuve esta adicci n porque ten a un refrigerador lleno pero pudo haber sido alcohol en su lugar por ejemplo
4361951 vengo de una familia en donde no se habla de lo que se siente y en donde no se hablan de las emociones y yo me empiezo a comer mis emociones
4361952 es como el malestar de la cultura de freud donde lo que no se menciona no existe vivimos en una cultura donde las apariencias son muy importantes y por eso debes ocultar tus sentimientos y los comedores compulsivos comenzamos a aislarnos de la sociedad
4361953 las tienditas de la esquina siempre te ofrecen todas las drogas legales los chocolates los marinela y todas las harinas refinadas con az car todo lo que tiene que ver con una nutrici n que no te nutre
4361954 uno come cosas para que se libere endorfina y se puede aliviar el dolor emocional anestecian las emociones de tu vida fue cuando entr al grupo que me di cuenta el da o que me hac a al deformar mi cuerpo
4361955 no se trata de hacer ejercicio o tener fuerza de voluntad sino que es un problema que tiene que ver con las emociones de las personas que padecen obesidad
4361956 est s de acuerdo con la prohibici n de las minifaldas como medida contra el acoso
4361957 a mi no me parece justo que una chava tenga que vestirse de cierta manera para no provocar a los hombres
4361958 para ser parejos que proh ban a los hombres andar sin camisa o en camiseta que les proh ban el uso del traje y la corbata porque seg n muchas mujeres se ven muy atractivos
4361959 yo tambi n tengo el derecho de caminar por las calles a las 3 de la madrugada por un barrio inseguro cargado de joyas relojes de oro y una maleta con 1 mill n de d lares en efectivo si me asaltan no es mi culpa
4361960 este es un caso extremadamente raro de coinfecci n en una relaci n mon gama controlada que demuestra la forma en que un sistema inmunol gico fuerte impide la multiplicaci n del virus y la infecci n de otras c lulas
4361961 cuando hay especies que son muy sensibles a los cambios en el h bitat en el que se encuentran lo que sucede es que se mueren pero cuando se trata de especies m s resistentes como los cocodrilos o los osos lo que hacen es buscar nuevas zonas donde vivir y en las cuales alimentarse y en esa b squeda es cuando invaden zonas en las que en teor a no deber an estar
4361962 es decir si se encuentran osos los comenzar n a matar hasta que se acaben
4361963 why cant she ever learn that this wont make my eyes any less fucked up
4361964 give it a rest alon youll give yourself a heart attack with your blood pressure
4361965 grandfather we may be hebrew but were not jewish anymore
4361966 i fled my home i risked everything for my faith and my son and his family renounce it like its nothing
4361967 thats where you are mistaken boy the mark on you is proof of your forefathers
4361968 youre blood is a gift and youre an unworthy child to have it
4361969 you best find what youre looking for wanderer before you are lost
4361970 that is it why cant you ever leave him alone
4361971 and do you know what happens when they do they rot and become food for everything else no god to take their soul
4361972 i swear the bad taste in my mouth every time i pass the monarchs gets worse
4361973 one that skirt is far to short to be dress code two those stockings are black and are higher than required she wants to get more attention at her lower half
4361974 three she just gave someone head and four 20 bucks said it wasnt her boyfriend john
4361975 even if i were it would still be better than being catholic
4361976 jews dont believe he was the messiah thats savior for you under educated christians
4361977 especially when your considered a man at 13 knowledge is sacred
4361978 id like to start the class by saying a happy birthday to arvad
4361979 well today we are at genesis 4 the story of cain and abel
4361980 cain was the first child of adam and eve abel was the second
4361981 cain became a farmer and abel became a sheppard when cain made an offering of his finest crop it was refused by god and his brother abels offering of a young fat lamb cain killed abel and god cursed cain he was exiled to the eden god cursed him with a mark the vav
4361982 the mark is the hebrew character for the number 6 the number of evil cain pleaded with god before he was exiled whoever saw the mark on cain would know that he was the first murder of all mankind and would try to avenge abel god gave cain mercy and another punishment he would have to live with the guilt of murder as long as he should live the mark became a sign of protection whoever harmed cain or a barer of the mark would receive a fate sevenfold worse than the harm put on cain
4361983 i remembered saying it was a stupid tattoo and you got all pissed and said it was a birthmark
4361984 i dont think discussing about my body is apart of the curriculum
4361985 wait you have the mark of evil and your name is the same as the worlds first murderer
4361986 you tell me to stop standing up for myself and you let them completely tear me apart
4361987 this is religious discussion and study we were discussing the story of cain and abel
4361988 letting big mouth tell private things about my body then allowing queen slut of the school make the assumption of me being the son of a murderer
4361989 you knew that she would make everyone believe that ms bells hands balled into fists cain
4361990 youre worse than the rest of them youre all so stupid if you knew anything about your own fucking faith you would know that cain built a city he named after his son the whole fucking city and his bloodline was destroyed in the great fucking flood
4361991 god made the fucking flood you think he could suffer his own curse
4361992 pretty unlikely or it would prove gods a fucking idiot
4361993 but i could have still heard you even if you werent
4361994 unless you were in the class you have to be making this up
4361995 your whole bloodline escaped the great flood along with your patriarch
4361996 but there are lost books that were banished i will tell you what truly happened to cain before he had his first child what jehovahs curse really became
4361997 i will not harm you i have come to free you
4361998 after cain came to the cain found this is his exile lilith fell in love with cain she laid with him and discovered the true power coming from the curse of god cain became tired of staying with lilith unable to have children lilith would not let him go he killed her taking her knowledge with him and with this he built the city of while building the city he was visited by 4 arch angels michael was first offering him the lords mercy cain refused and was cursed with the weakness of fire uriel came offering him redemption cain refused and was cursed with the fear of the sun gabriel came offering him retribution cain again refused and was cursed with the thirst for blood and immortality finally raphael offered him a way to be saved but only if he sought it himself the weaknesses were not without new strengths not needing the light of day he gained the powers of darkness with the weakness to fire he gained the power to pass on his curse with the thirst for blood he gained the ability to consume the very person he fed on in mind and spirit taking all their life experiences talents and strength unto himself making him stronger with every victim
4361999 that one was a reverse in the eyes of cain that was truly a gift because he could be worshiped as a god so raphael was thought to have made a mistake
4362000 but that gift was the curse that would bring the demise to cain
4362001 so you made the connection that he became the vampire of legend
4362002 the reason why your family is not a clan of vampires is because you are the human decadents of cain also
4362003 you have the perfect mark the exact mark of cain you are the only other one than cain to have it exactly perfect it was if you were touched by god yourself
4362004 cain became bored after surviving the flood he eventually went into sleep and with the patriarch of all the vampires asleep the third generation or the antediluvians made their clans and started their conquest of the world this has become a problem as time has progressed some of the antediluvians have tried to claim a government others are wild and animalistic all that matters now is that they are on the brink of exposing the underworld to mortals which i cannot allow
4362005 i have tried but he has shielded himself from being found from anyone
4362006 it seems he either does not care the destruction his children are doing unto themselves and the world or he simply does not know
4362007 do you think that my blood has some way of locating cain
4362008 but i do not need to find cain i doubt he would awaken for me he did kill me once i need you to become a patriarch
4362009 if i were a vampire and sired you you would be my servant by blood the reason i need you is because you are pure just like cain was
4362010 you grandfather and your teacher you refused redemption and retribution but you have not been offered mercy yet if you were made now you would never have the weakness to fire like the rest do if you became a patriarch you would have power that only exists in you and cain but you would eventually develop different ones since you are not cain himself you would be able to purge the world of the master less vampires and free to start your own empire of the night in your image
4362011 do not fear i have learned many secrets of the world and universe from the fruit of the tree of knowledge i know how to cheat death and how to come back from it
4362012 but how does having sex with you and killing you turn me into a vampire
4362013 if we stop driving our cars tomorrow if every american stopped driving a car tomorrow for good we would still need five million barrels of oil a day to supply our other needs rubber plastic nylon aerosols rosins solvents lubricants non can exist without oil maybelline the cosmetics company came to be in existence because a woman named mabel decided to mix some product with vaseline which is a derivative of oil in a fascinating way and maybelline was born you put lipstick eye shadow and foundation on it wouldnt be possible without oil in fact even these windmills and all of these alternative energy things still need some form of oil for lubrication of the moving parts
4362014 why would a god damn fucking computer be out here you idiot
4362015 sou o nico candidato que eleito conseguir fazer os investimentos que o munic pio precisa os outros n o t m como conseguir
4362016 ano passado o deputado inoc ncio oliveira pr conseguiu r 10 milh es para realizar obras de infra estrutura e o dinheiro n o foi empregado na cidade porque a prefeitura estava devendo

4362019 to get two away goals was a bonus and after the first half the manager brought us in and just told us what we had to do everyone needed to up their work rate and keep the ball a little bit and that is what we did
4362020 it was a tough game and i thought they played well in the first half
4362021 in the second half they did well too but that was the real st pats in the second half we showed the swedes that we could play and hopefully we can finish the job in dublin and try to get through to the next round

4362112 how do you tell somebody you are after winning the lotto everybody kind of thinks youre joking at the start i think they will all know now that im not lying
4362113 my parents didnt believe me when i told them my dad started laughing i told him honestly im not joking id say they were in shock
4362114 he could shoot a 65 or an 85 after hearing this
4362115 i woke up this morning and got my breakfast i decided to look at my lotto ticket to see how i got on i put on teletext and looked at the numbers i had to look at it about five times
4362116 i even turned off the telly and put it back on five minutes later to see again to make sure i wasnt dreaming
4362117 i was on the way home and i said id just go in and do the lotto not even sure how much it was for
4362118 here is a club penguin account to start the opening of my blog
4362119 i got calls from various places including kashmir asking about attacks on muslims i told them that all these are rumours and we are safe here
4362120 there is no question of leaving jammu nobody has attacked us these are rumours being spread by some vested interests jammu has been a perfect example of communal harmony we were offered refuge when our own people in kashmir disowned us
4362121 all kashmiri muslims who migrated to jammu were against armed insurgency in the valley we protested against the exodus of kashmiri pandits however the extremists started targeting us
4362122 people of jammu are not against the kashmiris or muslims or kashmiriyat but they are dead against the politics of imperialism practiced by muftis abdullahs and the ilk
4362123 the home ministry on wednesday released figures countering the claim of agitationists in the valley about the economic blockade and arguing that truckers and unions of fruit growers openly aligned with hurriyat were also engaged in myth making about the blockade
4362124 overall the farm sector still lags its potential due to underinvestment in previous years the full year production could also be hampered by high fertilizer and oil prices
4362125 its too early to make a call on the year end figure we have to study the third quarter trends we have to study the impact of lower fertilizer sales
4362126 you have lower fertilizer usage and sales all over the country
4362127 its my estimation that every man ever got astatue made of him was one kind of sommbitch or another aint about you bout what they need

4362133 was wir tun ist dass wir diesen t zellen wieder eine brille aufsetzen

4362139 being on a new team youve got to go out and prove you belong
4362140 as a veteran youve got to prove you belong and you still have it
4362141 he needs to develop game ready conditioning being able to go the first and into the second quarter saturday night is going to be important
4362142 and we need to see where he is as far as injuries are concerned hopefully he doesnt get nicked up if we see that then well know some other things about him like the injury factor so we want to see him come out of this game with a clean bill of health and some good successful runs
4362143 we were going to have to go out there and test it sooner or later and i felt good about it
4362144 i havent had any setbacks it wasnt stiff at all so i felt really good
4362145 id like to see his toughness to stay in there
4362146 and what kind of conditioning hes in i want to see his reading of the schemes his understanding of what hes learned through the otas and training camp
4362147 i hope we see the type of veteran we expect him to be a guy who can come in and be a starter at any time smart enough to not break any assignments and tough enough to just be able to carry the team
4362148 bahwa tujuan zionisme adalah menciptakan sebuah negara israel di bumi palestina yang dijamin oleh hukum internasional
4362149 ave a seat i gotta throw this in the dryer
4362150 i went to the woods because i wished to live deliberately to front only the essential facts of life and see if i could not learn what it had to teach and not when i came to die discover that i had not lived
4362151 geloof is aannemen wat wij niet zien en de beloning voor geloof is zien wat wij aannemen
4362152 i dont know i havent done much research on this hike but there is a waterfall at the end
4362153 politiek bedrijven vraagt om een ander vocabulaire dan wanneer we evangeliseren
4362154 a full review of the facts is in process so that we and the family may have a clear picture of the circumstances surrounding this tragic and extraordinary event
4362155 they came here and i guess they told him to take gatorade and just left him
4362156 i just came from football practice and i think i need an iv or something i think im just dehydrated and need an iv
4362157 dehydration may have played a role in his death but this is not certain nor even that he was dehydrated
4362158 he was biting my legs he bit on his mouthpiece
4362159 any time a 17 year old whos apparently ok dies after theyve been seen by some kind of medical personnel you wonder if anything could have been done differently
4362160 i think we owe that explanation to the family and we owe it to people who call 911
4362161 thanks to safer vehicles aggressive law enforcement and our efforts countless families were spared the devastating news that a loved one was not coming home
4362162 the more he talked the deeper he dug the hole
4362163 earth to john the national enquirer now officially has more credibility than you do
4362164 i dont think there has been an intentional distancing as a result of this it was already expected that he would not be returning to the center
4362165 he had an uncommon sense of devotion to this place there were no limits on his hours and dedication he lived the work
4362166 i sided with the students basically and it was a wonderful thing that the chief administrative officer of the campus was going against the trustees wishes on a matter of principle
4362167 the current value of risk to farmers is almost double our annual premium and thats not tenable
4362168 were not allowed to charge customers for those costs so it all comes out of company reserves
4362169 i think it was a little bit of healing for the neighborhood perhaps
4362170 theyre saying here is my cat here is my dog and i am here because i cannot afford to feed this animal i cannot afford vet care
4362171 i came in one day and found a carrier and a note with a vet bill that said please take care of him
4362172 i actually have a fish in my office right now that somebody who had been evicted from their home apparently left behind
4362173 he needs somebody who can take him to the vet on a regular basis and maybe somebody who has more than one animal so he can have companions if i cant afford one animal i sure cant afford two
4362174 he loves to go traveling and to ride in the car and stuff and i cant even do that because my car is broke down and i cant afford to have it fixed
4362175 theyve had to downsize and cant take the pets with them or they cant keep up with the cost of vet bills things like that
4362176 theyll say well we just cant afford to care for it anymore
4362177 if people are having problems with money they may not initially give the dog up
4362178 they may skimp on the food or not bring it to the vet for shots itll take longer to see the effects from that
4362179 it is important for all agencies state and local to think about the emergence of an aging population and begin planning and preparing for that now
4362180 that includes staying fresh with skills to make sure we remain marketable
4362181 you can look at it doom and gloom but i prefer to look at it as an opportunity
4362182 she was getting used to her class when the rug was pulled out from under her
4362183 i am so angry and so mad and have so much hate in my heart that i cant vent like i want to
4362184 its all because of a number that you deemed him mentally retarded
4362185 mental retardation is not an excuse for what he did it is not a defense to what he did it did not cause him to commit this crime
4362186 a mutually satisfactory resolution is always preferable to litigation but the outcome of our discussions remains to be seen
4362187 we got a little lucky and were also a little bit good
4362188 they pay people to talk to them were not in a position to do that
4362189 again and again in trying to pursue this story we would be asked by people who were central to it whats in it for me theyve the enquirer offered me 50 000 what do you have we have a cup of coffee so were at a disadvantage there
4362190 this is true we do pay sources and this is a case where we were able to use that policy to get the truth
4362191 there were quite a few people who worked on the event and hosted it
4362192 so theres no way of knowing who would have raised which money
4362193 we are investing significant time resources and manpower to ensure north carolina stays red in november
4362194 ultimately elections come down to the issues most important to north carolina families hardworking families are looking for a candidate who will keep their taxes low create jobs strengthen our national security and work to find innovative solutions to reduce the prices at the pump
4362195 if i didnt have that on itd be black and blue tonight
4362196 we never really get that much stuff taken mostly damage
4362197 so this is major compared to anything else that has happened i dont think these thieves care about what we do
4362198 we have extreme problems in the west but at least the message is getting out
4362199 were definitely in a little better shape than last year
4362200 even if we were to get a repeat of last year the fact that were starting off with 90 percent of supply is going to help
4362201 they used direct mail solicitation previously unknown to us that implied the mailing was from the senior centers
4362202 we now are aware that they periodically used these opportunities to sell their hearing aids to some participants retail sales of products through the senior centers is forbidden and they knew that
4362203 as a result of their marketing program some people were invited back for further testing with some of these targeted to buy the beltone hearing aids
4362204 a few people who qualified based on income received free hearing aids but these are provided through the n c department of health and human services not through beltone
4362205 sometimes i think we largely fool ourselves in this community we study all this stuff about evolution and genetics well guess what if everything is genetics and the behavioural and emotional circuitry of women is hardwired and beyond their control as mystery says then the same must be true about us men too most of the guys i have met that do well seem to have been fairly confident most of their life so maybe some of us have just been hardwired to be awkward beta males and there isnt jack shit we can do about it because it is all genetics
4362206 if you do this right she cant help being attracted
4362207 this study will be critical to our working out a reasoned policy on this hot potato issue
4362208 im against allowing illegal immigrants who can never work legally in north carolina to attend community colleges in north carolina
4362209 if they have the desire to learn then they need to get that opportunity
4362210 to punish them because of something that their parents did to me thats not right
4362211 it is possible to craft policies to support our open door philosophy while also addressing many of the concerns expressed by north carolinians
4362212 it just so happens that my family and i ran into abercrombie amp fitch not victorias secret that day
4362213 i have reviewed practice films he has sent to me and given him a few tips including a suggestion to try out different shoes on the practice track and figure out what works best for the rain conditions

4362251 there are people who are advising him to avoid confrontation but i dont think he has made up his mind
4362252 it is at the moment that pakistan cannot afford confrontation
4362253 and its obvious that the present government and president musharraf cannot get along so it is in the best interest of pakistan that some way is found whereby this mode of confrontation can be changed or can be more conciliatory
4362254 should safe passage be given to someone who has done this to pakistan
4362255 he wants safe passage by breaking pakistans law he wants safe passage by breaking pakistans constitution he is asking for safe passage by selling out pakistans sovereignty

4362305 there is not a normal functioning market for property at present and providing short term liquidity is a challenge and comes at a price we remain determined to provide this liquidity unlike funds who have invoked long redemption deferrals

4362324 michael dolan is a born leader a leader of criminals
4362325 basically we are simplifying and coalescing our efforts around atom as the single brand for internet devices
4362326 if an independent software vendor discovers that they have shipped a vulnerable activex control they should e mail us to work with microsoft to issue a kill bit disabling that control
4362327 this is right in line with microsofts presentation at black hat
4362328 they said many times that they are working as a coalition to better secure the windows operating system and everything which runs on it
4362329 while microsoft has issued a few kill bits in the past for third party products this is something we are going to continue to see going forward
4362330 no one has a bigger embedded user base than office
4362331 what we see happening is companies like webex connect salesforce com microsoft and google are trying to fence in their little area of the cloud
4362332 you sign into salesforce com in the morning and stay there all day
4362333 you can view and edit your documents in expresso but be inside any of those platforms
4362334 you may reassign a software license but not on a short term basis i e not within 90 days of the last assignment
4362335 technically the virtual machine would have to remain on the same physical machine for three months
4362336 within a few months were going to see those changes
4362337 virtualization licensing and support lethargy curing the disease that stalls virtualization adoption
4362338 allowing standard edition windows server os licenses to be assigned directly to a vm and move with a vm without restriction is all that is needed for microsoft to offer the most nearly ideal licensing terms
4362339 vendors are working hard to come up with schemas that work well and are fair to them and the end customer
4362340 youve got the ability to spin up additional virtual machines as your processing demands increase
4362341 the difficulty with software licensing is how you keep track of how many virtual machines how many applications or how many iterations of the operating system youre running at any time its an interesting can of worms
4362342 its very inconvenient well probably have to address the issue at some point
4362343 there are still vendors who have no clearly defined licensing policy for virtual environments
4362344 you have to pay for all available cpus on a physical server
4362345 we have an enterprise site license for oracle so its not really an issue
4362346 as you start to deploy virtual machines you are deploying more operating systems that need to be licensed and metered
4362347 every time you tell your systems management tool that you want to spin up a new virtual machine all of a sudden youre deploying operating system and application licenses to people whether you like it or not
4362348 it would be really nice if we could just have a very simple licensing model thats not the case today
4362349 vendors are honestly trying to do the right thing here
4362350 the trick for them is to develop a model that is fair to them and protects their revenues is fair to their clients and is something thats going to be able to last for a few years they dont like to have to change licensing models on a whim

4362422 i had sex with my husband the other night for the first time in ages and it put me in such a good mood i decided not to be cross with him for the next two days
4362423 and having no sleep in two years but also feeling like all the ahem equipment has been well left out in the rain
4362424 you must find the time to get it all out and give it a good hard polish from time to time because your marriage depends upon it
4362425 i researched this thing i didnt just get any old dirty movie i went onto a special site that sells movies to women good movies with stories and good lighting the one i bought has won an award
4362426 thats what im saying i dont want to just see a bunch of people rooting i want to watch a story
4362427 and then you want to watch a bunch of people rooting
4362428 you cannot tell me that your porno dvd has a story it may have good lighting and it may even win an award for just that but i find it impossible to believe it would have a strong narrative dramatic tension believeable plot engaging characters and a bunch of people rooting each other
4362429 and it is something about pirates but i cant remember the name
4362430 ive got the receipt here and i actually bought it in may

4362446 the confidence expressed by some observers that weaker economic growth will lead to a damping of inflation pressures is in my opinion premature
4362447 they boxed themselves in and it became hard to retreat it is clear from the august bulletin that they have now really woken up to the downturn

4362522 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4362523 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4362524 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4362525 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4362526 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4362531 this new research is tremendously exciting as firstly the biological brain controls its own moving robot body and secondly it will enable us to investigate how the brain learns and memorises its experiences
4362532 this research will move our understanding forward of how brains work and could have a profound effect on many areas of science and medicine
4362533 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
4362534 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1

4362543 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect sen obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again
4362544 in a sense theyve got obama hostage and are exacting their ransom
4362545 in my view shes sticking up for her delegates and shes going to take a lot of heat for this

4362558 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4362559 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4362560 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4362561 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4362562 oh finn this tea is so delicious what kind of tea is it
4362563 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4362564 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4362565 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4362566 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4362567 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4362568 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4362569 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4362570 who are open to doing something on the production side
4362571 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4362572 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4362573 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4362574 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4362575 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4362576 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4362577 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4362578 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4362579 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4362580 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4362581 in july fixed asset investment again accelerated to a certain extent
4362582 thats positive for tackling the issues arising from a weakening in external demand
4362583 urban fixed asset investment has maintained a growth level of about 25 percent every month
4362584 i think pilates would be great as a healing thing with the miscarriage to strengthen that
4362585 i think the afl are up there checking it right now and well obviously have a look at it later on today
4362586 we wanted it to be suitable to play an afl game we will demand that get the best of foxtel
4362587 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4362588 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4362589 if we didnt comply with the request they might take away the business in fact it was forced we had no choice but to achieve it
4362590 in the worst case i want my life insurance money to be used to liquidate my company
4362591 is toyota unable to see the mom and pop suppliers at their feet
4362592 is this an example of the pride toyota fears so much
4362593 im telling you as a toyota veteran come back when youve fixed your attitude
4362594 these are your seniors who have spent years with sweat on their brow we exist today thanks to their efforts
4362595 perhaps toyota has become too big and can no longer spare the attention to look after the small companies
4362596 all that connects us with toyota is money any sense that i am serving toyota is gone
4362597 we immediately dispatched the westpac rescue helicopter from christchurch with a st john advanced paramedic on board to tekapo
4362598 because of the severe weather conditions it was not possible to send the rescue helicopter to the site of the incident
4362599 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4362600 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4362601 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4362602 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4362603 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4362604 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4362605 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4362606 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
4362607 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
4362608 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
4362609 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
4362610 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
4362611 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
4362612 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4362613 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4362614 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4362615 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4362616 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill

4362618 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
4362619 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
4362620 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
4362621 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
4362622 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4362623 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4362624 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4362625 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4362626 in case you are wondering what the best selling pc game in north america was for the third week of july 2008 according to the retail sales figures compiled by npd well it wasnt devil may cry 4 which received a score of 8 awesome from games radar nor was it mass effect which received a score of 9 awesome from games radar nope it was little ol nancy drew the phantom of venice now isnt that a crock of seven out of ten

4362629 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4362630 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4362631 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4362632 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4362633 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4362634 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4362635 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4362636 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4362637 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4362638 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4362639 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4362640 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4362641 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4362642 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4362643 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4362644 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4362645 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4362646 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4362647 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4362648 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4362649 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4362650 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4362651 oscar said he wasnt budging it was take it or leave it manny opted to pass
4362652 i tried that as late as 15 20 minutes ago oscar will not fight him
4362653 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
4362654 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
4362655 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4362656 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4362657 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4362658 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4362659 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4362660 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4362661 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4362662 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4362663 but when you get on the field its all worth it
4362664 he called me two years ago in the off season and said were looking to put a team in st
4362665 i had been doing a lot of camps and clinics and he knew how much i loved working with kids
4362666 its only three hours from home so the family can come and see me when we have home games
4362667 my love is hitting and i enjoy teaching kids how to hit
4362668 ive been doing what hes told me the whole year
4362669 when i feel like im doing something wrong or i dont feel right hitting i talk to him hes been able to help me out
4362670 he always expects you to play hard play 100 percent every day
4362671 its more cut throat here than i thought it was going to be
4362672 you dont really have time to take on projects overhaul kids and turn them into great athletes
4362673 sure the defendants will argue that criminal activities committed by mr tang was a superseding cause of mr bachmans death but dont we have a special and unique circumstance here does the defendant s owe the deceased a heightened level of duty of care mr bachman was an invitee and those in charge of securing the bell tower had a duty to make that place reasonably safe and secure for folks like him further those in charge had a duty to adequately train their security personnel so that the popular tourist destination would be reasonably safe and secure in addition since those in charge of security knew or should have known that more visitors were coming to the bell tower which enhances the odds of harm and danger to invitees like mr bachman they have the duty to provide adequate security as reasonably prudent men would but they failed miserably an attacker was able to get into the crowd injure a few individuals and fatally attack another before he committed suicide where were the security guards what were they doing when the attack was happening had there been adequate security mr bachman would not have been fatally attacked and killed consequently had there been adequate security personnel with adequate training mr bachman would not have been so brutally killed by his assailant therefore it was the negligence of the parties providing security at the bell tower that proximately caused mr bachmans death

4362722 during this time he allowed huge increases in day to day spending financed by unsustainable property revenues and stalled public sector reform and abandoned any discipline over value for money

4362752 massachusetts will lead the way in reducing the emissions that threaten the planet with climate change
4362753 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
4362754 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
4362755 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
4362756 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
4362757 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
4362758 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
4362759 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
4362760 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
4362761 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
4362762 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
4362763 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
4362764 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
4362765 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
4362766 this isnt about how fast someone can download a full length movie
4362767 speed matters to our economy and our ability to remain competitive in a global marketplace rural development telemedicine and distance learning all rely on truly high speed universal networks
4362768 the test results demonstrate the critical need for the senate to pass s 1492 the broadband data improvement act to move the u s toward a national broadband policy
4362769 earlier this year the house of representatives passed a similar measure the broadband census of america act to support the collection of data about broadband deployment
4362770 construct an infrastructure with enough capacity for 10 mbps downstream and 1 mbps upstream by 2010
4362771 we are the only industrialized nation without a national policy to promote universal high speed internet access and it shows
4362772 most of our speed test users logged on with broadband connections such as dsl modem or fiber people with dial up connections didnt take the test because it took them too long so even these dismal statistics paint a rosier than reality picture of connection speeds across the country
4362773 at least al gore may have something to be happy about
4362774 we must lower gas prices and a chicken in every pot for every voting american
4362775 a career legacy politician who fell hook line and sinker for the administrations case for a disastrous war and dragged much of our party with him would undermine both
4362776 ive lent my crystal ball to someone so i cant give you the figure
4362777 whats barack obamas energy solution nothing but a bunch of hot air really
4362778 barack obama wants you to inflate your car tires yes thats right inflate your tires thats barack obamas solution to the high gas prices we pay in new mexico every day
4362779 this is the same barack obama who told a crowd of wealthy san francisco liberals that people who live in small towns cling to their religion and guns because theyre bitter
4362780 now he opposes producing more oil and gas here at home and opposes lowering your gas tax this summer
4362781 we could save all the oil theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups
4362782 now he opposes producing more oil and gas here at home
4362783 largest selection and variety of tools in the united states for filling tires and checking tire pressure
4362784 if john mccain put more money into s s then he should get more money out that is completely fair
4362785 and in the same election thank you for this miracle diebold
4362786 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
4362787 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
4362788 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
4362789 a weaker economy soaring gas prices growing dependence on foreign oil and a worsening climate crisis
4362790 theres a bold new solution for all of these challenges
4362791 join the more than one million people who are already demanding we switch on a brighter future
4362792 the olympics are a time for all americans to reflect on our nations achievements and what we as a people can do together
4362793 choosing the right path and re powering our nation is something we can do and something that will benefit us all
4362794 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
4362795 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
4362796 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
4362797 the vast expanses of glaciers massed on average 1 6 miles deep contain enough water to raise sea levels worldwide by 23 feet should they melt or otherwise slip into the ocean they would flood coastal capitals submerge tropical islands and generally redraw the worlds atlases the infusion of fresh water could slow or shut down the oceans currents plunging europe into bitter winter
4362798 this is distinctly alarmist and part of mr gores wake up call it is common ground that if greenland melted it would release this amount of water but only after and over millennia so that the armageddon scenario he depicts is not based on any scientific view
4362799 no rule to pursue but such as he prescribes to himself
4362800 should be as little dependent as possible on those of the others
4362801 if it be wished that my relation to the bank be continued it may be well to send me the usual retainer
4362802 that the dependency of private funding simply shifts the focus of congress thats all and if so is this really the issue to worry about
4362803 whom i think it does compromise they feel like they have to ameliorate or change their position for fear of losing certain contributions
4362804 it is very difficult for me to accept that people dont consciously or subconsciously tailor their views to where they know the sources of campaign funding can be
4362805 how are we going to raise money from those guys if we deregulate them
4362806 should the public come to believe that the scientific issues are settled their views about global warming will change accordingly therefore you need to continue to make the lack of scientific certainty a primary issue in the debate
4362807 as real a revolution in the principles of government as that of 1776 was in its form
4362808 it wouldnt have taken a genius long to recognize the corrupting influence of money in american politics
4362809 but it took me a long time to recognize it
4362810 i also agree that the worlds problems arent caused by global warming
4362811 our dangerous over reliance on carbon based fuels is at the core of all three of these challenges the economic environmental and national security crises
4362812 so i ask you to join with me to call on every candidate at every level to accept this challenge for america to be running on 100 percent zero carbon electricity in 10 years
4362813 we need to act now this is a generational moment a moment when we decide our own path and our collective fate
4362814 have warned that there is now a 75 percent chance that within five years the entire north polar ice cap will completely disappear during the summer months
4362815 the arctic ocean was much warmer than it is now for several millennia after the end of the last ice age we know this because there are trees buried in the tundra along what is now the arctic shore
4362816 we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires
4362817 herald a post civil rights america any more than his victory in november will mean that race as an issue has been vanquished in america
4362818 i am not persuaded that 20 000 additional troops in iraq is going to solve the sectarian violence there in fact i think it will do the reverse
4362819 we just have to slow down our economy and cut back our greenhouse gas emissions because we have to save the planet for our grandchildren
4362820 higher superstition the academic left and its quarrels with science
4362821 because in math and organic chemistry you find truths someone cannot say 2 2 5 or that a carbon molecule no longer has a molecular weight of 12
4362822 we took three days and the criticism lasted weeks and weeks it looked like we spent five weeks lying on the beach and we spent two hours
4362823 we havent used a drop of gasoline in a month and a half two months
4362824 going through the generator is 4 2 gallons a day every work day
4362825 it cost seven or eight dollars when i first started now it costs 32 a can
4362826 this is not new technology we just stumbled onto one spot where its working and working really well
4362827 republican presidential candidate john mccain now enjoys a healthy 88 7 percent lead over barack obama among republicans
4362828 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
4362829 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
4362830 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh
4362831 im all about biden for many reasons the first being hes the most qualified
4362832 he has excellent experience he has been in the senate since 1985 and he serves on the armed services committee
4362833 in late june polls conducted by the wall street journal nbc and fox opinion dynamics using entirely different samples both showed sen clinton giving sen obama a 3 bump pushing him over 51 for the first time when the two of them were paired against sen mccain and gov romney
4362834 most recently in nationwide polling on july 22 23 a fox opinion dynamics poll showed a more dramatic bump of 8 with sen clinton as sen obamas vice presidential running mate in a head on match it was sen obama 41 to sen mccains 40 this was before the intense media coverage of his european trip but with exactly the same sample when all voters were presented with the choice of an obama clinton ticket vs mccain romney the results were obama clinton 48 7 and mccain romney 39 1
4362835 according to the july 22 23 fox opinion dynamics poll in an obama mccain head on match up sen
4362836 so what about independents an obama clinton ticket appears to gain some strength in this critical swing voter group with an obama mccain head on contest independents are evenly divided 32 30 with sen obama over sen mccain but with an obama clinton ticket vs a mccain romney ticket the independents favor obama clinton 38 30 a statistically significant 6 increase in a crucial voter group
4362837 i too think senator kerry is a brilliant man who clearly beat bush in the debates by miles but he does not inspire much respect in the general population which is incredibly unfair
4362838 senator clintons poorly run campaign her inability to concede error and the irresponsible behavior of bill make me think she would not be a good president should she need to step in
4362839 but why did hillary give up we dont do that here this we do not understand if obama picks her as a partner he will be considered weak by much of the world
4362840 the answer is simple to power our country with 100 clean energy in ten years all we need is your help
4362841 without the slightest doubt the technology for a hydrogen economy exists or can be developed in reasonable time
4362842 the problem of maximizing power from sunlight has been known for at least 30 years and is primarily one of physical limitations not engineering technology
4362843 its the first big unequivocal test about what this possible president really thinks
4362844 youve got to be sure that you get the right person the person has got to be of presidential stature has got to be someone you can be comfortable with work with and help you as president compatibility is very crucial
4362845 the chemistry between us had been correct but not warm
4362846 you dont want it to be a reason for people to question your judgment
4362847 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
4362848 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
4362849 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
4362850 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
4362851 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
4362852 individualism puts conservatives at a huge disadvantage as the left swarms through the big institutions they love so dearly the education bureaucracy the colleges all the layers of government institutionalized science the liberal media the only thing that saves conservative politicians is the american people if they happen to feel like it
4362853 the greatest tyrannies are always perpetrated in the name of the noblest causes
4362854 government big enough to supply everything you need is big enough to take everything you have the course of history shows that as a government grows liberty decreases
4362855 the issue today is the same as it has been throughout all history whether man shall be allowed to govern himself or be ruled by a small elite
4362856 the clintons with their folie a deux determined to get four presidential terms two for him and two for her
4362857 and the whole shebang coming to a disastrous climax with hitler mussolini and stalin
4362858 considering what the current neo con president has actually succeeded in doing to the balance of power between the branches which far supasses fdrs now feeble looking attempts
4362859 bush has gotten away with dispicable acts that any civilized democracy should not tolerate
4362860 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
4362861 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
4362862 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
4362863 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
4362864 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4362865 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4362866 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
4362867 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
4362868 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
4362869 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
4362870 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
4362871 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
4362872 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
4362873 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4362874 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4362875 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
4362876 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
4362877 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
4362878 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
4362879 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
4362880 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
4362881 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
4362882 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
4362883 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4362884 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
4362885 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
4362886 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
4362887 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4362888 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
4362889 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
4362890 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
4362891 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
4362892 seven words that can change the world reveals the astonishing simple truths that have the power to forever transform our world for the better while freeing our minds from the enslavement of limiting beliefs this is not a text for the simple minded it is a guiding philosophy for the mindful intelligent few who are wise enough to seek out and recognize the higher simplicities of truly purposeful living
4362893 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
4362894 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
4362895 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
4362896 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
4362897 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
4362898 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
4362899 ada apa kok malem malem begini datang ke sini ntar di marahi pak rt harus lapor nanti
4362900 eh kapan harus datang dan ada apa aku harus datang harus datang kemana
4362901 kata ku sedikit terputus putus karena harus lari cepat agar masih bisa bicara dengan angga sebelum dia pergi
4362902 wah mentang punya pacar orang luar negeri jalannya berlagak nih
4362903 mana mungkin hanya anak pedagang kecil berpacaran dengan orang luar negeri
4362904 dan mereka bilang paling mbak ima cuman mau di salah gunakan sama orang luar negeri itu
4362905 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
4362906 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
4362907 m ost of america understands that the competence bar is set so low for gov george w bush of texas that its practically lying on the ground
4362908 doesnt seem to realize that in the real world people hate eddie haskell
4362909 for every complex problem there is a solution that is simple neat and wrong
4362910 de facto slogan has become real men dont think things through
4362911 every day that the campaign is about race is a good day for john mccain
4362912 he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
4362913 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
4362914 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
4362915 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
4362916 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
4362917 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
4362918 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
4362919 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
4362920 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
4362921 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
4362922 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
4362923 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and the planet began to heal
4362924 anybody gone into whole foods lately and seen what they charge for arugula
4362925 as you may know a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
4362926 normally there is something peculiar about us politicians we all have our foibles david cameron is remarkably free of such flaws he does very normal things like go down to tesco and having his bike stolen
4362927 who is this guy what does he what to do what does he mean by change and what has he done
4362928 for climate changes he glosses over that this local planetary system is in constant change and we cant accurately measure the recent relatively small changes and anthropogenic contributions are an open question
4362929 how would the developers in this audience feel if the news media were opining on the benefits of one programming language over another and other people with no knowledge of programming were making strong statements based on what theyd read or heard in the media
4362930 im curious robert whether you are also skeptical about evolution that would be a good litmus test of whether this is a political religious disagreement or a scientific one
4362931 right now your choices are between the scientists who are actually conducting the research and analysis and pundits who are opining on something that they have no data research or proper science to support
4362932 most scientists think that global warming is an issue i think its bunk
4362933 there no agreement among scientists that weather patterns are changing as a result of human activity
4362934 look they are saying there may be the equivalent of war crimes trials one day
4362935 this boat is going to be the toyota prius of the houseboat business
4362936 it is the most eco friendly houseboat anywhere in the country
4362937 gore will consume a lot more fuel driving to and from the lake than he will ever use cruising on this houseboat
4362938 climate confusion how global warming hysteria leads to bad science pandering politicians and misguided policies that hurt the poor
4362939 we are a debt relief agency amp have proudly helped people file for bankruptcy for over 30 yrs
4362940 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
4362941 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
4362942 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
4362943 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
4362944 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
4362945 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
4362946 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
4362947 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
4362948 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
4362949 we are pleased to note ofcom has vindicated the ipccs claim against channel 4 in spirit and in substance
4362950 it is entirely appropriate people should bear a cost if only of unpopularity and criticism for speaking freely however the cost should be reasonable and not disproportionate there should not be in the words of a famous supreme court decision a chilling effect on free speech
4362951 well im voting for barack obama hell help with global warming
4362952 it would take as long as 15 years that is until 2023 to go from starting a pilot plant to proving the technology will work
4362953 we have to store radioactive waste for 250 000 years
4362954 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
4362955 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
4362956 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
4362957 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
4362958 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
4362959 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
4362960 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
4362961 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
4362962 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
4362963 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
4362964 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
4362965 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
4362966 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
4362967 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
4362968 employees here dont know where hell get the ethanol there are only gas pumps here
4362969 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
4362970 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
4362971 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
4362972 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
4362973 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
4362974 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
4362975 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
4362976 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
4362977 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
4362978 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
4362979 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
4362980 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
4362981 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
4362982 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
4362983 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
4362984 and when you get the chance to sit it out or dance i hope you dance
4362985 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
4362986 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
4362987 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
4362988 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
4362989 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
4362990 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
4362991 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
4362992 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
4362993 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
4362994 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
4362995 once again we have an opportunity to take a giant leap for humankind
4362996 when we send money to foreign countries to buy nearly 70 percent of the oil we use every day they build new skyscrapers and we lose jobs when we spend that money building solar arrays and windmills we build competitive industries and gain jobs here at home
4362997 i have long supported a sharp reduction in payroll taxes with the difference made up in co2 taxes we should tax what we burn not what we earn this is the single most important policy change we can make
4362998 we must recognize those who have toiled in dangerous conditions to bring us our present energy supply we should guarantee good jobs in the fresh air and sunshine for any coal miner displaced by impacts on the coal industry
4362999 in recent years our politics has tended toward incremental proposals made up of small policies designed to avoid offending special interests alternating with occasional baby steps in the right direction our democracy has become sclerotic at a time when these crises require boldness
4363000 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil 10 years from now
4363001 more than any time in history mankind faces a crossroads one path leads to despair and utter hopelessness the other to total extinction let us pray that we have the wisdom to choose correctly
4363002 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
4363003 says he has all the answers and it will only cost 3 trillion
4363004 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
4363005 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
4363006 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
4363007 he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
4363008 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
4363009 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
4363010 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
4363011 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
4363012 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
4363013 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
4363014 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
4363015 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
4363016 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
4363017 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
4363018 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
4363019 decisions on substantive matters require nine votes including the concurring votes of all five permanent members this is the rule of great power unanimity often referred to as the veto power
4363020 jesus said that we are to render to god the things that are gods and to caesar those that are caesars our caesar is a government of the people by the people and for the people in order for us to render to caesar the things that are due him we should indeed participate in our government our lord would have it so

4363023 what can we do to make the tabula rasa new player experience great
4363024 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
4363025 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
4363026 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
4363027 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete

4363080 the u s mint buys direct from the refiners and this suspension of gold eagle sales may be an indication that the supply line is already backing up or that the mint expects that it will back up for the rest of the year i wonder who would give up physical metal at these prices and under these circumstances except distressed sellers the central banks are in a hunker down mode as far as i can determine and its the mines that supply the refiners so if the mint which buys from the refiners is having a difficult time locating metal what does that tell you i keep saying that we may get a surprising rubber band effect later in the year when the pre holiday festival season kicks off in september october it may happen sooner one of our indicators of approaching a bottom in gold is how many calls centennial precious metals gets from our u s based indian clientele heres a quote from my offices report to me at the end of the day today today was a good day there must have been an indian convention where someone was handing out usagold business cards that may give you a clue as to thinking in india proper and probably the rest of the asian rim

4363110 is this the cycle that started with the jakarta opec meeting in late 1997 and culminated in the extreme price lows of 1998 and 1999
4363111 or is this similar to the drawn out weakening that started at the beginning of august 2006 with prices about 78 per barrel and culminated in the temporary fall below 50 per barrel in january 2007

4363166 this type of weapon is excellent in close combat where fire arms are not desirable
4363167 this tells us that sleeps role in emotional memory preservation is more than just mechanistic
4363168 in order to preserve what it deems most important the brain makes a tradeoff strengthening the memorys emotional core and obscuring its neutral background
4363169 emotional memories usually contain highly charged elements for example the car that sideswiped us on the ride home along with other elements that are only tangentially related to the emotion such as the name of the street we were traveling on or what store wed just passed
4363170 we were interested in examining whether sleep would affect memory for all of these elements equally or whether sleep might allow some of the event features to decay at a faster rate than others
4363171 our results revealed that the study subjects who stayed awake all day largely forgot the entire negative scene they had seen with their memories of both the central objects and the backgrounds decaying at similar rates
4363172 after an evening of sleep the subjects remembered the emotional items smashed car as accurately as the subjects whose memories had been tested only 30 minutes after looking at the scenes
4363173 by contrast sleep did little to preserve memory for the backgrounds i e street scenes and so memory for those elements reached a comparably low level after a night of sleep as it did after a day spent awake
4363174 this is consistent with the possibility that the individual components of emotional memory become unbound during sleep
4363175 you might say that sleep is actually working at night to decide what memories to hold on to and what to let go of

4363197 manakala keputusan pula tidak boleh dibuat sewenang wenangnya tetapi hendaklah dirujuk kepada parti di semua peringkat
4363198 jangan kita sekali kali leka seolah olah peranan kita hanya untuk musim pilihanraya semata mata dan tidak ada lagi peranan selepas menang dalam pilihanraya
4363199 the only reason youre conscious right now is because i dont want to carry you
4363200 he was in the right frame of mind and wanted to play nothing would have stopped him so that is pleasing
4363201 i have no idea what will happen between now and the end of august
4363202 he knew the consequences of playing tonight so the decision was very much his
4363203 i could not think at all about the game on sunday until we had played tonight but i was very pleased with some of the football we played
4363204 we obviously need to tighten up our defence if we could but i was very pleased to win
4363205 since it is obvious we dont have any chance in the second leg we will concentrate on the league
4363206 i dont think this game will break us down i doubt well play against a team as good as this again this summer
4363207 the game was over before it began we let in two goals in six minutes when there was a total lack of concentration
4363208 i do not know if players showed aston villa too much respect which was not necessary
4363209 if you go two goals behind against such a team at home obviously it will be difficult but we tried and showed sometimes that we are a good attacking team
4363210 but in football you must also play defence and that we did not
4363211 of course i am disappointed we planned to get more out of this game and were hoping to get a good result by that i mean a draw or losing by one goal which meant we would be going out there to possibly put pressure on them
4363212 were asking these state agencies to monitor the situation within their enforcement powers to make sure utahns are not being taken advantage of
4363213 right now theres a laser like focus on this topic
4363214 if there are any suspicious activities or nefarious intent the information will be forwarded to the attorney generals office
4363215 it makes me mad to see were paying so much above the national average im not saying we have to be the lowest but i expect us to be near the national average not near the top
4363216 his own energy director was on the television the other day explaining that were seeing prices follow the typical pattern for this time of year
4363217 the auditors job is to give an opinion about companies financial statements
4363218 said allen who has taught in the david eccles school of business since 1991
4363219 the ground breaking leader in establishing a model of cooperation between academic researchers and standards setters
4363220 i have high hopes for this cooperation in the future
4363221 i have urged all chief ministers to improve and strengthen the public distribution system pds to ensure availability of essential commodities to the common man at reasonable prices
4363222 i know how much each one of you is concerned about the recent rise in prices the inflation we have seen this year is basically due to external factors all over the world and in global markets the price of food fuel and other commodities has been rising we are taking determined measures to bring prices under reasonable control
4363223 our economy must grow at the rate of at least 10 per cent every year to get rid of poverty and generate employment for all
4363224 insulate the poorer sections of society from the full impact of rising food and fuel prices
4363225 all over the world there is growing realisation of the importance of atomic energy to meet the challenge of energy security and climate change
4363226 it is a clean environmental friendly and renewable source of energy
4363227 after almost a decade of stagnation especially from 1998 to 2004 investment in agriculture is increasing and there has been a revival in this area
4363228 quando era pequena eu chegava da escola chorando e perguntava para minha m e por que todo mundo fica me chamando de japonesinha
4363229 quero me aprofundar na cultura culin ria e moda o jap o sempre esteve muito presente na minha vida meus av s maternos moravam na minha casa tinha ofur a gente s comia comida japonesa
4363230 uma atra o refinada tem um estilo matrix e muito atual depois que me envolvi descobri que o programa lida com assunto s rios
4363231 o que voc fez com o neto da band com o godoi da band que trabalham com voc com o milton neves com o fl vio prado coisa de mau car ter de mau colega
4363232 o neto aponta os jogadores porque ele est cego ele n o enxerga ele troca um jogador loiro pelo pel o neto fica com uma canetinha apontando para ele em uma cartolina desse tamanho com o nome dos caras e o n mero da camisa
4363233 os caras d o grana para ele o governo publicidade se for mentira minha prova que eu estou mentindo
4363234 mentira dele ele n o tem diploma nenhum o diploma que ele tem o mesmo que eu tenho que um monte de gente tem a gente n o fez faculdade a gente tem 25 anos de trabalho a gente ganhou o registro de jornalista como se a gente tivesse feito faculdade mas n s n o fizemos faculdade n o que diploma que ele tem para ficar gozando os caras para puxar o saco do sport recife
4363235 estou muito contente ele ser mais um integrante do programa mas pretendo fazer um especial na sua volta sempre fomos amigos e nunca deixamos de nos falar nas datas importantes
4363236 n o acho que ofereci algo para ser indicada n o vou tomar o lugar de uma atriz que mere a isso
4363237 vou ser honesta ele n o deve falar em p blico ponto
4363238 eu estou indignado vou transmitir o jogo hoje quarta feira 11 de junho porque sou obrigado eu por mim n o pisava na ilha do retiro est dio do sport mas nem por decreto porque um jogo s s o 90 minutos de bola quem ganhar ganhou quem n o ganhou bate palma e continua a vida vamos parar com isso onde que n s estamos a imprensa de s o paulo t o que abrindo guerra contra a imprensa do brasil

4363241 we all have to thank him for getting rid of tim sylvia
4363242 we have intelligence inputs about extremist groups planning to target prominent leaders and symbols of national importance
4363243 checking at all the borders has been intensified and spotters from other states have been deployed to identify suspects
4363244 all police officials have been ordered to be on high alert after the blasts in ahmedabad and bangalore
4363245 they are there to help the blind cross the street ok until a garbage truck backs up
4363246 fiquei chateado mas vou continuar comentando os jogos com ele
4363247 ele pisou na bola mas sei que n o foi intencional ele estava nervoso eu tenho diploma sim
4363248 reconheceram que o v deo n o trazia utilidade p blica

4363250 falcon hill is not only hills future it represents northern utahs future
4363251 when you look at the long term viability of the air force base this is critical
4363252 i dont see why he should get off scot free while im left here with nothing
4363253 i turned to drink after what happened to try and blot it out
4363254 it was the only way i could sleep and everything spiralled from there i just want it dealt with so i can get on with my life
4363255 theres still a problem i dont think its gone away the majority of the violence has gone away from the football grounds
4363256 the advantage is that we have a joined up system with the police the crown prosecution service and football intelligence officers
4363257 the rotor blades and the propellers must have a ring around the perimeter so that they dont come into contact with the fingers of a child
4363258 also it did not have the manufacturers details the firm said it was not the importer but it couldnt say who was
4363259 unfortunately officers are regularly subjected to physical abuse broken bones and torn ligaments are relatively common
4363260 on two occasions officers have lost an eye as a result of being attacked the impact of something like that on the officers and their families is with them for the rest of their lives
4363261 i am not surprised that a fifth of victims are women some of the people we deal with have no respect for gender and dont tend to display gentlemanly behaviour
4363262 what the statistics show is that no matter how much protective equipment we give our officers they are still liable to be hurt in an attack body armour cant protect you from a punch in the face which breaks your nose
4363263 we are there to help people not to be assaulted and abused
4363264 i am optimistic that this is a rare piece of local history and it will capture someones imagination
4363265 the mineshaft is still there with its winding gear there are sheds full of equipment including steam driven machines lathes and other tools
4363266 the property has featured in the many television documentaries and films fred made about his life and his passion for our industrial heritage
4363267 ive been fighting the bnp for over 40 years so ive had my fair share of jibes and abuse but this frightened me
4363268 we are investigating a threat to kill recently made on a website we are following a number of inquiries
4363269 we dont believe there is any merit to this lawsuit
4363270 has no merit and we will defend against it vigorously
4363271 this man is going to have a very difficult time while hes going to be incarcerated
4363272 i have come to the conclusion that this attack does not have any particularly aggravating features such as the use of violence but it is an offence which must be visited by a term of imprisonment
4363273 i cannot understand whether they are just being lazy by refusing to help her or whether it is political correctness gone mad but i can guarantee this policy gives her no independence or dignity
4363274 i have found her twice covered in food trying to eat the meal she has got on her nightgown my father has found her several times too and so has one of my brothers it is not hygienic especially as she has c diff and we have also found her sitting in her own food
4363275 she is very weak from the bug and she does not have good health anyway she has had very good medical care in the hospital but the standard of personal care is totally unacceptable
4363276 we are sorry the family have had cause to raise concerns
4363277 when we treat patients we try to let them maintain as much independence as possible and at meal times this may lead to food spills if a patients hand movements are unsteady
4363278 we encourage patients to eat well during their stay and monitor them regularly to make sure that any issues are addressed
4363279 in mrs langs case we have increased the level of support and supervision during meal times this involves a staff member being in attendance at meal times to offer assistance as and when she requires it and to ensure that any spillage is cleared up promptly
4363280 the ward manager has discussed mrs langs meal arrangements in great detail with family members
4363281 if enough of us join forces to collect recyclable waste and sell it on it could be quite lucrative
4363282 not only would it be good for the environment we could use the money to make small improvements to the streets where we live unlike the local council who must pay staff costs and delivery charges we wouldnt have any significant overheads
4363283 the value of a newspaper or steel can on its own is quite small but if you have a tonne of newspaper or steel then the transport costs and the processing costs start to make more economic sense
4363284 if you look back to the 1970s there was a time people were able to make a few pence on each bottle or can that they returned to the shop
4363285 but the culture has changed when i was a kid we had a deposit scheme for cans and bottles the reason why it was taken away was because people didnt think it was worth going back to the shop for 5p or 10p
4363286 those schemes fell out of use because they werent getting the volumes back its been found that its much more effective for local councils to offer kerbside collection
4363287 rather than people trying to make money themselves they should do what they can to ensure that local authority recycling schemes are as effective as possible
4363288 it costs 32 per tonne in landfill tax for a local authority to throw waste into a hole in the ground and that is going to increase by 8 per year until 2011
4363289 by the time that has been carried to the tip by the local council the cost has risen to 100 per tonne
4363290 we all know someone who has made a call or sent a message when they are drunk which perhaps they wish they hadnt done the morning after
4363291 however from the amount of messages sent in the past 12 months it seems a lesson rarely learned even when its hitting our pickets as well as our love lives
4363292 its good to see the digital age isnt by passing the older generation although its surprising to see they are as bad as those in their 20s when it comes to saucy calls and texts
4363293 a group of european party kids who borrow a yacht for a private party and take things much much too far
4363294 mshas failure to adequately evaluate roof control plans contributed to the occurrence of the august 6th accident
4363295 although press reports indicate that the operator did not report the march 10 bump to msha it is clear that msha was aware of the bump and considered it when it subsequently approved roof control plans for the south barrier pillar
4363296 the modeling by itself does not indicate if the active mining was the most likely trigger
4363297 a sudden change in stresses due to slip along a joint in the roof within the collapse area could have been a factor in triggering the collapse
4363298 we like to have a good time we dont take ourselves too seriously
4363299 that when one of americas allies thinks it has a green light to invade somewhere they always do it in the summer
4363300 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten a neighbor occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it
4363301 russia a country with 30 times the population of georgia decided to roll into its much smaller neighbor and tried to roll over it
4363302 it failed to roll over georgia but it would never have even thought of doing this if georgia were already a member of nato

4363307 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer

4363309 hhs is moving stealthily because it knows that theres no public support for such reactionary regulations 73 of voters believe strongly in making contraception easier for women of all incomes to obtain
4363310 my intent is to deal with the subject of contraceptives somehow defining them as abortion
4363311 that does not match any of the current medical definitions its ideologically based and not based on science and could interfere with the development of many new therapies to treat diseases
4363312 i will wait to see if a clean version of the rule is released for publication in the federal register and then i will believe it
4363313 secretary leavitts vague comments on the draft hhs rule do nothing to reassure americans that the administration is not considering redefining abortion to include common forms of contraception
4363314 pro life groups are backing the measure and saying the abortion definition is very clear that any drug or procedure that ends the life of an unborn child after the point of conception is an abortion
4363315 said it would be fantastic if the proposed rule prompted insurance companies to drop coverage for prescription birth control

4363340 una cumbre as como la que se propone con estos y otros puntos que seguramente ser n recomendados o sugeridos por otras entidades federativas y por instancias federales como el poder legislativo y judicial dar a lugar para que resolvamos las acciones comunes a realizar de inmediato
4363341 la inseguridad el secuestro el crimen organizado deben ser atendidos sin condici n alguna sin poner ning n tipo de condicionante ning n tipo de reglas sin tratar de fijar ning n tipo de agenda individual

4363344 pero la funci n del presidente de la rep blica es ser el l der de todos y encaminar a que las negociaciones se hagan lo mejor posible entonces creo que la bolita est en la cancha de ellos van a poder demostrarnos que tienen altura en esto
4363345 nosotros como sociedad no tenemos por que decirles a las autoridades si se juntan o d nde se junten se pueden juntar en aguas internacionales o si quieren nos podemos ir al desierto realmente el lugar donde ellos decidan ese es el lugar donde debe ser y que ellos hagan el consenso necesario
4363346 pero las autoridades que digan d nde y qu nombre le ponen s lo queremos que se pongan de acuerdo
4363347 en este momento la agenda la tenemos los ciudadanos y los pol ticos van a estar a la altura de los ciudadanos porque eso nos conviene a todos y ellos as lo est n viendo no tiene por que ser de otra manera

4363371 our evidence based study says the test you ordered is not needed so were not paying for it
4363372 the picture is completely absolutely 100 percent on schedule on time there were no delays
4363373 ive seen the movie it is fabulous we would have been perfectly able to have it out in november

4363376 you have less confidence in how much the fbi is really sharing and how accurate this might be
4363377 to know what challenge youre defending against is terribly important
4363378 if top fbi officials knew in 2005 that the anthrax used in the attacks came from dr ivins lab then why didnt they clear dr hatfill until aug 8 either they were unsure of the scientific evidence against dr ivins or they knew long ago that dr hatfill was not the killer

4363396 theres some evidence to suggest that first and later borns go into different kinds of careers and have associated different motivations
4363397 if people use birth order in job interviews theyre using a stereotype rather than good information and they might pick someone on false inference
4363398 if someone came to me to work as a research assistant i wouldnt ask them about their birth order if they told me i wouldnt infer anything major about it
4363399 im a big believer in it but legally you cant ask where they fall in birth order thats the problem
4363400 the origin of this gesture is speculative and quite possibly thousands of years old
4363401 terrorism extremism communalism and fundamentalism have emerged as major challenges to the unity and integrity of our country the recent terrorist attacks in bangalore ahmedabad jaipur and other parts of the country have shocked the nation what words can i find to condemn such acts of barbarism i share the sorrow and grief of people affected by terrorism the government of india will take concrete steps to rehabilitate and help such families
4363402 we wish all our neighbours well we welcome the strengthening of democratic forces in our neighbourhood especially in bhutan nepal and pakistan the recent blasts in our embassy in kabul july 7 have cast a shadow over our efforts to normalize relations with pakistan and to bring a lasting and honourable peace in our region i have personally conveyed my concern and disappointment to the government of pakistan
4363403 if this issue of terrorism is not addressed all the good intentions that we have for our two peoples to live in peace and harmony will be negated we will not be able to pursue the peace initiatives we want to take the terrorists and those who support them are enemies of the people of india and pakistan of friendship between the two countries and of peace in the region and the world we must defeat them
4363404 if this issue of terrorism is not addressed all the good intentions that we have for our two peoples to live in peace and harmony will be negated let us resolve today to stand together to strengthen the unity and integrity of our country and to stand firm in our determination to build a new india of our dreams
4363405 i commend our security forces and intelligence agencies for the dedication with which they are dealing with the problem under difficult circumstances but i agree that we have to further strengthen our intelligence agencies and police forces to deal with the problem of terrorism
4363406 whatever resources are required will be provided whatever manpower is required will be provided we are firm in our resolve to meet the challenge of terrorism i urge the state governments all political parties civil society groups and social and religious leaders to cooperate with us in rooting out terrorism from our country
4363407 i am confident that we will overcome these challenges but this requires hard work and unity of purpose this requires a politics of consensus not confrontation this requires dialogue among communities not discord the challenge of communalism of extremism and of terrorism cannot be won by a nation divided
4363408 if a democrat voted with the national rifle association two out of every three times no one in his right mind would call that person an advocate of gun control
4363409 yet bob casey jr who has a naral voting record of 65 percent meaning that he votes with the radical pro abortion group two out of every three times is somehow considered pro life
4363410 the democratic party strongly and unequivocally supports roe v wade and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay
4363411 the most likely alternative is that big brains enhance the rate of evolutionary diversification by facilitating changes in behaviour which would place new selection pressures on populations and favour adaptive divergence
4363412 the president will neither be impeached nor prosecuted on any charges he will try and stay in pakistan
4363413 the army does not want president musharraf to be insulted and the generals want both of the presidents demands to be met
4363414 president musharraf has lost his last card the armys support might have made a difference to his future
4363415 im sick i have a serious medical condition in a medical emergency these ids allow medics or other medical professionals to give prompt precise treatment
4363416 what makes him hard to stop is his ability to run and pass the ball
4363417 he just has good instincts on when to throw the ball and when to tuck it hes dynamic
4363418 what we know about dan is that hes always going to get some kind of positive yardage
4363419 he is such a competitive guy that he never likes to have any negative play on any snap
4363420 i dont think he ever forces anything or makes bad decisions with the ball in his hand
4363421 as an offensive lineman he takes the pressure off us
4363422 you arent going to be forced to pass protect for too long hes going to make his first and second reads and if they arent there hes going to take off
4363423 hes helping offensive linemen with our stats because if hes taking off downfield we arent going to be marked for a sack
4363424 he said if you try to explain how you play football then you are in trouble
4363425 all i know is that when i decide to run it makes a lot of sense to me i can feel the pocket collapsing or something is happening that makes me believe i should run
4363426 hes extremely accurate and hes got great knowledge of our offense and he has great confidence
4363427 he puts in his work all week and he watches so much film
4363428 hes always learning and hes always trying to find the next best way to do something
4363429 i feel very good the race went fine and im happy with the way i ran
4363430 it makes me relax more knowing ive been to the olympic finals
4363431 it makes my mind relax a little bit hopefully it will pay off
4363432 this is what i needed i needed to know about my body
4363433 i think i ran more with my mind than my body
4363434 for sure ive done what i need to important just to be there at this moment
4363435 ive done my best today its the first race the aim was to get through get through
4363436 the girl that was favorite in my event got done for drugs how is that a bad thing to say that youre disillusioned going into an olympic games
4363437 all the athletes have been very supportive this is probably the closest athletic team i have ever been a part of they are fantastic
4363438 weve been just in an offensive lull everybodys going out there and trying ive never really been a part of anything like it before
4363439 hes pitching as well as he has in a padre uniform if not better
4363440 were a team the more medals we get as a team the better i dont care who wins them
4363441 people who want to be international athletes they want the limelight
4363442 i think this is a little bit more than we would normally enjoy were kind of quiet people
4363443 i would not trade having katy by my side all the time for anything in the world but i will tell you that it is when the other one is competing it is very difficult to keep your mind on your own game
4363444 granted at this olympics its been a little easier because we dont compete at the same time at world cups it is definitely a challenge when we have to compete on the same day
4363445 you can just watch and cross your fingers and thats all and just wait
4363446 while it is disappointing not to have ricky ponting available we are confident continuing his recovery and missing this series will assure ricky is ready for the demanding cricket schedule ahead for the australian team
4363447 you always like to have a guy like that going the first day especially against a team thats hot
4363448 we feel like webby can silence just about any teams bats when hes on
4363449 this is a fairly remarkable streak when the guys are all playing well like this you have this feeling that you can always come back we definitely feel like were going to win when its close in the seventh
4363450 hes a big part of this team he can play any position and were going to need him down the stretch
4363451 it was a day where you had to find ways to get it done
4363452 i feel very good the race went fine and im happy with the way i ran
4363453 it makes me relax more knowing ive been to the olympic finals
4363454 it makes my mind relax a little bit hopefully it will pay off
4363455 this is what i needed i needed to know about my body
4363456 i think i ran more with my mind than my body
4363457 for sure ive done what i need to important just to be there at this moment
4363458 ive done my best today its the first race the aim was to get through get through
4363459 the girl that was favorite in my event got done for drugs how is that a bad thing to say that youre disillusioned going into an olympic games
4363460 all the athletes have been very supportive this is probably the closest athletic team i have ever been a part of they are fantastic
4363461 you cant do much better than a gold and a silver
4363462 were a team the more medals we get as a team the better i dont care who wins them
4363463 people who want to be international athletes they want the limelight
4363464 i think this is a little bit more than we would normally enjoy were kind of quiet people
4363465 i would not trade having katy by my side all the time for anything in the world but i will tell you that it is when the other one is competing it is very difficult to keep your mind on your own game

4363467 you can just watch and cross your fingers and thats all and just wait
4363468 we believe that the main function of the tree is to facilitate the flow of water from the ground and into the atmosphere to achieve that function the tree is ideally designed to not only maximize the flow of water but in order to be successful in the real world it must also be able to withstand the stresses of the wind it is exquisitely designed to do just that
4363469 the tree is a physical flow architecture that has evolved to meet two main objectives maximum mechanical strength against wind and maximum access for water coming from the ground through the tree and into the atmosphere in the larger sense the forest itself is a flow system with the same mechanical properties and functions as the individual tree facilitating the flow of water across the globe
4363470 winds come in many speeds but their ultimate effect is cutting off trunks branches and leaves so whatever is too long or sticks out too much is shaved off so the pattern of the tree is the result of the never ending assault by the wind
4363471 if the purpose of a tree was not to transport water it would look like the eiffel tower it looks like mr french engineer gustave eiffel without knowing it designed a structure that corresponds with our constructal theory
4363472 that means you will also have less drug reaching the normal tissue
4363473 right now what we are doing is so called passive targeting which is using the leaky vasculature of the tumour but a more active targeting would be attaching a peptide or antibody to the nanotube drug one that will bind more specifically to the tumour which should further enhance the treatment efficacy
4363474 we are definitely hoping to be able to push this to practical applications into the clinic this is one step forward but it will still take time to truly prove the efficacy and the safety
4363475 im happy here i miss my mum but not my dad
4363476 i heard about facebook and wanted to know what it was about
4363477 i love being online and it beats writing with a pen

4363479 ive only got nine friends on the net at the moment but im hoping for lots more im going to put some of my photos on my page
4363480 i am convinced that honouring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4363481 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect senator obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again
4363482 i pay rs 500 a month to the taliban as per their decree i can afford to pay the sum otherwise it would have been great injustice

4363516 the medal around my neck that really was my motivation and i couldnt see anyone past katie i didnt know what was going over on that side of the pool so i saw katie and i said lets just try and just catch and her and keep with her
4363517 to come in here and swim and personal best time at the olympic final is more than i could have hoped the best thing for me is that i have
4363518 another world record was set in the pool during a prelimitary heat kirsty coventry of zimbabwe set the 100 meter
4363519 the thought really crossed my mind for a split second there is no way i am going to catch up and then i changed
4363520 i said you know what it is really ridiculous to think that i am at the olympics and i am here for the united states of america i do not care how bad it hurts i am going just to go out there and put it and honestly in like five seconds i was thinking all these things i just got a super charge and just took it from there
4363521 it was a higher level fight for me and in that sense i was able to break my record
4363522 i was able to race fast and i am full of emotion compared to last time in athens
4363523 the medal around my neck that really was my motivation
4363524 and i could not see anyone past katie hoff i did not what was going over on that side of the pool so i saw katie and i said lets just try and just catch her and keep with her
4363525 to come in here and swim and personal best time at an olympic final is more than i could have hoped
4363526 the best thing for me is that i have equaled what i have done at athens
4363527 there are 31 of these jobs in the world actually 32 if it was any other job in the world and youre no 31 thats pretty good

4363553 i think as a consumer one of the ways to become more involved is to research maybe what you are buying a little bit more

4363566 shes hired some pretty high powered consultants to advise her and put it all together the web site will be a registry like for a bridal or shower registry where low income women list things they need for their babies more well off people will then go on and buy stuff for the children
4363567 isnt this the way tim budds little smalltalk always interpreted the plain cascade operator
4363568 when i worked with phil larder he used to say defence is an attitude of mind
4363569 he used it when england won the rugby union world cup as well and i think it applies very much to us because its the same personnel who went five games in march and april where they didnt concede a try in the second half
4363570 now all of a sudden it looks as though we cant stop a try so i think phils words of wisdom echo pretty true within our camp and obviously thats been one of the focuses this week
4363571 ive told the players they can forget about the top six lets go out there and play some good rugby league
4363572 i just want us to play well i dont want people to remember wakefield trinity wildcats 2008 season for finishing it in poor fashion because for two thirds of it weve had an absolute wow of a season
4363573 we were in genuine top six contention and got to the semi finals of the cup and i dont want them to remember the last third when we just disintegrated
4363574 i want us to finish the season playing some good rugby league if we pick up a couple of wins then marvellous and if it affects the top six even better but i dont think it will when you look at who bradford have got to play
4363575 we were happy with the performance against bradford but we understand its only one game
4363576 were on track for what we want to do and weve got players coming back webby brent webb had his first game back last week he makes us a better team and it wont be long before ryan bailey and jamie jones buchanan are available
4363577 scott donald is a couple of weeks away timing is everything for the finals but weve got a long way to go yet
4363578 i dont know if ive quite prepared for a fight and taken things to the extreme that i kind of have for this particular fight
4363579 i think you get fights like this abroad with two mexicans facing off against each other or even two americans
4363580 i think its got that kind of element its scotland versus england
4363581 we both want it as much as each other and i think it could end up being a bit of a classic
4363582 i wouldnt be taking the fight if i wasnt confident of winning
4363583 whatever alex can throw at me im sure ill be throwing back twice as much ive just got all the tools there to match him
4363584 its not going to be a walk in the park its going to be a great fight
4363585 i definitely feel i earned the place after the fight with koba gogoladze
4363586 i got the horrible job of stepping in to fight him so i feel that was my title victory
4363587 i beat a former olympic medalist and a virtually unbeaten pro when i took him on
4363588 im grateful for a second chance at a world title
4363589 obviously i came unstuck during my first title fight due to weight problems
4363590 i enjoyed what i did at london irish but i recognise england have been very good to me both as a student and professional rugby coach
4363591 a chance to be a part of this coaching team is a once in a lifetime opportunity i was quite excited about being sounded out
4363592 johnnos standing in the game is very significant in this country
4363593 if youre going to hitch a wagon to anyone then this is a regime that id like to be a part of
4363594 there are a lot of good players one of the problems is that countries in that situation can churn and burn through players
4363595 its been my experience in the past players evolve through repeat selection we have 32 players
4363596 we know who they are and there is a pecking order with players behind them
4363597 some arent the finished article and some are world class its a very talented squad
4363598 there is a lot of clarity about how were playing we need a plan a and plan b
4363599 the boys need something to go to if things arent going well
4363600 we need to change our mentality quickly for the premier league opener
4363601 facing sunderland away will be a very tough game they have strengthened their squad and are always difficult on their own ground
4363602 we have a few minor injuries bruises and so on xabi alonso and yossi benayoun have got some small problems but they will be okay for the game in sunderland
4363603 we would have preferred that he did not need to play we waited and waited but in the end we needed him because we were not in control of midfield
4363604 competition for places must improve we have several away or injured we need more players to out pressure on players
4363605 i do not like to talk about specific players but clearly we were not the best we were not good in midfield or the defence
4363606 if you have more players competing for positions in the team things are better we need new players but for the moment we must work to make the ones we have got better players
4363607 now we are looking forward to saturday and the first league game at sunderland to show who we are and what we are
4363608 we know in liege it was not our best game but we want to step things up and we know there is quality in the team we have shown that in pre season and now we must show it in competitive matches too

4363623 the iocs public expression of concern is welcome but it wont have any effect without real action
4363624 the international olympic committees failure to address this problem highlights the urgent need for mechanisms to prevent further abuses
4363625 to win a bronze medal at the world championships is not really a failure i would think
4363626 before the race my coach told me you need to swim your own race and that the others would start very fast
4363627 at that moment i did not really know what had happened
4363628 but then when i looked at the board i saw that i had won and everything was brilliant
4363629 she has managed to bring out the best in me
4363630 but i had some very good help from my psychological coach and she helped me to get my focus right for the swim and it obviously worked
4363631 some colors will work better than others so play around until you get the desired result darker colors will work better

4363635 i have not expected that many cases to occur during the olympic games we usually have 12 cases or so but this time many federations have conducted intensive out of competition testing before the games and we have seen the consequences of that
4363636 its encouraging and shows that hopefully the athletes here competing are clean
4363637 this is a problem when you have an age limit that there is a temptation for manipulation how to prove this is scientifically very difficult
4363638 there are ways but it is not a scientifically or legally accurate way of doing it
4363639 this is probably a result of poor information given to the athlete involved
4363640 not every wrong or even every violation of the law is a crime
4363641 they say ok tomorrow come to our gym we start
4363642 some kids play two hours and they feel bored i like the training
4363643 what kind of beasts are these designer types are they customers users or part of the team
4363644 does this push us outside of the tolerance of our sprint i e does it add more time than we can absorb
4363645 if so then is it lunacy to carry on as we are
4363646 if not then hurrah lets wait for the next sprint
4363647 if so then we are going to have to re plan and re start this sprint so as to not waste any more time
4363648 theres a lot of hard work dedication working together with your coach bob and i have been able to work fairly well over the last several years ive banked a lot of workouts back to back thats what set me up to have the meet im having
4363649 i just wanted to step on it in the first 50 a little bit and try and get out to an early lead
4363650 i knew that was a hard double for ryan lochte i knew in the first half if i got a big enough lead i thought i could hang on and thats all i wanted to do
4363651 what makes him the best is the endurance that he can swim so many races
4363652 his endurance is the main thing that makes him the best
4363653 if he wasnt in this sport and swimming i dont think id be as good
4363654 he is up there and he makes me become better and stronger in training without him i wouldnt be standing here today i think i push him as well
4363655 i didnt know i had as little time as i did
4363656 i didnt have time to go to the ready room i knew it was a tight turnaround the only thing i wanted to do today was win my heat of the 100 fly and get a center lane i hope it sets me up for something good tomorrow
4363657 one of the things bob and i want to do is get out a little better in the first 50
4363658 yesterday in the heats for me to be a body length behind after the first 50 is not where i wanted to be im down to two races im going to try to rest and prepare myself as best i can for them
4363659 russian president medvedev and prime minister putin must understand the severe long term negative consequences that their governments actions will have for russias relationship with the u s and europe
4363660 the situation in georgia remains fluid and dangerous as soon as possible my colleagues senators lieberman and graham will be traveling to georgia theyre both members of the senate armed services committee i hope that other members of the armed services committee in the senate will go together
4363661 our position on georgias territorial integrity is not going to change no matter what anybody says
4363662 and so i would consider that to be bluster from the foreign minister of russia we will ignore it

4363666 the demand side is a major concern supplies from opec countries are rising but there is a shortage of buyers the industrial use in china has been cut back
4363667 the situation in the post soviet area has changed significantly
4363668 russia is ready and able to use force outside its borders thats a different situation
4363669 the only oil at stake is whats flowing through the btc pipeline to turkey something that involves many big western oil companies and if russia were to do anything to disrupt that it would become a pariah in europe
4363670 it will shrink russias ability to operate in foreign policy
4363671 they always closely follow who is the boss who is stronger
4363672 if they come to the conclusion that the u s is less strong now than before i cant exclude that they will turn their attention more to russia or to china
4363673 safety is our primary concern always with the development of any new treatment
4363674 they didnt explain to the parents that this was an experimental vaccine and a lot of the parents who signed consent forms were illiterate

4363685 if i draft you are you going to let us down
4363686 i dont know if thats a good thing or a bad thing for guys who play that
4363687 my interpretation is this was probably the result of poor information given to the athlete who did not have the knowledge of what to avoid and what she was allowed to take

4363714 everybody rose to the occasion and we just did everything we could at trying to help him trying to get support in but unfortunately with weather like that you just cant get a helicopter in
4363715 relatively gentle terrain but there was quite a lot of snow so we had to just navigate slowly
4363716 i feel very privileged to have had him as a husband and two wonderful daughters who he simply adores

4363718 our manufacturing distribution segment revenues were up 41 2 anchored by the orange bowl stadium project revenues and the addition of schwartz sports
4363719 while losses increased slightly for the three and six months ended june 30 2008 they were consistent with our internal budgets and we remain on target to achieve our record projected financial goals of 91 million in revenues and a fourth consecutive year of increasing profitability for the twelve months ending december 31
4363720 our business is cyclical and the second calendar quarter is typically the weakest quarter in our industry our historical business model generates a greater portion of our annual revenues and profits in the holiday quarter october december

4363725 our competition advanced micro devices threw together a demo booth which stated baldly that hp laptops with the intel gm45 chipset did not accelerate blu ray at all while theirs naturally did
4363726 on the montevina centrino 2 system youll see the cpu utilization gets pegged up at 95 to 100 percent where the cpu utilization on the amd system will be half that
4363727 on the plus side use of the arcsoft total media theater player yielded immediate results blu ray cpu utilization on a core 2 duo was lower than 20 on all material a clear indication that hardware acceleration is working properly
4363728 they too did not see hardware acceleration on g45 blu ray playback
4363729 they updated this a couple of days later with a correction showing the acceleration working now but a less than stellar benchmark the only one they ran remains on the hd hqv test intel scored a paltry 30 out of 100
4363730 while i question the value of some of the hd hqv tests when evaluating blu ray a topic for another time they are in fact valid tests my sources tell me that intels less than stellar scores are due to a player software issue properly configured advanced de interlacing will result in scores 20 points higher still not perfect scores but coming within the realm of workable and my hope is that subsequent driver tweaks will improve this even further
4363731 suffered from stuttering every 15 seconds or so at 24 hz display refresh rate on blu ray and the issue is still there on g45 centrino 2

4363739 die meiste zeit verbrachte dhondup wangchen im dienst der gesellschaft und damit den bed rftigen zu helfen er ist mir ein guter ehemann und unseren vier kindern ein guter vater ich appelliere an die chinesische regierung dhondup freizulassen ich flehe das ioc an seinen einflu auf china geltend zu machen damit das gastgeberland der olympischen spiele sich an sein versprechen h lt und seinen b rgern redefreiheit gew hrt
4363740 meine familie und ich haben uns lange berlegt ob der film ver ffentlicht werden darf oder nicht wir waren uns klar da dies zur verhaftung der beteiligten f hren w rde aber dhondup meinte es sei ungeheuer wichtig der welt diesen film zu pr sentieren nachdem wir die entschlossenheit meines bruders sahen hatten wir keine wahl als der welt die wahren gef hle der tibeter in tibet vor augen zu f hren ich appelliere an alle sich f r die freilassung meines bruders und seines freundes einzusetzen
4363741 ich hoffe der film wird zu einem sprachrohr f r diejenigen die in tibet sind und ihre stimmen bleiben nicht ungeh rt

4363743 they kind of juked me and made some really good moves on me at first i was like wow these guys are pretty good it was a reality check
4363744 theres a lot of competition there and hes holding up well
4363745 its kind of hard for me to set goals because ive been out of it for so long
4363746 being older i dont want to get too far ahead of myself im just trying to get better each day
4363747 but i would love to see some game action this fall whether its special teams or adding depth in the secondary and playing a series here and there i would love to just get the opportunity to work in and get on the field
4363748 i always loved football and baseball football was probably my first love deep down i knew i had a good shot to play either one of those coming out of high school and im very fortunate now that ive got a chance to do both
4363749 baseball is obviously more laid back and a lot less physical so its definitely different on the body
4363750 but im getting used to it and im getting back in the swing of things
4363751 its his first camp and his body is tired a little bit its a little different for him i dont think they have to do cut drills or tackling drills in baseball camp but hes adjusting real well learning the system and everything hes still getting his football legs back but hell be ready to go
4363752 anytime you get an opportunity to judge a deep ball its an advantage
4363753 you can just see his baseball coming out the way he runs and goes up and gets a ball at the highest point i like that about him and the other guys are watching how he does it and are learning from him too
4363754 growing up watching the huskies come out of the tunnel and hearing 70 000 fans scream ive never forgotten that
4363755 so to experience that firsthand from a players standpoint this is something ive always dreamed about
4363756 i did see a lot of my teammates blow some money but im fine
4363757 i always thought in the back of my mind that if baseball didnt work out id better have something in the bank and be able to go to school and move on to a future life

4363762 i had been doing a lot of camps and clinics and he knew how much i loved working with kids
4363763 its only three hours from home so the family can come and see me when we have home games
4363764 my love is hitting and i enjoy teaching kids how to hit
4363765 ive been doing what hes told me the whole year
4363766 when i feel like im doing something wrong or i dont feel right hitting i talk to him hes been able to help me out
4363767 he always expects you to play hard play 100 percent every day
4363768 its more cut throat here than i thought it was going to be
4363769 you dont really have time to take on projects overhaul kids and turn them into great athletes

4363886 i know god really exists and i have no doubts about it
4363887 while i have doubts i feel that i do believe in god
4363888 the intent of this ordinance is to smear protesters and make them appear as if theyre somehow criminal
4363889 whereas its a new venue its not a new challenge for us
4363890 it could be a real nightmare to get 76 000 people into invesco field
4363891 do we close the interstate or will the protesters thats a very big issue
4363892 you dont need to have a gun the police will protect you
4363893 if people carry guns there will be murders over parking spaces and neighborhood basketball games
4363894 im a pacifist enlightened spiritually aware people shouldnt own guns
4363895 id rather be raped than have some redneck militia type try to rescue me
4363896 if you do that one more time im going to kill you
4363897 that lethal violence even in self defense only engenders more violence
4363898 if projection is used as a defense mechanism to a very great extent in adult life the users perception of external reality will be seriously distorted
4363899 so you fear if your neighbors had guns they would use them to murder you what makes you think that
4363900 why do you think that your childrens schoolteachers would shoot them
4363901 why do you entrust your precious children to someone you believe would murder them
4363902 imagine your wife is in the parking lot at the supermarket and two men grab her one holds a knife to her throat while the other tears her clothes off if i see this happening and have a gun what should i do what would happen next what if after five minutes the police still havent arrived
4363903 it must be awful to live in fear of being assaulted by your own neighbors i remember what it was like when i was the only jew mormon african american republican in my class football team workplace and even then i didnt think anyone was going to kill me
4363904 the only reason to have a gun is to murder children
4363905 im carrying a gun right now and you cant even tell
4363906 i sometimes carry a firearm and youve never seemed to be uncomfortable around me
4363907 the vast majority of persons involved in life threatening violence have a long criminal record and many prior contacts with the justice system
4363908 if someone comes to kill you arise quickly and kill him
4363909 so i say to you seek god and discover him and make him a power in your life without him all of our efforts turn to ashes and our sunrises into darkest nights without him life is a meaningless drama with the decisive scenes missing but with him we are able to rise from the fatigue of dispair to the buoyancy of hope with him we are able to rise from midnight of desperation to the daybreak of joy st augustine was right we were made for god and we will be restless until we find rest in him

4363914 ive worked with many coaches during the last year to improve my skills and accomplish my goals i like to do thing on my own pace and rhythm and never felt comfortable following an agenda but since i worked with coach erwin and his success agenda ive felt so clear about what i have to do to accomplish my goals and i can measure where i am during the process of accomplishing them most important is that i have more results in less time thanks of using his success principles my productivity has multiplied ten fold i can manage multiple projects at the same time as i like to but now all of them meet their goals and the quality of my work impresses my clients give it a try

4363919 we will continue to reduce the number of british troops in iraq
4363920 we will continue to reduce the number of british troops in iraq of course future decisions will be based as i have always said on the advice of our military commanders on the ground
4363921 but just as last year we moved from combat to overwatch we would expect a further fundamental change of mission in the first months of 2009
4363922 although it is hoped that the uk military presence in iraq will decrease significantly in the future it is still too early to discuss the size and shape of a reduced uk forces footprint
4363923 in his statement to the house of commons on july 22 the prime minister set out our intent to make a fundamental change to the uk mission in iraq in the first months of 2009
4363924 as ever this will be based on conditions on the ground the plans of our coalition partners and the military contribution requested of us by the government of iraq under a long term bilateral relationship
4363925 as a key coalition partner the us is intimately involved with the development of our future plans
4363926 and as general petraeus stressed in recent his interview with the times the us is fully supportive of the uks current position on iraq and of our proposals for iraqs future

4363931 i tried to do a harder start in the first 100 metres but michaels breaststroke is awesome
4363932 i really couldnt care less if michael was in the pool or not it doesnt matter to me one bit it could be anyone beside me and ill race him
4363933 the water in front of me is all i care about added beavers who was clocked in 1 59 43 a little behind the canadian record 1 59 19 he counted in a preliminary
4363934 i cant complain about a seventh place at the olympics its something ive wanted to do for a long time

4363936 i knew that was a hard double for ryan phelps said
4363937 i swam my own race every inch of the way and i feel i have more in me for finals
4363938 mom why is joan of arc called joan and not jean

4363942 so why joan and not jean where did joan fit in
4363943 i guess somewhere along the line joan derived from john

4364146 the significant operating improvements that have taken place with regard to merchandising assortment service and cleanliness of stores cant be underestimated

4364148 our customers represent a broad income segment and they are all challenged today
4364149 while commodity prices have decreased recently food inflation continues to be a factor in our markets
4364150 certainly high energy prices are increasing the costs of raw materials and transportation
4364151 at the present stage there is merit in the contention that the article put up by the defendant on the blog site is defamatory
4364152 todays destination is garrison north dakota and many people probably associate the town with lake sakakawea or the dickens festival but theres actually a few other things to see in town like wally the walleye right behind me here right now were going to go see what else the town has to offer
4364153 basically this is the museum that honors firefighters from across the state of north dakota as well as being a museum for the trucks the firefighting equipment apparatuses of the past we started it in 2006 and its been done virtually with all volunteer labor and materials and we received a number of donations and support from across the state from all the fire departments
4364154 this is the fort the guard house from fort stevenson its a replica of the orginal which is now under water because of the lake in here we have artifacts and information on the fort the surrounding area and the native american tribes
4364155 we have to be aware of them depending on how high they are they may not be lit
4364156 but how many people here could potentially be at risk because of that
4364157 does somebody have to get thrown into an ambulance now and carted two three four miles to flight for life
4364158 that delay could make a major difference between life and death

4364164 so for non lawgeeks this wont seem important but trust me this is huge
4364165 the court has held that free licences set conditions on the use of copyrighted work when you violate the condition the licence disappears meaning youre simply a copyright infringer

4364168 if youre doing something bad or mischievous i mean someone catches you good riddance
4364169 in my mind it would be much better to take that officer and put him out among the crowd and have him interact and be out in the crowd
4364170 its like invading our privacy we go someplace we want to have a good time we dont need everybody watching us
4364171 i have no problems with it i dont think its a privacy issue unless the cameras are in the bathroom or something
4364172 we have brought in a new person into the group we have a new guitar player who is playing for the first time tomorrow it is the first time he has been on our stage his name is wes borland he used to be in a very terrible band that he left because he felt it was a destructive force

4364179 i dont put more than 5 of a clients assets with any of them
4364180 if one fund is in trouble another is usually doing well
4364181 it doesnt bother me if shareholders leave because we underperformed on the markets upside but id be very unhappy if they left because we performed worse on the way down
4364182 we dont want to be in a position where our investors are redeeming our shares and we dont have the cash to pay them that would force us to sell positions we like at a loss
4364183 the next day i was talking to somebody and i looked over and the sign was gone
4364184 the top rental markets were less impacted by the housing bubble bursting
4364185 the job growth in these markets is probably still good though the rate of job growth is declining
4364186 thats going to continue to happen until you see a decline in the for sale inventory once that happens people renting out these units will end up putting them up for sale and that will lessen the rental inventory
4364187 fewer people are moving out of our apartments to buy homes
4364188 last year in our portfolio about 20 of tenants moved out to purchase a home in the first six months of this year it was 14
4364189 its easier to work your way out of a lease than a mortgage
4364190 i always felt that united would do it last year but i fancy chelsea this time

4364211 i know that if i had not seen america i never would have written my new symphony
4364212 all the pieces are of his own composition entirely new and not yet heard in public
4364213 the transformation of the fwso under music director miguel harth bedoya continues to amaze
4364214 the smashing debut confirmed the validity of reputation as one of the most exciting young conductors on the international scene
4364215 as time passes i realize that i must keep doing it so that i can keep doing it
4364216 it is no exaggeration to say that in the following weeks i was able to continue my own life only by my work on the symphony in c
4364217 for the third time in six months i heard the long requiem service walked in the field beyond paris to the cemetery of sainte genevi ve dropped a handful of dirt in an open grave
4364218 and for the third time i saved myself or at any rate recovered by composing
4364219 the upheaval caused by the war though neither tragic nor terrible in my case was nevertheless a difficult environment for composition
4364220 i did not seek to overcome my grief by portraying or giving expression to it in music
4364221 and you will listen in vain i think for traces of this sort of personal emotion
4364222 i consider that music is by its very nature essentially powerless to express anything at all whether a feeling an attitude of mind a psychological mood a phenomenon of nature
4364223 the allegro of the symphony in c is no more than the portrait of a symphonic allegro
4364224 the neon glitter of the california boulevards from a speeding automobile
4364225 this was outstanding a kind of rebirth piece in which the music begins hellishly but gradually picks up a bluesy swing as the soloist rhapsodically spirals higher and higher i was mesmerized

4364229 we are confident that jackson browne will prevail in this lawsuit not only have senator mccain and his agents plainly infringed mr browne s copyright in running on empty but the federal courts have long held that the unauthorized use of a famous singer s voice in a commercial constitutes a false endorsement and a violation of the singer s right of publicity
4364230 in light of jackson browne s lifelong commitment to democratic ideals and political candidates the misappropriation of jackson browne s endorsement is entirely reprehensible and i have no doubt that a jury will agree
4364231 they are like a police department on campus and no one dares cross them
4364232 they fear undergraduates would form a formidable political movement that would challenge the status quo
4364233 our stand is that the university law should be abolished and replaced with a new university act that protects undergraduate basic rights
4364234 the university law has been used to curb student activism ever since it was enacted in 1971 to curb freedom of expression and freedom of association
4364235 we dont want to be cheated by cosmetic changes of the law
4364236 all proposed changes must be fully made public so that everyone can give crucial feedback
4364237 however the time has come for the authorities to allow students to participate in political activities
4364238 universities must promote independent thinking and to process and create new knowledge and clamping down on the student freedom will only defeat the purpose of setting up universities in the first place

4364248 i just wanted to step on it in the first 50 a little bit and try and get out to an early lead
4364249 i knew in the first half if i got a big enough lead i though i could hang on and thats all i wanted to do
4364250 if he phelps wasnt in this sport and swimming i dont think id be as good
4364251 he is up there and he makes me become better and stronger in training without him i wouldnt be standing here today
4364252 i congratulated britta shes a wonderful person and a fantastic competitor full credit for her she kept working hard and driving through the wall
4364253 im just glad i got another opportunity i was so thankful that i was in there in the first place and i got a lane
4364254 its been a long road to get here and i really cant believe that just happened
4364255 although i am very pleased to hear him listening to those around him i saw several quotes from school board members and parents who praised him for saying i dont know and not having a ready made plan
4364256 personally im all for a ready made plan that includes giving back more power to teachers and principals incorporating the community in the schools finding ulterior means for educating students more interested in disrupting schools than planning for their future preventing and not merely handling violence in schools and bringing back skill classes like shop keyboarding and home ec for students not on a traditional college track
4364257 while it was nice to hear that mr green didnt think he had all the answers i would have been more confident if he had a firm vision of direction for guilford county schools
4364258 hopefully this will come after his 100 days of listening mr green will have to stand up and be a leader and hold people accountable
4364259 i think his lack of specifics and plans may be his greatest strength
4364260 mr greens biggest challenge will be to overcome the morale and intimidation issues and the lack of trust that the grier years have heaped upon our teachers

4364263 we are expecting a response from dot prior to the scheduled public hearing
4364264 our concern is that this is in strong contrast to what was recommended to us
4364265 its important that responsible development be applied you can get the golden egg and kill the goose that laid it in the process we want to make sure that beautiful northwest guilford county is preserved
4364266 traffic is already a big issue on 68 edgefield and pleasant ridge roads plus were worried about northwest schools already being overcrowded and clear cutting of trees to build
4364267 our hope is to have the area treated like oak ridge rather than treated like high point
4364268 why do they need to develop more in our area when there is already plenty of space available elsewhere all within minutes of the airport
4364269 what we felt were compromise conditions they really didnt meet any of them except what they would have had to meet anyway we are extremely disappointed with their lack of earnest compromise
4364270 what happens here will set the bar on what happens in this area in the next few years
4364271 in the next 10 years we will experience more change than in the 50 years before

4364273 energy storage is in the heart of the next generation of efforts for fuel economy

4364281 everyone has assumed we age by rust but how do you explain animals that dont age some tortoises lay eggs at the age of 100 there are whales that live to be 200 and clams that make it past 400 years
4364282 our data just didnt fit the current model of damage accumulation and so we had to consider the alternative model of developmental drift
4364283 we found a normal developmental program that works in young animals but becomes unbalanced as the worm gets older
4364284 it accounts for the lions share of molecular differences between young and old worms
4364285 but then how do you explain animals that dont age
4364286 a free radical doesnt care if its in a human cell or a worm cell
4364287 the take home message is that aging can be slowed and managed by manipulating signaling circuits within cells
4364288 this is a new and potentially powerful circuit that has just been discovered for doing that
4364289 its a new way to think about how to slow the aging process
4364290 but then how do you explain animals that dont age
4364291 hey youre cute wanna come over and see my etchings

4364294 months of political deadlock have finally come to an end
4364295 the alliance has made it certain prachanda will become prime minister as theyll easily get the 298 votes needed for a simple majority
4364296 theres no question of joining a maoist led government if our candidate is defeated
4364297 well stay in the opposition and play a constructive role so the peace process remains on track
4364298 after long study and experience i have come to the conclusion that 1 all religions are true 2 all religions have some error in them 3 all religions are almost as dear to me as my own hinduism in as much as all human beings should be as dear to one as ones own close relatives
4364299 i believe in the fundamental truth of all great religions of the world
4364300 i just want to clean the place up and make it look like a shopping center instead of a hitching post

4364311 since i am still young enough to work i plan to substitute teach
4364312 he was in the right frame of mind and wanted to play nothing would have stopped him so that is pleasing
4364313 he knew the consequences of playing tonight so the decision was very much his
4364314 i wouldnt be particularly sure until the transfer deadline passes what might materialise so well see
4364315 i took my apple out and started eating while i was working as well and she teacher said put that in the bin and you get a sanction and everybodys like but hes diabetic oh hes diabetic and then she was like oh sorry
4364316 he the teacher should have understood a bit more that i was low and didnt know what i was doing because i was talking complete nonsense which is a big sign of being low well my friends know how to react but other people in the class will know when im low and will tell somebody
4364317 i said by the time i get there shell be unconscious
4364318 previous studies have examined the role of parents in diabetes self care and found that parental influence decreases during adolescence as friendships and school life become more important during adolescence examining the influence of school personnel and peers was pertinent there were few studies examining this area so possible outcomes were unknown
4364319 the impact of teachers on young people with diabetes cannot be overestimated given that poorer self care increases the risk of complications including unconsciousness seizures and coma as well as serious long term problems such as blindness and kidney failure
4364320 diabetes is a legally recognised disability all young people with the condition have the right to appropriate school care to help them fully take part in school life young people with diabetes must be allowed to undertake care at any time at school schools need to make all staff aware of pupils with diabetes and their related care needs and staff must be trained in recognising and treating hypoglycaemia
4364321 this work changes the textbook picture of the lifecycle of the leishmaniasis parasite identifying the inflammatory cell known as the neutrophil as the predominant cell involved during the initiation of infection
4364322 parasites transmitted by sand flies to mice lacking neutrophils have more difficulty establishing an infection and surviving this demonstrates the importance of neutrophils at the site of an infected sand fly bite and suggests the unexpected path taken by the parasite from sand fly to neutrophil to macrophage is a critical component of this disease
4364323 within 24 hours of the plastic film being applied to a surface less than 1 bacterium out of 1 million bacteria will survive
4364324 it also reduces the environmental impact of the process and we have developed a method that is easy to apply and could bring great benefits to patients in hospitals as well as the food industry

4364326 neurological disorders are a critical area of need in terms of expanding our ability to design and conduct trials that have maximum efficiency at the lowest possible cost

4364328 i have been intrigued for years by the question of how a cell knows what to do
4364329 it is exposed to a plethora of signals and many stimuli and somehow it moves forward in the right direction most of the time if it doesnt know what to do the cell may continue to divide and become a cancer
4364330 nature doesnt like chaos so there had to be something logical some process that tells the cell what to become a pathway that integrates a variety of stimuli and comes up with a conclusion
4364331 infs does that it tells the cell dont start anything until i tell you it also is called a safety mechanism its a bean counter it counts the signals and averages them until there is enough to open the gate
4364332 we were the first to have the guts to talk about it publicly it took courage and sticking to an important scientific principal to report on nature as it is rather than what was thought to be the situation when our theory challenged the established scientific opinion this unconventional anti doctrinaire approach has allowed us to explore areas and ideas that were overlooked by many scientists
4364333 integrative nuclear signaling in cell development a role for fgf receptor 1 appeared in the november 2007 issue of dna and cell biology
4364334 the infs pathway offers a novel target for in vivo neural stem cell therapies and anticancer strategies
4364335 it is a universal mechanism that can apply to many areas of biology we have a key now we can move on to develop therapies
4364336 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4364337 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4364338 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security

4364340 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4364341 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4364342 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4364343 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4364344 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4364345 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4364346 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues

4364348 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4364349 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
4364350 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4364351 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4364352 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4364353 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4364354 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4364355 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4364356 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4364357 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4364358 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4364359 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4364360 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4364361 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4364362 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4364363 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4364364 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4364365 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4364366 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4364367 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4364368 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4364369 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4364370 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
4364371 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
4364372 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
4364373 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4364374 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4364375 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4364376 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4364377 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4364378 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4364379 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4364380 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4364381 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4364382 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4364383 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4364384 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4364385 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4364386 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4364387 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4364388 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
4364389 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4364390 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4364391 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4364392 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4364393 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4364394 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4364395 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4364396 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4364397 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4364398 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4364399 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military

4364421 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4364422 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4364423 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4364424 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4364425 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4364426 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4364427 if i knew what a fairyland was supposed to look like

4364440 what it was like to play in the ultimate game super bowl
4364441 if its the ultimate game why do they play it every year
4364442 sayang aku baru membaca sebuah artikel di majalah tentang bagaimana memperkuat tali pernikahan
4364443 masing masing kita akan mencatat hal hal yang kurang kita sukai dari pasangan kita
4364444 aku tidak mencatat sesuatupun di kertasku aku berpikir bahwa engkau sudah sempurna dan aku tidak ingin merubahmu
4364445 they made huge inroads last year but obviously they fell away
4364446 i thought they were very close two or three games that was all it was there were games they were up in against the big teams that they lost and it looked very hopeful but there has been a bit of unrest in the summer by losing a couple of key players
4364447 those gaps have been filled by the youngsters who have come through and look as if they are going to get a chance this year but i still think they are two players short i am a bit worried about the start of the season
4364448 we are certainly not a selling club but these young players get their heads turned
4364449 they are moving on to bigger and better things in their mind but i dont see that as an onlooker if you leave arsenal there are not many places you can go on an upward step
4364450 i think flamini had his head turned with money and going to such a so called big club but i think he has made a mistake and i think the other players will see that
4364451 ill challenge you to name anyone who has left and gone on to bigger and better things there arent many places you can go and enjoy your football so much
4364452 you can go to other places and earn more money and maybe that is a sign of the modern player
4364453 arsene has always wanted to keep an english core but he has found it difficult
4364454 when we all left it was the decline into an all foreign team and he was more disappointed than anyone but he has struggled to bring in english players and nurture them to first team capabilities now he has a crop he really believes in
4364455 there is no doubt in my mind that having an english core in an english team is beneficial to the club you need to have that affiliation for your home club
4364456 i feel over the years that has been lost they have produced some brilliant football but the actual loyalty and commitment to the club long term are not there
4364457 im very much a believer you have to get the league right
4364458 it is more important than the champions league and more important than cups in the league you play 38 games thats the most important and that is wengers philosophy
4364459 he will be more disappointed than anybody that they have not put a really good challenge up for a few years now
4364460 it pains me to say it because i want us to challenge and win it but i just feel were a little bit short
4364461 we found the guidewire application to be easy to configure and straightforward to implement and integrate with eqcs other systems
4364462 this is a great example of ibms ability to provide software as a service and it highlights the real value proposition ibm provide clients
4364463 our adjusters claims staff and managers absolutely love the system and all the functionality improvements that have come with it
4364464 claimcenters electronic claim file and online notes keeps everyone updated on a claims status freeing the adjuster to focus on managing the eqc claimant relationship instead of continuously providing status reports
4364465 i felt a little sluggish the first round but my body is woke up now
4364466 i felt controlled good start did exactly what i wanted to do in that race
4364467 something like with the wii where you dont have to push buttons
4364468 if i breathe or turn the wrong way it bothers me
4364469 i imagine that theres a couple guys on that team that remember that 8 0 loss
4364470 right down from our first line to our fourth line weve got guys who have been putting the puck in the net since they were little kids
4364471 the shots and the goals weve had the leads weve had just says it for itself
4364472 we unfortunately gave one up in the first shift of the first period
4364473 it can be a bad habit scenario if you allow it to be but our guys are very mature
4364474 when one country sneezes the others stock up on tissues

4364508 aufgrund der mittlerweile sehr gro en bandbreite an e commerce angeboten im netz ergeben sich gro e qualitative unterschiede im bereich online handel

4364563 my visit comes at a very important time in burma as it moves under the new constitution to civilian rule after the elections planned for 2010
4364564 what is important now is the interim period and i told the burmese government that i planned to draw up a detailed proposal on how human rights issues should be treated in relation to the roadmap to democracy and i expected them to implement it
4364565 the international community has been telling the junta now for more than twenty years to release political prisoners and stop human rights abuses without any appreciable success
4364566 the prison conditions of the political prisoners i saw were not so bad
4364567 the monk was very angry after all he was detained for exercising his rights
4364568 on the day of mr quintanas visit to see the political prisoners in insein they all had their food rations increased
4364569 but the next after the visit their meals returned to the usual meager rations which do provide prisoners with adequate nutrition
4364570 if anything conditions in insein jail have got worse in the past year since septembers uprising
4364571 since the red cross stopped their prison visits conditions have deteriorated no proper medical attention no soap to wash with less food rations and no one to courier letters between them and their families
4364572 the best thing the new envoy can do is to urge the junta to allow the red cross to resume their prison visits as soon as possible

4364580 the core of krishnamurtis teaching is contained in the statement he made in 1929 when he said truth is a pathless land man cannot come to it through any organization through any creed through any dogma priest or ritual not through any philosophic knowledge or psychological technique he has to find it through the mirror of relationship through the understanding of the contents of his own mind through observation and not through intellectual analysis or introspective dissection man has built in himself images as a fence of security religious political personal these manifest as symbols ideas beliefs the burden of these images dominates mans thinking his relationships and his daily life these images are the causes of our problems for they divide man from man his perception of life is shaped by the concepts already established in his mind the content of his consciousness is his entire existence this content is common to all humanity the individuality is the name the form and superficial culture he acquires from tradition and environment the uniqueness of man does not lie in the superficial but in complete freedom from the content of his consciousness which is common to all mankind so he is not an individual freedom is not a reaction freedom is not a choice it is mans pretence that because he has choice he is free freedom is pure observation without direction without fear of punishment and reward freedom is without motive freedom is not at the end of the evolution of man but lies in the first step of his existence in observation one begins to discover the lack of freedom freedom is found in the choiceless awareness of our daily existence and activity thought is time thought is born of experience and knowledge which are inseparable from time and the past time is the psychological enemy of man our action is based on knowledge and therefore time so man is always a slave to the past thought is ever limited and so we live in constant conflict and struggle there is no psychological evolution when man becomes aware of the movement of his own thoughts he will see the division between the thinker and thought the observer and the observed the experiencer and the experience he will discover that this division is an illusion then only is there pure observation which is insight without any shadow of the past or of time this timeless insight brings about a deep radical mutation in the mind total negation is the essence of the positive when there is negation of all those things that thought has brought about psychologically only then is there love which is compassion and intelligence
4364581 there are people who are advising him to avoid confrontation but i dont think he has made up his mind
4364582 it is at the moment that pakistan cannot afford confrontation
4364583 and its obvious that the present government and president musharraf cannot get along so it is in the best interest of pakistan that some way is found whereby this mode of confrontation can be changed or can be more conciliatory
4364584 should safe passage be given to someone who has done this to pakistan
4364585 he wants safe passage by breaking pakistans law he wants safe passage by breaking pakistans constitution he is asking for safe passage by selling out pakistans sovereignty

4364591 this was found in kims system i interpret that it was a deliberate intake because of the importance it has in that sport the consequences are obvious
4364592 the evidence shows we are ahead of the cheats my interpretation is that three positive tests is fairly low
4364593 you would expect six or seven tests this is a feature of increased awareness in the sports population the figures are encouraging rather than showing anything else

4364672 the government will pocket 675 million but abandon farmers and its responsibility to tackle climate change all for the profits of a foreign owned company
4364673 this study needs to look at the underground and surface water flows of the liverpool plains prior to any further exploration or mining taking place as we are particularly concerned by the governments assertions that strict environmental regulation will prevent any impacts on aquifers
4364674 there are concerns from our members about the impacts of coal mining activities on agriculture and the failure by government to consider these impacts when deciding to release new mining tenements

4364709 i have worked numerous leads for national media marketing stories for years now
4364710 and cultured a vast quantity of insiders to feed me information with all these sources our paper will finally have the chance to write the best review possible complete with valid information and up to the minute reporting
4364711 after my stint with the daily news i moved over to investigative reporting
4364712 and i found my home i love investigative journalism particularly in the national media marketing industry where there is always a juicy story to be told furthermore it is of great benefit to our community to report such news
4364713 the internet moves so fast its hard to compete with
4364714 bloggers beat me to the stories most of the time but on several occasions in the past ive been able to get to the source first and report the most reliable information available to me
4364715 and i intend to harness its power to better inform everyone about various national media marketing happenings in our area
4364716 and i want to be very careful about releasing the most reliable and pertinent information related to this national media marketing issue possible
4364717 i think the potential for success marketing in most all countries so why not casino games
4364718 i believe that online casinos can thrive in the east if they are marketed correctly that means outstanding customer service a realistic gaming experience and good deposit options
4364719 what are you using to embed polls such as this one in the rss feed itself
4364720 the people of pentre maelor are 100 opposed to it
4364721 in the past they have put on demonstrations here woman and children lay in the road protesting over pollution from a local factory
4364722 as a councillor i have to weigh up all the options i understand that it will bring a lot of building work and employment to the area
4364723 but what about the type of people it will bring here people visiting those locked up in prison
4364724 this area is already targeted by criminals and chancers from manchester and liverpool
4364725 why go for wrexham anyway its too far from the courts in caernarfon and theres no direct route to the prison the bus service is atrocious
4364726 wrong site for a north wales prison for many reasons
4364727 youre the first person to come and ask what my feelings are weve heard nothing from the council or anyone
4364728 nobody seems to care what we think most people here dont want it and im not sure id feel safe here anymore
4364729 other companies wont want to invest here either this area is for industry
4364730 we dont know what type of prison its going to be we dont want any sort but the thought of an open prison across the road when im out with my children is awful
4364731 i dont particularly want a prison here but if theyve made their minds up theres nothing we can do
4364732 as long as the prisoners are locked up and are well supervised i cant see a problem it will bring jobs at the end of the day
4364733 it doesnt bother me its better than having a dirty great factory
4364734 there is a clear case for a new prison that can cater for inmates from north wales and their families
4364735 obviously there will be people with concerns but there will now be a period when we can have a discussion about what needs to be done in caernarfon for it to be taken into consideration
4364736 i have high hopes that my constituents will take full advantage of that
4364737 i appreciate that it could bring jobs which would normally get my vote but it offends and frightens me to hear that it would be so close to caernarfon
4364738 we would need reassurance that it was not an open prison not category a there are concerns
4364739 i dont want to be a nimby not in my back yard but you have to ask is this serving the community and i dont think it is
4364740 i dont know what exactly they have planned and im a bit surprised that no one from the council has asked for our opinion as to any effect on us
4364741 we have invested heavily at the site and will be doing so again in the future
4364742 a lot of people are in jobs here including graduates and many of our employees have been with us for over 20 years
4364743 this is not a good idea in caernarfon as it is mainly a tourist area and it will put people off visiting here and businesses will suffer
4364744 you are talking of at least five years of work on the construction and then after it opens jobs in admin and security
4364745 we the directors of bluefield caernarfon ltd felt it was only right that the local community and key stakeholders are given the opportunity to put forward their views on this proposal
4364746 gruffs really nuts about the life of john z delorean and the crazy history behind the man and his machine
4364747 the cars the star and we didnt think wed be able to stage a neon neon stainless style performance without a gleaming gull wing or two outside the front of wales millennium centre
4364748 were hoping to be able to offer gruff a ride round in one as well so if anyones got a mint delorean they want to show off then let us know
4364749 this is a unique chance to see the very best of welsh talent in a different way
4364750 its our ambition to show the world why top music makers like gruff rhys continue to reinvent and revitalise the vibrant music scene in wales

4364910 all our fruit went down the jhelum valley into west punjab which is now in pakistan that was always the natural road and river route and low transport costs meant that our fruit farmers got a good price but now we have been cut off from our natural trade routes and consumers instead we have been forced to cross the pir panjal range into jammu and the gangetic plain this route is fraught with logistical difficulties high costs and longer distances so kashmiri fruit growers get a lower price for their produce

4364931 it remains to be decided whether new types of subsidies are necessary or whether existing levels should be altered by adjusting terms that have held some subsides flat for a decade
4364932 but in order to best decide how to aid the m t a in the future a common understanding of how much assistance the city and state provide today is needed
4364933 generally speaking given the quality of mayors they should be in control of their transportation systems

4364948 in the last one and half months exports fell by at least 30 per cent because of the agitation which has brought the movement of goods particularly fruits to a virtual halt
4364949 if the agitation goes on the economy of the state will suffer major jolt as people who had lined up over rs 5000 crore worth of
4364950 agitations of this nature discourage investors and therefore peace and tranquillity must prevail in the state to ensure that its industrial prospects are not derailed
4364951 it has awakened us because its new mosquito and another disease vector that has been brought to a highly endemic area for la crosse encephalitis and carries four kinds of encephalitis
4364952 even though i didnt find it at fort mccoy its probably still there
4364953 we dont know where the mosquito is and how it got here
4364954 but we want to find them before they are established in the area so we dont have to put out fires later
4364955 the last place i expected to find it was in the storm sewers in shelby
4364956 this species is a big deal for public health and it will be a high priority for us
4364957 we knew sooner or later wed find it here but as money is drying up for mosquito control we will have to reallocate our resources and take a step back and cut control measures for nuisance mosquitoes

4364961 the cooler weather we had this week might slow things down but we are just moving into a critical period
4364962 we only take that measure when it is absolutely necessary when human health is being compromised but we are nowhere near that point

4364986 we believe our proposed cooperation is an important step towards ensuring that we can compete effectively with rival alliances and manage through the challenges of record fuel prices and growing economic concerns
4364987 in addition we believe we will be more effective competitors with greater ability to invest in our products and services

4365020 a tipping point has been reached and the latest cuts are now threatening the very future of the papers if you continue to deny resources for editorial you inevitably produce worse products and why would business advertise in or readers buy such products
4365021 the strategy of cut cut cut in editorial budgets has been shown to be a failure and its time it was reversed shareholders should be fearful for their investments and local communities should fear for the future of their papers

4365063 colonel mace will want to know how you managed to breach the cordon we threw up around here
4365064 hello dr jones i am romanadvoratrelundar but you may call me romana
4365065 i have just left him in cardiff refuelling his tardis at the rift
4365066 so what are you doing here no never mind tell me afterwards i need to get these aliens back to unit hq to see if i can synthesise an antidote and get my people on their feet again
4365067 very well if colonel mace agrees youd better come back with us
4365068 a tardis and its got a well stocked lab that might prove useful to you
4365069 youd better not land it inside the hq until weve spoken to mace
4365070 the doctor was rather rude to him last time they met and im not sure hell welcome you with open arms do you know where the hq is
4365071 no lance corporal jenkins hes not here now lets get these aliens back to hq
4365072 yes sir all the espirron were stunned and captured i intend to see if i can synthesise an antidote now
4365073 as i understand it the lady romana has offered to assist you in this matter
4365074 you have a means of contacting the doctor still i presume
4365075 yes sir he still has my old phone as far as i am aware
4365076 then i want you to ring him and ask him to confirm the identity of our visitor
4365077 hello doctor would you mind having a word with colonel mace please to confirm that our current visitor is lady romanadvoratrelundar
4365078 well ive only just met her but she seems nice enough i suppose she unnerved me a bit appearing out of nowhere when we were dealing with espirron
4365079 im sorry about that i had meant to ring you to let you know she might turn up but well you know how it is
4365080 fine as far as i know but ive not seen him since we split up
4365081 wed realised we wanted different things and he was never very happy with my job
4365082 oh long standing joke the first time we met he was posing as a patient in the hospital where i worked and he was going by the name mr smith
4365083 mmm nothing some coffee and a doughnut wont cure do you want some coffee
4365084 just as long as it takes me to walk to the canteen and back dont worry im as eager as you to get this resolved
4365085 i presume that you know that during the last stages of the time war the daleks rounded up those members of the high council who had not already left gallifrey and locked us in a time lord prison ship
4365086 most of those who were trapped in that ship in the void did not fare well
4365087 actually thats a vast understatement everyone went mad more or less
4365088 but i had been imprisoned by the daleks once before
4365089 i survived that experience which gave me a little more hope than my fellow time lords had
4365090 since i was released from the prison ship i have been working with the doctor to convert it into a tardis a long and arduous task made more difficult by the absence of gallifrey and her technology now though the task is complete and i am ready to travel to that end i am looking for a companion
4365091 not that im not flattered to be asked but why dont you want to travel with the doctor a fellow time lord with whom you must have far more in common than any human
4365092 the doctors got a strong self destructive streak at times and i suspect its got stronger since the business with davros and the daleks
4365093 im not a qualified psychologist no but i did the basics as part of my training and ive done a bit more since i joined unit but i do know the doctor a little enough to know that hes probably not at his best at the moment
4365094 donna told me that the first time she met him he terrified her because he was so full of pain and anger and at that point rose was still alive now that shes dead and his other self too well i cant imagine anyone would find him easy to be around even if they were feeling a hundred percent themselves
4365095 having some of his fellow time lords back isnt much compensation for what he did especially since he was never that fond of us in the first place
4365096 he found time lord society hide bound in tradition boring and stuffy and the time lords too disinclined to help others hes an inveterate meddler and i have missed him a great deal but i cannot travel with him at present at the same time i cannot sit around doing nothing and i do not wish to travel alone i require an intelligent competent companion someone who would enjoy exploring and will not fall apart at the first hint of trouble not that i intend to go looking for trouble
4365097 i looked through the tardis data banks and decided you might suit me but the doctor said he thought you were fairly settled on earth now
4365098 im not unwilling but i will need to talk to my superiors and to my family first ive got no intention of simply disappearing without warning the last time i did that i ended up walking the earth alone for a year trying to prevent the master from destroying both my planet and the rest of universe its not an experience i want to repeat
4365099 i understand you laughed in his face as you defeated him
4365100 it seems needlessly cruel to laugh at someone whom youve defeated
4365101 i will return tomorrow and you can tell me of your decision unless you need more time to decide
4365102 perhaps its a side effect of associating with the doctor
4365103 i thought you were a time lord not a vulcan
4365104 bit of luck them not chaining up our wrists as well
4365105 let us get out of here before they realise were free
4365106 weve just spent several hours locked up it must have reminded you of what the daleks did to you twice before i thought you might want to talk about it
4365107 if i wanted to talk about it you would know
4365108 romana you dont have to deal with this on your own youre not the doctor
4365109 not that im aware of but i was sleeping in my room so i dont know where she is at present hold on
4365110 hes in trouble again and i have agreed that we will go and help him out of it
4365111 hes being his usual self then what did he do this time
4365112 apparently he unintentionally or so he says insulted the queen of eisblau iv and shes threatening to execute him tomorrow night local time unless he can produce two character witnesses to testify on his behalf i gather the queens guards were all set to execute him on the spot but he used an obscure loophole in the law to persuade them to give him the chance to bring in witnesses
4365113 i think it best if we dress in our finest
4365114 your majesty im afraid that flattery is not the doctors chief talent hes a scientist and an engineer and as im sure you know theyre usually better with mechanisms than with words
4365115 yes your majesty there is no doubt that the doctor is more than capable of saving the world with a kettle and some bits of string but compliments are not his forte generally i would describe him as verbally clumsy he means well but he has not the art of speaking compliments well
4365116 i charge you doctor to study the greatest of the poets and learn how best to offer pleasing compliments to ladies in the meantime i will allow you to keep your head you may depart at your earliest convenience
4365117 thank you your majesty you are most gracious and i am your most humble servant
4365118 by the lake in the great park about four miles away
4365119 so what have you two lovely ladies been up to since i last spoke to you
4365120 never tell me the lady romanadvoratrelundar former lord president of the gallifreyan high council got into trouble with someone and it was none of my doing
4365121 a slight disagreement with dr metterman a scientist from squalene
4365122 i am going to change you may spend an hour with your former travelling companion if she wishes and then i intend to be on my way
4365123 romana will unbend again eventually but shes been through such a lot she needs time to heal just as i did
4365124 when romana told me she was going to find herself a companion to travel with instead of me i was hurt and when she picked you from the tardis databank i was jealous but then i realised that you were one of the best people for the job since youd already helped one broken time lord to heal and just because youre my doctor doesnt mean you cant be romanas too
4365125 look after her for me please shes one of my best friends just like you
4365126 im sorry i was so thoughtless earlier and for joking about being locked up
4365127 actually you barely reacted at all at least in front of me you know im not a trained psychologist but i am a fairly good listener
4365128 im going to go and change then im going to the lab as i promised the brig some information on the tests im running
4365129 not at all i shall go and set the coordinates and see if i have a picnic hamper anywhere join me in the control room when youre ready
4365130 although we only had a thermos of tea and a blanket to keep off the mist
4365131 he took you on a picnic in the mist how very typical of the doctor
4365132 i suppose it was really he took me to the eye of orion and showed me the memorial there
4365133 i understand the mist now so you have seen the memorial to the time war what did you think of it
4365134 i thought he was probably hoping for too much but i understood why he wanted to help he carries around so much guilt about the time war and his part in it that hell probably always be looking for ways to atone for it
4365135 the time lords sent his fourth incarnation back in time to stop davros creating the daleks but he couldnt do it i think that old guilt eats at him as much as the newer guilt about the time war
4365136 no thanks i honestly couldnt eat another thing right now
4365137 shes unconscious and appears to be having a screaming nightmare from which i cant wake her
4365138 they should ease romanas mind out of the hallucinatory state but it may take some time
4365139 if they dont ring me again and ill be there as soon as i can but those injections should work
4365140 its just a case of bearing with the side effects of the bederven until they do
4365141 i dont care i need you to do this its too late to save gallifrey but we must stop the daleks from conquering the entire universe weve lost too many planets already
4365142 you were the one who urged time lords to be more involved and not sit around in dusty towers pontificating i dont want to see gallifrey destroyed either but weve tried everything else without success
4365143 youre the only person i can trust to do this thats why im asking you please doctor
4365144 thank you doctor now go well hold them off as long as we can
4365145 yes but you did not sign up to be my personal physician
4365146 i knew when i agreed to travel with you that you were still recovering from being locked up by the daleks besides ive travelled with the doctor so i knew that medical situations were bound to arise occasionally even if you werent planning on looking for trouble
4365147 i admit i didnt anticipate dealing with a hallucinating time lord but its all a learning experience
4365148 the doctor told me the fruit you ate had a hallucinogenic effect and you were having a lot of one sided conversations with people so i presumed you were hallucinating
4365149 you had a long argument with the doctor you were urging him to end the time war you also argued with vansell and darkel and you were apologising to leela and wynter
4365150 i beg your pardon i did not realise i was disturbing your rest
4365151 i was only on my way to bed not actually in it
4365152 its a long tale and theres quite a lot of politics in it
4365153 come on you need to sleep and so do i
4365154 this beds more than big enough for two of us
4365155 they showed me the body they took me to the area where they found it it took a day and a half to get there i got to be honest when i first saw it i hated to see it in that state it was in i wanted to capture one so the world could see it walking i guess this is the next best thing for the time being

4365158 my interpretation is this was probably the result of poor information given to the athlete who did not have the knowledge of what to avoid and what she was allowed to take
4365159 i switched from my dress sweats to my parka shoes threw my cap and goggles on and then they pushed us on out no time
4365160 but i think theres going to be a lot of time for me to rest over the next 18 hours or so and ill be able to be ready for tomorrow mornings 100
4365161 tomorrow is going to be a tough race for me to be a player in that race i have to be closer at the 50 if im not then it will be tough i was over a body length behind at the 50 in the prelims and came up a bit short so i have to be there
4365162 i touched the wall and was like thank you finally
4365163 you can start by not worrying about what everybody else thinks
4365164 nobody knows what ive really gone through in the last eight years and what has gotten me to this point besides myself and a few people that i know well so its my own personal deal at this point
4365165 thats the theme of the meet you have to break a world record to win i gave it my all and i had nothing left
4365166 im very proud of what ive done ryan swam well he earned it
4365167 its been a long road to get here and i really cant believe that just happened
4365168 i really couldnt breathe that last 50 i was just digging deep and couldnt breathe
4365169 a silver medal is still a silver medal in the olympics i gave it everything i couldnt have given more
4365170 no honey you shouldnt be worried at all russia didnt invade georgia they invaded a breakaway province in south carolina georgia is pretty safe because as all americans and intelligent russians know theres nothing there worth invading to get the russians can get cheap bourbon pickup trucks with confederate flags and syphilitic hookers right there on the streets of moscow they dont need to come over here for that

4365176 we can forget about talks on georgias territorial integrity because its impossible to force south ossetia and abkhazia to agree that they can be returned into georgias fold by force
4365177 georgia is a member of the united nations as such it has internationally recognized borders therefore the territorial integrity of georgia within those borders is not an issue
4365178 georgias borders have been reaffirmed by numerous security council resolutions
4365179 so the question of abkhazia and south ossetia will be the subject of international negotiations as they have been at the u n security council
4365180 the resolution of kosovos status is covered by a u n security council resolution and that resolution envisions an international process

4365187 reading is of course a good and precious thing but literacy has a dark side too doesnt it
4365188 what pleasure centres ignite when you part the pages of a new book and sniff the ink it seems those neural pathways are laid down young youre hooked early or not at all and from that point on you need to keep feeding the habit with progressively larger doses of word no matter how cut and contaminated highs and lows altered states in my life books have often played a pharmaceutical role either sedative or stimulant

4365215 from a moral and social and economic perspective its absolutely critical that we help those students who have historically struggled the most
4365216 we know that students can reach the high bar that we have set
4365217 of course we still have a lot of work to do to reach our goal of universal proficiency
4365218 weve shown growth in all areas and are outstanding in many subjects
4365219 we are always looking for ways to improve and that is why this data is so important to us we use it to see where we can make program improvements
4365220 i continue to be impressed by the academic achievements of our elementary school students and am pleased with the signs of improvement at the middle school level
4365221 however we still have a great deal of work ahead of us to improve the proficiency and academic performance of our high school students
4365222 im so happy and excited that i have found you again
4365223 this is my life this is what has happened to me

4365229 i would consider him a danger to the community in that he has dropped out of any registration program and lives the way he is who knows how long it will be before he decides to try something
4365230 he had a girlfriend and she found some images of child porn in his backpack
4365231 they talked to him and they didnt think they had enough to hold him
4365232 his whole purpose of going to the libraries is getting his internet access

4365244 we could easily get people on our side using the obvious martial law
4365245 my reading of history convinces me that most bad government results from too much government
4365246 timid men prefer the calm of despotism to the tempestuous sea of liberty
4365247 i probably wouldnt have noticed if they hadnt informed me

4365253 the manager asked him if he needed to talk at that point he turned in his badge and left the building
4365254 he was pretty blunt but always had something good to say
4365255 you dont ever know about people but thats the last thing in the world i would have ever considered
4365256 the patent system s purpose was to help society rather than to help inventors
4365257 what i remember most about that day other than the kiss are the expressions on the peoples faces expressions of happiness and peace and love
4365258 many people have that picture but not many young people know what it represents it represents liberation
4365259 we encourage todays youth to capture the personal stories of those who served the country during world war ii and to honor the achievements of that generation
4365260 this is a chance for kids to be a valuable part of their countrys history they are seeing them as they were 60 years ago
4365261 we want to make sure the kids get the story
4365262 kids have an incredible gift for technology and we encourage them to use technology to benefit their community and they get to interact with older people who dont have an agenda
4365263 these are boys and girls who are interviewing people three generations removed from them
4365264 they are learning more history in this than they probably learn in school
4365265 everyone in new york went to times square when there was a celebration
4365266 its to memorialize and keep the sacrifices of the people who fought in the war alive
4365267 i started out doing community service and after i got my points i fell in love with the program
4365268 you dont learn this history from textbooks i spend a lot of time with the people and i learn a lot from them
4365269 school teaches us how the war started and how it ended but when the textbook is closed thats it
4365270 here we learn about the people and how they benefited from the war and what their lives are like now
4365271 as a teacher im so thrilled with this program it has purpose and togetherness
4365272 im so glad there are so many young people involved from different generations and different places

4365276 the thing common to both boys is the church and conway became someone to be trusted to look after and mentor the children
4365277 this case is about events that took place a long time ago it is a feature of these sorts of cases that very often it takes time for things to come out
4365278 he would say he loved me but said that was fine because that was a church thing too
4365279 just an excuse to get me in a place where i was naked
4365280 we just reacted because we didnt have any other option any civilised country would act same way i may remind you september 11th the reaction was similar american citizens were killed you know the reaction
4365281 the sight of russian tanks rolling into parts of a sovereign country on its neighboring borders will have brought a chill down the spine of many people rightly
4365282 what happened on the night of august 7 is beyond comprehension
4365283 the georgian military attacked the south ossetian capital of tskhinvali with multiple rocket launchers designed to devastate large areas
4365284 russia had to respond to accuse it of aggression against small defenseless georgia is not just hypocritical but shows a lack of humanity
4365285 nevertheless it was still possible to find a political solution clearly the only way to solve the south ossetian problem on that basis is through peaceful means the georgian leadership flouted this key principle
4365286 the georgian government and its supporters should rethink their position
4365287 we wanted to do a book that was a complete fabrication but remain completely true to the spirit of these films we love
4365288 basically what you are looking at is a sort of
4365289 shock festival is packed full of the most bizarre obscure monster movies blaxploitation films slasher flicks and perverted sci fi celluloid masterpieces no one has ever seen
4365290 from the super sexy starfire beyond the galaxy to the nauseating univesrse of bloody zombies the book makes you grin with delight at the idea of a parallel universe of trashy films that should have existed we loaded this thing with never before seen movie poster art lobby cards and movie stills romano is your stalwart and intrepid guide lending first hand accounts of this lost galaxy of auteur and maverick directors drug fueled lunatic actors and a kaleidoscopic journey through their sleazy world behind the scenes stephen invited me in to lend my artistic eye to the whole thing and as such his earlier effort with the book has been overhauled in a huge way for the better were all very excited about this and tom jane loves what weve done with it im very proud of what romano has accomplished
4365291 i work a lot in the film business and so i know my way around hollywood
4365292 so ive combined that insight with some real stories highly fictionalized of course with all the names changed and my love and knowledge of b movies and the people who made them in the 70s and 80s
4365293 there has to be some sort of message or throughline that i can relate to
4365294 at dread central our contest gets over a million hits a day
4365295 and there is a lot of excitement about my art studio as well the shock festival movie posters are even being featured in a new upcoming horror film from joel silver the big time die hard guy the movie is the hills run red and i hear its a bruiser its about a cursed movie and so they did a deal with me to get my posters in the theater lobby and on the walls of the heros apartment that film will be out next year from universal meanwhile on october 21 and 22 of this year well be having a big release bash for shock festival here in austin at the alamo drafhouse cinema which will be a two day mini festival of some amazing exploitation films and trailers you know the stuff that inspired us to do shock fetsival in the first place
4365296 shock festival is one of the greatest homages to b cinema ever undertaken
4365297 stephen romano brings a fresh unique voice that is firmly grounded in the genres history yet daring and different than anything thats come before his words have weight his stories have impact you will not be disappointed
4365298 stephen romano writes likes on fire and not just with some fancy notion like the muse
4365299 his voice is polished clean powerful this is a guy with a vision a dark and mesmerizing worldview brutal full on street cred sharp insightful human authentic asskicking but smooth and altogether pure
4365300 god bless you stephen romano for you have recognized what we all should know the whole of the human race has sinned
4365301 yes well i am going to do this case because i have already been involved and i wasnt exactly sitting on my arse all morning you know
4365302 if you were there and you didnt look at the camera angle you would have saw that i was firing away from him and above him
4365303 i got nothing against michael phelps the guys the king do i want to make a rivalry of this of course why not
4365304 it would be kind of nice that one day historically well speak of michael phelps maybe winning seven gold medals and having lost an opportunity to win eight gold medals
4365305 when they talk about that theyll talk about whoever that guy is that took it away from him id love to be that guy
4365306 i think itd be good for the sport and itd be good for him if he lost once just once
4365307 ive had a lot of bad experiences in the past especially at the olympics this is my time to do something
4365308 if it were over today i think he is the greatest olympian that ever lived
4365309 i cant be a body length behind at the 50
4365310 go to an irish pub and you will find someone to talk to

4365314 saas erp suites likely will be significant and may not compare favorably with on premises solutions
4365315 the multitenant architecture needed for saas erp suites results in high internal efforts and costs for the initial setup and the ongoing maintenance and upgrade of the system
4365316 vendors must prove to organizations that are considering saas erp adoption that their security and privacy concerns are unfounded through super low cost or no cost proof of concept trials encouraging early adoption through value pricing and getting early adopters to share their success stories
4365317 one of the major value propositions of amazon web services is the utility pricing plan
4365318 there are people who are advising him to avoid confrontation but i dont think he has made up his mind
4365319 it is at the moment that pakistan cannot afford confrontation
4365320 and its obvious that the present government and president musharraf cannot get along so it is in the best interest of pakistan that some way is found whereby this mode of confrontation can be changed or can be more conciliatory

4365323 this is a big season for dean fabio capello spoke to him in the summer and hes taken on board what he said
4365324 what capello has asked for is no different to what weve asked for and dean has been working hard at it i think you will see a difference
4365325 im looking for him to lead the line and score the goals that comes with that
4365326 at his age and the position he finds himself in its all in front of him everything is up for grabs and that includes the england spot
4365327 i will wait until the final training session and see how he is in training thats when i will make a decision on that
4365328 hes an excellent pro hes been working totally independently to anything that might be happening outside the football and any speculation has been dealt by his agent hes just been getting on with things professionally in training
4365329 if you ask any manager they always want their best players available dimitar is no different
4365330 he is a great player and is carrying himself superbly well through this and we want him to stay but if it is my personal opinion i have no preference one way or another you have to go with what is happening
4365331 my ambition is to play for my country and i think with aston villa i will have that possibility
4365332 every player wants to play international football and that is my aim im joining a big club in the premier league this is the best league in the world and last year villa did very well
4365333 the 12 000 scooter seen above but sold just 123 of them and now has had a lot of debt
4365334 i have to conserve as much physical and emotional energy as i can
4365335 i switched from my dress sweats to my parka shoes threw my cap and goggles on and then they pushed us on out no time
4365336 but i think theres going to be a lot of time for me to rest over the next 18 hours or so and ill be able to be ready for tomorrow mornings 100
4365337 tomorrow is going to be a tough race for me to be a player in that race i have to be closer at the 50 if im not then it will be tough i was over a body length behind at the 50 in the prelims and came up a bit short so i have to be there
4365338 anybody can say whatever they want but i know im clean
4365339 people can question it all they want but the facts are the facts i have the results to prove it
4365340 i touched the wall and was like thank you finally
4365341 you can start by not worrying about what everybody else thinks
4365342 nobody knows what ive really gone through in the last eight years and what has gotten me to this point besides myself and a few people that i know well so its my own personal deal at this point
4365343 thats the theme of the meet you have to break a world record to win i gave it my all and i had nothing left
4365344 im very proud of what ive done ryan swam well he earned it
4365345 its been a long road to get here and i really cant believe that just happened
4365346 i really couldnt breathe that last 50 i was just digging deep and couldnt breathe
4365347 a silver medal is still a silver medal in the olympics i gave it everything i couldnt have given more
4365348 im very proud of how ive handled the heavier workload
4365349 ik dacht dat ik goed begonnen was en ik zag het volop zitten
4365350 ook op de brug ging het goed maar ineens was het gedaan ik was een beetje kwaad op mezelf maar ik heb me proberen te concentreren op mijn balkoefening maar op de balk lag ik er meteen af ik ben herbegonnen en de drie volgende elementen gingen goed en dan boef viel ik weer ik dacht hoe kan dat nu ik was weer goed bezig maar ik heb toch maar doorgevochten tot het einde
4365351 ik ben toch tevreden over mijn spelen en ben blij dat ik hier heb mogen staan aan mijn finale kan ik nu toch niets meer veranderen net als in de kwalificaties had ik zenuwen maar toen speelde dat in mijn voordeel het was toch een zware voorbije week ik ben hier nu al drie weken en het begint toch te wegen nu ga ik nog wat genieten enkele dingen bezoeken en een paar sporten bekijken

4365357 but thus do i counsel you my friends distrust all in whom the impulse to punish is powerful
4365358 before you speak think is it necessary is it true is it kind will it hurt anyone will it improve on the silence
4365359 liukin and johnson gold and silver stars of american gymnastics
4365360 its just a terrible thing to see one of your old friends pass away
4365361 it was very harrowing but everybody rose to the occasion and we just threw everything we could at trying to help and trying to get support in
4365362 and we got to the hut door and two people went inside the hut and gottlieb came back out of the hut and collapsed on the snow
4365363 one of the most incredible people i have ever seen
4365364 i have got to know anne braun elwert and the children and the family very well over the years
4365365 we dont really know what the real cause is we are just guessing its a heart attack hes such a fit strong man its the last thing i thought would have taken him
4365366 we have relatives coming from germany and things to organise but beyond that we are just taking it one day at a time
4365367 gottlieb was respected by so many people id be surprised if the climbing community didnt do something in their own way and what exactly that will be i dont know

4365369 i wanted to make an affordable coffin which used as few resources as possible using minimal materials makes the coffin extraordinarily lightweight celebrants and funeral directors have been telling me it will give friends and family more choices in who carries their deceased loved one
4365370 its a completely different style of coffin its quite modern looking an eco coffin is generally coffin shaped a bit rustic looking and made out of pine

4365492 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer
4365493 the release date change does not alter the production schedule for this or future harry potter films post production on half blood prince was completed on time and the studios release plans for the two part harry potter and the deathly hallows will not be affected by this change we know harry potter fans are eagerly anticipating seeing the final chapters unfold onscreen in fact the good news for them is that the gap will now be shortened between half blood prince and the first part of harry potter and the deathly hallows
4365494 when jeff robinov explained the rationale behind moving the release date of harry potter and the half blood prince to july 2009 it was immediately apparent that this offered us the potential to reach the widest possible audience i am extremely proud of this latest film and of the work of david yates and our incomparable cast i believe we have developed and pushed the series further still we are all looking forward to sharing it with harry potter fans around the world even if we have to wait just a bit longer
4365495 it has been a joy to work on harry potter and the half blood prince dan rupert and emma and all our returning young cast continue to blossom and our new cast members bring fresh color and life to hogwarts even as we put the finishing touches on this latest film we are already beginning preparations on the final two films we start filming in february and i am excited to bring this remarkable series to the exciting and moving conclusion its loyal fans deserve
4365496 keeping the eastern end of the runway open for take offs will ensure that residents to the north north west and south of the airport do not bear the full burden of aircraft noise during construction and will get some respite when weather and operational conditions permit mr albanese said
4365497 i know the residents of sydney will be affected by the temporary changes in aircraft noise from this essential safety project but every possible option has been examined in order to minimise the noise impact on surrounding communities
4365498 they are only retaining take offs to the east which can be done from the third runway anyway so its not really making any difference to people in the north and west said mr rees
4365499 we are looking for any release we can get we truly think its appropriate to relieve inner west residents of aircraft noise he said
4365500 this is just more evidence that the long term operating plan for the airport is in a shambles

4365603 the biggest issue that atheism promoting godlessness has going against it is that it is inherently negative

4365776 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4365777 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4365778 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4365779 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4365784 you call it peacekeeping troops i dont call it that but controllers monitors european facilitators i think the russians would accept that
4365785 im convinced at the end of the day we will find an international peacekeeping force in the region with the eu at its heart
4365786 there are no signs of the russians letting in anyone else i dont really see it happening at the moment the russians are firmly in control

4365796 the prime minister never offered to absorb palestinian refugees into israel olmert has said time and again that any political agreement will not include the return of palestinian refugees to israel no matter the number
4365797 the prime ministers position is that the establishment of a palestinian state would provide the answer to the refugee question
4365798 with regards to the refugees that will not return to a palestinian state an international mechanism will be established to determine monetary compensation the us stance on this is similar to israels as demonstrated in an april 2004 letter by us president george w bush in which he said that there will be no return to the state of israel only to a palestinian state

4365836 we are in the market for a striker and made a substantial offer which has been well documented
4365837 we will have to wait and see what happens we are trying to address certain weaknesses in the team and we will continue to do that right until the window closes
4365838 we have problems up front as we are missing key personnel we are a little bit light and went with two young guys who are still learning the game it was difficult for them
4365839 i think what the bid does show is that the club is in decent shape financially and that we were able to make a bid of that significance

4365841 to describe this film as a piece of crap would be to run the risk of a discourse that would never again rise above the excremental
4365842 at the age of 5 months babies will watch a fearful face for longer than a happy face and their attentiveness level as measured by eeg is higher after seeing a fearful than a happy face
4365843 by contrast infants age 5 months watch both faces when they are shown side by side for just as long and there is no difference in the intensity of attention in favor of the fearful face

4365845 de consumptie in japan is laag de export naar europa en de verenigde staten loopt slecht en het lijkt er op dat de situatie in china ook minder rooskleurig wordt
4365846 de ns directie wil op ons verzoek meewerken aan snellere treinverbindingen en betere aansluitingen op schiphol voor luchtreizigers die voor een klm vlucht met de trein naar schiphol reizen gaan we het treinkaartje compenseren
4365847 we zijn wel negatief verrast maar de ontkoppeling met de randstad is erger we zagen de vluchten vooral als snelle verbinding met de randstad toch het economisch centrum van nederland
4365848 we zijn hier met een uur in frankfurt brussel of d sseldorf en met de tgv vanuit het nabije luik zijn we eerder in parijs dan op schiphol de internationale bereikbaarheid en beschikbare verbindingen zullen dus niet echt verminderen
4365849 niet vol te houden in deze tijd maar onze passagiers uit zuidnederland zijn daarom niet minder belangrijk we doen er daarom alles aan om samen met de ns de trein tot een acceptabel alternatief te maken zonder extra prijskaartje dat zal bij een klm vlucht door ons worden betaald
4365850 we kunnen met het missen van een vliegverbinding met de randstad leven mits als alternatief betere en snelle verbindingen ook echt worden gerealiseerd
4365851 de luchthaven is geprivatiseerd er moeten alternatieven worden gevonden omdat de luchthavens om ons heen nu eenmaal ook goede verbindingen hebben
4365852 de gebouwen worden te weinig gecontroleerd en de regels zijn te onduidelijk bovendien vindt de controle veel te versnipperd plaats sinds het nationaal brandpreventie instituut is opgeheven aannemers kunnen en durven het daardoor minder nauw te nemen
4365853 ons werk heeft dan minder nut want ondanks de constructies en materialen die wij aanbrengen blijft het pand dan toch brandgevaarlijk
4365854 helemaal omdat een eigenaar of gebruiker van een pand tegenwoordig strafrechtelijk vervolgd kan worden na brand
4365855 hierdoor lopen we achter de feiten aan en dat is gevaarlijk
4365856 het is zeer slecht dat er geen eenduidige autoriteit zich bezighoudt met het voorkomen van brand telkens wordt na een grote brand zoals in enschede volendam of bij de tu delft geroepen dat er wat moet gebeuren vervolgens worden er allerlei rapporten opgesteld die uiteindelijk in een diepe la verdwijnen

4365858 i think logically that playing with paes would be the best choice for the country we want to win a medal
4365859 on the court the chemistry is there every time we have taken a break and come back we have found a way to put our differences aside and win so hopefully that will happen again
4365860 the problems have been happening for a long time so were dealing with it
4365861 its nice unfortunately we dont have that many top level players
4365862 but we put in a lot of work so to be recognised for that is nice i guess it motivates us to work harder
4365863 at the same time you have to put things in perspective you cant let it go to your head youre here to do a job i love what i do so work comes first results come and then everything else comes later
4365864 we are very pleased to present these cars to you today
4365865 they are not concept cars they are not prototypes they are the production cars that will roll out of the single plant later this year
4365866 those people who are riding motorcycles these days can drive a car and they will find it easier to drive a car in the streets
4365867 there is just no room left for more cars in delhi if you really look at the city the roads are already congested
4365868 data shows that we have even gone beyond the designed capacity of the roads
4365869 the traffic speed has come down drastically from 35 to 40kph to 12 to five kph at the peak traffic volume
4365870 now that clearly brings out the fact that it is a crisis that we need to deal with because of both the congestion and pollution impact
4365871 this cheap motorisation that is now going to explode in indian cities we are not prepared for it at all
4365872 we may as well come to grips with the fact that all the things that you ask for may not be in a one lakh 100 000 rupees car and all the things that might be there in an eco car may not be possible for one lakh
4365873 take it as it is its a car thats affordable provides transport meets all safety laws meets all emission laws present and future
4365874 it will be a reliable form of transport which will provide indian families an all weather means of safe transport
4365875 the presence of four companies each from china and malaysia and three each from russia and brazil serves as a gentle reminder that these countries are emerging as viable outsourcing destinations

4365897 a skill development corporation will be created by the government with the active participation of the private sector to give special training to our young men and women our workers and our technicians
4365898 as someone who started his professional life as a teacher i feel proud to say that our government has been giving special attention to the development of education in our country
4365899 we want every section of our society to get access to education
4365900 i want to see a modern india imbued by a scientific temper where the benefits of modern knowledge flow to all sections of society

4365920 now it is possible for bad people as well as good to be friends to each other for pleasure or utility for decent people to be friends to base people and for someone with neither character to be a friend to someone with any character clearly however only good people can be friends to each other because of the other person himself for bad people find no enjoyment in one another if they get no benefit

4365972 la tendencia a la destrucci n es uno de los medios empleados para la conservaci n del mundo

4366002 de reformatie der kerk roept tegelijkertijd en onmiddellijk om de reformatie van heel het leven haar consequenties moeten onderzocht en zoo ze gevonden zijn ook aanvaard en toegepast worden zeker niet altijd is het ons direct duidelijk waar er noch ook in welk opzicht er in de samenlevingsverbanden van woordverlating en dus van deformatie sprake is daar zijn allerlei oorzaken voor die ik nu niet bespreken kan in elk geval staat dit wel vast dat we om dat te kunnen zien altijd weer en altijd meer terug moeten naar de schrift zonder ophouden hebben wij ons geloovig biddend in haar te verdiepen wie dat geloovig en biddend doet die krijgt naar gods beloften te doen met het wonder der schrift en dat wonder der schrift is dat er dan poorten opengestooten worden waardoor we licht hebben en al meer licht verkrijgen want dan opent zich gods woord en de opening van gods woord geeft licht en dat wonder der schrift is dat dan de dingen transparant doorzichtig worden zoodat hun werkelijkheid zich aan ons ontsluit maar dan leeren we ook zien den weg dien we hebben te gaan
4366003 tegelijk leefde sterk het bewustzijn dat met de gereformeerde theologen van vroeger tijd en van de vorige eeuw niet het laatste woord was gezegd er kwamen nieuwe vraagstellingen in een nieuwe tijd vraagstellingen die serieus genomen moesten worden en waarbij men niet meer uitkwam met vroegere arbeid daarvan werden ook juist in het kader van nieuwe vraagstellingen zwakke plekken zichtbaar
4366004 wanneer dan al deze dingen over u komen de zegen en de vloek die ik u voorgehouden heb en gij dit ter harte neemt te midden van al de volken naar wier gebied de h ere uw god u verdreven heeft en wanneer gij u dan tot de h ere uw god bekeert en naar zijn stem luistert overeenkomstig alles wat ik u heden gebied gij en uw kinderen met geheel uw hart en met geheel uw ziel dan zal de h ere uw god in uw lot een keer brengen en zich over u erbarmen hij zal u weer bijeenbrengen uit al de volken naar wier gebied de h ere uw god u verstrooid heeft al waren uw verdrevenen aan het einde des hemels de h ere uw god zal u vandaar bijeenbrengen en vandaar halen de h ere uw god zal u brengen naar het land dat uw vaderen bezeten hebben gij zult het bezitten en hij zal u weldoen en u talrijker maken dan uw vaderen
4366005 want dit gebod dat ik u heden opleg is niet te moeilijk voor u en het is niet ver weg het is niet in de hemel zodat gij zoudt moeten zeggen wie zal opstijgen ten hemel het voor ons halen en het ons doen horen opdat wij het volbrengen en het is niet aan de overkant der zee zodat gij zoudt moeten zeggen wie zal oversteken naar de overkant der zee het voor ons halen en het ons doen horen opdat wij het volbrengen maar dit woord is zeer dicht bij u in uw mond en in uw hart om het te volbrengen
4366006 zie ik houd u heden het leven en het goede voor maar ook de dood en het kwade
4366007 ik neem heden de hemel en de aarde tegen u tot getuigen
4366008 gedenk dan van welke hoogte gij gevallen zijt en bekeer u en doe weder uw eerste werken maar zo niet dan kom ik tot u en ik zal uw kandelaar van zijn plaats wegnemen indien gij u niet bekeert

4366029 we need to look at this on a fair playing field basis theres other countries out there that value their automotive industry greatly their tariffs reflect that
4366030 if it tariffs has to decrease wed like a more gradual decrease as an industry we are pretty united on that the tariff is a big issue for us

4366035 early eating patterns have implications for attainment that appear to persist over time regardless of subsequent changes in diet
4366036 there was no relationship between school meals or packed lunch consumption and later attainment once the junk food dietary pattern prior to school entry and other confounding factors were introduced in the analysis
4366037 this research highlights the importance of diet before entry into formal education for later school attainment and calls for a concerted effort between schools families government departments and other agencies to improve the nutritional intake of children

4366047 but after two hours they were advised that there was really no point continuing with their efforts
4366048 she miss clark made a special effort to come out in the dark last night it was probably a bit scary coming down the mountain in the snow partially on a skidoo said ann braun elwert
4366049 we dont really know what the real cause of death is we are just guessing its a heart attack hes such a fit strong man its the last thing i thought would have taken him
4366050 it takes her about 24 hours to tune out of her special work environment and then shes like everybody else mr braun elwert said in an interview in 2000
4366051 one of the big positives is going to be the oil price thats going to be the major point of differentiation between bhp and rio tinto as far as the market is concerned fat prophets analyst gavin wendt said

4366060 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4366061 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4366062 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4366063 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4366067 no one is ever called or aspires to be the solzhenitsyn of our generation
4366068 solzhenitsyn turned into such a crank in his later years unheeded even in his own country
4366069 orwell looked straight at the worst that human beings are capable of and without the consolation of utopian expectations or spiritual support indeed he seemed to take sadistic pleasure in rubbing our faces in evils indecency and ubiquity human nature was human nature even if the humans were pigs he didnt turn away from the horror or yield to despair and he didnt retreat either into irony or piety he is the dominant writer i would say because he is the model for precisely the kind of courage we seem to require today

4366115 there are people who are advising him to avoid confrontation but i dont think he has made up his mind
4366116 it is at the moment that pakistan cannot afford confrontation
4366117 and its obvious that the present government and president musharraf cannot get along so it is in the best interest of pakistan that some way is found whereby this mode of confrontation can be changed or can be more conciliatory
4366118 should safe passage be given to someone who has done this to pakistan
4366119 he wants safe passage by breaking pakistans law he wants safe passage by breaking pakistans constitution he is asking for safe passage by selling out pakistans sovereignty
4366120 melbourne has been a strong club for four or five years i hope he can make it 12 from 13 he must enjoy playing against them
4366121 willie will thrive on the atmosphere down here on friday night he usually lifts for big occasions and a lot of teams have lifted to play us weve been minor premiers or premiers of late
4366122 he probably gets his teams up for those games hes played plenty of tests and plenty of origins and quite a few grand finals
4366123 i think youd rather have him in your team that out of it with that stat
4366124 but you cant read too much into that its more coincidence more than anything
4366125 theyve got the versatility to change around a bit bring blokes in to the middle then put them out wide we probably wont know until the night
4366126 theres a bit of a size difference between our lock dallas johnson and their lock i think its the biggest lock against the smallest lock
4366127 their commitment is their greatest weapon they work hard for each other
4366128 we have to be committed and try and get some mistakes out of them but you dont get many they pounce on your weaknesses
4366129 melbourne execute well under pressure they have practised it for years
4366130 yeah i think they are on our great days we can match it with them but week in week out we are a fair way off
4366131 it will be a great test to find out where we are at were down on troops but i have confidence in the blokes we have in there
4366132 weve only just made some contact with toulon i suppose the encouraging part of that is theyve shown great respect for the order of the court
4366133 it shows that an injunction and an order of the supreme court of nsw is significant

4366156 we are confident that jackson browne will prevail in this lawsuit not only have senator mccain and his agents plainly infringed mr brownes copyright in running on empty but the federal courts have long held that the unauthorized use of a famous singers voice in a commercial constitutes a false endorsement and a violation of the singers right of publicity
4366157 in light of jackson brownes lifelong commitment to democratic ideals and political candidates the misappropriation of jackson brownes endorsement is entirely reprehensible and i have no doubt that a jury will agree
4366158 im a fighter and i believe that if somebody should be holding a belt in the ufc its brock lesnar
4366159 ive been in front of a lot of crowds but the one thing i hadnt been in was the octagon and fighting a former champion
4366160 i put a lot of pressure on myself that first fight i had more pressure on my first fight i think than i did this fight
4366161 when brock said he wanted to fight in the ufc i told him this isnt the place to learn how to fight
4366162 he wanted to come here and test himself against the best
4366163 ill be honest i didnt think he could come in here with no fights and compete at this level he proved me wrong he looked unbelievable im very impressed and i think everyone else is too
4366164 i got really excited after i won and i have every right to be i came off a loss and it was tough i dont like to lose and it feels good
4366165 ive been working on everything not just the right hand its one of those things where we broke heath herring down and the advantage we had in our camp was heath didnt have any footage on me and we had everything on him he was expecting me to shoot on him and i faked a shot faked a jab and came with the right hand and put it where i needed to put it
4366166 that was for heaths camp because on the way out to the octagon there was some things said before the fight and i had the last laugh and the last words to say thats all that matters to me
4366167 but i was having fun you know i like where im at and if i offended anybody im sorry ah not really
4366168 i was in the entertainment business for four and a half years i didnt forget who i was nor will i ever forget i started wrestling when i was five years old nobody gave me anything in my entire life ive had to fight for every damn thing that ive got and im proud of it im proud to be here
4366169 i feel at home here people bounce around from job to job their whole lives and never find a home i feel like this is where i belong

4366187 like how he thinks about me often and how he would love to get together again
4366188 it was not handwriting it was block writing it was consistent but weird
4366189 he tried to date all the young girls in san marino and i wondered how he got the trust of our fathers and other men in san marino he was a complete pathological liar
4366190 i said hes creepy dad theres something wrong with him
4366191 he was always nudging either myself or my husband to invest in this or that
4366192 he wanted us to foot the bill for bringing the stones over
4366193 my husband thought it was kind of a cute scheme we kind of chuckled about it because his schemes were so grandiose
4366194 i was under the impression that he didnt even have a place to live
4366195 he wouldnt tell us where he was living hed say he wasnt at liberty to say because after all he was occupying someone elses place
4366196 the only suspicion i had was that he wasnt really wealthy like he said he was

4366223 is already paying off for a pair of activists who have pocketed tens of thousands of dollars heading up the ballot campaign a herald review has found in fact libertarian activists carla howell and michael cloud took in nearly 200 000 in consulting fees for two anti tax ballot initiatives and work on their political campaigns over the past six years in the 18 month period after the first income tax question failed the committee for small government which listed cloud as its treasurer and howells wayland home as its headquarters continued to accept political contributions and the pair took nearly 89 cents of every dollar donated for past consulting fees
4366224 remained open to pay off their debts which included 29 000 for her and about 25 000 for cloud the committee finally disbanded in may 2004 and launched anew in 2007 without cloud in any official capacity
4366225 has performed better in national polls than any libertarian party presidential candidate in history
4366226 polls have showed barr winning as much as 5 percent of the vote 2 points more than libertarians need to regain automatic ballot access but the commonwealths voters may not get the opportunity to choose barr in november
4366227 secretary of states office insists that barr should be well barred the massachusetts libertarian party listed its state chairman george phillies as a stand in presidential candidate before the libertarian national convention in may phillies was seeking the national partys nomination but told state election officials he wanted the actual nominee to be listed on the ballot if he lost while phillies is certainly entitled to object to barrs policy positions especially as they relate to the religious and cultural concerns of his state committee members massachusetts libertarians need ex republicans like barr when the gops statewide candidates have been weak or nonexistent it has benefited libertarian party candidates

4366232 is scheduled to appear at the josephine county fair tomorrow and saturday
4366233 while democrats are looking to knock republicans out at the state level the gop is facing serious challenges from libertarians over who the real party of opposition is in travis county the libertarian party of texas is demanding that the travis co republican party hand over public records of its march 4 precinct conventions and its leaders say they have been waiting four months for them under the texas election code convention chairs must make copies of the original list of all delegates and alternates selected and submit them to the county chair within three days of the convention while the originals are not public information the copies are and thats what lpt executive director wes benedict is requesting

4366235 effectively gives permission to abcs producers to copy the underlying premise of a show without licensing the format
4366236 frapa and the international tv production industry have waited in vain for abc and or disney to respond to howard davines memo which if authentic is unacceptable both creatively and commercially
4366237 frapa believes in and fights for the intellectual property of formats frapa believes that formats belong to the people who create them and that they should not be used unlawfully by any third party even one as powerful as abc
4366238 in frapas view davines memo can be seen to be encouraging abc producers and show runners not to licence formats honestly
4366239 if this is found to be the case frapa will do everything in its power to help protect the property of its members in the international creative community
4366240 if abc and disney refuse to repudiate the contents of the davine memo then producers in both the us and around the world might note their silence and help themselves to the underlying premise of hannah montana
4366241 producers might even be persuaded by mr davines memo to be inspired by the general underlying premise of a well known disney cartoon character in the spirit of the memo the rip off rodent might be called tricky mouse
4366242 what is often overlooked or not fully appreciated are the complexities associated with negotiating format deals coupled with the fact that often times what is appealing in the format may be nothing more than a general underlying premise which in and of itself may be no reason to license the underlying property
4366243 a tipping point has been reached and the latest cuts are now threatening the very future of the papers if you continue to deny resources for editorial you inevitably produce worse products and why would business advertise in or readers buy such products
4366244 the strategy of cut cut cut in editorial budgets has been shown to be a failure and its time it was reversed shareholders should be fearful for their investments and local communities should fear for the future of their papers

4366253 as we see the stabilizing of commodity prices not only here but across the world we are going to get into a situation where farmers and ranchers are squeezed because prices are up for inputs and prices are going to start to tail down now for their products and that is a formula that just doesnt work

4366304 we believe that the main function of the tree is to facilitate the flow of water from the ground and into the atmosphere to achieve that function the tree is ideally designed to not only maximize the flow of water but in order to be successful in the real world it must also be able to withstand the stresses of the wind it is exquisitely designed to do just that
4366305 the tree is a physical flow architecture that has evolved to meet two main objectives maximum mechanical strength against wind and maximum access for water coming from the ground through the tree and into the atmosphere in the larger sense the forest itself is a flow system with the same mechanical properties and functions as the individual tree facilitating the flow of water across the globe
4366306 winds come in many speeds but their ultimate effect is cutting off trunks branches and leaves so whatever is too long or sticks out too much is shaved off so the pattern of the tree is the result of the never ending assault by the wind

4366364 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity
4366365 the days and months to come will determine the future course of us russian relations
4366366 but by the same token my personal view is that there needs to be some consequences for the actions that russia has taken against a sovereign state

4366377 its really sickening and its really dirty they are being very private and secretive about it

4366419 what the russians are saying now is not at all different from what they said about hungary in 1956
4366420 the simple fact is that foreign troops are deployed in the territory of another country bombing cities and killing innocent civilians

4366444 we do not agree with the faas findings and characterizations of americans action in these cases
4366445 in accordance with faa procedures for handling these matters we have requested to meet with the faa after we have had time to thoroughly review their findings so that we may discuss the issues since these matters are ongoing with the faa we will not have any further comment at this time
4366446 i dont see any prospect for the use of military force by the united states in this situation
4366447 were concerned about reports that russian forces have entered and taken positions in the port city of poti that russian armored vehicles are blocking access to that port and that russia is blowing up georgian vessels
4366448 we have found that a lot of the initial reports that we have received on things going on in georgia have not been accurate
4366449 our latest information for example is that the commercial port at poti is intact and usable and we think that the russians never actually imposed a blockade
4366450 we do not need nor do we intend to take over any air or seaports in order to deliver humanitarian assistance to those caught in this conflict

4366463 should safe passage be given to someone who has done this to pakistan
4366464 he wants safe passage by breaking pakistans law he wants safe passage by breaking pakistans constitution he is asking for safe passage by selling out pakistans sovereignty

4366488 look i thought this entry is about some dead russian author isnt the title an allusion to the dead mans novel and yet here you are rambling about the heat and he time what a waste of time
4366489 like millions of citizens solzhenitsyn lived through tough times he was one of the first to talk about the inhumane stalinist regime and about the people who experienced it but were not broken we owe him a lot
4366490 for the ethical force with which he has pursued the indispensable traditions of russian literature
4366491 was heir to a morally focused and often prophetic russian literary tradition
4366492 weve only just made some contact with toulon i suppose the encouraging part of that is theyve shown great respect for the order of the court
4366493 a financial settlement is going to be found at the beginning of next week
4366494 were happy to talk weve said that all along and well start to open up some discussions now

4366498 the club can confirm that it has received the decision from fifas dispute resolution chamber drc on the claim made against adrian mutu
4366499 chelsea is delighted with the drcs decision to award the club 13 68million in compensation
4366500 this is an important decision for football not only did the drc make us a very significant monetary award the decision also recognised the damaging effect incidents involving drugs has on football and the responsibilities we all have in this area
4366501 chelsea will now be following the process laid out in the drcs decision to claim the money from mutu
4366502 the game on saturday morning comes very quickly but in fairness i am not in a position where i can make many changes at the moment
4366503 a reasonable target for fabregas is the second leg of the champions league game but diaby will take four to six weeks
4366504 they have got the control and they have got the quality and if they play for arsenal then that means they are very good
4366505 i am happy for them because when i was the same age as them i dont think i was at a big club like arsenal and it is a joy to work with them everyday
4366506 i think getting into the england squad was a massive boost to deans confidence its seen him go on to another level
4366507 hes got that ability and looks so natural i see good things for him this year regular england call ups
4366508 i think he senses there is a real chance for him to get into the england team he wants to reach 20 goals this year
4366509 thats another big thing for him because he spent so long on the sidelines
4366510 tenth was probably more than we deserved but this season you will probably see the west ham everyone wanted to see last term
4366511 finishing in the top six is achievable but were going to focus on the top eight and hope were there or thereabouts
4366512 the squad on paper can compete with the teams around us trying to obtain fourth fifth or sixth spot
4366513 its important we get off to a good start and hope that momentum can carry us through
4366514 theres pressure at every club our crowd is very demanding
4366515 theyve obviously been educated over the years to expect a certain brand of football
4366516 theres an expectation level and clearly last year no one reached it its up to us to give them what they want
4366517 were not going to be dictated to by the fans but we want to play an exciting brand of football and win classic games that everyone watches and talks about in the pubs afterwards
4366518 its something we all want its just a matter of achieving it
4366519 we need to change our mentality quickly for the premier league opener
4366520 facing sunderland away will be a very tough game they have strengthened their squad and are always difficult on their own ground
4366521 we have a few minor injuries bruises and so on xabi alonso and yossi benayoun have got some small problems but they will be okay for the game in sunderland
4366522 we would have preferred that he did not need to play we waited and waited but in the end we needed him because we were not in control of midfield
4366523 competition for places must improve we have several away or injured we need more players to out pressure on players
4366524 i do not like to talk about specific players but clearly we were not the best we were not good in midfield or the defence
4366525 if you have more players competing for positions in the team things are better we need new players but for the moment we must work to make the ones we have got better players
4366526 now we are looking forward to saturday and the first league game at sunderland to show who we are and what we are
4366527 we know in liege it was not our best game but we want to step things up and we know there is quality in the team we have shown that in pre season and now we must show it in competitive matches too
4366528 we have some big games coming up one of those is on saturday at sunderland so we must not play again like we did against standard
4366529 do you want a ride sweetie i think its going to get harder
4366530 yes was delightful as you can see i worked up quite a sweat
4366531 this is so frustrating we had so much fun and someone just comes in and smashes it
4366532 wow thats such an amazing person who has that set of rules and thinks that way
4366533 you dont understand you have to be able to laugh at your predicament everybody has to be able to do that

4366538 the board unanimously concluded that this revised proposal also materially undervalued the company and its prospects and that the proposed transaction structure was unattractive for shareholders

4366545 my first thought was that he had robbed a bank
4366546 there was over 71 000 in that bag thats more than my husband earns in a year
4366547 i just got an e mail one day and i figured what the heck i put my name on it like the instructions said and i started sending it out
4366548 i get junk e mail all the time and really did not think it was going to work
4366549 about a week later i rode my bike down to the post office and my post office box had 1 magazine and about 300 envelopes stuffed in it
4366550 the five dollar bills just kept coming in and i just kept sorting them and stashing them in the closet i barely had time for my homework
4366551 i didnt want the banks to get suspicious so i kept riding to different banks with like five thousand at a time in my backpack i would usually tell the lady at the bank counter that my dad had sent me in to exchange the bills and he was outside waiting for me one time the lady gave me a really strange look and told me that she would not be able to do it for me and my dad would have to come in and do it but i just rode to the next bank down the street laughs

4366553 do you know where freshmen go they put me in the wrong room
4366554 rising ninth graders have a lot of anxiety about going into high school
4366555 the idea is to sort of set up some kind of connection with them
4366556 the ultimate idea is to make that transition smoother because thats just a real rough year
4366557 even though my sister came before me and she kind of showed me around i still didnt really know where my classes were i didnt know a lot of teachers
4366558 they have an opportunity now to kind of get their bearings before school starts
4366559 everybody knows youre a freshman when you have a schedule and youre walking around and you dont really know where to go and reynolds is a huge school
4366560 we lose a lot of our freshman by the time they become seniors some to transfer but most to dropouts
4366561 i hope they will come feeling less anxious about finding their way around a new facility and be better prepared to organize their class work and extra curricular activities
4366562 youre in a point in your life right now where you really dont need to say its not my fault or he made me do it or she made me do it no excuses
4366563 its your time to step up thats what we expect

4366601 maybe its a new tattoo and she is covering it until it heals
4366602 door alle rompslomp heb ik de laatste weken mijn hoofd niet echt meer bij fietsen ik denk dat het beter is dat ik me richt op volgend seizoen waar ik sterker dan ooit wil terugkomen
4366603 ik heb jaren met plezier bij deze ploeg gereden maar het is duidelijk dat het de laatste weken niet meer boterde meer wil ik er niet over zeggen omdat de afspraak is gemaakt dat we ons onthouden van commentaar voor mij is het nu belangrijk om zo snel mogelijk een goede andere ploeg te vinden
4366604 im in the right spot just because they wanted to sign me didnt mean i wanted to play overseas that wasnt in my mind set
4366605 he has some great physical skills that allow him to be special at defense
4366606 he just has to learn our schemes hes kept himself in good shape
4366607 he can play in an nba game right now whether he gets an opportunity is based on how well he plays it depends on how he transitions as a rookie hes definitely talented enough to step in and contribute
4366608 it took a little time to get the contract done but it got done i want to be in the best position to go to boston and give them what they drafted
4366609 i cannot rest i must draw however poor the result and when i have a bad time come over me it is a stronger desire than ever
4366610 i believe a leaf of grass is no less than the journey work of the stars
4366611 i must be good at everything or people wont like me
4366612 its your fault i feel this way you make me upset
4366613 no one will ever love me because i was abused as a child
4366614 i heard about facebook and wanted to know what it was about
4366615 i love being online and it beats writing with a pen
4366616 more and more people are on facebook now but at 102 i have a lot to put on about myself
4366617 ive only got nine friends on the net at the moment but im hoping for lots more im going to put some of my photos on my page

4366626 we cannot wait to see a fall in inflation before we start cutting rates because by then it would be too late
4366627 things have worked out broadly speaking the way we intended them to
4366628 as well as costs going up businesses were widening their margins so there was a pronounced increase in inflationary pressure the danger was that if that continued it would cause severe difficulties for the economy in the years ahead
4366629 weve asked households to cut back on spending and weve given them the inducement to do so with higher interest rates households have responded favourably households have been prudent in cutting back on spending and lifting savings that is why the reserve bank can talk about cutting interest rates
4366630 and i was hoping it would be enough at that point
4366631 i didnt think whether i was going to make it or not but how i was going to make it
4366632 ask me on another day or if i hadnt won
4366633 our pitching has been great kuroda got us to the eighth and he was able to throw his breaking ball free and easy
4366634 im not taking anything away from them kuroda mixed it up nicely we just didnt play up to our capabilities
4366635 its tough right now we have to find a way to win
4366636 i always look for the fastball he gave me a good pitch to hit and i looked for the mistake

4366643 as a councillor i have to weigh up all the options i understand that it will bring a lot of building work and employment to the area
4366644 but what about the type of people it will bring here people visiting those locked up in prison
4366645 this area is already targeted by criminals and chancers from manchester and liverpool
4366646 why go for wrexham anyway its too far from the courts in caernarfon and theres no direct route to the prison the bus service is atrocious
4366647 wrong site for a north wales prison for many reasons
4366648 youre the first person to come and ask what my feelings are weve heard nothing from the council or anyone
4366649 nobody seems to care what we think most people here dont want it and im not sure id feel safe here anymore
4366650 other companies wont want to invest here either this area is for industry
4366651 we dont know what type of prison its going to be we dont want any sort but the thought of an open prison across the road when im out with my children is awful
4366652 i dont particularly want a prison here but if theyve made their minds up theres nothing we can do
4366653 as long as the prisoners are locked up and are well supervised i cant see a problem it will bring jobs at the end of the day
4366654 it doesnt bother me its better than having a dirty great factory

4366660 they are saying if you do it according to the book its none of our business they have pushed against mr musharraf
4366661 we waited for you till 9 but it was getting late and your parents pushed to carry on and finish
4366662 have i in the last two years ever asked you why you come home late every day have i ever asked you to take me out with you even to the temple that you go alone every weekend have i ever told you how it feels to attend family functions without you
4366663 karthik please look at me will you i need an answer today
4366664 really what is it please tell me i know that you agreed to our marriage only because you did not want to disappoint your parents i know that im your wife only for the sake of it but why should gaargi suffer because of all this doesnt she deserve to be called your daughter what is her fault
4366665 srishti i am really very sorry i dont know how to tell all this and im not sure how youll take it you are not my first love i had never liked any girl in my life until i met a very nice person who i decided would not only be my first love but also the only love in my entire life
4366666 your mother told me i know everything but i wanted you to tell
4366667 karthik have i ever made you feel that i had been betrayed by someone who i thought would be the only person in my life
4366668 he not you was the first man in my life and i too had dreamt that he will be the only one ever but our relationship collapsed after 5 months of our engagement when i came to know that he was already married my parents were more than broken when they found this out for they were the ones who had found this person through some marriage bureau i went into depression and had attempted suicide twice but somehow survived see even god does not want me so i decided to live on as life takes me although i knew that i will not be able to forget any bit of it
4366669 karthik i know that you too had given all the love of your life to her i also know that she never reciprocated your love and that she was never ready to accept you as her man even though you were ready to sacrifice yourself for her but dont you think it should always flow both ways dont you think that it is not worth crying over someone who cannot feel your love is it fair on your part to ignore someone who is craving for your love and actually deserves it look into my eyes dont you see anything which suggests that i deserve to be loved by you i know karthik i know that theres some space in your heart that has been made for me i can see it in your eyes too when i look into them i do not feel sad that theres a lot of pain in it instead i see that part of it which tells me that im not completely unwanted so i ask you the same thing that you had asked her please give me a chance dont tell me that you cannot love me even a little i know you do and gaargi is the proof
4366670 i switched from my dress sweats to my parka shoes threw my cap and goggles on and then they pushed us on out no time
4366671 there wasnt much time but i think theres going to be a lot of time for me to rest over the next 18 hours or so and ill be able to be ready for tomorrow mornings 100
4366672 with cavic and ian having a great semi final its going to be a good race tomorrow

4366679 australia at 10 per cent makes it tougher for local manufacturers in competing and drawing innovation and new technology to australia mr reuss said
4366680 we need to look at this on a fair playing field basis theres other countries out there that value their automotive industry greatly their tariffs reflect that
4366681 if it tariffs has to decrease wed like a more gradual decrease as an industry we are pretty united on that the tariff is a big issue for us
4366682 one of the big positives is going to be the oil price thats going to be the major point of differentiation between bhp and rio tinto as far as the market is concerned fat prophets analyst gavin wendt said
4366683 we saw spot oil prices hit a record high of us147 per barrel and that has to have a positive rub off on their earnings
4366684 while the market is generally aware of cost pressures throughout the industry we are concerned that there is a tendency to underestimate the quantum of cost increases goldman sachs jbwere said in a client note

4366690 light as a metaphor for visionary thinking reflected the companys operating and guiding business philosophy
4366691 in practice you look over and there goes larry nixon there goes dion hibdon
4366692 i had the best practice ive had in a long time
4366693 he knew every brush pile i knew so that was to his advantage
4366694 man man man it was close there are so many big ones in this lake
4366695 i fish the stren northern division and let me tell you columbia is hot
4366696 i feel like theres more fish there you just dont know if other people are utilizing them too
4366697 i had a rough practice believe it or not i wasnt on anything and i just went up on the bank and trash fished and was fortunate enough to get three big bites
4366698 i never caught more than three keepers a day but in the last hour of practice i pulled into a shallow area that looked right i fished it for about 30 minutes and never caught a fish but i saw a couple of big ones blow up in the area
4366699 in big tournaments like this you just have to fish by instincts and make decisions on the fly
4366700 and thats exactly what happened i saw that rain and figured it would muddy up the water just enough to get some bigger fish moving to the banks to feed i ran to that place i found in the last hour of practice hoping to catch a single 4 pounder this morning in an hour and a half i caught a 7 pounder a 6 pounder and a 5 pounder i was up on the bank fishing and just ran into them it was really a blessing
4366701 the way this lake is fishing right now i might not get a bite tomorrow
4366702 i found these fish several days ago and i told my good friend chip harrison that if i could figure out how to make them bite id be a millionaire
4366703 they are cruising fish and they are huge but the problem is all they do is follow my lures ive thrown everything in my tackle box at them during practice and they just wont bite
4366704 things went much better than expected today because i actually got four of them to bite early things actually worked out for a change
4366705 these are visible fish and if they see me before i see them its over they wont bite its so weird because its like spring time fishing in the middle of august
4366706 it makes me so mad to see these giants following my bait and they wont eat i probably saw 30 of them today and some are 5 and 6 pounders
4366707 id like to just run up the river and catch a few keepers to keep me in the top 10 without having to go in there and pressure those fish
4366708 im telling you im looking at a million dollars worth of fish if i can get them to bite
4366709 i do not consider myself a local but i am familiar with the lake and im just trying to use that to my advantage by fishing everything i know here
4366710 im not really on any kind of solid pattern im junk fishing wide open from the launch site up to where the rivers split
4366711 i only made three moves today and spent about 3 hours on each spot
4366712 im fishing slow and methodical and keeping it pretty simple i dont want to get caught up in running around too much
4366713 two of my areas are very similar in terms of the type of cover im fishing the other is different but im catching fish off all three
4366714 both my partner and i noticed it at about the same time today
4366715 when boats run by the fish start snapping if i start struggling tomorrow i might just fire up that yamaha and start doing 360s just to get the fish going
4366716 i was gonna say sry for being a dick but now ill say your welcome for being a dick
4366717 i have staked my countrys fate on the wests rhetoric about democracy and liberty
4366718 we will do what we need to do in order to win winning is the prime directive
4366719 which to me says if we need money to do what we need to do he will bring it in somehow
4366720 that means weve got to keep building our farm system and our coaches because those are the people who teach so the kids can play the game in the major leagues at the highest level
4366721 theres something different that goes on when we sing together
4366722 theres something that really works about our voices when theyre paired i think were on the same page with music writing and singing we got along really well in the first place it seems like its meant to be it was kind of an absurd random meeting in the first place she was the first person i met out here i came out to record with michael my intention was to come out for a week and record it was the first time that i was out here by myself i had initially planned on going back to iowa after a day or so i made the decision that i wasnt leaving i fell in love with the west coast everything about this place is pretty amazing to me coming from iowa the first thing youve got to do when you move somewhere is make friends colbie was the first one i met i pretty much lived at her house because i didnt have a place to stay we hung out all the time and wrote music maybe theres a great deal of luck meeting somebody so real because there are a lot of people out here that arent anywhere near as real as she is i think something else had to do with it but i didnt do it
4366723 you had a year over year 60 price increase it got a bit ahead of itself in alberta and now it is correcting
4366724 people who bought in the last 12 to 15 months are angry im telling them we have an oversupply of listings inventory the largest in history
4366725 its like comparing my golf swing to tiger woods if you take away 2006 and 2007 we are back to where we should be with average sales
4366726 really have the economic fundamentals changed that much in alberta
4366727 canadas housing market is running into some seriously foul weather amid the weakest affordability in nearly two decades
4366728 given the steep run up in new listings double digit sales declines and the sharp drop in consumer sentiment price declines may become a more common feature across the country in the months ahead these latest figures simply pound home that point while we still doubt that canada will stage an instant replay of the trauma in u s markets even a mild version would be bad news
4366729 the combination of a larger inventory of homes for sale and fewer homes sales means less upward pressure on home prices in many markets
4366730 we no longer know the limits of the invading russian army russia seems intent on overthrowing the democratically elected government of georgia and occupying the country
4366731 as a consequence the national security council has just decided to bring the georgian army to tbilisi in order to defend the capital and prevent the fall of georgia

4366743 its time for a young vibrant enthusiastic coach like damon rensing is to lead the spartan soccer program
4366744 im going to stay in the background and be very low key but i just want to be there to be supportive and helpful
4366745 and be honest just to walk totally away after 32 years would be very difficult this will be kind of a nice way to phase out
4366746 winning the big ten championship was something well never forget
4366747 we geared toward it for quite a few years and came up short a couple times and to beat indiana and then northwestern in the championship is a memory that will go on and on
4366748 with a new stadium and a new young vibrant coach i just think an ncaa bid is a very realistic goal every year and every few years to seriously contend for a big ten championship is also very realistic
4366749 i really think one thing thats neat is if you have excellent spartans whove played and coached here to keep them in the program
4366750 its always been a dream to maybe sometime be in charge of this program
4366751 im forever grateful for what coach baum has taught me and instilled in me hes been a teacher a mentor and always a close friend
4366752 it was kind of cool to sit back there and watch all that happen
4366753 that was the first time that i tried doing it
4366754 i dont believe ive ever seen that especially between two pitchers
4366755 i dont believe ive ever seen four in a row between two pitchers and that many runs given up in a one run ballgame with two outs
4366756 the first two you dont feel it the third one is the one you start feeling it three in a row
4366757 i think he could still be a big offensive force for us
4366758 one of the best talks ive ever had with a player
4366759 get through this year work out during the winter i think theres a lot there offensively i do
4366760 i didnt want to make a big deal about that
4366761 but im definitely going to hit ordonez third and cabrera fourth next year two great hitters im going to get them up there more often if i can
4366762 i talked to magglio about it and told him he had his choice he chose third im going to leave it that way from now on
4366763 he gives us another experienced pitcher who throws strikes dolsi needs to go pitch hes a diamond in the rough but still a little rough
4366764 were out of it just try hard the rest of the way
4366765 i just wanted to remind the players that were going to have crowds of over 30 000 almost every game the rest of the season
4366766 we owe the fans something theyve stuck with us theyve spent their hard earned money to watch us weve disappointed them and i apologize for that
4366767 we have to see how well we can play for a month and a half lets have some fun because obviously we havent played as well as we should have im going to try to manage my butt off and all i want them to do is to play their butts off
4366768 you dont always control your performance but you do control your effort and your attitude
4366769 there was a reason for that meeting obviously he saw something
4366770 texas is 18 2 when scoring 10 or more runs in 2008
4366771 they told me if i left any it was bad luck i thought they meant the beer
4366772 you know what im trying to say make something up
4366773 were two days away from being sold out sunday for the grandstands

4366775 steve is a little taller nick seems like hes a little thicker
4366776 i dont know what their 40 times are but they run about the same theyre pretty sharp and ive been pleased with their intelligence and picking up the concepts so far but until you play who knows
4366777 the guy that runs a 4 4 40 can throw it 80 yards makes quick decisions understands concepts who wouldnt want them
4366778 i want them to get a little cranky i am
4366779 i dont know we dont have a position where i say hey i dont have to worry about that one i worry about them all

4366782 i dont think its really set in but i feel like this journey has been so long
4366783 standing on the podium and hearing olympic champion next to my name was a dream come true
4366784 i just knew that i had to give the routine of my life
4366785 i was pretty far behind but i couldnt control that i gave a great meet today that was probably my favorite moment finishing on floor because i knew i had given it my all and i couldnt change anything
4366786 its a feeling i dont think any father can describe
4366787 just to know that he was so close to the all around gold and didnt quite achieve it
4366788 and i hope you know i cleared away any of those bad little memories for him i hope that this definitely tops it i have a few more to go but it is an amazing accomplishment just to be here with him out on the floor 20 years after he competed i think it just means so much more to both of us i dont know just all the hard work paying off all the injuries tears blood rips everything
4366789 about the rocket firing i think those who are responsible are those who collaborate with israel because there is a consensus by all palestinian groups to respect the truce
4366790 linked to israel as they provide a pretext to exercise pressure on the palestinian people
4366791 it now appears that an effort may be under way to depose georgias duly elected government russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century

4366795 his is just one of what will likely be many more lie filled books rushed to print this election cycle which are cobbled together from debunked internet sources to make money and advance a partisan agenda we will respond to these smears forcefully with all means at our disposal

4366798 the current global food crisis requires immediate action to feed people most at risk
4366799 in the longer term since agriculture and the needs of small scale farmers in the developing world have been increasingly neglected in recent decades we need a significant reinvestment in agricultural development from donors and developing countries that focuses on helping small farmers boost their yields and increase their incomes

4366810 the matter is now before the constitutional court we will await the ruling from the constitutional court before we close the shelters
4366811 but remember most of the people who are in the shelters do not have any legal status in the country and the constitutional court will not rule on their legality it is merely a decision on whether it would grant an interdict against the closures
4366812 whether today or another today they will be dealt with home affairs would have to decide on the matter
4366813 there was a meeting at the constitutional court today thursday between all the parties and we hope and expect the directions will come out very soon

4366836 i know they are playing hard and i know they will keep trying to get better
4366837 its hard when you lose two out of three when in reality you know we needed a sweep
4366838 there are a lot of guys in here who take pride in what they do and dont want to be embarrassed regardless of where we are in the standings
4366839 hes one of the top three pitchers in the game if you take cc sabathia first i would take him next

4366841 itll be very limited i want to make sure and im not quite certain yet but we should have answers very shortly
4366842 ive watched it for years but its even more spectacular than i even thought
4366843 thursday is probably the most hectic day of them all
4366844 but my dad hes left me a lot of messages saying its just crazy there
4366845 i want to keep playing i know people say that the past is the past and that something like last year cant happen again
4366846 it felt great i hope to pitch sunday at washington
4366847 thats why i work so hard in the offseason to feel good right now
4366848 on the morning of june 28 1948 i walked down to the post office in our little vermont town to pick up the mail i opened the box took out a couple of bills and a letter or two talked to the postmaster for a few minutes and left never supposing that it was the last time for months that i was to pick up the mail without an active feeling of panic it was not my first published story nor my last but i have been assured over and over that if it had been the only story i ever wrote or published there would be people who would not forget my name
4366849 are particularly useful in a sentence that is long and complex
4366850 yes i would like to report a case of wifi theft
4366851 he is wearing black entirely he has emo rimmed spectacles he has a ponytail at the back of his hair not literally a ponys tail nor the pony tail that dangles down his hair but yes he tied up a tail at the top of his head
4366852 no i am very familiar with the faces of the residents
4366853 yah hacking of internet so is the furlur still down there
4366854 i did not check you mean you have not sent your men down
4366855 eh no our men was coming down but along the way they had something on so yah theyre late but our men should be coming down now are you sure that man is not a resident
4366856 i lost you for a minute can you repeat that
4366857 virtual assistants bpovia trial review startup firm shows signs of inexperience
4366858 you chose to do this yourself dont stuff words into my mouth that i forced you
4366859 i appreciate your ambitions but dont be like your brother
4366860 why didnt you seek help why didnt you ask for a tuition
4366861 i give my all to have just one more night with you
4366862 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4366863 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
4366864 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
4366865 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
4366866 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
4366867 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
4366868 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
4366869 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
4366870 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
4366871 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
4366872 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
4366873 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
4366874 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4366875 it is possible that some unknown environmental factor is the cause of current health problems and of gulf war syndrome
4366876 but it is also possible that these symptoms result from the stress of military deployment especially prolonged and multiple deployments

4366880 im very excited and i look forward to see what happens
4366881 its a huge opportunity for him to have the medical treatment here
4366882 we thought some wild dogs probably mauled him and then when he was found he was covered with blood and ants
4366883 its a miracle that not only is he alive but hes just wonderful
4366884 how can air climb the columns of cans when theres no hole at the bottom of the can
4366885 thats shocking the academic debate is between some who say that junior enlisted ranks lean slightly republican and some who say its about equal but no one would point to six to one
4366886 that represents a tremendous shift from 2000 when the military vote almost certainly was decisive in florida and elsewhere and leaned heavily towards the republicans
4366887 if on a bad day a guy gets that letter that says his tour has been extended from 12 to 15 months that could spur a quick donation and expression of anger
4366888 donating helps members of the military express their political views privately
4366889 its hard to describe how apolitical a lot of the enlisted ranks are hes worried about other things than following the news
4366890 one possibly mundane explanation for the tilt in contributions from deployed soldiers is that the obama campaign has just been so much savvier with web based donors it may be a logistical question
4366891 it took some effort to get that check i had my mom send me my checkbook and i walked to the post office in camp liberty in baghdad with an envelope addressed to barack obama in chicago illinois
4366892 he was right on iraq long when others were jumping into the sea like lemmings and thats hard to do were soldiers and we respect courage
4366893 most of my friends are conservative republicans and they say im voting for barack mccain does not have a lock on the military vote thats for sure
4366894 well complete our duty im deploying next year because its a commitment i made to the nation not to a president but we all know that iraq was a big mistake
4366895 as soon as the surge was ordered my tour was extended just by a pronouncement from the president for very few americans can the president say something and your lives are changed

4366906 this morning the prime ministers office backed the comments by ratu epeli saying they shared similar sentiments
4366907 fiji is of course free to arrange any meetings with forum partners throughout its time in niue
4366908 allowing ample opportunity for discussions before the partners leave niue at 9 40pm
4366909 there is therefore no basis to any suggestion that new zealand is somehow preventing the participation of the fiji interim government delegation in either the forum or the post forum dialogue
4366910 new zealand has by granting specific exemptions to its travel ban to enable transit through auckland ensured the opportunity for the interim government to front up to leaders in niue
4366911 were hoping cristiano will do well he comes with a good pedigree hes scored in european leagues overseas so hopefully hell be one to look out for
4366912 hes scored a couple in pre season and we just need him to knock in another 10 15 more this year and we should be right
4366913 it was disappointing in that respect not scoring enough goals in pre season but we created the opportunities which was good and hopefully theyll start going in on the weekend
4366914 weve been pretty sharp this weekend at training so were confident in our ability to score goals
4366915 weve got port adelaide in round 21 id love to be able to beat port adelaide over there and we play richmond last
4366916 im in the game to win and thats what we need to be in
4366917 if were not good enough to win then the outcome is you get that pick but there are still three or four games to go
4366918 i expect us to be competitive and win on saturday and i expect us to go to aami and win next week
4366919 that makes it four and we have richmond at the end and i will still be trying to win the game
4366920 we really were terrible last week really poor and how we bounce back on saturday is going to tell us a story on how far our young players have come and all the players who have represented the club this year
4366921 we may not have scrutinised the geelong game but we will certainly scrutinise this game
4366922 we are really at a stage where we are strongly reshaping the club
4366923 weve made changes on our list when i first came in last year
4366924 theres been a lot of changes through the club for the whole year from an administration point of view
4366925 at the end of the year again well make changes to our list
4366926 we need to reshape our list and get us into a situation where weve got better resources to train at
4366927 we have to have a more effective pre season training schedule
4366928 i think then when we start to be able to put in place the way players where they should train and how they should train then i think well get the best out of the players

4366935 the awarding of this exploration licence will benefit the local area and the state
4366936 it will generate funding for infrastructure and services such as hospitals schools and roads
4366937 the nsw government says this is an exploration licence but really its the go ahead for massive coal mines that will rip the heart out of the gunnedah plains
4366938 the government will pocket 675 million but abandon farmers and its responsibility to tackle climate change all for the profits of a foreign owned company
4366939 this study needs to look at the underground and surface water flows of the liverpool plains prior to any further exploration or mining taking place as we are particularly concerned by the governments assertions that strict environmental regulation will prevent any impacts on aquifers
4366940 there are concerns from our members about the impacts of coal mining activities on agriculture and the failure by government to consider these impacts when deciding to release new mining tenements

4366959 weve been pretty sharp this weekend at training so were confident in our ability to score goals
4366960 missing out on the finals last year was very disappointing so thats something we need to change for this season and theres also the champions league we need to try to qualify for again
4366961 the nation inflicted significant damages and pain on many countries especially on people in asian countries
4366962 here i express on behalf of the nation deep remorse and humble condolences for all of the people who fell victim

4366980 i think then when we start to be able to put in place the way players where they should train and how they should train then i think well get the best out of the players
4366981 when that happens then i think you can look at actually setting some parameters
4366982 this morning the prime ministers office backed the comments by ratu epeli saying they shared similar sentiments
4366983 fiji is of course free to arrange any meetings with forum partners throughout its time in niue

4366995 jamaican dancehall culture music it made sense to reach out to one of its biggest stars
4366996 the moment america finds itself in daring to re imagine itself and its place in the world
4366997 we are pleased to have met our primary endpoint for improvement in cfa with trizytek and this achievement is a major milestone for our company the outcomes were driven by the strong positive data from the 26 centers in the u s where we will be initially seeking approval upon completion of our long term safety studies
4366998 our overall top line results were affected by a marked difference between patients within the u s and outside of the u s although we have not yet analyzed individual patient data on aggregate patients from 3 out of 6 non u s countries did not appear to show a difference between trizytek and placebo groups
4366999 we are currently investigating possible factors that may have affected the results outside the u s and upon completion of the investigation we will report the findings moving forward we have requested a pre nda meeting with fda to discuss these results and we remain committed to driving trizytek toward commercialization
4367000 the data are very compelling and the results from the cf centers in the u s confirm the phase 2 study which was conducted solely in the u s during my 20 years of treating cf patients i have seen significant advancements in patient care and trizytek is a good example of an innovative drug that has the potential to enhance nutritional outcomes which are strongly correlated with pulmonary status
4367001 trizytek has the potential of being formulated for young children and other patients who cannot swallow capsules
4367002 we are very encouraged by the trizytek efficacy data because this treatment will offer important new benefits to cf patients who need enzyme replacement therapy
4367003 currently the dosing regimens for enzymes can be a challenge for patients the one capsule per meal dosing for trizytek will help drive better compliance and therefore enhance long term patient health outcomes since 2000 the foundation and altus have worked together toward a goal of bringing this new treatment to the market the data reported today reinforces our business model of supporting highly innovative therapies for cf patients
4367004 the trizytek clinical program demonstrates our commitment to advancing novel enzyme replacement therapy options for both cystic fibrosis patients and others who suffer from pancreatic insufficiency due to the uncertainties with therapeutics that contain animal derived ingredients we believe there is a need for new products that are derived from recombinant technology such as trizytek i would like to thank all of the investigators study coordinators dieticians patients and patient families who participated in this trial in addition i would like to acknowledge the cystic fibrosis foundation for its continuing support reaching this milestone was a great group effort by all parties involved
4367005 we now know that hivcide i was clearly superior to the triple drug combo cocktail in all parameters we observed
4367006 the novel mechanism of action of hivcide i defines a new class of anti hiv drugs this enables that it can be combined with the existing cocktail in such a combination a much greater level of effectiveness could be achieved compared to what is possible today
4367007 if our preliminary results can be duplicated in humans it is quite possible that hivcide i either alone or in combination with the current combo cocktail may provide a functional cure for hiv aids
4367008 together with our european marketing partner takeda we concluded that requesting reexamination of the initial chmp opinion is a feasible option for making this important drug available as a controlled pharmaceutical product to patients throughout europe as we are allowed to do in canada following the recent marketing authorization under conditions for catena in that country we are aware of the challenges of such reexamination processes but we believe that the clinical benefit afforded to friedreichs ataxia patients was underestimated in the initial assessment

4367022 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4367023 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4367024 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4367036 we want to inculcate the value of food production not only to the students and employees but more importantly and generally to every ordinary
4367037 that increase of population is a substantial number of mouths to feed already
4367038 and if we will not do something about it then we are in for greater problems
4367039 that is why we have come out with initiatives on food production
4367040 this is not just a one time program and will stop after sometime but we will sustain this

4367043 britains waterways are on the brink of an astonishing revival and some of the uks biggest trucking firms are leading the way
4367044 it might seem odd that one of the goals of britains biggest branded truck company is to get trucks off the road but that is exactly what we are trying to do
4367045 it seems ironic that we are now looking to revive more traditional modes of transport but new pressures such as congestion rising fuel prices and the environment mean the old methods are becoming viable again
4367046 britain is covered with castles that were built in medieval times when people had to protect themselves from invaders but there are no longer battles and no one is suggesting that we restore them to their original function why should it be different for canals we cant influence the prevailing economics the amount of subsidies given to canal transport dwindles into insignificance alongside those given to roads because canals are not judged to be a transport network
4367047 in cases where it would cost 11 per tonne to transport some cargo by road and 10 per tonne to transport it by water companies often stick with road because it is the tried and tested option
4367048 no he sabido estar a la altura y me he lleva una gran decepci n he sacrificado toda la temporada para hacerlo bien en los juegos ol mpicos y no he sabido hacer una buena calificaci n
4367049 por dar un dato me parece que he hecho pr cticamente la misma marca que en pista cubierta para m ha sido un gran golpe
4367050 he hecho un primer lanzamiento a asegurar para hacerlo v lido un segundo que se me ha escapado de la mano y en el tercero he tenido buenas sensaciones pens que era de m s de veinte metros y sin embargo nada m s que fue de 19 80 por lo tanto no he sabido estar a la altura
4367051 ahora mismo no lo s ha sido algo muy fuerte para m ten a puestas muchas ilusiones y no me llevaba una desilusi n tan grande desde hace muchos a os
4367052 cada uno sabe en cada momento en la posici n en la que est y hoy no era mi posici n el veinte del mundo
4367053 tengo que ver cu les son mis posibilidades y como he dicho m s de una vez a o a a o plantearme si voy a seguir compitiendo tengo que tener ilusi n y ganas de continuar porque estar en la alta competici n es algo muy dif cil se necesita mucho esfuerzo y se sacrifican muchas cosas por ejemplo llevo sin ver a mis hijas un mes y medio y es sacrificado
4367054 este tipo de cosas la gente no las ve y son importantes tienen un gran valor llevo diecis is a os en la alta competici n y muy pocos lanzadores a nivel mundial pueden decir eso

4367062 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer

4367069 bella and edward are no longer in high school theyre dealing with grown up family problems not teen problems when young readers were reading about people they could relate to in the earlier books they were willing to ignore the way so many characters roll their eyes chuckle and snore the improbabilities regarding plot and the scenes that went on way too long but bella becomes matronly in breaking dawn and edward seems as if he ought to be out playing golf

4367105 its just a terrible thing to see one of your old friends pass away an emotional miss clark said after her guide former nuclear physicist gottlieb otto braun elwert 59 collapsed from an apparent heart attack
4367106 it was very harrowing but everybody rose to the occasion and we just threw everything we could at trying to get support in
4367107 we got to the hut door and two people went inside the hut and gottlieb came back out of the hut and collapsed on the snow miss clark said
4367108 gottlieb was one of the most incredible people i have ever seen i have had so many beautiful trips with him miss clark said
4367109 they did an incredible job of trying to resuscitate him they worked on him for over two hours mr crow said
4367110 but after two hours they were advised that there was really no point continuing with their efforts
4367111 she miss clark made a special effort to come out in the dark last night it was probably a bit scary coming down the mountain in the snow partially on a skidoo said ann braun elwert
4367112 we dont really know what the real cause of death is we are just guessing its a heart attack hes such a fit strong man its the last thing i thought would have taken him
4367113 it takes her about 24 hours to tune out of her special work environment and then shes like everybody else mr braun elwert said in an interview in 2000

4367220 er staan hele bloemperken langs het ravijn maar sommige rozen hebben wel doorns met een beleggingshorizon van twaalf maanden of meer zijn aandelen aantrekkelijk pas op met zogenaamde goedkope aandelen voor veel financials en cyclische aandelen is het nog te vroeg ga voor olie farma voeding nutsbedrijven en telecom
4367221 het ravijn veroorzaakt door de kredietcrisis is steil en diep ik waag mij daar nog niet in de buurt maar ik zie genoeg muurbloempjes met verborgen schoonheid sommige zoals aalberts arcadis en grontmij worden kwetsbaar verondersteld bij een afzwakkende conjunctuur maar een bedrijf als imtech lijkt daar weinig last van te hebben
4367222 a man of words but not of deeds is like a garden full of weeds

4367226 i touched the wall and was like thank you finally
4367227 you can start by not worrying about what everybody else thinks
4367228 nobody knows what ive really gone through in the last eight years and what has gotten me to this point besides myself and a few people that i know well so its my own personal deal at this point
4367229 thats the theme of the meet you have to break a world record to win i gave it my all and i had nothing left
4367230 im very proud of what ive done ryan swam well he earned it
4367231 its been a long road to get here and i really cant believe that just happened
4367232 i really couldnt breathe that last 50 i was just digging deep and couldnt breathe

4367238 never in a million years would i have thought that they are going to do this and left for five days straight
4367239 were a big family and we live in a small town
4367240 its about understanding how to use the web to get your message out there and get your supporters to distribute it for you
4367241 this is the home page this is where were greeting people
4367242 do you think these guys could make eye contact with us no
4367243 hes using lots of different type faces at all different sizes which gives you a feeling of chaos
4367244 obamas then goes on to do what mccains doesnt which is to provide his supporters this whole infrastructure to organize themselves to do things that are going to help get obama elected and mccains just doesnt do that
4367245 it allows everybody who wants to do something to put their thing out there and see if people get excited about it
4367246 building communities online takes time and building strong robust web sites also takes time so its kind of like getting a 747 to take off from a small regional airport there aint enough runway

4367256 the united states spent 45 years working very hard to avoid a military confrontation with russia i see no reason to change that approach today
4367257 i think what happens in the days and months to come will determine the future course of u s russian relations
4367258 my personal view is that there need to be some consequences for the actions that russia has taken against a sovereign state
4367259 to punish georgia for daring to try to integrate with the west
4367260 if tomorrow president saakashvili signs these documents then the withdrawal of the russian troops can start

4367263 on this show we talk to men about the things that are happening in their lives right now and we challenge them to do something about it
4367264 guys respond to a challenge the lord will help them but they have to admit that something is not right in their life
4367265 men have dropped the ball they need to be the spiritual heads of their families women have taken over that role you see wonderful young ladies with two kids and no guy at church where is he fishing golfing theres nothing wrong with that but you have to do first things first
4367266 life in the spirit seminars teach you that the holy spirit is not some bird flying around out there he dwells in each of us we all want a personal trainer for our physical workouts but we have the greatest spiritual trainer of all the holy spirit through baptism and confirmation we just dont call upon him the life in the spirit seminar taught me to turn my life over to the lord i dont have to worry about doing everything on my own
4367267 men dont think of the lord when things are rockin and rollin when things start turning bad thats when we need to be available to the men
4367268 wow good job you looked like the sort to gag but you didnt
4367269 justice scalia says that original meaning is to be found in the historical practices and understandings of the time not the views of the documents drafters
4367270 i agree that its an ultimate safety net and we cannot and certainly cannot retrench back to the 18th century but hopefully we are evolving toward more and more freedom and equality for more people and thats exactly what the trajectory of this country is in when you think of where we started
4367271 where is that one way street nadine where does it say that the only way the constitution the bill of rights can evolve is in the direction of more freedom it does not say that anywhere youll find that it has evolved in both directions
4367272 if you fall in love with an evolving constitution do not think that its going to evolve in just one direction its going to evolve in both directions
4367273 hai orang orang yang beriman jika kamu menolong agama allah nescaya dia akan menolongmu dan meneguhkan kedudukanmu

4367285 in the end though stephen was the most consistent at the quarterback position i told him it was his job for today and he would have to hold on to it nothing is set in stone except that he is our starter for the arkansas state game

4367310 because the nature of military service can make it more difficult for veterans to find employment after separating from the service the federal government has a special obligation to look to veterans first when federal jobs come open
4367311 highlighted the need for federal government hiring preferences to be extended to spouses as well as veterans this simple step will help alleviate the lower than average employment rates for military spouses
4367312 response lacked much substance and the central request of my letter remains unaddressed
4367313 the overall figures hide a wide disparity between various departments and agencies in terms of their success in recruiting and hiring veterans
4367314 this is an area that has not gotten the attention it deserves

4367321 the vast majority of civilian employees government employees use the cards responsibly at the same time i would say there is abuse and the goal is zero and we need to make it zero
4367322 as a current fed i just wanted to say that this misuse of government credit cards is exactly the sort of thing that gives working for the federal government a bad reputation
4367323 even the best prepared workers face difficult choices when children need their care
4367324 so i guess youre boyfriend doesnt know that you meet guys like me
4367325 actually hes very funny about this kind of thing but i reckon that sex outside a relationship is like dessert a nice extra that compliments the main course the boyfriend doesnt need to know about this and what he doesnt know wont hurt him for example its nice to meet older guys like you sometimes for diversity

4367349 to be honest aceves has more or less lived up to my expectation he throws strikes and doesnt miss by much when he misses but hitters at this level seem to be having an easier time making solid consistent contact than the hitters in double a and a ball triple a is an adjustment and aceves is going through it he allowed three hits in the second inning and four hits in the fourth but he also sent the side down in order in both the first and the third i dont think hes overmatched at this level hes just challenged at this level to be more than a guy who throws strikes

4367358 we are in the market for a striker and made a substantial offer which has been well documented
4367359 we will have to wait and see what happens we are trying to address certain weaknesses in the team and we will continue to do that right until the window closes
4367360 we have problems up front as we are missing key personnel we are a little bit light and went with two young guys who are still learning the game it was difficult for them
4367361 i think what the bid does show is that the club is in decent shape financially and that we were able to make a bid of that significance
4367362 i think everyone will say the same thing its a challenge
4367363 we cannot lose sight of the fact that more than half of our students and too many students of color are still not meeting our high standards
4367364 that is an act of terrorism against the nation its terrorism from within during a water crisis

4367445 i think a 10 percent decline would actually not be a problem for this market the market has been up 10 percent in the last four months
4367446 in 2009 and into 2010 i think prices should remain strong but i dont think theyll keep rising at the same pace
4367447 we use gdp per capita which doesnt really account for the fact that a lot of wealth could be sitting in the top two percent of the population who dont need four or five houses
4367448 the rise is not yet a trend for the dollar but if it continues it could be a positive in terms of encouraging the type of buyer that we want buying in the market rather than speculative buyers

4367482 the place that has suffered most is south ossetia which is home to both ethnic ossetians and georgians the latter accounting for about a third of the population
4367483 ossetians fleeing the conflict zone talk of georgian atrocities and the indiscriminate killing of civilians
4367484 on august 7 after days of shooting incidents in the south ossetian conflict zone georgian president mikheil saakashvili made a speech in which he said that he had given the georgian villagers orders not to fire that he wanted to offer south ossetia unlimited autonomy within the georgian state with russia to be a guarantor of the arrangement
4367485 both sides said they were discussing a meeting the next day to discuss how to defuse the clashes
4367486 that evening however saakashvili went for the military option the georgian military launched a massive artillery attack on tskhinvali followed the next day by a ground assault involving tanks
4367487 this was a city with no pure military targets full of civilians who had been given no warning and were expecting peace talks at any moment

4367516 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4367517 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4367518 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4367519 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4367520 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4367521 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4367522 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4367523 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support

4367534 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4367535 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4367536 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4367537 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4367538 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4367539 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4367540 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
4367541 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
4367542 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4367543 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4367544 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4367545 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4367546 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4367547 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4367548 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4367549 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4367550 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4367551 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4367552 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4367553 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
4367554 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
4367555 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
4367556 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
4367557 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4367558 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4367559 membership websites are informational hubs that provide specialized knowledge in a well packaged form
4367560 i am convinced that honouring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4367561 during the investigation it became apparent that the registrant was holding morning surgeries on exactly the same basis as dr gray himself she was holding open morning surgeries on occasions when dr gray was not there or when he could not do it himself
4367562 we say the scope and remit of these open surgeries either held alongside dr gray or alone went far beyond anything she was qualified or experienced to do as a nurse practitioner
4367563 a lady came in with a prescription it was signed by dr gray despite the fact that i knew he was on holiday
4367564 the reason why i went across to the surgery was the quantity of one of the prescriptions was for one capsule there was no locum doctor on duty at that point i was told by the receptionist that the quantity should be 28
4367565 i was told that it was authorised by dr gray i was not satisfied with this because it was obvious dr gray was not on the premises
4367566 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
4367567 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
4367568 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
4367569 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
4367570 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
4367571 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
4367572 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4367573 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4367574 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4367575 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4367576 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4367577 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4367578 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4367579 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4367580 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
4367581 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
4367582 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4367583 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4367584 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4367585 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4367586 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4367587 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4367588 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4367589 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4367590 who are open to doing something on the production side
4367591 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4367592 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4367593 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4367594 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4367595 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4367596 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4367597 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4367598 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4367599 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4367600 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4367601 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4367602 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4367603 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4367604 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4367605 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4367606 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4367607 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4367608 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4367609 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4367610 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4367611 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4367612 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4367613 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4367614 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4367615 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4367616 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4367617 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence

4367625 it shouldnt surprise anyone that bitterly divisive democrats like barney frank dont have anything good to say about republicans fair minded people look at mitt romney and see a strong leader a man of character and integrity who was elected as governor at a time of job loss and recession and who managed to balance the budget all four years without raising taxes and get the massachusetts economy moving again
4367626 i think there are better choices for senator mccain that have the approval of value voters
4367627 the issue is that in many ways mitt romney has had very definite swings of position not just on one or two things but on many of the issues

4367632 i wouldnt be particularly sure until the transfer deadline passes what might materialise so well see
4367633 i came from a very kind of pseudo strict household
4367634 both of my parents are still to this day traveling ministers and i wasnt allowed to listen to a whole lot of music growing up i wasnt really involved in a lot of pop culture to the state when people have pop culture references from the 90s im completely clueless the new kids on the block are still the new kids on the block to me theres no old in them but i left home at seventeen and moved to los angeles and just kind of started changing and growing and singing about everything under the sun
4367635 im not exactly the poster child of what they thought i would be when they had me
4367636 but im not strung out and doing spreads naked and stuff im on track and got a head on my shoulders and i know i write about everything in life
4367637 im glad i didnt put out the record i thought i should have put out when i was seventeen eighteen
4367638 its a song about curiosity its a song that i wrote because i opened up a magazine and i looked and i saw i think it was megan fox or scarlett johansson and i looked up at my boyfriend and i said you know what im not gonna lie i know you have your one this is my one if she were walking in through the door and she wanted to make out with me scarlett johansson im not going to lie i probably would let her do so are you okay with that yep its okay so its kind of about the beauty of a woman and how it doesnt matter who you are male or female if giselle bundchen walks into the room everybodys jaw is dropping
4367639 a lot of girls i think sometimes are asking themselves is he on my team or is he on the other team
4367640 its a song i wrote by myself in my little apartment and thought nothing of it
4367641 i was going through a period in my relationship a transitioning period that i think a lot of people go through where they have had that first love and its not necessarily right and they move onto someone else but they feel bad about it and theyve got that sick to their stomach feeling even though youre not together youre doing something wrong and this isnt natural and this isnt how it should be it wasnt mean to be this way i was supposed to be with you but its not thats how it is
4367642 its the closing song on the record and its an anthem
4367643 i have gone through so many different emotions i dont wanna be one of the boys youre not man youre a mannequin youre so gay i kissed a girl i got lost i woke up in vegas and i thought of you by the end of the day im leaving my fingerprints and i want to break the mold i dont want to be a stereotype
4367644 oh man it wasnt a history it happens right now

4367690 hey im sure glad you never listened to me about those v8s
4367691 son i cant sell em as fast as youre bringing em back
4367692 whether you think that you can or that you cant you are probably right
4367693 i was speechless when they told me about the jersey retirement earlier this summer and i still dont think its sunk in
4367694 man when i see that number and my name on the stadium i dont know what im going to do
4367695 being down two match points and the other guys serve youre never really feeling good
4367696 but looking back i might have needed a tough match like this
4367697 this morning we saw pictures of the warsaw ghetto at yad vashem and this evening we are going to the ramallah ghetto
4367698 anyone who tars israel with the nazi brush by drawing obscene analogies between israeli policies on the west bank and the warsaw ghetto is wandering into very questionable territory and is legitimately open to strong criticism
4367699 drawing comparisons of contemporary israeli policy to that of the nazis
4367700 drawing comparisons of contemporary israeli policy to that of the nazis
4367701 the jewish israel lobby with its active network is extended over the world
4367702 for the practitioner to cry foul by claiming that the israel lobby is out to silence all legitimate criticism of israel is itself nothing more than another rhetorical trick in the standard lexicon of anti zionism
4367703 if henryk broder exposed one more example of this mendacious behavior then good for him
4367704 i share henryk m broders view it is a rare phenomenon to find even jews in germany expressing themselves in an anti semitic and anti zionist manner and ms hecht galinski is a leading representative she obviously tries to cope with her self hatred through anti semitic and anti zionist statements the central council will support henryk broder in this trial if ms hecht galinski thinks she has to solve the problem in the courts
4367705 modern anti semite does not believe in the protocols of the elders of zion but instead he fantasizes about an israel lobby that is supposed to control american foreign policy
4367706 for the modern anti semite it goes without saying that every year on january 27 he will commemorate the liberation of auschwitz but at the same time he militates for the right of iran to have atomic weapons or he inverts the causal relationship and claims that it is israel that is threatening iran and not vice versa
4367707 devote your attention to the modern anti semitism that wears the disguise of anti zionism and to its representatives you will find some of the latter among your own ranks
4367708 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4367709 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4367710 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4367711 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4367712 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4367713 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4367714 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4367715 its just a terrible thing to see one of your old friends pass away like that
4367716 i came out with damien last night because we wanted to say face to face to the family what had happened
4367717 we need to give the family time and space now and prepare for the funeral so we will be heading away
4367718 they tried everything they could doing cpr for two hours is pretty harrowing
4367719 after already investing thousands of dollars we have employees leaving after just one day on the job
4367720 together with the fiesta resort we wanted to do something here on the property knowing that this is where we hold a special place with him
4367721 our tasking today was to come out and focus mainly on the air conditioning units here at the school
4367722 est claro que el tirador norcoreano se dop deliberadamente para mejorar su resultado es probable que la gimnasta vietnamita haya estado mal aconsejada porque sus resultados claramente no mejoraron

4367768 there is a clear case for a new prison that can cater for inmates from north wales and their families
4367769 obviously there will be people with concerns but there will now be a period when we can have a discussion about what needs to be done in caernarfon for it to be taken into consideration
4367770 i have high hopes that my constituents will take full advantage of that
4367771 i appreciate that it could bring jobs which would normally get my vote but it offends and frightens me to hear that it would be so close to caernarfon
4367772 we would need reassurance that it was not an open prison not category a there are concerns
4367773 i dont want to be a nimby not in my back yard but you have to ask is this serving the community and i dont think it is
4367774 i dont know what exactly they have planned and im a bit surprised that no one from the council has asked for our opinion as to any effect on us
4367775 we have invested heavily at the site and will be doing so again in the future
4367776 a lot of people are in jobs here including graduates and many of our employees have been with us for over 20 years
4367777 this is not a good idea in caernarfon as it is mainly a tourist area and it will put people off visiting here and businesses will suffer
4367778 you are talking of at least five years of work on the construction and then after it opens jobs in admin and security
4367779 we the directors of bluefield caernarfon ltd felt it was only right that the local community and key stakeholders are given the opportunity to put forward their views on this proposal

4367789 the journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step
4367790 when i took a step i felt the rock press into my foot looking ahead i pressed my weight down and took another step the rock fell away eventually and my journey continued
4367791 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
4367792 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
4367793 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
4367794 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
4367795 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
4367796 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
4367797 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
4367798 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
4367799 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
4367800 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
4367801 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
4367802 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
4367803 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
4367804 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
4367805 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
4367806 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
4367807 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
4367808 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
4367809 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
4367810 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
4367811 once again we have an opportunity to take a giant leap for humankind
4367812 when we send money to foreign countries to buy nearly 70 percent of the oil we use every day they build new skyscrapers and we lose jobs when we spend that money building solar arrays and windmills we build competitive industries and gain jobs here at home
4367813 i have long supported a sharp reduction in payroll taxes with the difference made up in co2 taxes we should tax what we burn not what we earn this is the single most important policy change we can make
4367814 we must recognize those who have toiled in dangerous conditions to bring us our present energy supply we should guarantee good jobs in the fresh air and sunshine for any coal miner displaced by impacts on the coal industry
4367815 in recent years our politics has tended toward incremental proposals made up of small policies designed to avoid offending special interests alternating with occasional baby steps in the right direction our democracy has become sclerotic at a time when these crises require boldness
4367816 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil 10 years from now
4367817 more than any time in history mankind faces a crossroads one path leads to despair and utter hopelessness the other to total extinction let us pray that we have the wisdom to choose correctly
4367818 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
4367819 says he has all the answers and it will only cost 3 trillion
4367820 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
4367821 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
4367822 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
4367823 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
4367824 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer

4367826 there is only a 1 in 130 chance that the analysts consensus forecast will be within 5 percent for any four consecutive quarters to put this in perspective your odds are ten times greater of being the big winner of the new york state lottery than of pinpointing earnings five years ahead
4367827 dreman recounts a study that used a sample of 67 375 analysts quarterly estimates for new york and american stock exchange listed companies between 1973 and 1990
4367828 it found that analysts average forecast error was 40 percent and that estimates were misleading i e missed their mark by more than 10 percent two thirds of the time
4367829 the people at reynolds metals couldnt possibly tell you how much theyll earn in the future because it all depends on aluminum prices
4367830 if you ask phelps dodge what it will earn next year phelps dodge will turn around and ask you what the price of copper is going to be
4367831 if analysts guess too high and the company reports lower earnings than the guesstimate theres a good chance that the price of the companys shares will fall
4367832 if however analysts guess too low its taken as good news and very often the stock spikes higher
4367833 the match has struck the fuse has been lit and four or five years from now opec producers are going to be drinking their own oil and choking on it
4367834 you had a perfect storm of pre olympics demand in china a plunging dollar speculation cold weather and fear of supply disruptions in nigeria and iran pushing it up and now theyve all swung around on a dime

4367840 clinton has travelled a similar path and his opinion is one we respect he was adamant that mark will be an absolute hit in the game
4367841 a player like mark has that experience and is able to fit a certain hole in terms of our squad list
4367842 he was the right person for that position that didnt exist off contract at the moment in rugby in australia
4367843 marks going to fill a real hole there for us in terms of experience expertise great football mind and also a little bit older hell be very good for us we believe
4367844 the difficulty with such unusual jobs is that they often dont fit in the pre written rule book but that doesnt mean there shouldnt be any rules when it comes to negligence in some ways the more unconventional the job the more you need to think about the hidden risks
4367845 in todays compensation culture it is unfortunately all too easy to imagine a customer suing their dog psychologist if their dog continues to eat their slippers or somebody taking their feng shui consultant to court if theyre not happy with their homes energies
4367846 it clears deputies pretty easily and makes good cases for us
4367847 i would not sell them to reality tv that is not the purpose of the technology
4367848 there have been videos of high speed chases that have been great evidence it really puts the jury there
4367849 it shows the guy belligerent and drunk and falling down its not just the officer describing him
4367850 but that hasnt stopped us from looking at new technology
4367851 youre looking at the total picture with your team going forward and considering how much better can it get the way it is vs what is the potential to get better by doing something different
4367852 you know if you have a big shade tree then shade is good to a point
4367853 but if theres too much shade then the grass doesnt get to grow
4367854 we have seven or eight core veterans who are really good pieces we have this young group here behind them starting in october training camp well see what it looks like
4367855 we felt he was really a top 20 talent going in
4367856 he played really well over the las vegas summer league and adds another exciting skillful player to our team that we can go forward with
4367857 being able to acquire another young talent with size and skill who should be a natural small forward in the league along with a veteran like bobby and not sacrifice any real future salary cap flexibility that starts to become attractive to you
4367858 but we continued to talk and we always felt like ron was a player that if we could acquire for the right pieces would as were talking about today add a significant upgrade

4367864 perhaps a dozen pieces at the uc davis medical center in the meditation chapel and corridors
4367865 i know more about fred than anybody and this piece does not sound familiar to me
4367866 i think but im not positive that he and ball were buddies
4367867 there was a show a year and a half ago that traveled around the u s and picked the 10 top enamel artists in the country
4367868 californians are already reeling from skyrocketing gas and food prices
4367869 the last thing they need is to go to the supermarket and pay higher prices for a dozen eggs
4367870 were talking about a pretty small additional increase to get these animals out of these horrible crammed cages
4367871 itll just make california more dependent on other states and other countries for eggs
4367872 were near mexico which is probably the no 1 place that wed buy our eggs if the initiative passed
4367873 manure is a problem when its in such concentration as these places with tens of thousands of animals in the same building

4367878 i dont know if were very good but i think well find a lot out in the first half tonight
4367879 this is a big physical team that can rush the passer can stop the run and can run the heck out of the ball its the perfect team for us to be playing in my opinion
4367880 you can harp on a guy but if he doesnt want to go out and bang 70 plays and 16 games in a year youre not going to get it out of him
4367881 its being fundamentally sound and getting the guy on the ground
4367882 thats what being physical is about getting the guy on the ground no matter how you do it thats the bottom line whether its a knockout hit or drag down tackle you want to get him and get off the field

4367895 seagate has already made its intentions about jumping into the ssd game pretty clear and one analyst now says he sees two clear options at the companys disposal if it wants to seriously make a go of it each of which involve seagate shelling out a good chunk of cash according to lazards daniel amir one option would be to buy out intels 49 stake in the im flash technologies joint venture it has with micron which would reportedly cost anywhere from 1 to 2 billion not to mention put seagate on the outs with intel more likely than that amir says would be an acquisition of or partnership with sandisk which he says would be an ideal fit given seagates expertise on the enterprise side and sandisks retail knowhow amir doesnt put a price tag on that option though but you can be sure it wouldnt be cheap

4367905 the boat at hope cove is vital because it takes 25 minutes for the lifeboat to get from salcombe and a swimmer could easily drown when the mca withdrew the boat in june they said it would be for six weeks but the crew wanted it back as soon as possible so they paid for the repairs themselves
4367906 they were then told it had to stay off service until it was surveyed and that would have taken it out for the whole of the summer season anyone would have done the same thing when they saw the girl in trouble
4367907 the health and safety of the boat crews and those who they may render assistance to is of paramount importance
4367908 search and rescue effectiveness will not be compromised by the suspension of the general purpose boat these general purpose boats are additional facilities and are not generally used as part of the first response to an incident

4367937 hearing professionals contend that the younger the candidate is the more effective the implants can be but deaf leaders point out that when children are implanted it is hearing people parents and doctors who make the decision they believe that children ought to be allowed to grow up with exposure to other deaf children and adults to acquire and use asl to develop positive attitudes toward their own deafness and all of deaf culture and then to choose for themselves whether to receive the implant or not
4367938 as immigration policies and procedures continue to change it is increasingly important to apply for and to obtain citizenship
4367939 its really easy for all of us to get complacent and think
4367940 this case sends a message that it can happen in small town america that it can happen anywhere
4367941 my thesis is that the american people and their chances for good government are the ones most harmed by these scandals in fact i recommend that we should stop considering sexual behavior as a qualification for political office
4367942 it makes men want to have more different partners on top of the self selection of adultery prone men into politics the opportunities probably increase for a successful politician
4367943 not so oversupplied with brilliant wonderful effective politicians that we can afford to disqualify a substantial number of them based on something as irrelevant as a bit of wild oats
4367944 at the place where they detained us they conducted an interrogation

4367947 i am writing this letter to implore you to pray for my personal safety and for the freedom of belief of us chinese people

4367951 we put so much time and energy into these animals
4367952 its gut wrenching to think what might happen to them
4367953 our first goal as always is to see the horses get adopted into loving homes
4367954 just two years ago we were paying 10 a bale for hay now its 20
4367955 theyve lost their job or their house or just had to cut back and they dont know what to do about their horses
4367956 its a very dark day for horses in our economy
4367957 i never thought i would see a day when we had to think about euthanasia
4367958 i think they are trying to help the city well assume they are good samaritans and not that they wanted to avoid inheriting our problems
4367959 law enforcement is very important to this community and to the council but if you dont have enough money you dont have enough money
4367960 we issued the permit in error and now weve stopped the work i personally drove there at 7 in the morning and stopped it right away
4367961 i would be very upset if they were mad at me
4367962 i laid out a ton of money for the work and it was based on the assumption that the city knew what they were doing when they issued a permit
4367963 on the surface it sounds like were real dorks but this is a really complicated world i live in there are a lot of rules

4367972 its nonsense that neither prime minister fukuda or the emperor are paying homage
4367973 months of political deadlock have finally come to an end
4367974 the alliance has made it certain prachanda will become prime minister as theyll easily get the 298 votes needed for a simple majority
4367975 theres no question of joining a maoist led government if our candidate is defeated
4367976 at the same time we will have volunteers touring towns and villages in the affected area of north cotabato to assess what is needed

4367978 our figures also show nine people were killed two soldiers two milf and the rest civilians
4367979 if russia does not step back from its aggressive posture and actions in georgia the us russian relationship could be adversely affected for years to come
4367980 i dont see any prospect for the use of military force by the united states in this situation
4367981 the united states spent 45 years working very hard to avoid a military confrontation with russia i see no reason to change that approach today
4367982 the days and months to come will determine the future course of us russian relations
4367983 but by the same token my personal view is that there needs to be some consequences for the actions that russia has taken against a sovereign state
4367984 residual security arrangements that the russians would be able to maintain
4367985 this army travels around with irregulars travels around with marauders travels around with rapists travels around with arsonists robbers and with looters
4367986 i think it should be possible to have this resolution before too long
4367987 critical importance of safe and unimpeded access for humanitarian actors to all conflict affected areas
4367988 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
4367989 i must tell you that i am deeply troubled by a notion i see developing in russia and that is a notion that russia somehow has a say or some control over countries outside of its borders
4367990 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4367991 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4367992 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4367993 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4367994 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4367995 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4367996 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4368037 were hoping to be able to offer gruff a ride round in one as well so if anyones got a mint delorean they want to show off then let us know
4368038 this is a unique chance to see the very best of welsh talent in a different way
4368039 its our ambition to show the world why top music makers like gruff rhys continue to reinvent and revitalise the vibrant music scene in wales
4368040 if shes talking about it im not hearing it the most feminist thing shes done is tell women to vote for her
4368041 well its fair game to judge her for standing by someone who lied to her and disgraced the office
4368042 its not fair to blame the victim for her husbands actions
4368043 i dont think any of us are in a position to judge other peoples marriages its such an intimate and personal relationship
4368044 my thoughts and prayers are with the edwards family today and thats all ive got to say
4368045 there was a major open source legal development this week and surprisingly it did not involve the string of busybox lawsuits which included settlement from mobile and telecom giant verizon in march 2008
4368046 its a real pleasure to meet you emma ronans the proper name
4368047 ah so its all very prim and proper then no hand shakes no hellos or goodbyes just idle chit chat while everyone pretends to be wallowing in misery boy i love the english
4368048 its got nothing to do with being english my brother has died today we buried him saw him for the last time he was the closest thing to me so please even if you dont feel it try to show a little compassion
4368049 but why are you thinking about how hes gone what you saw today
4368050 open up remember him as he was not as he is now think of all the brilliant times you shared that smile will come back jake i promise
4368051 im thinking of getting everyone to call me ash i love it when nick does
4368052 thats because nick is your husband and he loves you id prefer to call you a lazy cow myself shift some of these and make some beds
4368053 emma im so sorry for ringing you at work i just got so excited when i heard and thought of it
4368054 theyve given me next week off they told me to take a break after the last spell but i dont think i need it anyway i was going to refuse but then i remembered that i havent seen you for nearly five months emma
4368055 thats great what are you going to do then go to southampton
4368056 southampton no nothing to see there i was thinking maybe you could come visit for a couple of days i mean you havent seen my flat yet or even the city what do you think em
4368057 sorry jake that was aislin the laziest woman i ever had the displeasure of working with but i shall see what i can do i definitely want to come and see you but it depends on the rota here im sure i can pull a few strings though for my favourite guy in the whole wide world
4368058 well ill give you a ring when you finish work and youll let me know then yeah say hi to aislin for me catch you later em
4368059 here at gtcc the books are more than the tuition
4368060 its extremely frustrating because were the ones that have to face the students when theyre buying the textbooks and we have very little control over the biggest component that goes into pricing the textbook
4368061 theyre huge i didnt think theyd be this big or this expensive
4368062 theres a lot of work to be done but if you have a vision and you have a goal you can seize that moment
4368063 weve got new interstates the airport hub and industry looking to come here
4368064 im excited about it and i think it could be the beginning of a major development for the triad
4368065 we have a downtown that has a lot of down time
4368066 the furniture market has sort of taken over a large part of the downtown and a lot of smaller businesses have moved out in a way thats sad but it also makes it perfect for something like this
4368067 i have difficulty with the notion of punishing minors for the actions of their parents
4368068 we have to ask do we want them here without an education or with an education and a degree with which they can be better citizens
4368069 i think for us to change course in the middle of this stream to me borders on the point of being absurd
4368070 right now im very confident that this is the guy we were after all along
4368071 this is one of those cases that never went away for some of us
4368072 the effects are no doubt still fresh in the minds of those victims and we hope that news of this arrest will help them in their continued recovery
4368073 it feels satisfying that at least we know that the victims can have some kind of closure that they dont have to look over their shoulder to wonder if hes still out there
4368074 he had an uncommon sense of devotion to this place
4368075 there were no limits on his hours and dedication he lived the work
4368076 it represents the best thing that the people of north carolina have that they built themselves
4368077 god gave them their mountains and beautiful beaches and their gorgeous piedmont but the people of north carolina built their university
4368078 chancellor fordham is rightly regarded as the driving force behind a period of extraordinary success at carolina
4368079 we will never forget his deep love for this place
4368080 i have shown it to a lot of people and they absolutely love the building and see community theatre as a perfect match for the space
4368081 the main reason we are entertaining the community theatre offer is that they want to preserve that building
4368082 we dont want to see it torn down for some other kind of development
4368083 the challenge is where they get the 2 million were committed out right now
4368084 we dont need to know about the whos and the whys
4368085 we were able to give people seconds on the stuff they wanted
4368086 while i talked to them about the homeless and the hungry they gave me all they could and by the time i left their stores they were thanking me
4368087 that they felt christs blessing for their act of charity
4368088 mack truck is a very important company to allentown pennsylvania so were trying to be very sensitive to the fact that theyll be losing that
4368089 weve been on that side of the coin a couple of times
4368090 they asked for no local incentives that makes it an a plus
4368091 and its proving every day that the triad is becoming a transportation and logistical focus area
4368092 those people are the people who will fly primarily on business as well as for leisure travel
4368093 larrys about the most positive person ive ever met and ive met a lot of them
4368094 theres nothing that gets him down on the golf course or in life thats one of the things i really respect about him
4368095 you wont find a more kind hearted guy than bobby
4368096 his whole demeanor is to take care of everybody because he really cares about everybody he meets
4368097 i know i had certain advantages growing up that he didnt
4368098 if larry would have had what i had growing up he would have run past me like there was no tomorrow
4368099 and what exactly are you going to do for me
4368100 whatever you want me to do i guess you just tell me what it is and i know i can do it
4368101 other clubs will tell you they have the best guy running their locker room but trust me they dont
4368102 bobbys like family to me and id do anything for family
4368103 you come across a lot of people in your life
4368104 i pull it out now and then and read it because its so beautiful
4368105 i think i kinda like that 99 9 of our troops arent spending at least 200 on presidential campaigns
4368106 one of the most common cases i see as a legal assistance attorney in the army
4368107 most of those troops are likely too busy doing the important work of defending this country to make political contributions
4368108 the one branch where mccain leads obama in contributions is the one most likely to see the hardest action the corps
4368109 i think the lopsided contributions speak more to conservative dissatisfaction with mccain than outrageous amounts of new support for obama
4368110 i saw she couldnt give an interview down the end because she wouldnt be able to talk
4368111 she has done that before where shes really over exerted so that she cant breathe it has happened before
4368112 i just couldnt breathe i just dug so deep i just really couldnt breathe that last 50 it happened after my world record at the comm games as well so its exactly the same its the same feeling she said
4368113 i dont suffer from asthma its just purely digging deep and trying to work hard im probably not really conscious of the breathing towards the end
4368114 no not really shes a pretty good competitor anyway she showed that in the heats and semis as well jones said its the olympic games people lift and people swim fast so its good to see
4368115 we sat down as a group this week and talked about responsibility and the players led it we wanted them to lead it
4368116 what the squad has been through cant happen again the players are aware of that
4368117 theyve been through it so theres no harsher lesson than what they had to endure out there
4368118 it was clear to all the coaches that the players understood the situation and are very keen to make amends
4368119 what happened doesnt reflect the calibre of the people in the squad but its done now and we have to deal with it
4368120 weve had a couple of really good meetings thats part of the process of being a team
4368121 if you can you need to get guys to take responsibility for themselves but it has to be driven and led by the coaches
4368122 we dont think four days and two meetings makes everything all right its an every day process for all these guys and ourselves
4368123 its all about being successful and we dont want the headlines weve had this year on a couple of occasions that makes it difficult for us to operate
4368124 were not doing these things to appease the media were doing it because we think its the right way to be a successful team
4368125 the score is the score thats what counts and thats where we are
4368126 we can sit here and say we think we can do this and we think we can do that but weve got to prove it on the field
4368127 some guys came back off the new zealand tour and found it difficult especially with all the changes that were made to the team
4368128 but there are no excuses we have a tough autumn but were genuinely looking forward to the challenge
4368129 there are a lot of good players one of the problems is that countries in that situation can churn and burn through players
4368130 its been my experience in the past players evolve through repeat selection we have 32 players
4368131 we know who they are and there is a pecking order with players behind them
4368132 some arent the finished article and some are world class its a very talented squad
4368133 there is a lot of clarity about how were playing we need a plan a and plan b
4368134 the boys need something to go to if things arent going well

4368152 teresa kok had convinced the menteri besar to have a meeting with a view to re look the policy
4368153 how could developers sit in at such meetings when their interests are being discussed with ex officio status they will have access to all our reports and input the whole idea of having independent people is to prevent any lobbying or looking after vested interests
4368154 this is the last thing the new pakatan rakyat government needs as it tries to fulfil its election promises of a transparent and consultative government
4368155 we have listened to the residents and the ngos it is only fair that we hear the developers
4368156 you cant say they are wrong in wanting to develop their land
4368157 they want to know why it is different in malaysia in malaysia the flaws in hillslope development are caused by poor engineering design and sub standard quality of work
4368158 khalid is a good listener he talks to everyone we shall see if we can come to a compromise
4368159 it is unfair to lable me as a mouthpiece for the developers they are queueing up outside my office to see me but i always treat them the same way i treat anyone who would wantto see me with respect and a fair chance to give their views
4368160 there is so much land and why do they have to cut the hills
4368161 we believe our hills should be preserved as they are important water catchment areas
4368162 had convinced the mentri besar to have a meeting with a view to re look the policy
4368163 why cut the hills when there is so much land

4368165 she gets away with that because i she sells so many books or ii is such a great writer
4368166 shes earned the right to break the rules by keeping them for so many previous books

4368181 if you read the whole book you will see how these inner city students grow and change and become articulate compassionate educated young people who want to do something good in their lives despite the environment in which they were raised
4368182 i thought my students would very much relate to those kids
4368183 that was the pivotal moment of my life when i saw how my students were taken with the book how they loved it and then i am told not to let them read it i said no
4368184 she knew she had defied her supervisors direction in her work and that her defiance was insubordination and neglect of duty

4368192 we know were in the best shape we could be the rest is out of our hands we know well do the fastest time weve ever done we are going better than we were in manchester and thats all we can do
4368193 its the mental side that counts now you just want to make sure you do yourself justice im confident that im in as good shape as i can be id be disappointed if i dont go better than ever
4368194 the club can confirm that it has received the decision from fifas dispute resolution chamber on the claim made against adrian mutu
4368195 chelsea is delighted with the drcs decision to award the club 13 68 million in compensation
4368196 this is an important decision for football not only did the drc make us a very significant monetary award the decision also recognised the damaging effect incidents involving drugs has on football and the responsibilities we all have in this area
4368197 chelsea will now be following the process laid out in the drcs decision to claim the money from mutu

4368215 it was something supposed to be funny or something but never offensive in any way im sorry if anybody thought or took it the wrong way and thought that it was offensive
4368216 we thought it was something appropriate and that it would always be interpreted as somewhat loving
4368217 anyone who would like to interpret this differently is absolutely confused
4368218 dua macam rosella yang saya miliki berasal dari pemberian seorang rekan yang baru pulang dari taiwan dan yang satunya lagi saya dapatkan dari menitip seseorang ketika ia pergi ke sudan
4368219 dulu kelopak rosella dikenal sebagai frambozen yang digunakan sebagai bahan pembuat sirup berwarna merah yang beraroa khas sekarang ini kelopak rosella dikenal sebagai bahan minuman dan disebut teh rosella tanaman yang masih kerabat bunga sepatu ini banyak ditemukan sebagai tanaman pagar
4368220 kadar antioksidan yang tinggi pada kelopak rosella dapat menghambat radikal bebas beberapa penyakit kronis yang ditemui saat ini banyak yang disebabkan oleh radikal bebas yang berlebihan di antaranya kerusakan ginjal diabetes jantung koroner hingga kanker
4368221 semakin pekat warna merah pada kelopak rosella rasanya akan semakin asam dan kandungan antosianinnya semakin banyak dengan demikian kandungan antioksidannya juga semakin banyak
4368222 alhamdulillah saya sudah mengonsumsi rosella selama dua tahun dan tidak memiliki keluhan apapun
4368223 there is a case for a lifetime olympic ban and i admire what great britain has done we need to do everything we can to clean up the sport
4368224 i think christine is fortunate to be here but she didnt fail a drug test and her case is unique to me she seems clean and eager to compete
4368225 the baggage of trying to change our sport is heavy to be carrying during the olympics
4368226 its a huge injustice to the athletes who have worked so hard there are too many great athletes here to want to hear about those who cheated in the past
4368227 christine and nicola will be my biggest competition and are both extremely confident coming into the games
4368228 they have followed the same path had only a few races and a few injuries which they seem to like
4368229 they are carrying the hopes of their country on their shoulders as britains best sprinters they will be tough i just hope im tougher
4368230 im under no illusions this is going to be very tough it was around 37c in osaka last year for the 10 000m with very high humidity
4368231 my warm up was trying to nip in and out of an air conditioned room
4368232 i know the heat makes it very painful but if you prepare properly then it can play into your hands
4368233 youve seen in that semi final weve got the engine and the tools
4368234 its a case of tapping into that and making sure we have a really outstanding row in the final
4368235 the dutch were all standing around grown men crying openly
4368236 they probably came here as one of the favourites but you could see it doesnt count for anything its savage out there
4368237 its not been the ideal season but we came through it
4368238 racing together would have been nice but we learnt as much as we could about each other in the period after that
4368239 jurgen grobler their coach has been a lot more on our case if we havent delivered what he expects us to
4368240 theres a staircase to our performance and every step is important last year we were behind on each step so if you get to the top and youre still half a step behind its no surprise it all starts on that first rung
4368241 the five of us have worked really well as a team since weve been out here
4368242 i do love a challenge im looking forward to seeing how much i can get out of myself and these guys this is what the last four years have been all about if im not enjoying this then im not enjoying life
4368243 people know we have had very good start a gold and bronze in the pool
4368244 we have to go back a long way to remember a gold in swimming for britain they the public know what they are seeing is a step change i hope it continues all the way through there is a level of recognition that this is already a more successful games than before
4368245 what are important are big british moments i dont think people really sit there wondering where we finished in the medals table what they remember is kelly holmes steve redgrave matt pinsent chris hoy or nicole cooke

4368255 across the country we are getting the same message the credit crunch is hitting football and the effect is likely to be even greater next year
4368256 i did say we intended to bring in three top players but that was before the credit crunch
4368257 we cannot keep spending the amount we have spent since the summer of 2007 in excess of 60 million on players on top of that you have agents fees while the wage bill has gone up substantially
4368258 the optimism reported by clubs who expect their sponsorship to grow next season is likely to be short lived
4368259 the current arrangements are based on existing three or five year sponsorship deals that have some years to run and once they are complete it is doubtful that new deals will be easy to secure
4368260 the pressurised climate is here for some time to come so it is imperative for the long term stability of the industry that clubs tackle their money concerns with a matter of urgency
4368261 while all clubs are starting to feel the bite of the credit crunch on their sales of tickets merchandising and corporate hospitality the premier league financial directors are reporting a more widespread set of financial challenges and pressures than in previous years
4368262 fans are experiencing the current economic realities just like everyone else
4368263 i would expect that there would be a particular impact with fans travelling to away games and the sale of replica shirts football often thinks it is divorced from the realities of the world and the complacency in some areas has been quite staggering
4368264 i dont think that last year we would have seen the gareth barry deal collapse over what seems to be 1 million or manchester united taking so long over berbatov the anticipated spending boom hasnt materialised deals are collapsing over what seem to be relatively trivial sums
4368265 the number of uk billionaires is a fairly small number and many of those have indicated they do not want to get involved in football
4368266 quite simply the financial requirement is for billionaires not millionaires
4368267 its just a terrible thing to see one of your old friends pass away miss clark said after her guide former nuclear physicist gottlieb otto braun elwert 59 collapsed from an apparent heart attack
4368268 it was very harrowing but everybody rose to the occasion and we just threw everything we could at trying to get support in an emotional miss clark said
4368269 we got to the hut door and two people went inside the hut and gottlieb came back out of the hut and collapsed on the snow miss clark said
4368270 gottlieb was one of the most incredible people i have ever seen i have had so many beautiful trips with him miss clark said
4368271 they did an incredible job of trying to resuscitate him they worked on him for over two hours mr crow said
4368272 but after two hours they were advised that there was really no point continuing with their efforts
4368273 she miss clark made a special effort to come out in the dark last night it was probably a bit scary coming down the mountain in the snow partially on a skidoo said ann braun elwert
4368274 we dont really know what the real cause of death is we are just guessing its a heart attack hes such a fit strong man its the last thing i thought would have taken him
4368275 it takes her about 24 hours to tune out of her special work environment and then shes like everybody else mr braun elwert said in an interview in 2000
4368276 its just a terrible thing to see one of your old friends pass away miss clark said after her guide former nuclear physicist gottlieb otto braun elwert 59 collapsed from an apparent heart attack
4368277 it was very harrowing but everybody rose to the occasion and we just threw everything we could at trying to get support in an emotional miss clark said
4368278 that means you will also have less drug reaching the normal tissue
4368279 right now what we are doing is so called passive targeting which is using the leaky vasculature of the tumour but a more active targeting would be attaching a peptide or antibody to the nanotube drug one that will bind more specifically to the tumour which should further enhance the treatment efficacy
4368280 we are definitely hoping to be able to push this to practical applications into the clinic

4368301 while network capacity is growing exponentially so has the cost of developing new network infrastructures the vx veb160r2 ethernet extender allows operators to leverage existing copper lines to provide triple play bandwidth to the end user
4368302 not only does this give operators a cost effective solution but it also gives them a swiss army knife when building new networks with a pre existing infrastructure
4368303 we are extremely excited with the flexibility the vx veb160r2 gives us being able to take advantage of the existing copper infrastructure to deliver ethernet speeds at a low cost allows us to gain the upper hand
4368304 sometimes retrofitting existing networks isnt as easy as running new cable or fiber and with construction cost often breaking the bank the vx veb160r2 allows us to update existing networks while adding little cost to the customer

4368321 i did one miracle and you are all astonished 22 yet because moses gave you circumcision though actually it did not come from moses but from the patriarchs you circumcise a child on the sabbath 23 now if a child can be circumcised on the sabbath so that the law of moses may not be broken why are you angry with me for healing the whole man on the sabbath 24 stop judging by mere appearances and make a right judgment

4368358 the right time for me has not yet come for you any time is right 7 the world cannot hate you but it hates me because i testify that what it does is evil 8 you go to the feast i am not yet a going up to this feast because for me the right time has not yet come
4368359 i tell you the truth you are looking for me not because you saw miraculous signs but because you ate the loaves and had your fill 27 do not work for food that spoils but for food that endures to eternal life which the son of man will give you on him god the father has placed his seal of approval

4368362 what miraculous sign then will you give that we may see it and believe you what will you do
4368363 i tell you the truth it is not moses who has given you the bread from heaven but it is my father who gives you the true bread from heaven 33 for the bread of god is he who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world
4368364 i am the bread of life he who comes to me will never go hungry and he who believes in me will never be thirsty 36 but as i told you you have seen me and still you do not believe 37 all that the father gives me will come to me and whoever comes to me i will never drive away 38 for i have come down from heaven not to do my will but to do the will of him who sent me 39 and this is the will of him who sent me that i shall lose none of all that he has given me but raise them up at the last day 40 for my fathers will is that everyone who looks to the son and believes in him shall have eternal life and i will raise him up at the last day

4368367 how can this man give us his flesh to eat
4368368 i tell you the truth unless you eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life in you 54 whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life and i will raise him up at the last day 55 for my flesh is real food and my blood is real drink 56 whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me and i in him 57 just as the living father sent me and i live because of the father so the one who feeds on me will live because of me 58 this is the bread that came down from heaven your forefathers ate manna and died but he who feeds on this bread will live forever

4368405 i was hurt most of last year then my goal this year was to try go to nationals so everything i did this year in terms of rehabbing most of my training was cross training bike in the pool elliptical that kind of thing was to try and minimize the injuries and stay healthy enough to get to nationals so i havent done anything other than 400s this year where i typically would do other types of racing
4368406 its hard because i like running to take time off
4368407 theres that balance of trying to perform or run injured to keep your fitness level up or your endurance level up and backing off enough to let it heal

4368452 sometimes as i have gone witnessing with a group of people i have wondered whether im sharing christ or selling a line of products it is interesting to see how some of the airport cults have picked up on some of our successful formulas and patterns of communicating these cult members are so predictable we can see them coming a mile away like us they tend to offer simplistic pitches because of election we realize that we as christians do not have to resort to such packages of last chance tactics we know that in the final analysis only gods electing redeeming grace and not madison avenue or the latest fads of pop psychology will bring lasting reconciliation between humans and god with this knowledge we can be more comfortable with the biblical message and biblical methods we can approach unbelievers as human beings rather than targets consumers numbers and converts i am tired of evangelical conferences where more time is given to the hype than to the hope where more energy is given to the methods than to the message and where more effort is devoted to techniques than to truth

4368541 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
4368542 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
4368543 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
4368544 the vast expanses of glaciers massed on average 1 6 miles deep contain enough water to raise sea levels worldwide by 23 feet should they melt or otherwise slip into the ocean they would flood coastal capitals submerge tropical islands and generally redraw the worlds atlases the infusion of fresh water could slow or shut down the oceans currents plunging europe into bitter winter
4368545 this is distinctly alarmist and part of mr gores wake up call it is common ground that if greenland melted it would release this amount of water but only after and over millennia so that the armageddon scenario he depicts is not based on any scientific view
4368546 no rule to pursue but such as he prescribes to himself
4368547 should be as little dependent as possible on those of the others
4368548 if it be wished that my relation to the bank be continued it may be well to send me the usual retainer
4368549 that the dependency of private funding simply shifts the focus of congress thats all and if so is this really the issue to worry about
4368550 whom i think it does compromise they feel like they have to ameliorate or change their position for fear of losing certain contributions
4368551 it is very difficult for me to accept that people dont consciously or subconsciously tailor their views to where they know the sources of campaign funding can be
4368552 how are we going to raise money from those guys if we deregulate them
4368553 should the public come to believe that the scientific issues are settled their views about global warming will change accordingly therefore you need to continue to make the lack of scientific certainty a primary issue in the debate
4368554 as real a revolution in the principles of government as that of 1776 was in its form
4368555 it wouldnt have taken a genius long to recognize the corrupting influence of money in american politics
4368556 but it took me a long time to recognize it
4368557 at least al gore may have something to be happy about
4368558 whats barack obamas energy solution nothing but a bunch of hot air really
4368559 barack obama wants you to inflate your car tires yes thats right inflate your tires thats barack obamas solution to the high gas prices we pay in new mexico every day
4368560 this is the same barack obama who told a crowd of wealthy san francisco liberals that people who live in small towns cling to their religion and guns because theyre bitter
4368561 now he opposes producing more oil and gas here at home and opposes lowering your gas tax this summer
4368562 we could save all the oil theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups
4368563 now he opposes producing more oil and gas here at home
4368564 largest selection and variety of tools in the united states for filling tires and checking tire pressure
4368565 if john mccain put more money into s s then he should get more money out that is completely fair
4368566 and in the same election thank you for this miracle diebold
4368567 m ost of america understands that the competence bar is set so low for gov george w bush of texas that its practically lying on the ground
4368568 doesnt seem to realize that in the real world people hate eddie haskell
4368569 for every complex problem there is a solution that is simple neat and wrong
4368570 de facto slogan has become real men dont think things through
4368571 every day that the campaign is about race is a good day for john mccain
4368572 he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
4368573 its just a terrible thing to see one of your old friends pass away
4368574 it was very harrowing but everybody rose to the occasion and we just threw everything we could at trying to help and trying to get support in
4368575 gottlieb was one of the most incredible people i have ever seen i have had so many beaut trips with him
4368576 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
4368577 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
4368578 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
4368579 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
4368580 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
4368581 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
4368582 a career legacy politician who fell hook line and sinker for the administrations case for a disastrous war and dragged much of our party with him would undermine both
4368583 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
4368584 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
4368585 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
4368586 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
4368587 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
4368588 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
4368589 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
4368590 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
4368591 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
4368592 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
4368593 this isnt about how fast someone can download a full length movie
4368594 speed matters to our economy and our ability to remain competitive in a global marketplace rural development telemedicine and distance learning all rely on truly high speed universal networks
4368595 the test results demonstrate the critical need for the senate to pass s 1492 the broadband data improvement act to move the u s toward a national broadband policy
4368596 earlier this year the house of representatives passed a similar measure the broadband census of america act to support the collection of data about broadband deployment
4368597 construct an infrastructure with enough capacity for 10 mbps downstream and 1 mbps upstream by 2010
4368598 we are the only industrialized nation without a national policy to promote universal high speed internet access and it shows
4368599 most of our speed test users logged on with broadband connections such as dsl modem or fiber people with dial up connections didnt take the test because it took them too long so even these dismal statistics paint a rosier than reality picture of connection speeds across the country
4368600 he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
4368601 so i ask you to join with me to call on every candidate at every level to accept this challenge for america to be running on 100 percent zero carbon electricity in 10 years
4368602 we need to act now this is a generational moment a moment when we decide our own path and our collective fate
4368603 have warned that there is now a 75 percent chance that within five years the entire north polar ice cap will completely disappear during the summer months
4368604 the arctic ocean was much warmer than it is now for several millennia after the end of the last ice age we know this because there are trees buried in the tundra along what is now the arctic shore
4368605 we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires
4368606 herald a post civil rights america any more than his victory in november will mean that race as an issue has been vanquished in america
4368607 i am not persuaded that 20 000 additional troops in iraq is going to solve the sectarian violence there in fact i think it will do the reverse
4368608 we just have to slow down our economy and cut back our greenhouse gas emissions because we have to save the planet for our grandchildren
4368609 anything reflecting chinese culture chinese artifacts designs artistic styles behavior
4368610 massachusetts will lead the way in reducing the emissions that threaten the planet with climate change
4368611 we took three days and the criticism lasted weeks and weeks it looked like we spent five weeks lying on the beach and we spent two hours
4368612 i also agree that the worlds problems arent caused by global warming
4368613 whatever you do you bastard dont f in kick me just dont f in kick me
4368614 in all that time ive never seen a more controversial choice
4368615 because of both the language and the sophistication of the story its not a comfortable or happy reading experience
4368616 but it has been recognised for its artistic excellence and the brilliance of the story and we are an awards for literary merit
4368617 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
4368618 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
4368619 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh
4368620 im all about biden for many reasons the first being hes the most qualified
4368621 he has excellent experience he has been in the senate since 1985 and he serves on the armed services committee
4368622 in late june polls conducted by the wall street journal nbc and fox opinion dynamics using entirely different samples both showed sen clinton giving sen obama a 3 bump pushing him over 51 for the first time when the two of them were paired against sen mccain and gov romney
4368623 most recently in nationwide polling on july 22 23 a fox opinion dynamics poll showed a more dramatic bump of 8 with sen clinton as sen obamas vice presidential running mate in a head on match it was sen obama 41 to sen mccains 40 this was before the intense media coverage of his european trip but with exactly the same sample when all voters were presented with the choice of an obama clinton ticket vs mccain romney the results were obama clinton 48 7 and mccain romney 39 1
4368624 according to the july 22 23 fox opinion dynamics poll in an obama mccain head on match up sen
4368625 so what about independents an obama clinton ticket appears to gain some strength in this critical swing voter group with an obama mccain head on contest independents are evenly divided 32 30 with sen obama over sen mccain but with an obama clinton ticket vs a mccain romney ticket the independents favor obama clinton 38 30 a statistically significant 6 increase in a crucial voter group
4368626 i too think senator kerry is a brilliant man who clearly beat bush in the debates by miles but he does not inspire much respect in the general population which is incredibly unfair
4368627 senator clintons poorly run campaign her inability to concede error and the irresponsible behavior of bill make me think she would not be a good president should she need to step in
4368628 but why did hillary give up we dont do that here this we do not understand if obama picks her as a partner he will be considered weak by much of the world
4368629 higher superstition the academic left and its quarrels with science
4368630 because in math and organic chemistry you find truths someone cannot say 2 2 5 or that a carbon molecule no longer has a molecular weight of 12
4368631 a weaker economy soaring gas prices growing dependence on foreign oil and a worsening climate crisis
4368632 theres a bold new solution for all of these challenges
4368633 join the more than one million people who are already demanding we switch on a brighter future
4368634 the olympics are a time for all americans to reflect on our nations achievements and what we as a people can do together
4368635 choosing the right path and re powering our nation is something we can do and something that will benefit us all
4368636 our 14 offices are part of a highly structured volunteer heavy plan to win in new hampshire
4368637 we are creating neighborhood teams with volunteers who are trained equipped and empowered to build a campaign organization in their own neighborhood
4368638 i think weve built on that grass roots effort from 2004
4368639 individualism puts conservatives at a huge disadvantage as the left swarms through the big institutions they love so dearly the education bureaucracy the colleges all the layers of government institutionalized science the liberal media the only thing that saves conservative politicians is the american people if they happen to feel like it
4368640 the greatest tyrannies are always perpetrated in the name of the noblest causes
4368641 government big enough to supply everything you need is big enough to take everything you have the course of history shows that as a government grows liberty decreases
4368642 the issue today is the same as it has been throughout all history whether man shall be allowed to govern himself or be ruled by a small elite
4368643 the clintons with their folie a deux determined to get four presidential terms two for him and two for her
4368644 and the whole shebang coming to a disastrous climax with hitler mussolini and stalin
4368645 considering what the current neo con president has actually succeeded in doing to the balance of power between the branches which far supasses fdrs now feeble looking attempts
4368646 bush has gotten away with dispicable acts that any civilized democracy should not tolerate
4368647 australia at 10 per cent makes it tougher for local manufacturers in competing and drawing innovation and new technology to australia mr reuss said
4368648 we need to look at this on a fair playing field basis theres other countries out there that value their automotive industry greatly their tariffs reflect that
4368649 if it tariffs has to decrease wed like a more gradual decrease as an industry we are pretty united on that the tariff is a big issue for us
4368650 i thought i found the house of my dreams in stickney
4368651 i had such a bad experience i know i could qualify with another lender but im just going to rent for now
4368652 if youre downtown and have good credit youll get a loan
4368653 most affected are subprime borrowers overbuilt suburbs and prices that dont represent market conditions
4368654 lenders are saying the unit isnt appraising out at the level we thought and wed like you to put in another 50 000
4368655 it was a given that id be able to make the monthly payment
4368656 its so difficult to buy or sell thats why the market isnt moving
4368657 there was nothing in my background to justify this rejection
4368658 i might sell the house but the market is so bad i dont know my next move
4368659 we dont know what to tell people when they ask how much down payment theyll need
4368660 the inability of the covered worker to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which impairment can last or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months
4368661 republican presidential candidate john mccain now enjoys a healthy 88 7 percent lead over barack obama among republicans
4368662 our dangerous over reliance on carbon based fuels is at the core of all three of these challenges the economic environmental and national security crises
4368663 we havent used a drop of gasoline in a month and a half two months
4368664 going through the generator is 4 2 gallons a day every work day
4368665 it cost seven or eight dollars when i first started now it costs 32 a can
4368666 this is not new technology we just stumbled onto one spot where its working and working really well
4368667 its the first big unequivocal test about what this possible president really thinks
4368668 youve got to be sure that you get the right person the person has got to be of presidential stature has got to be someone you can be comfortable with work with and help you as president compatibility is very crucial
4368669 the chemistry between us had been correct but not warm
4368670 you dont want it to be a reason for people to question your judgment
4368671 seven words that can change the world reveals the astonishing simple truths that have the power to forever transform our world for the better while freeing our minds from the enslavement of limiting beliefs this is not a text for the simple minded it is a guiding philosophy for the mindful intelligent few who are wise enough to seek out and recognize the higher simplicities of truly purposeful living
4368672 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and the planet began to heal
4368673 anybody gone into whole foods lately and seen what they charge for arugula
4368674 as you may know a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
4368675 normally there is something peculiar about us politicians we all have our foibles david cameron is remarkably free of such flaws he does very normal things like go down to tesco and having his bike stolen
4368676 who is this guy what does he what to do what does he mean by change and what has he done
4368677 employees here dont know where hell get the ethanol there are only gas pumps here
4368678 we must lower gas prices and a chicken in every pot for every voting american
4368679 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
4368680 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
4368681 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
4368682 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
4368683 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
4368684 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
4368685 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
4368686 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
4368687 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
4368688 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
4368689 we are pleased to note ofcom has vindicated the ipccs claim against channel 4 in spirit and in substance
4368690 it is entirely appropriate people should bear a cost if only of unpopularity and criticism for speaking freely however the cost should be reasonable and not disproportionate there should not be in the words of a famous supreme court decision a chilling effect on free speech
4368691 this boat is going to be the toyota prius of the houseboat business
4368692 it is the most eco friendly houseboat anywhere in the country
4368693 gore will consume a lot more fuel driving to and from the lake than he will ever use cruising on this houseboat
4368694 climate confusion how global warming hysteria leads to bad science pandering politicians and misguided policies that hurt the poor
4368695 we are a debt relief agency amp have proudly helped people file for bankruptcy for over 30 yrs
4368696 love suffers long and is kind love does not envy love does not parade itself is not puffed up does not behave rudely does not seek its own is not provoked thinks no evil does not rejoice in iniquity but rejoices in the truth bears all things believes all things hopes all things endures all things love never fails
4368697 but love your enemies do good and lend hoping for nothing in return and your reward will be great and you will be the sons of the most high
4368698 do what you do for the right reasons and keep your priorities straight
4368699 for climate changes he glosses over that this local planetary system is in constant change and we cant accurately measure the recent relatively small changes and anthropogenic contributions are an open question
4368700 how would the developers in this audience feel if the news media were opining on the benefits of one programming language over another and other people with no knowledge of programming were making strong statements based on what theyd read or heard in the media
4368701 im curious robert whether you are also skeptical about evolution that would be a good litmus test of whether this is a political religious disagreement or a scientific one
4368702 right now your choices are between the scientists who are actually conducting the research and analysis and pundits who are opining on something that they have no data research or proper science to support
4368703 most scientists think that global warming is an issue i think its bunk
4368704 there no agreement among scientists that weather patterns are changing as a result of human activity
4368705 look they are saying there may be the equivalent of war crimes trials one day
4368706 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
4368707 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
4368708 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
4368709 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
4368710 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
4368711 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
4368712 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
4368713 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
4368714 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
4368715 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4368716 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4368717 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
4368718 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
4368719 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
4368720 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
4368721 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
4368722 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
4368723 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
4368724 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4368725 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4368726 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
4368727 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
4368728 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
4368729 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
4368730 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
4368731 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
4368732 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
4368733 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
4368734 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4368735 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
4368736 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
4368737 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
4368738 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4368739 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
4368740 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
4368741 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
4368742 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
4368743 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
4368744 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
4368745 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
4368746 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
4368747 well im voting for barack obama hell help with global warming
4368748 it would take as long as 15 years that is until 2023 to go from starting a pilot plant to proving the technology will work
4368749 we have to store radioactive waste for 250 000 years
4368750 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
4368751 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
4368752 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
4368753 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
4368754 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
4368755 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
4368756 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
4368757 messages which reek of delusional and schizophrenia need to well for want of a better word chill
4368758 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
4368759 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
4368760 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
4368761 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
4368762 we do not agree with the faas findings and characterizations of americans action in these cases
4368763 the aircraft operated four flights without a fully functioning autopilot
4368764 in intentionally continuing to fly the aircraft the carrier did not follow important safety regulations intended to protect passengers and crew
4368765 a lot of investors who have been buying commodities not just on a global growth story but as a hedge against a weak dollar are unloading those commodities based on a much more constrained global outlook and going back into the u s dollar
4368766 well have some people targeting 750 but i think we would need to see a continuation in that dollar strength to give it sufficient momentum to head that way
4368767 history shows a strong and consistent correlation between weak currencies and falling stock markets
4368768 weak currencies are a symptom of a deeper problem slowing economic growth out of control inflation or structural issues that reduce the attractiveness of equities
4368769 many of us are concerned about the quality of care extended to those who receive elective surgery
4368770 its a very seminal period an opportunity to both celebrate 20 years of content and the fact that the source was a leader in chronicling the culture of hip hop
4368771 im on a mission to restore it to the community that gave birth to it and open the door to those that currently enjoy and influence that hip hop culture
4368772 its exciting because we believe that we can do it
4368773 we shared with him what we were trying to do the vision of hip hop and where we thought it needed to go and he thought it was refreshing and clever
4368774 were just going to expand on what the source has always done well
4368775 a core focus but not 80 percent of the book
4368776 i think that what were trying to do is evolve it as hip hop has evolved and become an international force to evolve it without losing its core essence that was the centerpiece of its earliest beginnings and greatness but it has to evolve just like hip hop has to evolve
4368777 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
4368778 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
4368779 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
4368780 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
4368781 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
4368782 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
4368783 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
4368784 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
4368785 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
4368786 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
4368787 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
4368788 she came in the same day rocsi went out and he had already issued the statement that they were separated apparently she went over there and got into the fight shes now in the hospital
4368789 the sub story is that he has been under investigation because 57 million dollars is missing from our government they froze all of his bank accounts hes getting a separation because he cant afford to get a divorce
4368790 last night lisaraye her cousin phillip travis and her publicist lynn jeter assaulted the guard at the premiers home proceeded to ransack the house and then assaulted the premier and his sister
4368791 it is public knowledge that the couple has been separated for months and lisaraye has no lawful right to be in the residence her conduct yesterday clearly contradicts her stated commitment to dissolve the marriage amicably
4368792 it is with great sadness that i have to announce that my husband and i have separated last night wednesday august 13 2008 an attempt was made by and on behalf of my husband to first prevent my entry into our home and then later to make me leave our home by force it was necessary for me to receive medical treatment for injuries suffered and in relation to those injuries i shall continue to assist the police force with its enquiries whilst it is my sincere wish to avoid unnecessary conflict i shall not be intimidated nor shall those individuals whose job it is to protect and represent me i ask that my privacy be respected in these difficult times and i believe that the people of the tci will understand and support my wish to receive the necessary independent representation from the legal counsel of my choosing i hope that in time the tci government will come to share that view although i have always been a supportive wife even in light of the very serious allegations currently pending against the premier there are limits even for me i continue to have the utmost respect for the people of the tci who have always shown me kindness and support i vow to continue my work amongst the people of turks and caicos islands until recently i had hoped that i would be able to continue to assist my husband during what will undoubtedly be difficult times ahead for him i do not wish to have to add to his difficulties
4368793 i was just as shocked about hearing about it as anyone and everyone else but just as any wifes position would be in such an allegation as this it has to put a damper on the marriage
4368794 the whole idea of the movie is to make fun of actors and how far actors go self important actors actors who want recognition and the need for actors to be taken seriously
4368795 with downeys character the idea was that he is the most respected actor of his generation five oscars hes looking for new challenges we thought comedically what would be the most wrong headed thing an actor could do thinking how far he could go thinking he could pull something off a white actor playing a black character in a movie its just ridiculous and wrong that was the idea with this character leading up to the fact that this guy is so lost he doesnt know who he is now hes taken on this guy he shouldnt be playing this guy
4368796 it was very important for us in the movie to have a black actor who is there all the time just calling him on it saying this is ridiculous
4368797 it is a dicey one and it could be interpreted the wrong way so it was a really short list
4368798 i knew it had to be a really good actor it had to be somebody that was one of the most respected actors around and downey is that but he also has a great sense of humor and a fearlessness and willingness to really go for it 100 when we were doing it we didnt know if it would really work or not we were just going to try to keep our intention of what the humor is coming through which is making fun of the actors who take themselves too seriously
4368799 when you feel youre hearts guarded and you see the breaks started and when the clouds have all departed youll be right here with me
4368800 being able to express myself and my journey through my music is a feeling i cant describe
4368801 this is an in depth detailed examination thats beyond what has been broadcast in terms of these typical type of biographies
4368802 the voters are evaluating these men obama and mccain and i believe these documentaries are terrific learning tools by which people can watch and learn discuss and decide
4368803 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
4368804 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
4368805 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
4368806 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
4368807 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
4368808 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
4368809 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
4368810 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
4368811 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
4368812 its not just music for the united states its world music
4368813 im touching so many different kinds of people on this album as well as keeping my core fan base at the same time
4368814 its totally given me a new energy a new everything
4368815 when you have a lot of stress and negativity around you when you cut that away you cleanse im starting over basically
4368816 i want people to say its a breath of fresh air from everything thats out there
4368817 its still going to be me and what they know me for but its still going to be newer
4368818 if you play him enough times hes bound to have an off day
4368819 i proved that i played with the best tonight and it couldnt have happened to me on a better stage
4368820 i missed some key shots that i probably shouldnt have missed that was that
4368821 not much i could do about it so it was definitely a surprise result for me
4368822 maar andere projecten die wij daar doen lopen gewoon door
4368823 now in its fifth year the vh1 hip hop honors has come to represent the pinnacle of innovation and achievement in hip hop music
4368824 this years five honorees are no different and are being recognized for their significant contributions to hip hop culture and for helping to elevate hip hop into a truly global phenomenon
4368825 he gave us a declaration for 80 and they found 12 000 and the cigars
4368826 i have a fear of banks so i keep cash in my house and i grabbed the wrong box i took it into the country and out the cigars well i should have smoked them before i left
4368827 hes filed papers and within the next few weeks ill probably get it back
4368828 apparently a black man with dreads cant carry that much cash but i think there are a few worse things to be embarrassed about i havent cheated on my wife like some in the news
4368829 he didnt even show for the vip opening in boca
4368830 in fort lauderdale he went once for a private party and stayed in the vip area without mingling with the fans
4368831 she came in the same day rocsi went out and he had already issued the statement that they were separated apparently she went over there and got into the fight shes now in the hospital

4368836 i was just as shocked about hearing about it as anyone and everyone else but just as any wifes position would be in such an allegation as this it has to put a damper on the marriage
4368837 with all thats happening with michael the rape and the corruption allegations and his ill behavior even this weekend for our recent music festival i think hes just spiraling out of control i will just continue to be uplifting and i will pray for him
4368838 many of us are concerned about the quality of care extended to those who receive elective surgery
4368839 its a very seminal period an opportunity to both celebrate 20 years of content and the fact that the source was a leader in chronicling the culture of hip hop
4368840 im on a mission to restore it to the community that gave birth to it and open the door to those that currently enjoy and influence that hip hop culture
4368841 its exciting because we believe that we can do it
4368842 we shared with him what we were trying to do the vision of hip hop and where we thought it needed to go and he thought it was refreshing and clever

4368868 when youre trying to recover affordability levels from 24 year lows youre going to need quite some period of time of sustained improvement to make it easier for first time buyers
4368869 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
4368870 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
4368871 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
4368872 nous navons pas lintention de laisser rentrer qui que ce soit plus de 18 000 r fugi s oss tes ont fui la g orgie pour loss tie du nord ce sont eux que nous devons faire revenir en oss tie du sud
4368873 fallait il les laisser nous pilonner nous tirer dans le dos et se moquer de notre peuple oui nous avons pratiquement nivel le terrain l bas ce sera la fronti re de loss tie du sud
4368874 les civils avaient t vacu s il ne restait que les troupes g orgiennes quant aux civils qui ont pr f r rester contrairement larm e g orgienne nous leur avons ouvert un corridor pour les laisser partir mais je vous assure quil ne restait pratiquement personne dans ces enclaves
4368875 telles sont les cons quences de nimporte quelle guerre de nimporte quelle agression nous nous employons y couper court de la mani re la plus ferme
4368876 he hit his line and lengths right from the word go
4368877 the more the guys play the more they understand what they need to do and when they need to do it
4368878 for the last year he cant put a foot wrong anyway but hes not taking anything for granted and i think the more the bowls the more confidence and belief he gets in himself hes got a really bright future if he stays away from injuries
4368879 his bowling was missed a little bit in the last test but thats the sort of impact he can make
4368880 hes following very much in the footsteps of shaun pollock and allan donald and its great for south african cricket if he stays fit for a long time i think hes going to do very well
4368881 he hits the ball really well and only needs to get half a bat on it and it will normally clear the ropes hes just a really good striker of the ball
4368882 his bowling is probably not where it can be but hes a dangerous batter down the order and theres no total that is safe even if were a few down and he comes in
4368883 that was pretty much a drubbing really and thats not a true reflection of the two sides i think were a better side than that
4368884 whoever youre playing for its always disappointed to get beaten like that when you know you should have done better because you walk off the field thinking we mucked up and it should have been a lot tighter than that
4368885 were probably more used to that sort of pitch than those guys are it was a little damp in the morning but even so we should have been a little bit smarter with bat and ball
4368886 it was two years ago why did they allow the transfer to go through to manchester city in the first place
4368887 i believe there is a witch hunt against me and it is neverending
4368888 portsmouth football club strongly deny charges by the fa alleging a breach of their regulations concerning the transfer of benjani mwaruwari to and from the club
4368889 we did not pay an agent when benjani joined the club from auxerre in january 2006 and his transfer to manchester city in january this year was approved at the time by the premier league and the fas compliance unit
4368890 this is nothing more than a technicality which we will strongly contest
4368891 the club can confirm that it has received the decision from fifas dispute resolution chamber drc on the claim made against adrian mutu
4368892 chelsea is delighted with the drcs decision to award the club 13 68million in compensation
4368893 this is an important decision for football not only did the drc make us a very significant monetary award the decision also recognised the damaging effect incidents involving drugs has on football and the responsibilities we all have in this area
4368894 were very happy with the squad weve got and with the players at our disposal we feel we can challenge anyone at the moment ive got the squad and the team how i want it in general terms you can never be 100 at the start of the season that is dependent on factors like injuries and signings settling in were on the right lines
4368895 we are in the market for a striker and made a substantial offer which has been well documented
4368896 we will have to wait and see what happens we are trying to address certain weaknesses in the team and we will continue to do that right until the window closes
4368897 we have problems up front as we are missing key personnel we are a little bit light and went with two young guys who are still learning the game it was difficult for them
4368898 i think what the bid does show is that the club is in decent shape
4368899 maybe the stories of the financial crisis flying around are not as substantiated as they should be
4368900 i was a little bit scared of city but when we saw them we knew we were their equals we were strong and quick it was only in the last 25 minutes we were under any kind of pressure
4368901 the players will be allowed to celebrate a little because very soon they will be back at work
4368902 we needed a spark to help us unlock the door but we did not have that
4368903 however when the second leg comes round we will have more games under our belt
4368904 hopefully we will make a better fist of it than we did here
4368905 the game on saturday morning comes very quickly but in fairness i am not in a position where i can make many changes at the moment
4368906 a reasonable target for fabregas is the second leg of the champions league game but diaby will take four to six weeks
4368907 they have got the control and they have got the quality and if they play for arsenal then that means they are very good
4368908 i am happy for them because when i was the same age as them i dont think i was at a big club like arsenal and it is a joy to work with them everyday
4368909 gold rush in beijing also chelsea are determined to complete the world record signing of kaka but they will have to wait until next year to do so
4368910 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
4368911 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
4368912 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
4368913 i can do all things through christ who strengthens me
4368914 there were no fresh injuries from midweek so i am please with that now i will look at what qpr have over the next 24 hours and decide on how we are going to go
4368915 darius henderson david cotterill and matthew spring all needed that game to help them sharpen up and all three improved as the game wore on i think that one or possibly two of those will start on saturday
4368916 one or two players not selected the previous week at birmingham could count themselves unlucky particularly danny webber but he was carrying a slight niggle and had missed training but he had a good workout against port vale
4368917 that last performance was good in many ways and several players did well so it is a selection dilemma but one that every manager wants our bench is looking very strong and illustrates our squad strength
4368918 that was disappointing because lee is a quality player and i know he wanted to come back
4368919 im more than happy with what ive got but yes i would like a pacey player for the left hand side maybe well have to wait until january though
4368920 you get wingers who flatter to deceive because there is no end product id rather wait for top quality from now on our signings must be of that calibre and ill be looking to bring one in every now and then
4368921 his career has been going backwards but lee is still a first class player
4368922 danny has a turn of speed that can upset defenders
4368923 they may become regarded as the team to beat not because of what theyve done on the pitch but what theyve done off it
4368924 lee made it clear that he wanted to come back here and i would have been interested but it wasnt to be however i do want to bring in a real quality attacking left sided player rather than just get by and i am prepared to wait until i can get him even until january if necessary
4368925 i do want to get a winning team that requires little or no change apart from occasions when situations venues or personnel demand
4368926 it lifts your heart to hear these children playing and having so much fun after such a sad start in life their mother is a miracle worker
4368927 our doors are always open and will continue to be open for anyone interested in dialogue i invite everyone to join us to discuss the problems of the state of jammu and kashmir so that its people can lead a life of peace and dignity if violence continues then our response too will be hard
4368928 as long as they continue their terrorist attacks our armed forces will be alert and give them a fitting response
4368929 it is our humanitarian obligation that we assist the state in all possible ways so that the people there can live in peace and harmony
4368930 in this conflict common citizens may also be affected at times i have said before and i am repeating once again that there is no issue that cannot be resolved through a process of discussion and dialogue
4368931 in this hour of crisis divisive politics will lead us nowhere i appeal to all political parties to keep the long term interests of jammu and kashmir in view and come together to find a permanent solution to the problems of the state
4368932 our slogan for the protest is that either give us shoes or take them from us we are asking for protective gear shoes if you are not going to give us then all the workers have collected sandals shoes from garbage and we are going to present it to additional municipal commissioner r a rajiv who happens to be the head of the solid waste department under whom these workers are working
4368933 we have not attacked anybody we ourselves ran for our life some of our friends are still missing 8 9 farmers are in one hospital and 2 died in apollo hospital we dont know anything about others
4368934 those who were responsible for disrupting law and order have been identified and till now 19 people have been arrested under various sections law and order situation in the area is absolutely normal
4368935 the federal government should not only give the land back to the amarnath shrine board but it should also allot land for the rehabilitation of kashmiri pandits who are forced to live a life of refugees in their own country which is very pathetic i have visited kashmir and i know there is a lot of land there which can be allotted for this purpose
4368936 daily choices are the determining factor in my annual weight gain or loss what is my choice this year
4368937 most of us spend life on the run too busy and too hurried to walk anywhere beset by problems and difficulties we feel walking is a frivolous waste of time when will i do it becomes one more problem the truth is that walking holds our solutions
4368938 on my daily walks ive recognized how to parent my children through difficult situations been prompted to call a friend i hadnt heard from in a while and felt compelled to reach out to strangers who soon became my friends i believe in a daily walk to listen because that is when i am close to god that is when i find my way
4368939 my oldest one has cheerleading two times a week while she does that i walk four times around the track with the baby in a stroller
4368940 the number on the bathroom scale is not a reflection of who i am it is a reflection of who i used to be i am a person who exercises regularly and eats right i am already at my goal weight the number on the bathroom scale measures the progress of my body catching up with who i am today

4368952 yeah whatever you know east lyme high is a perfectly good school too mom and all my friends are going there
4368953 im pretty much over the fact that every guy likes you better than me
4368954 no vick its okay you cant help that youre so attractive to guys youve got that whole marilyn monroe vibe just emanating from your every pore me im just that chick who obsesses over comic books and horror films and says really snotty things to everyone
4368955 the federal government should not only give the land back to the amarnath shrine board but it should also allot land for the rehabilitation of kashmiri pandits who are forced to live a life of refugees in their own country which is very pathetic i have visited kashmir and i know there is a lot of land there which can be allotted for this purpose

4368978 the reserve bank of india is taking all steps to control the rate of money supply so that prices are controlled

4368998 kerken in georgi en rusland hebben opgeroepen tot een wapenstilstand en vredesonderhandelingen ook hebben zij dringend om hulp gevraagd de vijandelijkheden rond zuid osseti georgi en abchazi hebben een groot aantal mensenlevens gekost duizenden mensen zijn op de vlucht en hebben hun bezittingen verloren

4369000 wat direct opvalt als je wycliffe hall binnenkomt is de leeftijd van de studenten alle studenten hebben al een andere studie en werkervaring achter de rug voor ze aan de predikantsopleiding beginnen
4369001 nu moet je vroeg de beslissing nemen om theologie te studeren en de weg naar het predikantschap in te slaan of op zijn minst open te houden veel mensen voelen zich pas als dertiger of ouder aangetrokken tot het predikantschap ik heb vrienden die intensief betrokken zijn bij het kerkenwerk en hele goede predikanten zouden zijn als die weg voor hen openstond omdat ze het gevoel hebben dat het geen optie is is er zelfs weinig ruimte om een roepingsbesef te laten groeien
4369002 breder gevormde academici die na een korte opleiding de kerk zouden kunnen dienen met hun gevarieerde levenservaring
4369003 dit biedt de mogelijkheid een bron van hooggekwalificeerde en gedreven predikanten aan te boren de ongetwijfeld beperktere theologische vorming zou gecompenseerd worden door het feit dat deze voorgangers veel gemakkelijker bruggen zullen slaan vanuit het evangelie naar de werelden waarin ze eerder zelf ervaring opdeden
4369004 ga in gesprek over de vorm zodat het daarna weer over de inhoud kan gaan
4369005 ik was benieuwd naar de themas die bij hen leven
4369006 ik dacht een orgel zullen ze wel niets vinden maar uit de gesprekken bleek dat het orgel helemaal geen afgeschreven instrument is als de organist maar fatsoenlijk speelt en er van tijd tot tijd ook andere instrumenten gebruikt worden
4369007 mobieltje in de hand hyven mailen die techniek vind je in de kerk niet
4369008 het is mooi om waar te nemen hoe jongeren hun geloof beleven
4369009 god is een waarheid in hun leven het geloof biedt houvast
4369010 ze hechten daar veel waarde aan en tellen graag mee in de kerkelijke gemeenschap
4369011 een jongere die een brief aan de kerkenraad schreef kreeg geen antwoord
4369012 ik zou best eens bij een oudere op bezoek willen gaan maar ze zien me aankomen
4369013 beide vormen soms een belemmering neem de houten bankjes die je vaak in een kerkgebouw ziet zelfs de stoelen in de trein zitten lekkerder als de aansluiting ontbreekt haken jongeren af
4369014 op inhoudsniveau dat betekent niet dat ze meer beslissingsbevoegdheid moeten krijgen wel dat we hen serieus moeten nemen
4369015 door het hanteren van ander taalgebruik en audiovisuele middelen dat kan al door het geven van een helder voorbeeld of het projecteren van de drie preekpunten via een beamer
4369016 jazeker in de kerk gaat het anders dan op het voetbalveld gelukkig wel toch moet de opzet zijn om de inhoud dicht bij de mensen te brengen de vorm mag niet belemmerend werken
4369017 you know who was a great movie president jeff bridges in the contender that was a great movie president he was charming and essentially an honorable person but there was a rogue about him the way he would order sandwiches he was good at that

4369036 the chinese governments idea of how you impress people is that everything is perfect even if that means a little bit of deception
4369037 and thats exactly the thing that drives the western media crazy because it seems sneaky

4369052 i just knew that i had to give the routine of my life
4369053 i was pretty far behind but i couldnt control that i gave a great meet today that was probably my favorite moment finishing on floor because i knew i had given it my all and i couldnt change anything
4369054 its a feeling i dont think any father can describe
4369055 just to know that he was so close to the all around gold and didnt quite achieve it
4369056 and i hope you know i cleared away any of those bad little memories for him i hope that this definitely tops it i have a few more to go but it is an amazing accomplishment just to be here with him out on the floor 20 years after he competed i think it just means so much more to both of us i dont know just all the hard work paying off all the injuries tears blood rips everything

4369058 none for you tonight and if you try that again none for you anytime in the next 10 dates

4369075 we got some practice in the group matches its like a single elimination competition too because only the top team in each group can play for the gold
4369076 so during every game there was quite a bit of pressure and that will be helpful in the semi finals and finals
4369077 compared to the chinese team we dont have as much pressure
4369078 i think theyre the strongest team for them to win the gold that would be routine
4369079 the olympics isnt any ordinary competition theres definitely more pressure
4369080 any team that can win their groups at the olympics are quite strong these teams are basically chinas primary opponents
4369081 maybe overall china is stronger but on an individual basis theyve beaten us before in singles matches or other contests

4369163 itu karena adanya perbedaan pendapat diantara elemen umat islam apakah awal masuk dan keluarnya bulan ramadhan itu ditentukan oleh ru yatul hilal melihat hilal ataukah dengan ilmu hisab
4369164 karena adanya perbedaan pendapat apakah di dunia ini hanya berlaku satu mathla tempat keluarnya hilal ataukah masing masing negeri mempunyai mathla sendiri sendiri
4369165 apa hubungannya antara ketaatan terhadap penguasa dengan pelaksanaan shaum ramadhan
4369166 barangsiapa menaatiku berarti telah menaati allah barangsiapa menentangku berarti telah menentang allah barangsiapa menaati pemimpin umat ku berarti telah menaatiku dan barangsiapa menentang pemimpin umat ku berarti telah menentangku
4369167 di dalam hadits ini terdapat keterangan tentang kewajiban menaati para penguasa dalam perkara perkara yang bukan kemaksiatan adapun hikmahnya adalah untuk menjaga persatuan dan kebersamaan umat islam karena di dalam perpecahan terdapat kerusakan
4369168 seseorang hendaknya bershaum bersama penguasa dan jamaah mayoritas umat islam baik ketika cuaca cerah ataupun mendung
4369169 sebagian ahlul ilmi menafsirkan hadits ini 1 dengan ucapan mereka sesungguhnya shaum dan berbukanya itu dilaksanakan bersama dan mayoritas umat islam
4369170 yang jelas makna hadits ini adalah bahwasanya perkara perkara semacam ini menentukan pelaksanaan shaum ramadhan berbuka puasa iedul fithri dan iedul adha pen keputusannya bukanlah di tangan individu tidak ada hak bagi mereka untuk melakukannya sendiri sendiri bahkan permasalahan semacam ini dikembalikan kepada penguasa dan mayoritas umat islam dalam hal ini setiap individu pun wajib untuk mengikuti penguasa dan mayoritas umat islam maka dari itu jika ada seseorang yang melihat hilal bulan sabit namun penguasa menolak persaksiannya sudah sepatutnya untuk tidak dianggap persaksian tersebut dan wajib baginya untuk mengikuti mayoritas umat islam dalam permasalahan itu
4369171 dan selama belum terwujud bersatunya negeri negeri islam di atas satu mathla dalam menentukan pelaksanaan shaum ramadhan pen aku berpendapat bahwa setiap warga negara hendaknya melaksanakan shaum ramadhan bersama negaranya pemerintahnya masing masing dan tidak bercerai berai dalam perkara ini yakni shaum bersama pemerintah dan sebagian lainnya shaum bersama negara lain baik mendahului pemerintahnya atau pun belakangan karena yang demikian itu dapat mempertajam perselisihan di tengah masyarakat muslim sendiri sebagaimana yang terjadi di sebagian negara arab sejak beberapa tahun yang lalu wallahul mustaan
4369172 inilah yang sesuai dengan syariat islam yang toleran yang diantara misinya adalah mempersatukan umat manusia menyatukan barisan mereka serta menjauhkan mereka dari segala pendapat pribadi yang memicu perpecahan
4369173 aku telah shalat di mina hari hari haji pen bersama nabi shallallahu alaihi wa sallam abu bakr umar dan di awal pemerintahan utsman 2 rakaat dan setelah itu utsman shalat 4 rakaat kemudian terjadilah perbedaan diantara kalian sebagian shalat 4 rakaat dan sebagian lagi 2 rakaat pen dan harapanku dari 4 rakaat shalat itu yang diterima adalah yang 2 rakaat darinya
4369174 engkau telah mengingkari utsman atas shalatnya yang 4 rakaat mengapa kemudian engkau shalat 4 rakaat pula
4369175 jika awal masuknya bulan ramadhan telah diumumkan di salah satu negeri islam semisal kerajaan saudi arabia namun di negeri kami belum diumumkan bagaimanakah hukumnya apakah kami bershaum bersama kerajaan saudi arabia ataukah bershaum dan berbuka bersama penduduk negeri kami manakala ada pengumuman demikian pula halnya dengan masuknya iedul fithri apa yang harus kami lakukan bila terjadi perbedaan antara negeri kami dengan negeri yang lainnya semoga allah subhanahu wa taala membalas engkau dengan kebaikan
4369176 setiap muslim hendaknya bershaum dan berbuka bersama pemerintah negerinya masing masing hal itu berdasarkan sabda nabi shallallahu alaihi wa sallam
4369177 waktu shaum itu di hari kalian umat islam bershaum waktu berbuka adalah pada saat kalian berbuka dan waktu berkurban iedul adha di hari kalian berkurban
4369178 umat islam di luar dunia islam sering berselisih dalam menyikapi berbagai macam permasalahan seperti penentuan masuk dan keluarnya bulan ramadhan serta saling berebut jabatan di bidang dakwah fenomena ini terjadi setiap tahun hanya saja tingkat ketajamannya berbeda beda tiap tahunnya penyebab utamanya adalah minimnya ilmu agama mengikuti hawa nafsu dan terkadang fanatisme madzhab atau partai tanpa mempedulikan rambu rambu syariat islam dan bimbingan para ulama yang kesohor akan ilmu dan wara nya maka adakah sebuah nasehat yang kiranya bermanfaat dan dapat mencegah terjadinya sekian kejelekan semoga allah subhanahu wa taala memberikan taufiq dan penjagaan nya kepada engkau
4369179 umat islam wajib bersatu dan tidak boleh berpecah belah dalam beragama sebagaimana firman allah subhanahu wa taala
4369180 dia telah mensyariatkan bagi kalian tentang agama apa yang telah diwasiatkan nya kepada nuh dan apa yang telah kami wasiatkan kepadamu ibrahim musa dan isa yaitu tegakkanlah agama dan janganlah kalian berpecah belah tentangnya
4369181 dan berpegang teguhlah kalian semua dengan tali agama allah dan janganlah kalian bercerai berai
4369182 dan janganlah kalian seperti orang orang yang berpecah belah dan berselisih setelah keterangan datang kepada mereka dan bagi mereka adzab yang pedih
4369183 dan tidak mengapa bagi penduduk negeri manapun jika tidak melihat hilal bulan tsabit di tempat tinggalnya pada malam ke 30 untuk mengambil hasil ru yatul hilal dari tempat lain di negerinya jika umat islam di negeri tersebut berbeda pendapat dalam hal penentuannya maka yang harus diikuti adalah keputusan penguasa di negeri tersebut bila ia seorang muslim karena dengan mengikuti keputusannya akan sirnalah perbedaan pendapat itu dan jika si penguasa bukan seorang muslim maka hendaknya mengikuti keputusan majelis departemen pusat yang membidangi urusan umat islam di negeri tersebut hal ini semata mata untuk menjaga kebersamaan umat islam dalam menjalankan shaum ramadhan dan shalat id di negeri mereka wabillahit taufiq washallallahu ala nabiyyina muhammad wa alihi wa shahbihi wasallam
4369184 dan berpegang teguhlah kalian semua dengan tali agama allah dan janganlah kalian bercerai berai
4369185 allah subhanahu wa taala mewajibkan kepada kita agar berpegang teguh dengan kitab nya al qur an dan sunnah nabi nya serta merujuk kepada keduanya di saat terjadi perselisihan
4369186 wahai orang orang yang beriman taatilah allah dan rasul nya dan ulil amri diantara kalian
4369187 yang dimaksud dengan ulil amri adalah orang orang yang allah subhanahu wa taala wajibkan untuk ditaati dari kalangan para penguasa dan pemimpin umat
4369188 wahai rasulullah kami tidak bertanya kepadamu tentang ketaatan terhadap penguasa yang bertakwa yang kami tanyakan adalah ketaatan terhadap penguasa yang berbuat demikian dan demikian ia sebutkan kejelekan kejelekannya
4369189 akan ada sepeninggalku nanti para imam penguasa yang mereka itu tidak berpegang dengan petunjukku dan tidak mengikuti cara jalanku dan akan ada diantara para penguasa tersebut orang orang yang berhati setan namun berbadan manusia
4369190 hendaknya engkau mendengar dan menaati penguasa tersebut walaupun punggungmu dicambuk dan hartamu dirampas olehnya maka dengarkanlah perintahnya dan taatilah dia
4369191 seburuk buruk penguasa kalian adalah yang kalian benci dan mereka pun membenci kalian kalian mencaci mereka dan mereka pun mencaci kalian
4369192 jangan selama mereka masih mendirikan shalat di tengah tengah kalian dan jika kalian melihat mereka mengerjakan perbuatan yang tidak kalian sukai maka bencilah perbuatannya dan jangan mencabut meninggalkan ketaatan darinya
4369193 urusan kaum muslimin tidaklah stabil tanpa adanya penguasa yang baik atau yang jahat sekalipun
4369194 wahai amirul mukminin kalau penguasa yang baik kami bisa menerimanya lalu bagaimana dengan yang jahat
4369195 sesungguhnya walaupun penguasa itu jahat namun allah subhanahu wa taala tetap memerankannya sebagai pengawas keamanan di jalan jalan dan pemimpin dalam jihad
4369196 adapun kewajiban menaati mereka penguasa tetaplah berlaku walaupun mereka berbuat jahat karena tidak menaati mereka dalam hal yang maruf akan mengakibatkan kerusakan yang jauh lebih besar dari apa yang ada selama ini dan di dalam kesabaran terhadap kejahatan mereka itu terdapat ampunan dari dosa dosa serta mendatangkan pahala yang berlipat
4369197 ketahuilah bahwa kejahatan penguasa tidaklah menghapuskan kewajiban menaati mereka pen yang allah subhanahu wa taala wajibkan melalui lisan nabi nya kejahatannya akan kembali kepada dirinya sendiri sedangkan kebaikan kebaikan yang engkau kerjakan bersamanya akan mendapat pahala yang sempurna insya allah yakni kerjakanlah shalat berjamaah shalat jumat dan jihad bersama mereka dan juga berpartisipasilah bersamanya dalam semua jenis ketaatan yang dipimpinnya
4369198 telah sepakat para ulama ahli fiqh ilmu dan ahli ibadah dan juga dari kalangan ubbad ahli ibadah dan zuhhad orang orang zuhud sejak generasi pertama umat ini hingga masa kita ini bahwa shalat jumat idul fitri dan idul adha hari hari mina dan arafah jihad haji serta penyembelihan qurban dilakukan bersama penguasa yang baik ataupun yang jahat
4369199 aku telah bertemu dengan 1 000 orang lebih dari ulama hijaz makkah dan madinah kufah bashrah wasith baghdad syam dan mesir
4369200 aku tidak melihat adanya perbedaan diantara mereka tentang perkara berikut ini beliau lalu menyebutkan sekian perkara diantaranya kewajiban menaati penguasa dalam hal yang maruf
4369201 di dalam hadits ini riwayat al bukhari dan muslim dari shahabat abu hurairah di atas pen terdapat keterangan tentang kewajiban menaati para penguasa dalam perkara perkara yang bukan kemaksiatan adapun hikmahnya adalah untuk menjaga persatuan dan kebersamaan umat islam karena di dalam perpecahan terdapat kerusakan
4369202 shaum itu di hari kalian umat islam bershaum waktu berbuka adalah pada saat kalian berbuka dan waktu berkurban iedul adha di hari kalian berkurban
4369203 the prisoners languishing in the prisons of tyrants be it infidels apostates or hypocrites christians or jews or infidels idolater and apostate
4369204 a couple could pretend to be joking before attacking the target

4369207 we believe our proposed cooperation is an important step towards ensuring that we can compete effectively with rival alliances and manage through the challenges of record fuel prices and growing economic concerns
4369208 in addition we believe we will be more effective competitors with greater ability to invest in our products and services
4369209 just because life is tough out there you shouldnt rid yourself of competition
4369210 one of the big positives is going to be the oil price thats going to be the major point of differentiation between bhp and rio tinto as far as the market is concerned fat prophets analyst gavin wendt said
4369211 we saw spot oil prices hit a record high of us147 per barrel and that has to have a positive rub off on their earnings
4369212 while the market is generally aware of cost pressures throughout the industry we are concerned that there is a tendency to underestimate the quantum of cost increases goldman sachs jbwere said in a client note
4369213 too much negative news on the cost side of things for bhp billiton
4369214 i dont think its really set in but i feel like this journey has been so long
4369215 standing on the podium and hearing olympic champion next to my name was a dream come true
4369216 i just knew that i had to give the routine of my life
4369217 i was pretty far behind but i couldnt control that i gave a great meet today that was probably my favorite moment finishing on floor because i knew i had given it my all and i couldnt change anything
4369218 its a feeling i dont think any father can describe
4369219 just to know that he was so close to the all around gold and didnt quite achieve it
4369220 and i hope you know i cleared away any of those bad little memories for him i hope that this definitely tops it i have a few more to go but it is an amazing accomplishment just to be here with him out on the floor 20 years after he competed i think it just means so much more to both of us i dont know just all the hard work paying off all the injuries tears blood rips everything
4369221 early eating patterns have implications for attainment that appear to persist over time regardless of subsequent changes in diet
4369222 there was no relationship between school meals or packed lunch consumption and later attainment once the junk food dietary pattern prior to school entry and other confounding factors were introduced in the analysis
4369223 this research highlights the importance of diet before entry into formal education for later school attainment and calls for a concerted effort between schools families government departments and other agencies to improve the nutritional intake of children
4369224 two cups of coffee a five egg omelet a bowl of grits three slices of french toast topped with powdered sugar and three chocolate chip pancakes
4369225 it is our teams view that one of the main values of horizontal surfaces in the cityscape is to use streets parks plazas and gardens as means of mediation between neighborhoods building heights economic levels and territorial functions
4369226 in designing the new world public space the site waha
4369227 the main features of this concept an evolution from plaza to architecture inside and outside treated as simultaneous events dense forest areas in the cityscape and an infinitely flexible paving design are readily applicable to other parts of the city
4369228 in summary the horizontal surfaces and mounded configurations of the urban forest establish a universal but also site specific concept including a tree branch river tributaries vascular system chinese calligraphy regional landscape imagery for beijings new world center this iconography is expressed vertically and horizontally physically and symbolically experientially and ecologically
4369229 the double standards advocated by the us are glaringly obvious
4369230 it was okay for georgia to obtain independence from the soviet union but its not okay for south ossetia or abkhazia to seek independence from georgia not for nothing are the georgian armed forces funded and trained by the united states it was okay for slovenia and croatia to obtain independence from yugoslavia and for kosovo to obtain independence from serbia but its not okay for euskadi to seek independence from the spanish state or puerto ricans to seek independence from the united states
4369231 russia does not control the imf and world bank it does not have over 700 military bases around the world aimed at surrounding the united states russia does not have a military larger than the militaries of the next nine nations combined and russia is not decimating iraq or afghanistan and does not fund ethnic cleansing and apartheid in palestine
4369232 therefore the alliance party condemns the cowardly silence of new zealands major political parties on this issue
4369233 one of the big positives is going to be the oil price thats going to be the major point of differentiation between bhp and rio tinto as far as the market is concerned fat prophets analyst gavin wendt said
4369234 we saw spot oil prices hit a record high of us147 per barrel and that has to have a positive rub off on their earnings

4369244 ask me on another day or if i hadnt won
4369245 la divulgazione dei nostri sport dama e scacchi uno degli aspetti di cui ogni damista scacchista dovrebbe farsene carico e secondo me un grande pregio che distingue il vero appassionato dal semplice spingitore di pezzi qualunque categoria di gioco esso sia
4369246 haitian fight song potrebbe anche intitolarsi afro american fight song lassolo che io prendo in questo pezzo pieno di concentrazione non posso suonarlo nel modo giusto se non penso al pregiudizio allodio alla persecuzione e a quanto tutto ci sia iniquo in esso c della tristezza e ci sono delle grida ma c anche della determinazione quando finisco di suonare di solito penso io glielo ho detto spero che mi abbiano ascoltato
4369247 la parte reazionaria del discorso del comico lo sfott c una grande differenza fra il teatro sfott e il teatro di satira il teatro di satira sempre morale basti pensare al timore al panico che hanno avuto sempre i potenti davanti ai problemi della satira perch la satira in molti casi ha determinato la presa di coscienza della gente soprattutto delle classi inferiori ha fatto capire di avere il potere di ribaltare le situazioni di avere il coraggio quindi temuta qual la differenza che esiste fra fare satira e fare sfott allora posso dire a un giovane attento che giocare esclusivamente sulla pura caricatura legata a un personaggio anche a un uomo politico che grasso piccolo magro magari ha la gobba magari si intartaglia non realizza niente questo fa fare soltanto una risata fine a se stessa ma se non c la dimensione morale se tu attraverso la satira non riesci a far capire il significato opposto delle banalit dellovvio dellipocrisia soprattutto e della violenza che ogni potere esprime e porta addosso ai minori ebbene il tuo ridere vuoto proprio lo sghignazzo ventrale e non quello dello stomaco e dei polmoni

4369258 what we are seeing graphically at organ pipe was predictable this is what happens when you circumvent environmental laws
4369259 as a consequence natural resources of organ pipe cactus national monument and national park service infrastructure will be impacted as well as resources and infrastructure on neighboring lands in the u s and mexico
4369260 i would just like to have them come back and re evaluate the structure
4369261 they need to come up with a process to be able to remove the debris prior to reaching the fence or the alter the design of the fence to accommodate more flow
4369262 what we are seeing graphically at organ pipe was predictable this is what happens when you circumvent environmental laws
4369263 when you build an impediment across a stream it becomes a dam and providing some holes in a fence is a joke
4369264 whatever is in the path of the redirected water flow will be damaged whether thats vegetation and natural resources or man made structures
4369265 its something that has been anticipated and unfortunately has apparently been ignored in the rush to build this wall
4369266 would permit water and debris to flow freely and not allow ponding of water on either side of the border

4369268 i want to make sure we address situations as they occur
4369269 it would like putting your finger on the end of the water hose
4369270 you are restricting the water flow that is what the fence is doing

4369288 i touched the wall and was like thank you finally

4369290 nobody knows what ive really gone through in the last eight years and what has gotten me to this point besides myself and a few people that i know well so its my own personal deal at this point
4369291 thats the theme of the meet you have to break a world record to win i gave it my all and i had nothing left

4369359 i had just overtaken the lorry which the man crashed into and was travelling along when i saw this man driving the wrong way up the a14 he was in the outside lane doing about 50mph and was hunched over the wheel
4369360 i pulled over onto the lay by just before girton and called the police to warn them this guy was driving down the a14 the wrong way sadly it was too late seconds later he went head on into the lorry i just dont know what he was doing it was crazy i feel lucky to be alive
4369361 we would like to express our sincere condolences to the family of the victim
4369362 i wrote to the council and complained but they have done nothing and i warned them that id take action
4369363 i left the car on the track for an hour and the police would have removed it but i decided i had made my point and drove it off myself
4369364 when the work has been going on my whole house has been shaking and im very very annoyed about it
4369365 i told them that if they didnt answer i would take action to disrupt the work and when nothing happened i decided to drive my citroen onto the track to make a protest
4369366 the guided bus workers were held up waiting for the police to arrive to remove the car
4369367 were all very worried about the prospect of the buses going past our houses a noise barrier is being installed but we dont feel it is high enough
4369368 we have had correspondence from mrs grant and we apologise to her and to other residents if the construction work has caused any inconvenience

4369370 i know its not necessarily the dogs fault but what would have happened if it had been my daughter out there that morning
4369371 now i make sure i keep the front gate shut and i always make sure my children make it across the road safely
4369372 i feel sad that the animals have had to go through this especially the one that was hit by a car at least it was not a child that got killed

4369402 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
4369403 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
4369404 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas

4369406 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender

4369430 from what i have gathered about the judo in the past is that referees used to allow judo to continue on the ground far longer than it has recently this comes from a talk i recently had with a turkish judoka that doesnt see much difference between the jiu jitsu of today and judo of the past the result is a lack of knowledge that i have seen from todays referees regarding ne waza but again that is because of what they have been exposed to if you have a short time on the ground you will see less and less attempts and techniques for attacking and defending in ne waza if you come from the camp that feels judos ne waza is the same as jiu jitsu you are talking from a time that has past again this is generally speaking the jiu jitsu of today technically speaking is beyond the judo of today on the ground just like the judo of anytime is greater in throwing techniques than jiu jitsu in jiu jitsu tournaments you see the opposite a short time to throw an opponent and only one shot at it it is a simple matter of rules dictating the behavior of students and instructors knowledge has been lost here and there and we see the effects of this in the top two schools for judo in the country the former otc and sjsu i have also seen this in japan again this is all related to the experiences throughout my career
4369431 i also practiced my mat techniques very hard my goal was to execute them quickly in combinationwith my standing techniques to ensure victory by studying and strengthening mhy works on the mat i managed to eliminate the anxiety i had felt about it and could thus cary out my standing techniques also when the opponent attempted a technique i would counter him and drag him down on the mat so that i could grapple with him there because i was confident in my mat techniques and because i was sure that i could fight on a a par with my opponent even if i was the one thown down to the mat i was able to attack with my favorite seoi nage purposefully and without fear

4369459 that choice will end his bid for the presidency and spell defeat for other republican candidates
4369460 hes not even sure christian conservatives would vote for him let alone work for him if he picked a pro abortion running mate
4369461 a good portion of us were urging him to pick a pro life running mate
4369462 that choice would go a long way to solidify his credentials
4369463 wrong headed short sighted fracture the republican party and not allow us to capitalize on the democratic partys fracture right now
4369464 if he does that it makes our job 100 times harder it would dampen enthusiasm at a time when evangelicals are looking for ways to gin up enthusiasm
4369465 some people in the movement say it would be the kiss of death he heard that in the room last night
4369466 youre going to have to have a huge turnout of that base again for mccain to win
4369467 ninety percent of the workforce for bush in 04 came out of that constituency
4369468 picking a ridge or a joseph lieberman would not be helpful at all
4369469 would be problematic thats not where theyd want him going
4369470 the point that mccain was making is that people can differ on one issue and still be a vital member of our party
4369471 the fact that governor ridge is not perfectly in line with the party platform does not make him any less of a republican
4369472 the pro life position is one of the important aspects or fundamentals of the republican party and i also feel that and im not trying to equivocate here that americans want us to work together you know tom ridge is one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro choice and i dont think that that would necessarily rule tom ridge out for vice president
4369473 i think its a fundamental tenet of our party to be pro life but that does not mean we exclude people from our party that are pro choice we just have a albeit strong but just its a disagreement and i think ridge is a great example of that
4369474 this move to a pro choice running mate such as lieberman could help reshape his message to appeal to swing voters
4369475 the right wing is not going anywhere and choice is a key issue for over 40 women who voted for hillary in the primaries
4369476 a lot of the troops here are on the fence or disappointed

4369496 my kids are all over me did you miss the cut again stuff like that
4369497 im like i did well in this tournament 15 years ago look at the tape but they dont care about that they want it now
4369498 its more tough on them than it is on me i want to play well for them so they can get excited about it
4369499 twenty one years ive been doing this and every now and then i go what am i doing out here but i love it
4369500 i love the competition even when im not playing good
4369501 i love practicing love the grind i dont want to do anything else i see guys my age or a little older doing what theyre doing and thats all the inspiration you need to keep going
4369502 heck if i get on a roll now maybe azinger will pick me
4369503 if i can win here and get some confidence going all it takes is one week
4369504 today i made some nice putts and hit some nice shots so i was very excited with the start im in a position right now where ive got nothing to lose
4369505 i have to conserve as much physical and emotional energy as i can
4369506 i switched from my dress sweats to my parka shoes threw my cap and goggles on and then they pushed us on out no time
4369507 but i think theres going to be a lot of time for me to rest over the next 18 hours or so and ill be able to be ready for tomorrow mornings 100
4369508 tomorrow is going to be a tough race for me to be a player in that race i have to be closer at the 50 if im not then it will be tough i was over a body length behind at the 50 in the prelims and came up a bit short so i have to be there
4369509 di siya tulad ng iba diyan kay sarah dapat seryoso ka talaga
4369510 naiintindihan ko naman siya sa simulat simula pa lang kuya na talaga ang tingin niya at kuya ang tawag niya sa akin nasa akin na talaga kung itutuloy ko ba o hindi pero ako hanggang sa i allow ako ni sarah na maging parte ng buhay niya na ligawan ko siya itutuloy ko kaya lang sa ngayon ayokong madaliin ang lahat hindi naman biru biro ang mga gagawin ko

4369512 alam ni sarah na sobrang ina admire ko siya before pa ako tinanong tungkol diyan sinabi ko sa kanya na sumagot lang ako sa isyu
4369513 may time lang na di kami nagkakausap nagkakailangan for some reasons na di ko alam kung bakit di ko rin naman siya matanong kung bakit after nung ilang weeks na ganun tapos biglang okey na pag kinakausap ko siya sumasagot na siya dati naiilang siya pero ngayon hindi na ngayon mas okey na mas open kami at mas naging close kami
4369514 hindi issue sa akin yan sobrang happy ako na naging successful yung movie nina sarah and john lloyd cruz kasi alam ko kung gaano niya pinaghirapan kung gaano niya pinagdasal yun na maging successful talaga at naging maganda naman talaga ang outcome nung movie
4369515 kanya kanyang lugar yan sa show business at natutuwa ako na nandun na siya actualy nandun nga ako sa premiere night ng a very special love nanood kami nag usap kami about the movie i congratulated her
4369516 siyempre may kaunting ganung feeling nung nalaman ko ang tungkol dun ang initial reaction ko was wow talaga pero na realize ko di ko hawak yung desisyon ni sarah di ko siya puwedeng pigilan na maka meet at makipag close sa iba dahil di ko naman siya girlfriend di naman kami kumbaga wala naman akong rights
4369517 di siya tulad ng iba diyan kay sarah dapat seryoso ka talaga

4369530 i wouldnt be particularly sure until the transfer deadline passes what might materialise so well see
4369531 but hes our player and he wanted to play in the game and we think hes mentally tuned into it so thats all that matters
4369532 we were lucky not to concede a goal clearly we did not play well the performance was poor but the result was good
4369533 its always important not to concede away from home and the second leg in anfield has to make a massive difference
4369534 i know paul has always wanted to play in a professional side with his brother
4369535 it nearly happened once for lancashire and thats the nearest hes ever he got
4369536 if i can facilitate that on the correct terms for the club then id love to
4369537 id be excited by the prospect because i can remember paul sculthorpe playing so well over a number of years but obviously the directors are perhaps a little more conservative because there is a question mark at the minute over pauls durability because of his injuries

4369558 pada kasus tindak pidana biasa yang dirugikan hanya satu individu saja namun tindak pidana khusus seperti korupsi narkoba dan illegal logging memiliki dampak merugikan dalam skala yang luas
4369559 pertimbangan lain yang juga ikut mempengaruhi perumusan uu no 28 tersebut adalah untuk menimbulkan efek jera baik bagi pelaku tindak kriminal maupun masyarakat luas

4369570 if the two other thermaltake blacx products were must have convenience products where does that leave the esata version esata performance added to an already good product just brings the blacx over the top the convenience of being able to just pop a drive in and hit a button to access the data on that drive to me is close to priceless then again i am an enthusiast that has a pretty large stack of hard drives that is only outnumbered by a stack of side panels that are hardly ever on the sides of their cases i know that i am not the only person out there with this routine breaking it down bit by bit thermaltake should have spent a little more time designing the power button on all of the blacx products at this point there isnt a competing product on the market that has the same functionality and a front power button so we will let that one slide post testing i did run into one other issue that may hamper some users the power and esata cables are a bit too short for my liking esata is around 3 feet and the power cable is right around 4 feet long i would like to see these extended to around 6 feet but i can also see why thermaltake went with shorter cables no one likes to have a rats nest under their computer desk even though we all do on the positive side of things the blacx is the first device to offer this type of functionality and is a product many of us are going to use every day to put it bluntly what other computer accessory put out in the last two years can you really say has made your life easier if you are ready for easy street and you have a stack of case panels somewhere in your computer room run out and get a thermaltake blacx with esata right away

4369606 they were happy that they didnt have to get other peoples smoke in their hair and clothing
4369607 both have exhibited a cooperative attitude and intend to work with the ade to fully implement the state mandate to the best of their ability
4369608 it is our belief at ade that a positive attitude is the most important part of the implementation process
4369609 biggest concern is consistency school by school and theres no way im going to have consistency based on the teachers we have
4369610 if a student is new to the country and new to the english language hell be in four hours of language development
4369611 but school by school were still going to need some more flexibility depending on staffing
4369612 will be based on staff and well have to tell ade how many hours we can do it
4369613 were just going to have to work with the state to get as close to the state model as we can within our resources but the ade understands the teachers we have are the teachers we have and the number of classrooms we have are the number of classrooms we have
4369614 they will look at three hours of immersion and then one hour of reading which can be in a content area but it still must focus on english instruction
4369615 districts cant mix ell kids with non ell kids even if they are newly classified kids who have just recently tested out of ell but still need the support in the classroom
4369616 and i dont think any district has 100 percent highly qualified teachers for those positions
4369617 want to see where the gaps are what are our data are telling us which will lead us to make adjustments to the services based on how our students are succeeding
4369618 the reason sunnyside submitted our alternative model is because the district and governing board had concerns about ell students being segregated for four hours a day for long periods of time
4369619 we would still hope as kids become more proficient say in reading then we would be able to reduce immersion by a reading hour or writing by a writing hour
4369620 constantly needs to look at how kids are making progress and what we need to do to move them forward
4369621 well be looking at proficiency levels and aims scores to justify fewer than four hours
4369622 and well be looking at keeping four hours but use content in them
4369623 the more proficient the more flexibility we will have to have fewer hours or to have the hours be more content driven
4369624 we know and the state knows were not going to be 100 percent in compliance the question is how close are we going to be able to get
4369625 were going to make every good faith effort to implement the four hours
4369626 not looking for us to be moving around staff this late in the game theyll let us work with existing staff and do it
4369627 we have a real commitment toward graduation for all kids and ell students should not be left behind
4369628 if school districts take full advantage of the many options available through the models that have been approved by a state task force i do not see being able to graduate on time as a problem at all
4369629 the state is not going to mandate how credit is to be awarded
4369630 we need to make sure ell students have the same positive opportunities to be an integral part of their school as any other student
4369631 we dont have a beef about them learning english but we dont want them left behind for other reasons
4369632 our hope is that the students will get the science credit in the science class but our main goal even there is to use it as an english language development class
4369633 important to learn english fast because i need it for my other classes and for me
4369634 thats because of a lot of effort on our part
4369635 some of the students will participate in sports and i also have an after school folklorico class so that gives them some contact

4369879 we come out here every summer to do clinics and stuff like that and i have always been pretty popular but i dont know when this happened
4369880 i thought if i flopped something here my ace might be the best hand and i could make a big pot
4369881 maybe he thinks i have a draw maybe he thinks i have 3 5 and im looking for a deuce or maybe he thinks i have two big overcards
4369882 im thinking he could have a full house so i was going to play the hand cautiously
4369883 or maybe he was on a stone cold bluff figuring i didnt have a 6 or maybe i have two overcards
4369884 i was pretty sure i had the best hand but i wasnt going to make it into a big pot and risk getting check raised
4369885 i was just going to let him fire into the pot
4369886 when he checked the river i checked behind him because i didnt want to get check raised i didnt have the nuts if i bet he could check raise in that spot and id have to fold because so many hands had gotten there on the river
4369887 theres really not any equity in playing big pots unless youve flopped the joint and youre the one making it big
