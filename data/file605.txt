6050134 database archiving often fails to get the attention it needs compared to other critical activities related to production databases and data warehouses
6050135 an archival system becomes critical when you need to access archived information in response to a legal summons customer service issue security investigation or technical issue the value of archiving grows considerably as it becomes easier to access the archived data
6050136 with legal demands for access growing conventional approaches to database archiving are increasingly being found lacking they focus on lifting and shifting inactive data from production databases to improve application performance without considering how to optimize the way archived data is stored get your archiving right and you reduce storage costs and guarantee simple future proofed access get it wrong and at worst you could face prison
6050137 why database archiving should be part of your dbms strategy
6050138 it managers need to achieve a balance between the compliance demands for retention and the business demand for economical storage and retrieval current database management system technology is optimised for transactional processing data warehouses are optimised for analytics but both fail to adequately address archiving needs worse still the lines between archive stores and backup which have very different drivers and requirements are all too often blurred
6050139 forresters research clearly illustrates the need for the new generation of archive stores these deliver both massive reductions in storage footprints through data compression together with the security immutability and point in time query capability that enables quick simple and unimpeachable fulfilment of regulatory obligations

6050143 with the widespread use of mobile phones and innate understanding of text combined with our customers desire to maintain active control of their finances fnbs incontact has provided our customers with the ability to take advantage of their cell phone as a powerful banking tool
6050144 interacting with customers through sms costs a fraction of what a live agent costs are so the cost savings for us have been tremendous and the communications are effective and pleasing to the customer which helps our business
6050145 organizations across all industries should take full advantage of these cost savings by implementing text based call center services in any industry financial services or otherwise

6050157 definitely maybe isnt a great title but if the album is good enough itll become itself dig out your soul is not the best one but dig out your soul was the best one on a day when we had to choose one
6050158 i was playing some drums on some demos left over from the last record
6050159 we sent them to producer dave sardy and he was like wow have you got any more songs like this we should make a record like this
6050160 and then going back to the stuff we ditched in the past we were like yeah we could do something with that or do something with this
6050161 slowly but surely it all started to change from a traditional british rock album to this whatever one we would describe it now

6050175 i have never suggested that sen mccain picks his positions on national security based on politics or personal ambition

6050181 i talk to other people who have done what i did and theyre happy with their decision theyve been able to get their business to the ebay business levels or beyond
6050182 many times you feel like theyre really pushing it to see if youll give them some kind of a refund
6050183 theyll float the suggestion that this isnt exactly what i expected
6050184 when ebay makes these dramatic changes it can make you very nervous
6050185 but again ebay is doing what ebay believes it has to do to protect its marketplace

6050330 is well known for its city and state level moot court competitions that expose law students to the best teams throughout maharashtra
6050331 in continuation with providing an exciting learning experience for law students the college has organised this moot court competition on surrogacy which is a current legal issue
6050332 there is no surrogacy law in india protecting either the biological surrogate mother or the genetic parents indian adoption law also prevents the adoption of a female child by its father if the parents are separated as in the recent case of the japanese couple who came to india
6050333 low cost of treatment and easy availability of women opting for surrogacy is attracting a lot of international couples to india hence there is an urgent need to have laws protecting not just surrogate mother but also the child and the couple

6050383 i am keen to stress that we are committed to providing a service at singleton and i have reiterated this at all our meetings and conversations with our partners
6050384 however through our discussions and the feedback weve received from our clinical staff it is clear that the current service is not safe and sustainable as it stands
6050385 we are regularly left with no choice but to close the unit at various times particularly at night because no doctor is available and that situation cannot be allowed to continue indefinitely
6050386 one option being looked at is working with the gps to provide a safe effective and regular service at singleton nevertheless nothing has been decided yet
6050387 there has been difficulty recruiting appropriately skilled doctors to substantive posts at singleton for some time
6050388 the department has been increasingly dependent on locums despite an increase in the amount of consultant input and support
6050389 the intermittent unpredictable closure of the singleton service which is happening increasingly often is not in the best interest of patient safety

6050417 i think the senator recognizes that way down the road there may be changes and that states will come together to reconsider the settings at that point but theres no reason on the senators mind to re open the compact or to insert federal interests this is an issue thats been resolved by the states and should stay resolved as it has been by the states

6050419 it wont work sen mccain showed his true colors hes a lower basin senator trying to grab up as much upper basin colorado water as possible coloradans wont take kindly to that
6050420 conservation is no longer just a civic virtue it is fast emerging as a statewide necessity

6050422 that was the day i fell in love with him
6050423 were pleased that we can be a part of keeping downtown bay city healthy and we thank the city and the county for their help
6050424 theyll be smaller units something like 800 to 1 100 square feet
6050425 that area of the city is the last real piece to be developed and then we can set our sights on uptown at riversedge
6050426 of course theres a process that has to be followed and i suspect there will be questions
6050427 das zweite quartal gibt hinweise auf einen verlangsamtes wachstum das den rest des jahres anhalten k nnte
6050428 we were quite pleased to hear that many of the 77 cases were actually resolved
6050429 we continue to ask for as much transparency on this as possible and we would of course welcome that the protest areas are genuinely used
6050430 but at this stage i dont really consider myself a jazz musician
6050431 i have plenty of space to improvise to try new ideas
6050432 in sterreich gehen 27 prozent der sprachminuten ber das festnetz in deutschland 70 prozent das ist der unterschied

6050436 marquis maze flashes great speed and is a playmaker b j scott is right there with him
6050437 were going to have to determine eight to 10 freshmen who will have some kind of role on our team he said
6050438 if these guys are back up players were probably going to play them on special teams were going to have to make that determination
6050439 they may make some mistakes early but in the long run it will help our team
6050440 maybe you ought to ask the guy that leaked them out we got on the internet to see if we could see some plays from clemsons scrimmage and we didn t see any you don t want to advertise on the internet which is just like tv what you re doing
6050441 dallas ap jessica simpson is now selling beer the singer and actress has signed on as spokeswoman for stampede light plus made by dallas stampede brewing co simpson will appear in ads in stores for the beer and is taking a 15 percent stake in the brewer the dallas morning news says terms were not disclosed
6050442 we lit up your world like the fourth of july
6050443 theres a big part of america that really believes that there is a war on terrorism and that we need to finish up
6050444 so i thought it was beautiful the other day when obama went to afghanistan and got educated about afghanistan and iraq
6050445 but at this stage i dont really consider myself a jazz musician
6050446 i have plenty of space to improvise to try new ideas
6050447 we are thrilled that the first ever global game board includes an interesting mix of cities that showcases the dynamic cultures sights and history of the planet
6050448 we are thrilled that the first ever global game board includes an interesting mix of cities that showcases the dynamic cultures sights and history of the planet
6050449 if you had three wishes dont you think youd use one of them to know the words to every song ever written
6050450 i like cereal and cereal is quiet i like cereal cuz cereal cant talk
6050451 and i decided to turn that negative feeling into something positive
6050452 the association loans equipment to patients like special computers that they can use with their eyes and wheelchairs for transportation
6050453 we will try to work with shop n bag who is a big sponsor for als and set up my own fundraiser with them where they can collect money at the register
6050454 we want to get simeon to donate a car or leno or seinfeld to raffle off at the event as well
6050455 we are working on getting entertainers and singers to perform live in concert and donate proceeds to the als foundation hopefully we can raise several thousand dollars or several hundred thousand
6050456 it starts out with tripping over your feet then you cant swallow and you lose your ability to chew
6050457 you cant breathe it affects your arm or leg first then you lose muscle strength and toning and your muscles atrophy
6050458 i found the disease by finding another problem i had
6050459 i woke up in excrutiating back pain and i didnt know what it was
6050460 i finally went to therapy to strengthen my stomach and back muscles and had three steroid injections in my spine
6050461 it started getting worse and i thought it was related to my back
6050462 i went to neurosurgeons and i got the same opinion from them
6050463 i think she knew right away but it was too early on
6050464 they told me that if i had the fast form of als id be dead already
6050465 i think i already had it two to three years before that
6050466 i had to change my whole life because of it im definitely afraid and theres no doubt its going to happen i just dont know when
6050467 theres a way of having some hope that therell be a better treatment a better cure
6050468 we follow game trails or very often the native people walking through the area will have a path from one village to the next village
6050469 elephants make paths for themselves 6 foot wide perfect for training you can bump into one and thats dangerous
6050470 one time there was a lion it really made me go faster
6050471 we really dont have the resources cycling is very difficult to develop in africa
6050472 with one soccer ball you can have 22 players to develop one cyclist you need a whole bicycle
6050473 getting bikes for riders and keeping them maintained with spare parts thats the challenge talent wise its limitless
6050474 dubbed the cassel this lightweight hiker is part of the stealth range planned for next year looking nice and tight especially in the aubergine and grape we can also vouch for its comfort and flexibility having roadtested the cassel ourselves perhaps the japan inspired outdoors hiking vibe is finally about to crossover

6050480 she will be our main sports reporter for norwich city ipswich town colchester united and southend united
6050481 she is very photogenic so she is going to be slightly different in that respect she will not be our first woman fronting the sport though
6050482 you look at her and think she is a very glamorous young lady but it is important to us she is a very ambitious person and knows her stuff
6050483 it works in the sense that that other product of baltimore ruth ian works
6050484 it has a certain lets say melodic sound to it this is unlike unitas ian or ripken ian or even poe ian which come across as both unfamiliar and nearly unpronounceable
6050485 students typically get done with finals by friday and then have to wait until sunday for commencement when many are launching their careers with new jobs on that monday
6050486 sunday also has been an inconvenient day for families who have other obligations including fathers day which frequently falls on the same day as our commencement
6050487 our goal is to make commencement as safe convenient and enjoyable as possible for our graduates and their families
6050488 the change to saturday is part of our ongoing efforts to improve commencement experiences for all participants
6050489 it feels good to make a difference in these kids lives
6050490 staff at latino family services appreciate the interest the u m students have in getting to know the children and their community
6050491 our u m students are able to see how they can make a difference through positive relationships with the children there
6050492 in order to obtain the best terms for our students the school is contributing funding to the new program
6050493 compared with the previous loan program the new rates and terms are more favorable to students
6050494 some amazingly innovative work is coming out of oregon state and this venture funding provided by the citizens of oregon will help translate new knowledge into viable business ventures
6050495 this is just the beginning as more people give to the venture fund additional awards can be made spurring more innovations like these
6050496 great things happen when oregonians have a chance to directly invest in their universities
6050497 the selected projects at oregon state university will launch new businesses and develop new entrepreneurs who will grow our economy
6050498 each of these projects has already made significant progress toward the marketplace
6050499 these awards will help speed the technologys time to market allowing faculty students entrepreneurs or existing companies to take the next steps to turn research into businesses
6050500 what our team has identified is an experimental drug therapy that can provide pain relief to patients within 20 minutes
6050501 depending on the individual in my experience one dose can last from 6 to 40 hours the ability of the therapy to provide immediate relief is something entirely new for sufferers of interstitial cystitis
6050502 women who suffer from this condition may find themselves having to urinate 10 or more times per day usually have pain or symptom flares after sexual intercourse and frequently have chronic pelvic pain
6050503 i had a son out there i hadnt forgotten him
6050504 i continue to get regular complaints about cycles being ridden on footpaths and without lights at night and the campaign will try to address these concerns
6050505 riding in this manner causes a danger and inconvenience to pedestrians and to other road users in addition to the hazard posed to the cyclists themselves
6050506 it is also unnecessary and illegal many of the main routes in felixstowe have cycle lanes and even these are not being used
6050507 during our last campaign a significant number of fixed penalty notices were issued which resulted in a noticeable decline in the number of persons flouting the law suffolk homes
6050508 our research has finally achieved the type of broad commercial and environmental impact that we always thought was possible
6050509 as more uses evolve for this adhesive there should be even more environmental benefits
6050510 its also creating jobs here in oregon and the u s and helping the north american forest products industry compete more effectively with imports
6050511 these companies had the vision and willingness to invest in this technology and now it appears to be really paying off for them
6050512 theres just a snowballing interest in more green sustainable products
6050513 there are estimates that the green building industry can double between now and 2012 become a 70 billion market i see a time when these environmentally friendly products will dominate the wood composite industry become the standard and not the exception
6050514 nearly every major player in the wood composite panel industry in north america has expressed an interest
6050515 this is the first study that shows the contribution of ships to fine particulates in the atmosphere
6050516 ships are really unregulated when it comes to air pollution standards what we wanted to find out was the contribution of ships to the air pollution in san diego and what we found was a surprise because no one expected that the contribution from ships of solid sulfur rich particles called primary sulfate would be so high
6050517 the importance of primary sulfate is usually ignored in assessments of the impact of ship emissions on air quality because less than 7 percent of all sulfur emitted by ships is found in primary sulfate particles
6050518 but our results suggest that this component of ship emissions is important and should not be ignored in the future knowing how much sulfate from ships is in the air will also allow us to better understand what happens to the other 93 percent of sulfur emitted by ships
6050519 we found that in san diego the port of los angeles can be a significant influence on air quality because these fine particulates can travel so far
6050520 this will tell us whether californias new regulation requiring cleaner burning fuel 24 miles off the coast is having the effect its intended to have
6050521 and because a large part of the worlds population live in major cities with shipping ports such as new york city san francisco hong kong houston and singapore and global shipping is expected to increase in the decades to come this should help policy makers around the world make more informed decisions about improving the health of their citizens
6050522 the population of the country is aging and people now live with chronic diseases longer so its important to understand from a health perspective how people are being treated as they age
6050523 older people with any physical vulnerability are about 13 percent more likely than those without one to report verbal mistreatment but are not more likely to report financial mistreatment
6050524 perhaps the respondents are including fairly routine arguments perhaps about money with their spouse sibling or child in their reports or perhaps older adults are more reticent to report negative behavior
6050525 elder mistreatment in the u s prevalence estimates from a nationally representative study
6050526 is there anyone who insults you or puts you down
6050527 is there anyone who has taken your money or belongings without your ok or prevented you from getting them even when you ask
6050528 is there anyone who hits kicks slaps or throws things at you
6050529 the opening of these buildings advances the great expectations we have for enhancing the residential experience of michigan students
6050530 our mission is to support the whole development of students physically socially and intellectually in these surroundings we have created comfortable welcoming environments where living and learning are constantly engaged
6050531 the much needed upgrades to the infrastructure the overall enhancements to the halls quality of life and the wonderful community spaces will continue to move us toward providing a richer and seamless learning experience at michigan
6050532 had larry been cool he could never have written i love you beth cooper a hilarious yet painfully accurate account of high school in all its pimply glory
6050533 the town and parish councils of these areas recognised the need to create these designated zones which mean that in those areas the police can deal with anyone misbehaving or acting in an anti social manner while drinking alcohol and seize any in their possession
6050534 we have already introduced similar restrictions in felixstowe leiston woodbridge framlingham kesgrave martlesham and rushmere st andrew and they have helped the police improve the quality of life for those who live there
6050535 as well as the introduction of three new orders the changes to the ones in felixstowe that were made after listening to the public the town council and the police have also come into effect
6050536 a substantial proportion of crime and disorder is linked to alcohol abuse and these orders will give the police additional powers to tackle the minority who act in an anti social manner after having too much to drink
6050537 we hope theyll participate in school and community garden projects and plug into nonprofits like the oregon food bank growing gardens and zenger farm which have educational programs that use volunteers
6050538 our goal is to match participants with these organizations with the hope that theyll educate others in the metro area especially schoolchildren about organic gardening
6050539 it is not appropriate that the president entrust an important governmental post to a man who does not have the courage to admit to his mistake and apologise
6050540 it is intolerable for the people that an iranian vice president speaks of friendship with israelis
6050541 what the hell were you and your girlfriend doing last night it sounded like a jackhammer
6050542 sometimes the way you think it is isnt the way it really is at all
6050543 an irreverent romp through our modern pagan culture its humor spotlights the foibles and fun of being pagan in the 21st century it always adds a smile to my day
6050544 it makes sense to use symmetry variation in mate choice
6050545 if you choose a perfectly symmetrical partner and reproduce with them your offspring will have a better chance of being symmetric and able to deal with perturbations
6050546 womens sex partner numbers are dependent on things other than attractiveness
6050547 because of the way that the sexual system in humans works women are choosey they are being sexually competed for they have to be wooed and all that
6050548 the idea is that beauty is conveying information about health and fertility and we admire that
6050549 we think the detection of these types of scent is way outside consciousness
6050550 with the development of a sexual color scheme you dont need the pheromone sensitivity to sense whether a female monkey is ready to mate
6050551 its advantageous to use visual cues rather than pheromones because they can be seen from a distance
6050552 the main theory is that some genes work well in combination with each other
6050553 if these genes evolved to work in combination then you dont want to break that up too much for your offspring finding a mate with similar genes will help you ensure this
6050554 romantic love is one of the most powerful of all human experiences
6050555 los accidentes de trabajo siguen ocurriendo porque no se ponen las medidas adecuadas

6050557 aqu no hay repulsa institucional ni banderas a media asta ni nada de nada tan s lo silencio
6050558 there can be no business as usual with russia under present circumstances
6050559 this convention in denver is one is which people well known and people not as well known will come together across party lines across geographic divides because they believe in change
6050560 his message all along is that the ideas have to come from the people
6050561 my voice shakes when i speak in front of 50 people at work at a meeting
6050562 when i saw that motorcade come down the cul de sac i couldnt speak i couldnt swallow within a couple minutes he put us at so much ease
6050563 im just a poor railroader ive got a small house and a family im trying to raise barack and michelle can relate to that because of their upbringing
6050564 as the candidate who would use the best judgment in a crisis
6050565 an increasing percentage see him as the candidate who can get things done
6050566 there is no doubt the campaign to discredit obama is paying off for mccain right now
6050567 that hairline difference between nuance and what appears to be flip flopping is hurting him with liberal voters
6050568 conservatives were supposed to be the bigger problem for mccain
6050569 obama still has work to do on his base at this point mccain seems to be doing a better job with his
6050570 there were no wild swings there isnt one group that is radically different than last month or even two months ago it was just a steady decline for obama across the board
6050571 over the years every time there is a major election we have had people attempt to put up a listing we catch them very quickly
6050572 when we see these listings we definitely take them down
6050573 its possible that someone would put a listing up its possible to be up for a couple of hours before we catch it its possible that for a brief period of time something might actually be visible on the site
6050574 we are very clear if you engage in illegal activity on our site we absolutely will share information with law enforcement we provide testimony in court
6050575 and what this person was proposing was probably not so feasible unrealistic
6050576 i dont think it will happen more and more as the elections are approaching
6050577 its not anything thats widespread or cause for concern in any way
6050578 people are just looking for an audience they are really using that listing as an opportunity to put their opinion on there
6050579 we have had instances that would be similar in nature where we have sports fan who are really unhappy with the performance of their favorite team and they may try to list the coach for sale as a way to express their unhappiness with the performance of their team
6050580 we were only able to get a spot in the top eight with the level were at now but at least we have closed the gap to the top
6050581 thats thanks to all the matches weve played against european teams and to our own progress in recent years
6050582 the result is regrettable put a lot of pressure on us to make bad shots we didnt perform as well as we can lithuania played extremely well
6050583 four years ago we made it to the top eight but the process was really difficult and full of pain
6050584 when we got eighth it felt like a cake had fallen from the heavens
6050585 this time the result is a bit disappointing the process was full of passion we improved our training and raised our basketball competence my olympic journey has been full of joy
6050586 weve gained a lot of experience we had persistence motivation and a lot of passion its rare in my 10 years on the team that we played so many successive high level matches
6050587 four years ago i thought 2008 would not be far away but i had three major operations over that time i hope that wont happen again
6050588 the only guy on the other side whos qualified is john mccain
6050589 john mccain is a personal friend a great friend and i would be honored to run with or against john mccain because i think the country would be better off be well off no matter who
6050590 ive been calling for more troops for over two years along with john mccain and others subsequent to my saying that
6050591 my impression is obama thinks that if we leave somehow the iraqis are going to have an epiphany
6050592 the threat saddam hussein presented was that if saddam was left unfettered which i said during that period for the next five years with sanctions lifted and billions of dollars into his coffers then i believed he had the ability to acquire a tactical nuclear weapon not by building it by purchasing it
6050593 the more people learn about them obama and hillary and how they handle the pressure the more their support will evaporate
6050594 several details remain to be sorted out to make the loan official
6050595 electronic arts ist nicht l nger der b se publisher

6050598 i think the thought is that decriminalizing it will make it somehow less of a forbidden fruit but i think the pattern shows the easier it is to access alcohol the easier it is for the students to abuse it

6050619 the centre should call both sides for talks there are ways in which the issue can be resolved but it is unfortunately being utilised to meet political ends which is dangerous and highly condemnable
6050620 it is not a question of transfer of land transfer of land is not at all an issue as is being projected by the rss bjp it is merely a question of taking the land for a particular time period to provide facilities to the pilgrims
6050621 this has been the practice not only 60 years after independence but hundreds of years before that
6050622 this is a significant step forward in the long term management of low back pain the results of this study clearly revealed that the alexander technique can beat back pain
6050623 it probably does this by limiting muscle spasm strengthening postural muscles improving coordination and flexibility and decompressing the spine
6050624 usman during his interrogation has said that qayamuddin one of the suspects in the blast case who is still at large had given him a bag which he had hidden in a warehouse belonging to his uncle
6050625 we searched the warehouse yesterday night and found the bag which contained one pistol two live bullets one air pistol a seven inch long pipe bomb and 19 compact discs and dvds
6050626 the air pistols were used during the simi training camp in halol in january 2008 they used to practice shooting using the air pistol the bomb has been dismantled and its material has been sent to the forensic science laboratory along with other material recovered for analysis
6050627 the cds and dvds contain jehadi speeches of bin laden and other such leaders

6050634 among the reasons americans distrust the mormon church is mormon clannishness because every worthy mormon male is expected to be a lay priest in voluntary service to the church the demands on his time often leave little opportunity to cultivate close friendships with non mormon neighbors a good mormon is a busy mormon those like mr romney who serve as bishops pastors of congregations often find it difficult to schedule evenings at home with their own families
6050635 to many americans mormonism is a church with the soul of a corporation successful mormon males can expect to be called at some time in their lives to assume full time duties in the churchs missions in its vast administrative offices in salt lake city or in one of many church owned businesses mormons like to hire other mormons and those who lose their jobs can count on the church networks to find them openings elsewhere mr romney put those same networks to effective use in raising part of his 23 million in campaign contributions
6050636 you know that mormon church really does seem to have the soul of a corporation doesnt it
6050637 moreover mormons are perceived to be unusually secretive temple ceremonies even weddings are closed to non mormons and church members are told not to disclose what goes on inside them this attitude has fed anti mormon charges of secret and unholy rites
6050638 t he candidate should take the time to set the record straight
6050639 for example mormons speak of god but they refer to a being who was once a man of flesh and bone like us

6050858 london retailers continue to outperform their uk counterparts buoyed in july by tourists discounts and the central london economy holding up better than the country

6050863 fue lo m s impresionante que he visto en mi vida
6050864 cuando t ves a alguien de esa altura correr as de r pido hacer lo que nadie ha sido capaz de hacer antes entonces piensas que va a hacer historia
6050865 tiene una combinaci n incre ble de amplitud de zancada y frecuencia al correr
6050866 no creo que lo bata aqu me impresionar a mucho si lo hiciese porque para correr en 19 3 tiene que mejorar mucho en la curva y mantener su m xima velocidad hasta el final
6050867 tampoco esperaba que lo batiera en la prueba de los 100 metros
6050868 lo de bolt fue lo m s impresionante que he visto en mi vida
6050869 no tengo la sensaci n de que ayer perdiera la medalla
6050870 he tenido las mismas sensaciones que en la final del mundial
6050871 he tenido las mismas sensaciones que en la final del mundial

6050878 tal vez haya tiempos mejores pero ste es el nuestro
6050879 el factor importante era la anticipaci n y lo utilizaron muy bien
6050880 liu xiang es un cono y no estuvo a la altura
6050881 que un hombre cargara con el peso de todo un pa s no fue algo muy inteligente desde el punto de vista de una marca
6050882 es como jugar todas las fichas a un n mero
6050883 no todo es ganar se trata de competir y competir lo mejor que uno puede
6050884 l entren toda su vida para este momento ese es el mensaje uno no se puede rendir uno tiene que seguir adelante
6050885 pero en china no hay tantos atletas de este calibre tienes a yao y tienes a liu xiang
6050886 puesto que china tienen tantos otros h roes habr un abanico m s amplio
6050887 la lesi n de hoy es un accidente sigo apoyando a liu xiang y quiero decirle sigues siendo el mejor y espero que se recupere pronto
6050888 esperamos que una vez que se recupere siga entrenando con dedicaci n y luche a n m s por la gloria nacional
6050889 a donde quiera que fuera ve a su foto eso ejerc a una gran presi n sobre l
6050890 un gran atleta cuya fortaleza psicol gica es muy grande
6050891 si lo hubiera forzado m s y el tend n se hubiera roto eso podr a haber puesto en riesgo toda su carrera
6050892 tal vez haya tiempos mejores pero ste es el nuestro
6050893 the attitudes of individuals and organisations must be altered so that waste is not just viewed as costly but as socially unacceptable
6050894 they will be hoping for the halo effect after these olympics because big events tend to drive the most interest in sport
6050895 the government will now need to really drive sports focus in the uk leading up to the next olympics
6050896 we dont see an uplift in sales yet but certainly will in 2012 and hopefully in the run up to it well see confidence build
6050897 we are in early discussions with the 2012 committee about linking up with them and how we can get people here more interested in sports there is an ongoing review to see how we can get involved
6050898 china and the malls there are experiencing a huge surge of energy and excitement as a result of the games 2012 will be a huge moment for the brand in the uk we will connect with athletes and consumers using the games as an energy moment in london and the uk just as we are doing in beijing and china
6050899 a lot will depend on if our athletes do well this year everyone here seems to want to be a footballer and we need the same level of excitement in other kinds of sports
6050900 there has for example been a great deal of hype around the 14 year old diver thomas daley and hopefully there will be more hype if our teams do well
6050901 the british olympic association wants to send a much larger team to 2012 than in previous years
6050902 the brand we are creating will follow the same brand values as the store ensuring exemplary quality for the price and a product appeal that meets many of our customer profiles
6050903 there are lots of areas of the range that are completely new that we are developing for example golf ski accessories babywear and plus size collections
6050904 remains weak and visibility of underlying trends in the major markets remains limited
6050905 we are refocusing on europe now and will be launching more gap and banana republic shops in new markets here there are no plans for new uk stores but we are looking at a transactional web site
6050906 the key factors stimulating this growth are increased affluence growing tourism rapidly expanding airline networks and new routes the increase in business travel as a result of globalisation is providing a further boost to airport retailers
6050907 no one left that shop without a bar of kendal mint cake or a map
6050908 i didnt want to be a doctor ive got no patience i expect someone to pop a pill and be well immediately
6050909 but what science teaches you is what you want to achieve how youre going to do it the critical path key points along the way and what youre expecting to find
6050910 at pizza hut which had a franchised business model you played around with product at your peril
6050911 when youve got staff working for you in restaurants who can sometimes determine their own way of working with product thats when you realise you can get that lack of brand integrity which is so integral to a business
6050912 parents arent going to sit down with their eight year old daughter and say im sorry mary but what with the credit crunch were reducing your pocket money by 14 per cent blame gordon brown
6050913 you might not be able to afford the big luxuries in life but you can still afford some hair slides or a new belt to wear at the weekend
6050914 its paradise for our shoppers and we need to continue to keep it that way
6050915 in our best stores they influence the customer so much customers look at the way they dress and all of our staff wear the product they are a living breathing advertisement for what claires is about putting together a lot of items and having fun
6050916 when you go off into the mountains for a weekend with next to nothing live off the land and find your way it teaches you to think differently
6050917 once we gave a group enough kit providing they shared its amazing all it required them to do was get in the same sleeping bag but they didnt some of them woke up freezing
6050918 no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the
6050919 we have safely placed senator mccain in a cone of silence
6050920 confirmed that mccain did not hear or see any of the broadcast
6050921 we are working on a number of strategies to try to change the trend
6050922 one of the things that is going on is weve made a much stronger effort to get congregations to make sure that their rolls are accurate
6050923 one of our strategic priorities is to become a multi cultural church
6050924 right to the free exercise of religion does not exempt defendant physicians here from conforming their conduct to the acts antidiscrimination requirements even if compliance poses an incidental conflict with defendants religious beliefs
6050925 going about the process the right way not of forcibly taking territory but the old fashioned way of purchasing land and having families move in
6050926 understanding of and knowledge about muslim prisoners was particularly weak and there was insufficient management scrutiny of race issues in general
6050927 these include prisoners who are dangerous but also prisoners who are vulnerable
6050928 inspectors found that there was no evidence of a robust violence reduction strategy which is essential to ensure safety order and control there was little management analysis of data on bullying intimidation or self harm
6050929 high security prisons require constant and vigorous management in order safely to contain and work effectively with their challenging populations
6050930 franklands population had become even more challenging recently with increases in gang affiliations and the arrival of a small number of convicted terrorists
6050931 it is unfortunate that this coincided with the absence of the governor for some months and the resulting drift that was observable at this inspection needs urgently to be reversed
6050932 i am pleased that the chief inspector has acknowledged the excellent multidisciplinary relationships within the dspd unit which deals with some of the most challenging prisoners in the system
6050933 i am concerned about the comments raised on the safety within frankland however this should be seen in the context of franklands extremely challenging population
6050934 a new diversity and safer prisons manager is now in post to ensure a focus on the matters raised by the inspector in relation to anti bullying and diversity
6050935 anne owers is warning of drift in key areas particularly safety
6050936 en un mes y medio se volver n a realizar diferentes pruebas para comprobar la evoluci n del equipo
6050937 me he quedado con la misma mierda un cuarto un quinto es lo mismo nadie se acuerda de los quintos y de los cuartos s lo se acuerdan de las medallas

6050941 este sevilla tiene la mejor plantilla de las ltimas temporadas
6050942 el sevilla ha crecido much simo hay una plantilla impresionante y es el mejor equipo de los cuatro a os
6050943 tiene que ir paso a paso con el objetivo principal de la liga de campeones que es muy importante y si se consigue ser muy valioso pero tambi n con opciones de luchar por algo m s
6050944 que ser m s realistas y saber que ganar una liga es muy complicado porque hay equipos muy importantes

6050948 we are the global authority on world records and our obligation is to provide the public with the most accurate information possible
6050949 according to our new guidelines leonid stadnyk does not meet the criteria for the evidence required to support his claim which is why we felt that it was only fair to rename bao xi shun whom we have measured in person
6050950 we still hope to hear from stadnyk and anyone else in the world for that matter so we can travel to meet him and officially measure his height
6050951 water levels of all rivers are rising and hundred villages have been completely submerged
6050952 youre romo like in your efficiency and big play capability
6050953 i find it to be a refreshing piece of work from dan a northern virginia based boys fan we are united in our hate for the washington redskins be sure to check it out
6050954 eagles fans who want to spy on the enemy should check it out
6050955 dude great site its good to see some knowledgeable fans
6050956 even throughout the dry period that has been this year leading up to the draft youre constantly finding gems to keep us entertained the landryhat has been my homepage for the last 3 months and its earned the spot for a long time to come keep it up and thanks
6050957 i come to this site everyday and at least 15 times a day i really do love your work and completely appreciate all the time you put in this web site
6050958 if communicating is talking thats what we have been doing at practice as we go forward i dont know i dont foresee anything changing if it does its in his court
6050959 dan understands the game and can play he is an exciting player who puts a smile on peoples faces we will see how he does for the rest of the week in training and take it from there
6050960 dan arrived last weekend and has trained with us for the last three days
6050961 he knows how to play football but it is understanding coming to a different culture and a different country to play
6050962 i have to see if his size is suitable for our game as you have to be physical in scotland
6050963 i know the reasons im not going to go and make them public
6050964 i will need to speak to one or two but as a team in general we need to roll the sleeves up get back to basics regroup and say right were not a good side
6050965 but were going to work hard to be a good side
6050966 i think defence is the strongest position in the squad
6050967 if someone is doing well it just raises the competition
6050968 its a huge blow to lose jody hes broken his metatarsal and could be out for three months
6050969 its knocked me back one but darren ward is still here thats something that will have to be addressed
6050970 hes playing today at wigan in a reserve game but with jody out that lessens his chance of going but it suits darren fine i would think he enjoys being here he might get the chance to prove me wrong now
6050971 if a person is compelled by the state or the will of another to a course of action or inaction which he would not have otherwise chosen he is not acting of his own volition and he cannot be said to be truly free
6050972 we saw a lot of road kill and thought of you
6050973 one day i stepped on the gas and got in shape physically and got my life back together
6050974 its funny because i was reading lily allens comments about emi delaying her album and it made me laugh because were in a very similar situation
6050975 were waiting for emi to give us a release date as well but its looking like january for the single and february for the album
6050976 i grew up with both my parents and with my sister and with my cousins and kelly rowland and all the girls and there was always a lot of love in my house
6050977 i guess god looks out for us and thats why we all have been able to establish the level of success that we have
6050978 and not only that both of my parents came from very humble beginnings and instilled that in us and it keeps us humble and i guess its a blessing
6050979 i think that the vice president is a person reflecting a half glass full mentality
6050980 he gives us the flexibility to do a lot of different things
6050981 we have a lot of backs so were not going to have one guy take 500 reps in a game were going to spread the wealth but well definitely find ways to get him the ball
6050982 he has a gift god blesses everybody with some kind of ability but everything he does is effortless
6050983 her supporters acting on their own because theyre proud of what they have done for her
6050984 obama could not seal the deal with voters during the primaries
6050985 the more voters got to know him the more voters chose hillary clinton
6050986 where obama once got a free pass on such despicable relationships with anti american people such as rev jeremiah wright george soros louis farrakhan the american voters are beginning to realize what a questionable and shady past this man has led
6050987 we had hoped that this kind of politics especially from within the party would have been abandoned
6050988 i told my brother all about you hes gonna love you only he better
6050989 un chaval muy majo con un gran desparpajo y con unas ganas enormes de trabajar
6050990 desde entonces no se volvi a saber nada desconocemos qu pudo ocurrir no hay ninguna pista
6050991 let me be clear i will let no one question my love of this country
6050992 you all served together and fought together and bled together under the same proud flag you did not serve a red america or a blue america you served the united states of america
6050993 let me tell you first what i wont do i wont hand over my energy policy to my vice president and not know necessarily what hes doing
6050994 my vice president will be a member of the executive branch he wont be one of these fourth branches of government where he thinks hes above the law
6050995 we did show him pictures and terry knew it was ordered before he passed away
6050996 im really glad to see how much respect they had for him
6050997 we hope sept 11th is a day when americans come together and reaffirm our resolve to address the common challenges we face together
6050998 we ask you to help us rekindle that sense of unity by suspending your campaign activity on 9 11 and engaging in your own personal expression of charitable service in honor of those who perished and those who rose in service to help rebuild our nation
6050999 because of the size of the company now we can get better deals on products and pass those savings on to the customers
6051000 the reintegration of iraq into the arab world is the principle objective that we should all work for
6051001 what obama is creating is this army of individuals these grass roots activists who are out there trying to change the world in 160 characters or less
6051002 valuable because not everyone sits in front of a computer or a television
6051003 at getting votes on election day and communicating the messages that we feel are important to our supporters
6051004 text messaging is really powerful if i have a text message i can forward that text message to over 100 people in my cell phone list
6051005 its going to be read by every single person have you ever not read a text message
6051006 behind all of these claims and positions by sen obama lies the ambition to be president
6051007 the republicans have taken that first type of patriotism that muscular military rockets red glare type of patriotism and driven that as a wedge against people they see democrats liberals as weak on national security issues
6051008 i think the patriotism question in this case is being wrapped into this larger issue that hes not one of us
6051009 even in retrospect he would choose the path of retreat and failure for america over the path of success and victory
6051010 it showed that hed put a campaign victory ahead of a military victory
6051011 if we think that we can use the same partisan politics where we just challenge our opponents patriotism to win an election then the american people will lose
6051012 regardless of the parties there is a certain political intercourse that is thrown in with other broader benefits of future access and gratitude when you become a financier of the conventions
6051013 while we recognize that the steps we have taken are not perfect or even a perfect symbol they do reflect the fact that barack obama shares the urgent desire of the american people to change the way washington operates
6051014 the idea is to give our leadership a chance to be with these folks to talk about our issues and make sure that our issues are out there
6051015 you can have a cover band but you cant have a name act
6051016 you can have a string quartet but were not sure you can have a dj
6051017 to my knowledge the chief of police is doing an investigation and that its an internal matter
6051018 there very well could be one but not to my knowledge
6051019 that to me is just a sham when you talk about public input
6051020 when you give a minister that kind of power it flies right in the face of democracy
6051021 i think theres always a possibility when you give that much power to someone
6051022 we do think that flash is the technology being abused
6051023 because it does have a facility to put content into peoples clipboards
6051024 the attackers have somehow managed to insert malicious adverts into the system
6051025 if youre in an instant message conversation with someone and they say heres that link i was talking about youre more likely to believe its legitimate its very cunning
6051026 when i say taking over my clipboard i mean it appears on my clipboard and cant be removed
6051027 whenever i paste thats what gets pasted if i copy something else and then paste whatever i copied isnt actually copied and that string is what gets pasted
6051028 if someone replies to an e mail they paste from the clipboard and get the url maybe they catch it maybe not likewise with blog posts guestbooks comments facebook etc theyre hoping that when you paste you paste their crap and it gets through
6051029 i asked them why they are taking him they said they are preparing charges of terrorism sectarian killings and displacing people
6051030 my son is a humble man he does not deal with political things he only owns a shop selling spare car parts
6051031 i lit a fire that wouldnt go out until it consumed all the walls and the roof of this house
6051032 it isnt fair my friend but it just makes it easier for me to whup him
6051033 im looking toward the future now a future that looks very bright once we send twig legs back to the back bench
6051034 hes a bright young man but he got ahead of himself
6051035 he needs to be taught a lesson and were the ones to do it have you seen the new bloomberg poll obamas dropped and were even again the bullets getting all the credit but you and i know hillary that its these top secret counseling sessions were having and thanks again for blackberrying me the rick warren questions while i was in the so called cone of silence
6051036 oh john you know i love you and im happy to help
6051037 the themes you took from me are working great painting obama as an elitist and out of touch celebrity when were rich celebrities too turning his big rallies and pretty words into character flaws charging him with playing the race card that one always cracks me up and accusing the media especially nbc of playing favorites its easy to get the stupid press to navel gaze theyre so insecure
6051038 they are going to say he is young and hes got a funny name and hes not patriotic enough weve seen this campaign before they have been running this movie for a long time it works for republicans because it feeds into the real cynicism that people have about government
6051039 people are finally realizing what he stands for and how much he cares for the middle class
6051040 david and i were elated with the cast we helped put together for the story of the florida presidential voting uproar
6051041 about that time i felt i had to head in another direction and became interested in casting casting directors are hired to facilitate the best actors available for a certain film
6051042 we then work with the movie director regarding money offers for the actors in hopes of coming up with the perfect cast
6051043 it was so wonderful to see a lot of old friends again
6051044 richard was always been that way just never comfortable talking about himself
6051045 tras la pista del at n rojo del mediterr neo
6051046 es triste que sepamos tan poco de una especie que estamos sometiendo a una presi n insostenible debido a la pesca ilegal y una flota totalmente sobredimensionada
6051047 la informaci n obtenida con este proyecto nos permitir proponer medidas m s efectivas para la recuperaci n de esta especie medidas que deber an ser adoptadas por las partes contratantes de iccat
6051048 el hecho de que instituciones cient ficas organizaciones de pescadores recreativos y profesionales y ambientalistas estemos colaborando para un mejor conocimiento de la especie refleja la profunda preocupaci n y compromiso de la sociedad por salvar al emblem tico at n rojo s mbolo de la crisis pesquera global
6051049 sometimes when im having a session and engaged with an entity another one will appear for no reason thats what happened this time
6051050 it was heath ledger clear as day looking just like he did in
6051051 he looked me right in the eye and said life is too fucking short
6051052 heath said he would have given up the fame and fortune just to spend more time with matilda looking back at his life he realized that being driven towards having a great acting career also carried its share of high costs but he didnt seem sad at all
6051053 i know most people dont believe in life after death or spirit contact but for me and mine its been a way of life for generations
6051054 its not something i can defend with empirical proof but i try to live my life in an honest way i always confirm the identity of the entity with a series of questions designed to trip them up if they are faking i am very sure it was the spirit of heath ledger
6051055 heath said he couldnt have been more pleased at how the the dark knight turned out
6051056 trustworthiness is the very first thing that we decide about a person and once weve decided we do all kinds of elaborate gymnastics to believe in people
6051057 the default is trust until theres a reason not to
6051058 the very people responsible for oversight were caught up in the same high expectations for future prices
6051059 die zahl der pl tze in den lehrwerkst tten rasch auszubauen so dass die jugendlichen im september und oktober ein realistisches angebot f r eine berufsausbildung bekommen
6051060 jetzt gilt es das umzusetzen und da ist das zust ndige ministerium gefordert und das arbeitsmarktservice aber zusammenhelfen m ssen alle und wir sind bereit dazu
6051061 das allein ist einfach zu billig und falsch das ist sozialismus von vorgestern wenn man sagt man bildet st rker in berbetrieblichen lehrwerkst tten aus
6051062 wir werden genau beobachten ob die ausbildungsgarantie dann wirklichkeit ist
6051063 honesty and integrity are two things you learn from golf like when you have to call your own fouls
6051064 so we use golf as a foundation for things the kids can learn about life
6051065 these grants continue our associations initiative to support multiple golf programs as well as adding to the enjoyment of the game that otherwise may not have been possible for so many
6051066 now were looking to see how we can grow it
6051067 being a mentor constantly teaches you humility which golf does too
6051068 being a part of this program is a constant grounding it reminds you that no matter how different people appear we are really all the same

6051078 pero el asunto del examen de oposici n fue un enga o una vacilada lo que se hizo a los profesores porque son muy pocas plazas
6051079 a la aplicaci n de examen le ponemos un angulito palomita pero a la vacilada de plazas le damos una tachita por querer burlarse del magisterio y de la sociedad
6051080 era 1 de vacantes por eso muchos que cubren interinatos desde hace a os se irritaron y no dejaron que presentaran la prueba

6051095 to change the result of the bout and to sanction the officials in the bout comply with the olympic charter and filas own internal rules
6051096 im really happy but also a little sad about our result
6051097 we were determined to fight but were limited by our capabilities
6051098 i was thinking that we can do something more but not everything has to do with practice and games
6051099 i think we need more experience need more players in other clubs other countries
6051100 this program is one of the most important ways i know to improve the educational opportunities for children
6051101 when i was growing up in the hills of east tennessee i knew my dreams would come true i know there are children in your community with their own dreams they dream of becoming a doctor or an inventor or a minister who knows maybe there is a little girl whose dream is to be a writer and singer the seeds of these dreams are often found in books and the seeds you plant in your community can grow across the world
6051102 a lheure actuelle le mdc na pas consenti la convocation du parlement
6051103 when the flag was being raised i was thinking about the hardship i have gone through for this gold medal
6051104 these past four years have been a hard time for me because of the injuries that have affected my training its a very demanding sport that requires you to be in perfect physical condition
6051105 all the support that everyone gave me throughout the years has paid off i can proudly go back to my home town and tell my people that i have not let them down
6051106 i am the only one in the chinese sailing team that is from inner china

6051111 la decisione di spostare la scuola del centro di malnate in una zona periferica stata presa dalla nuova amministrazione poco dopo che si insediata senza avvertire prima la cittadinanza con questo referendum chiediamo un confronto
6051112 ora ci aspettiamo che lamministrazione riveda le sue scelte e cerchi il confronto noi non cerchiamo il muro contro muro e speriamo che lamministrazione faccia lo stesso
6051113 certo sembra incomprensibile come una scuola che gradita messa a norma solo qualche anno fa con un grosso sforzo economico e in una zona di malnate che si sta sempre pi urbanizzando venga trasferita in periferia poco lontano da un altra scuola elementare

6051122 beside and near objects so these words actually take on a concrete meaning for them
6051123 ready steady move lessons promote the vital mind body connection in childrens brains stimulating both right and left side brain functions for increased learning abilities along with better physical health
6051124 comprehension is immediate and long lasting because this type of learning creates more neural networks in the childs brain
6051125 another reason is that its simply more fun just watch children in a ready steady move lesson
6051126 in hungary like elsewhere children spend too much time watching television or sitting in front of a computer also because of the reduction in phys ed lessons in schools parents are enthused about enrolling their children in a fun all inclusive movement class that also helps them practice english
6051127 we plan to run ready steady move in budapest and the larger cities the first year with a projected target of 1000 2000 children hopefully doubling or even tripling that number in the coming year
6051128 our teachers are qualified movement specialists incorporating activities based on yoga martial arts and dance techniques they also have a proficiency in the target language and most importantly a sincere wish to better childrens lives
6051129 ready steady move is a quality program and candidate teachers undergo an intensive 2 3 day training seminar to receive certification they also receive plenty of non stop ongoing support and updates to make sure they keep on doing their very best

6051141 understanding of and knowledge about muslim prisoners was particularly weak and there was insufficient management scrutiny of race issues in general
6051142 these include prisoners who are dangerous but also prisoners who are vulnerable
6051143 inspectors found that there was no evidence of a robust violence reduction strategy which is essential to ensure safety order and control there was little management analysis of data on bullying intimidation or self harm
6051144 high security prisons require constant and vigorous management in order safely to contain and work effectively with their challenging populations
6051145 franklands population had become even more challenging recently with increases in gang affiliations and the arrival of a small number of convicted terrorists
6051146 it is unfortunate that this coincided with the absence of the governor for some months and the resulting drift that was observable at this inspection needs urgently to be reversed
6051147 i am pleased that the chief inspector has acknowledged the excellent multidisciplinary relationships within the dspd unit which deals with some of the most challenging prisoners in the system
6051148 i am concerned about the comments raised on the safety within frankland however this should be seen in the context of franklands extremely challenging population
6051149 a new diversity and safer prisons manager is now in post to ensure a focus on the matters raised by the inspector in relation to anti bullying and diversity
6051150 anne owers is warning of drift in key areas particularly safety
6051151 any decision to convene parliament will be a clear repudiation of the memorandum of understanding and an indication beyond reasonable doubt of unwillingness to continue to be part of the talks in short convening parliament decapitates the dialogue

6051155 entah apa yang diperbuat bupati langkat selama ini untuk memperbaiki kondisi tersebut padahal kalau melihat jumlah wisatawan yang datang ke tangkahan ini jelas potensi yang besar

6051165 when you compare the faces and head shapes of children with specific types of autism to other children it is obvious there are variations
6051166 currently autism diagnosis is purely behaviour based and doctors use tape measurements to check for facial and brain dissimilarities
6051167 we are developing a quantitative method that will accurately measure these differences and allow for earlier more precise detection of specific types of the disorder
6051168 once we have created a formula we can pre screen children by performing a quick non invasive scan of each childs face and brain to check for abnormalities early detection is crucial in treating children and preparing families
6051169 instead of looking at brain structures slice by slice in an mri magnetic resonance image we developed tools to create 3 d representations of the structures in order to visualize and make comparisons

6051212 recently an extreme form of linguistic determinism has been revived which claims that counting words are needed for children to develop concepts of numbers above three that is to possess the concept of five you need a word for five
6051213 however our study of aboriginal children suggests that we have an innate system for recognizing and representing numerosities the number of objects in a set and that the lack of a number vocabulary should not prevent us from doing numerical tasks that do not require number words
6051214 an approach where governments businesses and nonprofits work together to stretch the reach of market forces so that more people can make a profit or gain recognition doing work that eases the worlds inequities

6051241 im interested in telling narratives and advocating peoples existent feelings the idea of sailing to gaza is kind of crazy but its also very straight forward the whole idea of having just one palestinian whos been forced off their land and who is able to return to palestine this is something that could demolish the whole zionist venture and it just has to be one person if one person can do it then others can do it this project this boat is about giving people the freedom to take responsibility you shouldnt expect something from others if you cant do it yourself and this is true both on a very personal but also on a political level

6051250 so many things are unknown with the way food is produced that it feels really good to keep control of it

6051252 the straw that broke the camels back was the economy
6051253 but the underlying reason is healthier food were tired of food that has tons of sodium preservatives and all the nasty stuff they put in food that you dont have to be eating
6051254 what i hear is the words the economy and weve started growing a garden because we dont know whats going to happen to the economy in the future
6051255 if i had 1 000 acres i dont think i would have been able to accommodate all the phone calls i had

6051298 problema alegerii cailor de constructie socialista este o problema a fiecarui partid a fiecarui stat a fiecarui popor nimeni nu se poate erija in sfatuitor in indrumator al felului in care trebuie construit socialismul

6051308 to be meaningful justice should be swift and sure life without parole which begins immediately is both of these the death penalty is neither
6051309 capital punishment drags victims loved ones through an agonizing and lengthy process holding out the promise of one punishment in the beginning and often resulting in a life sentence in the end anyway
6051310 though we share different perspectives on the death penalty every one of us agrees that marylands capital punishment system doesnt work for victims families and that our state is better off without it
6051311 i will let no one question my love of this country

6051376 die vom kabinett beschlossene versch rfung des au enwirtschaftsgesetzes ist berfl ssig diskriminierend und ein fatales signal f r potentielle investoren und gesch ftspartner das dem wirtschaftsstandort schadet deutschlands offene grenzen und seine liberale wirtschaftsordnung sind die basis f r unsere erfolge auf den weltweiten m rkten die wir nicht gef hrden d rfen
6051377 alle fragen der industrie und wettbewerbspolitik sind schon heute gegenstand nationaler und europ ischer gesetze zur fusionskontrolle vertraglicher verpflichtungen zur grundversorgung mit ffentlichen g tern sowie der exportkontrolle anstatt ausl ndische investitionen zu begrenzen w re es sinnvoll eine sehr viel gr ere transparenz einzufordern der derzeitige gesetzesentwurf erschwert jedoch die rahmenbedingungen f r ausl ndische investitionen in deutschland da er rechtsunsicherheit schafft
6051378 wir erwarten dass sich die positive entwicklung des operativen gesch fts auch im zweiten halbjahr fortsetzen wird
6051379 deutschland ist und bleibt offen f r ausl ndische investitionen
6051380 der gro teil ausl ndischer investitionen wird nicht vom gesetzentwurf erfasst

6051385 es ist erstaunlich dass it leistungen eingekauft werden aber nur in ausnahmef llen genau ermittelt wird welche leistungen auch tats chlich bezogen werden
6051386 letztlich wissen die unternehmen dadurch gar nicht welche leistungen sie f r ihr geld bekommen
6051387 denn wenn sich bei den mitarbeitern die anwendungen nur schleppend aufbauen oder zeitweilig gar nicht zur verf gung stehen hilft es ihnen nichts wenn die systeme des dienstleisters mit einer hohen performance gl nzen
6051388 dann entstehen negative effekte f r das business die im extremfall sogar denwirtschaftlichen vorteil der auslagerung in zweifel ziehen k nnen
6051389 zumindest bei den gesch ftskritischen anwendungen sollte gewissheit herrschen ob der output an leistung des providers ausreicht
6051390 wir haben als deutsche automobilindustrie den anspruch die co2 toprunner also die jeweils effizientesten fahrzeuge ihrer klasse unseren kunden anzubieten dabei sind wir unseren mitbewerbern einen deutlichen schritt voraus
6051391 entscheidend f r den klimaschutz ist dass die masse der verkauften fahrzeuge weniger co2 ausst t
6051392 nicht mit nischenfahrzeugen wie sie teilweise von vcd an die spitze der liste gesetzt wurden senken wir den co2 aussto im verkehrsbereich signifikant sondern mit fahrzeugen die den bed rfnissen der menschen entsprechen und gleichzeitig umweltfreundlich und kraftstoffeffizient sind
6051393 in den ersten f nf monaten des laufenden jahres haben wir mit einer reduzierung der co2 emissionen um 3 4 prozent berdurchschnittliche erfolge erzielt
6051394 besonders freut uns dass deutsche automobilunternehmen beim umweltmanagement der hersteller 3 von 5 vorderen pl tzen belegen
6051395 das beweist dass unser einsatz f r mehr umwelt und klimaschutz richtig ist

6051408 we have all been there we call for service only to be 134 in the queue when we simply need a balance update or tracking number consumers are increasingly mobile and interact with a myriad of companies through call centers often using their mobile phones they demand quick response times and easy to use systems
6051409 sms provides an easy to use mobile solution that doesnt require long wait times or interactive voice response systems to better serve mobile customers and save money organizations with call centers should take advantage of text messaging
6051410 our customers prefer sms it saves them the trouble of having to dial in to the call center or visit a branch to get the account information they need with sms our customer gets convenience and fnb saves money in addition to delivering a better customer experience sms has also greatly reduced call center costs associated with communicating routine account information

6051412 interacting with customers through sms costs a fraction of what a live agent costs are so the cost savings for us have been tremendous and the communications are effective and pleasing to the customer which helps our business
6051413 organizations across all industries should take full advantage of these cost savings by implementing text based call center services in any industry financial services or otherwise

6051427 this holiday season may well be the perfect storm for airfare that sends travelers running for cover
6051428 the combination of high fuel prices airline capacity and route cuts means holiday travelers may easily spend upwards of 100 more per ticket than last year there are deals out there for both thanksgiving and christmas but theyre few and far between and wont last long
6051429 many airlines are adding additional fees such as baggage on top of these fares which can push the cost of travel higher
6051430 in 2007 travelers found the best holiday fares in the second week of october
6051431 this year is a whole new game so i recommend anyone who needs to fly on peak travel days to buy as soon as they find a reasonable fare those who do have flexibility in their travel dates should monitor fares closely over the next few months and look for fare drops
6051432 the intense media attention to high airfares has everyone thinking that travel this year is vastly more expensive than ever before and thats just not the case
6051433 for example lets look at an eight day trip for two to miami in september airfare has increased 109 since last year but hotels are 173 less expensive meaning the total trip cost is actually down 64
6051434 we are very pleased to provide our shareholders with our financial statements for the second quarter of 2008 now that were a certified commodities trading advisor well be able to attract more clients and i anticipate an increase in revenue as our company continues to grow

6051439 the construction of this new facility will help the iowa national guard complete essential mobilization and readiness training and prepare for their missions iowa guard members play an integral role in strengthening our nations defenses and they deserve the very best as they prepare for their duties
6051440 i must compliment the iowa national guard for your resourcefulness in maintaining the operational standing next to picture of proposed readiness center rep dave loebsack while talking to guard members in february capacity of this readiness center but at 71 years old it does show its age and enough is enough
6051441 its time for something new the citizen soldiers who serve the iowa national guard deserve only the finest training facilities and this is clearly not up to par we have a responsibility to serve you with the same dedication that you have served us and i believe this readiness center reflects our commitment to doing so

6051454 on august 19 2008 we had prepared for filing our quarterly report 10 qsb for the nine month period ended june 30 2008 however in our final review with our auditors of the report we decided not to file but to continue to enhance among others the reporting related to the statements of cash flows these statements of cash flows build on the filing from the previous report and we want to make sure that they properly tie together on an unaudited proforma basis the report shows as expected good revenues with strong positive net operating income we believe we are still on target for the financial performance of the company for the year we regret the delay with the filing but our outside accountants will continue to work diligently with management to complete the enhancements and file at earliest

6051511 we are pleased to report positive blended same store sales of 3 0 percent for period seven and 3 6 percent for the second quarter on a two year cumulative basis period seven blended same store sales increased 5 6 percent and second quarter blended same store sales increased 6 0 percent as of the end of period seven our blended average unit volume for our company operated stores was 1 207 000 a 45 000 increase from the end of fiscal 2008
6051512 during the period both brands featured the distinctively premium quality and premium priced prime rib burger tm our latest meat as a condiment creation and the highest priced burger we have sold to date we make the six dollar burger tm and thickburger r varieties by topping a charbroiled 100 percent black angus beef patty with thinly sliced prime rib horseradish sauce swiss cheese and grilled onions all on a toasted ciabatta roll
6051513 the advertising for the product is part of our fake restaurant campaign in which people willingly paid 14 or more for a variety of carls jr six dollar burgers and hardees thickburgers the commercials and additional video content can be viewed on the microsite http www fakerestaurant com
6051514 carls jr achieved a 4 2 percent same store sales increase over flat
6051515 carls jr also debuted the latest flavor of our hand scooped ice cream shakes and malts tm banana cream pie the shake features real vanilla ice cream banana syrup and nilla r wafers as of the end of period seven the trailing 13 period average unit volume at carls jr was 1 527 000 a 34 000 per unit increase since the end of fiscal 2008 and an all time high for the brand in addition our period seven average unit volume for carls jr was higher than any comparable period seven ever
6051516 for the second quarter carls jr recorded a 3 8 percent same store sales increase on a two year cumulative basis second quarter same store sales at carls jr have increased 5 8 percent
6051517 hardees achieved a 1 4 percent same store sales increase versus positive same store sales of 5 0 percent last year for a two year cumulative increase of 6 4 percent in addition to the prime rib thickburger r hardees promoted the red burrito taco salad tm during the period
6051518 hardees also featured strawberry biscuits during the breakfast daypart we top our made from scratch tm buttermilk biscuits with sliced strawberries and strawberry syrup then drizzle them with icing
6051519 for the second quarter hardees recorded a 3 3 percent same store sales increase on a two year cumulative basis hardees same store sales have increased 6 2 percent
6051520 similar to last quarter we are providing some general insight with respect to certain of our operating expenses for the second quarter investors should be aware we have yet to complete our full review of the cost components underlying our quarterly results and that there may be material items other than those discussed below which could adversely or positively impact operating expenses or our business in general
6051521 on a consolidated basis restaurant operating costs in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 were 30 basis points higher than in the first quarter of fiscal 2008 as set forth below in the second quarter of fiscal 2009 we anticipate that our consolidated restaurant operating costs will decrease between 20 and 50 basis points as compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2008
6051522 similar to first quarter we continued to experience higher food costs at both our brands due to increased prices for cheese potatoes and oils as well as higher wheat costs at hardees in addition beef prices also rose significantly at both brands during the quarter we have been able to partially offset the impact of these higher costs through price increases and other actions we have taken to control food costs still we anticipate food and packaging costs as a percentage of company operated restaurants revenue to be 40 to 50 basis points higher than our results for the second quarter of fiscal 2008 in the prior year second quarter food and packaging costs on a consolidated basis were 29 9 percent of company operated restaurants revenue
6051523 we expect payroll and employee benefits costs as a percent of company operated restaurants revenue for the second quarter to be 120 to 130 basis points below our reported results for the second quarter of fiscal 2008 we expect workers compensation expense a component of payroll and employee benefits costs for second quarter to be 50 basis points favorable to the prior year quarter in the prior year second quarter payroll and employee benefit costs on a consolidated basis were 29 6 percent of company operated restaurants revenue
6051524 we anticipate consolidated occupancy and other costs as a percent of company operated restaurants revenue for the second quarter will be approximately 40 to 50 basis points higher than the results reported in the second quarter of fiscal 2008 in the prior year second quarter occupancy and other costs on a consolidated basis were 22 0 percent of company operated restaurants revenue
6051525 we will report same store sales results for period eight ending sept 8 2008 on or about sept 17 2008

6051531 there has been a turnaround in the fortunes of offset mortgages
6051532 fixed rate mortgage rates have gone up making offsets more competitive
6051533 the figures suggest that in the short term the recent strength in the housing market will support consumer spending
6051534 despite higher interest rates households are still keen to unlock money tied up in their house into a more spendable form
6051535 im not quite sure how im going to pay the money back
6051536 ive got to find 27 000 at the moment they can swing for it because theyre not going to get it off me
6051537 there are hundreds of thousands of pounds to be made but the guys who buy in london and sell in the west country arent the bad guys
6051538 the errors are being made by mortgage lenders and their advisors in taking it to london in the first place
6051539 youd have thought the mortgage lenders would have wanted to make the best price rather than give an easy profit to someone
6051540 the strong economic growth and rising employment enjoyed by the uk at present is supporting housing demand even in the face of recent increases in interest rates
6051541 while activity is past its peak and should slow gradually in coming months price rises will continue as the market moves towards a soft landing

6051544 certainly the impression we are getting as we go through the responses is that most lenders have gone for the original mortgage exit administration fee option
6051545 around 10 million mortgages have been redeemed in the last four years
6051546 but the number of people who claim compensation will no doubt be largely influenced by the amount of media coverage this topic receives
6051547 however i would estimate that the total compensation payable will be at least 50m and probably in the region of 100m
6051548 former customers will have to be pro active about this
6051549 for now supply issues are keeping an upward pressure on prices as property sales have continued to rise while the number of properties placed on the market has been falling

6051562 un flagrante enga o a los jaliscienses con su supuesta pol tica de austeridad
6051563 el primer error que se est cometiendo es creer que el congreso puede dejar sin estudiar la propuesta que hizo el gobernador tenemos ese asunto en comisiones se est estudiando y tiene que agotarse su an lisis no termina el proceso legislativo de la solicitud de plazas porque el gobernador ya no cambi de opini n eso no sucede
6051564 todas las plazas que hab a solicitado el gobernador no tienen justificaci n como no la tuvieron en la etapa de aprobaci n del presupuesto en diciembre de 2007 y no la tienen actualmente tampoco
6051565 esto abre un nuevo debate porque a final de cuentas si las plazas no est n justificadas como tales tampoco est n justificadas para pagarse v a honorarios
6051566 ten amos presupuesto pero no personal lo que hizo el gobierno es tomar recursos de la partida de honorarios y contrat personal para que hiciera esa tarea pero ese personal no puede permanecer porque esa partida est agotada
6051567 en las negociaciones que hubo con salinas se dijo que estas plazas no se utilizar an a principios del a o y que se aprobar an hacia el segundo trimestre pero que saldr an aprobadas
6051568 eso de que es un enga o que el gobernador haya tomado personal de honorarios y por eso no haya querido las plazas es falso se tom provisionalmente de la partida de horarios que es legal y lo puede hacer el gobernador para impulsar estos programas
6051569 until then lenders had been scared to lend on residential property because of the sitting tenant problem
6051570 demand for private rented housing is likely to remain strong
6051571 first time buyers are older then theyve been for some time people have a much more flexible attitude to moving for work
6051572 there is a soaring divorce rate there is a greater instance of people living alone and its becoming socially acceptable again to rent
6051573 when there have been suggestions that the market might be levelling off as in 2004 the rate of growth of new buy to let borrowing slowed down
6051574 no government has done more to help key workers since 1997 almost 25 000 key workers have got their first step on the property ladder through government shared equity and shared ownership schemes
6051575 health workers are effectively being given a pay cut and the idea that they can get on the property ladder is a non starter for many
6051576 there is a real shortage of accommodation both to rent and to buy as hospital trusts have sold off a lot of on site nurses accommodation
6051577 many of my site users have a bit of a beef with public sector workers they see them going to the front of the line in new developments and given a financial leg up which is not available to them
6051578 they recognise that they do a necessary job but feel left out they would like something to be done for them too
6051579 these shared ownership schemes are complex and you still have to find a large mortgage the average nurse starts on 19 000 and has course debts of 5 500 nurses are not able to move to expensive parts of the country
6051580 oxford city council has just set its fees for licensing at 800 and the licence will last for five years nationwide fees may vary from 400 to 1 000
6051581 if the landlord had come and done a lot of repairs and said right i have to put your rent up there would be no problem because i was getting paid by the executive the executive were paying him directly
6051582 we found significant failings in the advice giving processes in a number of mortgage firms
6051583 poor processes increase the risk of unsuitable advice being given
6051584 it is essential that firms have robust processes in place so that they treat their customers fairly and provide suitable advice

6051586 jeg tror guttene jeg har plukket ut er en gjeng med kamplystne karer kjennetegnet p samtlige er at alle har en enorm innsats og et sykt konkurranseinstinkt j rn bratland blir garantert en trussel i angrep som det forventes noen kasser fra stian lau s er en solid defansiv spiller som bidrar med rutine og ro mens stian lillev je antakelig blir en kriger med tekniske ferdigheter p midtbanen alle tre er klart med p heve sofagutta

6051597 we expect airplanes to be less full and skies to be less crowded this labor day holiday

6051658 it is in how one understands the word discipline it is most associated with punishment and means painful stern and harsh laced with punishment that is not what the word means in our school

6051660 i cant give anything away but this series has a lot of surprises in store for viewers
6051661 eve is great so easy to work with shes lovely and good fun on set but a true professional too
6051662 what makes our job so much easier is that the people of cardiff are so supportive
6051663 the businesses around this area could make things difficult for filming but they are being so cooperative
6051664 is that our red post box or is it a real one
6051665 i usually give you all one or two tone words when we have a meeting like this but if i were to give you two words this time they would be euros lyn
6051666 more than ever before this series of torchwood will be director led and it will look absolutely amazing
6051667 i cant give anything away but this series has a lot of surprises in store for viewers
6051668 eve is great so easy to work with shes lovely and good fun on set but a true professional too
6051669 what makes our job so much easier is that the people of cardiff are so supportive
6051670 the businesses around this area could make things difficult for filming but they are being so cooperative
6051671 is that our red post box or is it a real one
6051672 i usually give you all one or two tone words when we have a meeting like this but if i were to give you two words this time they would be euros lyn
6051673 more than ever before this series of torchwood will be director led and it will look absolutely amazing
6051674 what the mortality rate does is give you an entree to talk to your doctor and say look is this hospital stay going to kill me
6051675 the problem with the cms data is that most hospitals look average which isnt what employers want what they want is to compare hospitals
6051676 when your numbers arent what you like them to be its not because you didnt have the same patients as the hospital across the street
6051677 its because you didnt do as well as you could with the hand you were dealt
6051678 this is turning the lights on for providers of care as well
6051679 doctors and hospitals cant decide to do better unless they know how theyre doing
6051680 if we fall back a bit or if were not making progress
6051681 they want to know what were going to do about it
6051682 theres no one thing that determines whether you save a life
6051683 we learned that if we lock down our elevators when we know a patients coming we can save three or four minutes
6051684 this was a signal that we have to be responsible for patients after theyve left our halls
6051685 even if compliance poses an incidental conflict with the defendants religious beliefs
6051686 no 2 in the executive branch no 2 on the court
6051687 great pitching great defense some great adjustments at the plate the international tiebreaker the 20 second pitch clock you saw a little bit of what the sport has to offer
6051688 i knew she was going to come with it i just wanted to get my bat on it
6051689 like i was telling coach you dont even feel it hit the bat you just feel the motions before it but you dont feel it you just see it
6051690 i felt like i was doing the home run trot around the bases when she gets a hold of one you know its out it was a great kind of exclamation point on the day
6051691 i am proud to say that i am a g double e k
6051692 i just learned how to speak like american kids because they made fun of my scottish accent and i didnt want to be bullied when im back in the u k with scottish people i actually go back to my scottish accent
6051693 im of the star wars generation i love science fiction star trek the next generation battlestar galactica love em
6051694 i love every morning getting up to go to work because that little boy inside of me jumps with excitement every time i know im going to fight an alien or shoot a rocket gun or be on a spaceship or be with the doctor or get onto the tardis
6051695 so every time im working on it im really really happy
6051696 i always describe it as in season 1 we were learning how to walk and in season 2 were running
6051697 he is a lot more comfortable with his immortality you learn about how the team around him became a part of torchwood and you also learn about his feelings and relationships with each of them which i think is really important
6051698 but it should be one of his best episodes out of his career too he got to kiss me
6051699 the reason torchwood has gone down so well in america which tv executives should look at is the fact that their audience isnt uptight
6051700 its the executives who are treating the audience like theyre uptight because theyre pandering to programming for one specific audience and forgetting about everyone else out there
6051701 the stories have changed there are stories that people can actually relate to
6051702 a lot of people who argue that the stories are too risque theyre too in your face theyre too heavy for young people theyre afraid of dealing with those situations and theyre afraid of seeing real life on television what were doing is actually what people deal with in their everyday life we just do it in the realm of science fiction
6051703 i like the writers to create the story and create the fantasy for me so that i can then go and try to make it work but if im on set and were doing it and a director will ask me to do something that is completely out of context from what jack would do or what any of them would do we can actually say something
6051704 the producers trust enough and we know the characters well enough that we just know they wouldnt do or say something
6051705 as an expression of somebody who calls himself a minister of health its a very unhealthy statement
6051706 i mean where does he come off where does he appoint himself as a moral judge of professionals who he doesnt understand and knows nothing about
6051707 is it unethical for health care professionals to support the administration of drugs that are of unknown substance or purity or potency drugs that cannot otherwise be legally prescribed
6051708 so contrary to what mr clement might think were actually encouraging abstinence
6051709 my question to him is how does it affect you on a personal level that you should be so lacking in compassion for people
6051710 people have realized that when addiction touches their own lives in particular they realize that they really need a tool kit to help an addict and it should include injection sites
6051711 i almost feel a certain amount of pity for the guy clement because i think he doesnt seem to grasp just how sophisticated the level of discussion has been thats gone on around ethics
6051712 to just suddenly enter into the level hes entered this and think that he can sway the canadian medical association people with a few comments i think is very naive of him
6051713 too many canadians have seen the ugly face of drug crime
6051714 theyve had junkies break into their homes to fund a quick fix theyve seen young thugs dealing in schoolyards and getting more kids hooked
6051715 doctors dont always agree on a prognosis there is a fair amount of objectivity and there is a certain amount of subjectivity
6051716 as a result of this recommendation it appears that dr rainville would not sign paperwork to support a total and permanent disability claim
6051717 it appears at this point that dc district chief famolare begins to doctor shop
6051718 following that appointment dr mahoney then signs off on dc famolares paperwork declaring him totally disabled
6051719 if a person who has had a stroke can walk across a room i should be able to run 20 miles
6051720 when you run you delve a little deeper into yourself and empathize when they hit their wall and think i just cant do it
6051721 he is aging very gracefully healthy and smart much better than i did at his age he is national class
6051722 its training and leading up to a race for me
6051723 ive always had good pulmonary lung capacity its been my strength its carried me through a lot
6051724 it was kind of half hearted i was not prepared
6051725 i dont know exactly what it was that brought me back
6051726 thats a tough one a buddy of mine got me to run with him in the 2006 tucson 10 miler i did 1 07 and things snowballed from there
6051727 people who cant walk or dress themselves lots of stroke victims amputees hip fractures
6051728 its going to be a different feel because were doing five days
6051729 its not going to change its not a family show were still going to be on after 9pm torchwoods a family show if you think its appropriate for your children to watch it we just deal with issues of life but no its not going to be toned down were still going to be edgy because thats what we are
6051730 gt dropped out to be in the doubtless crappy law and order uk but thats just me now what do you think
6051731 with all due respect to cardiff city theres only so many options in a place of that size for stories compared to a huge city like london
6051732 but how many people are willing to make a commitment to watch something over five consecutive nights these days whats the dramatic point that cant be served by weekly episodes or are they relying on everyone recording it or iplayering it
6051733 i feel like a sore thumb in a piranha pool in this industry i dont like the way its all run by rich men in their 50s who went to private school its not something i want to be part of im going to retire and become a pedal taxi driver
6051734 id love to have a family ive always wanted to be married with kids i cant wait we both want lots of children we believe that when the time is right to have a child god will bless us with one
6051735 i dont really have a problem going topless but my bum is a different matter i like to have a body double for that other than that i dont have any problem with my body
6051736 mum and i would always talk about sex shed come up to my room have me roll her cigarettes and then tell me id have to have one with her its not the typical mother daughter thing but were extremely close
6051737 mums a bit mental in a good way shes this chilled out hippy mother my house was always the one where my brother and his mates would be drinking when they shouldnt be

6051741 the democrats in charge of this congress have been heavy on fluff and light on substance
6051742 i do apologize for all the pain ive caused the victims family
6051743 we have handed the case to the police and also submitted our findings to our disciplinary board
6051744 casting now no exp is ok pt ft tv acting modeling part time
6051745 taking this action now will allow us to focus our attention on locations with the best long term potential
6051746 this is the next frontier in assuring workplaces are safe
6051747 its not just for me but for the people you drive
6051748 we feel our health benefits and sick leave benefits are competitive and we feel good about it
6051749 very often these are the jobs where people are living very close to the bone
6051750 workers are sometimes putting their jobs on the line because they have a sick child or are sick
6051751 if we live in a society where all adults are working then we need to have a workplace to accommodate that reality
6051752 theres been some concern that employees are abusing the ordinance theres been a little bit of that but not as widespread as people thought at the beginning
6051753 what i want to get away from is the idea that this poor guy is going to be holding down the fort for all cnn outlets and at the end is going to fall down in a heap of exhaustion
6051754 i dont think hogan will stay in chicago but i suspect hes going to stay with cnn
6051755 with the 20 bureaus we have when you break them up and you look at the structure and you look at the management time thats needed we decided chicago fits best with the west coast
6051756 our decision to devote more time to the democratic convention is based on research which proves that our audience is overwhelmingly democratic
6051757 couple that with the historical significance of the convention and taking into consideration that sen is from chicago we wanted to add our unique local spin to this historic moment
6051758 were not hiding anything simply keeping a lid on 90210 until 9 02 riding the curiosity and anticipation into premiere night
6051759 senator my name is cal perry im a reporter from cnn and just wanted to say hello
6051760 that question is the reason im not doing interviews while in georgia
6051761 international flights have historically been sacrosanct from these kinds of charges
6051762 this is the new era of a fee for every service we should get used to it
6051763 these changes are difficult but necessary and we do not make them lightly
6051764 however they enable us to reduce costs and generate additional revenue while preserving a differentiated product for our premium cabin customers
6051765 regardless of ones position on nra issues this is a great event that provides a fun time for the entire family celebrating a wonderful cause good eats great camaraderie valuable prizes and auction items this is a family event for moms dads sons and daughters grandparents and families
6051766 on average fuel now makes up 20 per cent of the total cost depreciation counts for between 30 and 50 per cent
6051767 the racs report shows that while the rising cost of fuel is very high on motorists minds the hidden cost of depreciation is still the biggest cost in owning and operating a vehicle
6051768 however it is very likely that fuel will continue to grow as a dominant cost of car ownership this makes a vehicles fuel consumption an even more important factor when choosing your next car
6051769 small car drivers fare better than those with people movers and 4wds while a hyundai getz costs about 120 a week to run toyota landcruiser drivers are paying more than triple those costs about 405 a week
6051770 the rac recommends that people purchase vehicles with a four or five star safety rating some of the cheaper vehicles like the hyundai i30 which costs its owner 152 a week on average to run also have a four or five star safety rating
6051771 i hope readers in america flock to handle time in the same way that indian readers flocked to one night the call center
6051772 handle time provides a literary identity and voice to all the overworked underpaid and unrecognized superstars who report to call centers in america each and every day
6051773 last year a staggering 21 percent of malware attacks were unleashed with no known anti virus protection
6051774 that means fully one fifth of the time users were 100 percent vulnerable there is no foolproof tool that can keep people safe knowledge is the only protection
6051775 for more than 250 years timelines have been a useful tool for the temporal visualization of events
6051776 my timeline originally published in 1994 is unique in its use of quantitative and qualitative data across a variety of domains as well as historical and futures perspectives
6051777 the next two to three decades will see deep fundamental changes occurring across multiple technological social political economic and environmental domains this timeline was developed as a tool to provide insights that will help us understand these changes
6051778 timelines can be a powerfully effective tool for analyzing events both in the past and the future providing insights into long term changes and provoking thought and discussion about the future
6051779 we feel that our timeline offers greater insight than many others with its uniquely rich overlays of events trends drivers and archetypal patterns of change spanning america and the world
6051780 peter von stacklebergs development of the strategy of timelining the visual representation of the events of history by kind in parallel and correlated tiers represents a major qualitative breakthrough in providing a more systematic understanding of the past explanation of the present and grounded forecasting of the future

6051783 i heartily recommend kubit2me as an interactive tool to promote social language skills
6051784 younger students enjoy the lil scholars edition and can hardly wait to get their hands on the bright soft surface older students enjoy the now youre talkin edition these colorful cubes are flexible tools to use with students aged 3 to 18 for teachers and clinicians working with typically developing children or a special needs population this is a must have
6051785 i really love to engage youth in intelligent conversations about values ideals and goals many of the questions in the kubit2me games get these ideas out in the open
6051786 as a working mother of preteen and teenage boys its a challenge to find the time to have meaningful conversations with my kids and more of a challenge to get them to open up
6051787 when we played kubit2me now youre talkin we all really listened to each other not only did we have a blast playing this game but we also learned some interesting things about each other
6051788 our bankruptcy services help our clients get through the process with their dignity and respect by providing sensible solutions to their financial situations
6051789 actions speak louder than words when it comes to tackling obesity one of the toughest problems facing us today
6051790 jam is a successful working model because it inspires people to take action towards their health in small steps jam motivates you to get moving a minute at a time plus makes fitness fun
6051791 my kids love to jam each day and they lead each other its great because i get to exercise too
6051792 i cant remember when i last saw a teacher throw on their sneakers to join their class in pe but they are using the weekly one minute exercises with their classes and with their peers
6051793 the latest research on the cumulative effects of obesity is staggering the centers of excellence are telling us that our current generation of kids could be this countrys first to have a shorter life span than their parents
6051794 it could easily have been the other way around though
6051795 if the tigers did as well as everybody thought they would then people would look at us and constantly remind us that were the only ones in the city that havent started winning big i dont know if it puts any more pressure on us than what was already there
6051796 i was thankful to get the call to stay in the lions organization being a local guy and being familiar with the offense
6051797 my assistant head coach on the offensive side was excited about the things i was bringing to the table and my receivers coach liked me a lot but theres more to the game than just individual players
6051798 i think i have a lot of similar attributes as a lot of these guys
6051799 theres your core guys but if you pull the top three out all our receivers are pretty even i think we have talented group and im just as talented as everyone else there
6051800 im looking for an opportunity to make some plays and help this team win some ball games ill take any position they have available
6051801 can provide 2 4 or 6 reservd together or lawn great locations
6051802 ach verwacht van mij geen kritiek meer op bonden federaties of overheden ik probeer er in deze omstandigheden gewoon het beste van te maken vier jaar geleden viel me de selectie onverwachts in de schoot en toegegeven voor de spelen in athene was ik niet klaar voor peking wel het enige wat ik nu moet doen is die chrono uit mijn hoofd bannen die telt niet op de spelen het gaat er tactisch aan toe en in de laatste 1 000 meter zal de wedstrijd ontploffen
6051803 op papier ben ik zeventiende onder de deelnemers maar ik mik toch op een plaats in de top 12

6051807 the rich are not income constrained which is why they are rich
6051808 the portrait business is terrific i dont know why but its terrific
6051809 its ridiculous to talk about the economy with what we sell
6051810 we just dont fit the mold of what happens in the real world
6051811 its really the superfluous stuff that is being cut back on i dont see them not buying the new painting for the house or anything that would help them live better on a day to day basis
6051812 instead of coming every week for manicures and blow drys theyre extending it to every other week some may be skipping a blow dry for a black tie or a wedding
6051813 with clients its like money the market its just been so volatile
6051814 coding in c is like sending a 3 year old to do groceries you gotta
6051815 il governo si alambicca su questioni bizantine e litiga su tutto i destini del paese sono confusi con i destini giudiziari di un solo uomo dicono di togliere tasse e imposte e poi giocano a rimetterle e intanto perdiamo pezzi lalitalia il caro vita i salari inadeguati limmigrazione senza risposte serie fra giovani precari cinquantenni neo disoccupati anziani in difficolt lunica cosa che sanno balbettare sono slogan sullesercito mandato a vigilare nelle strade

6051819 he must hold firm to the sure word as taught so that he may be able to give instruction in sound doctrine and also to confute those who contradict it
6051820 i wont hand over my energy policy to my vice president without knowing necessarily what hes doing
6051821 it is an agreement which will help us to respond to the threats of the 21st century
6051822 we have achieved our main goals which means that our country and the united states will be more secure
6051823 its important that glitter comes back here and that hes carefully risk assessed here in the u k where we can do that
6051824 its important that we stop him traveling overseas again where he is a known risk of abusing children
6051825 a couple of very serious good titles under his belt

6051830 welcome to chilo a planet with corrosive rain crushing pressure and deadly heat fortunately fourteen year old timas lives in one of the domed cities that float 100 000 feet above the surface circling near the edge of a monstrous perpetual storm above the acidic clouds the temperature and pressure are normal but to make a living timas like many other young men is lowered to the surface in an armored suit to scavenge what he can timass life is turned upside down when a strange man crash lands on the city the newcomer is fleeing an alien intelligence intent on invading the planet and discovering the secret hidden deep inside the perpetual storm a secret that could lead to interplanetary war
6051831 dont worry well be home soon be a good boy
6051832 in my 19 years in this business i have never seen anything like this
6051833 i have seen many buyers come in with a lot of cash money but never this much money in coins
6051834 he had dimes quarters half dollars silver and susan b anthony dollars it took me an hour and a half to count all of it
6051835 paper money will burn but it is hard to damage coins i bought four or five rolls of coins each month i dont know how long it took me to save this amount probably all my life spending some of it now in then
6051836 he gave me lunch money in coins and each time he ever gave me money it was in coins
6051837 i am amazed that we were able to talk him into buying a new truck because he is pretty tight with his money
6051838 he still wanted to fix up the old truck and keep driving it but i convinced him to give it up
6051839 he is in pretty good health now except he rambles a little when he talks

6051846 it is my hope that reading these stories inspires some to plant their own seeds of change that when we see something wrong well do something about it whether that means writing to your representative in congress or researching a cure for a disease or simply speaking out against inequality and prejudice were all in this together and the first step toward change can begin with any one of us
6051847 we all had some bad news today our good friend leroi moore passed on and gave his ghost up today and we will miss him forever
6051848 we are deeply saddened that leroi moore saxophonist and founding member of dave matthews band died unexpectedly tuesday afternoon august 19 2008 at hollywood presbyterian medical center in los angeles from sudden complications stemming from his june atv accident on his farm near charlottesville virginia leroi had recently returned to his los angeles home to begin an intensive physical rehabilitation program

6051882 especially if government could continue showing that it could respond appropriately and within the limits of law and order
6051883 the heroes of this great artistic labor tend to be semimonastic intro verts who like woods beloved henry james and gustave flaubert toil with the doors shut and locked in soundproof splendid isolation attentive to the subtle frictions among nouns and adjectival phrases
6051884 less humorous and far more hectoring than whats the matter with kansas this volume quickly devolves into a highly partisan manichaean minded screed against conservatives and private sector economics mr frank comes across in these pages as a sort of parody of the liberal right wingers love to hate as someone in love with big government for the sake of big government and opposed to all manner of capitalism and entrepreneurial initiative
6051885 franks portrait of the conservative movement sacrifices complexity to caricature
6051886 with rare exceptions like john kenneth galbraith conservatives have been the best satirists in thomas frank
6051887 the lovers in the gargoyle have the intimacy of roommates who hook up when they get drunk not a time defying passion their thoughts feelings conversations and affections are so unformed so hampered by sentiment and under powered awkwardness that the courage endurance and under standing ascribed to them seem silly davidsons lovers are dysfunctional and quirky qualities that can look a bit like profundity from a distance but they dont have emotional or imaginative depth or range which at the end of the day are the only things that can make a love story deep and wide ranging
6051888 west has made 15 reporting trips to iraq over the last six years and is almost as personally invested in the current conflict as he was in vietnam this book his third on iraq is his attempt to ensure that the endgame in iraq turns out better than in his last war
6051889 sharp as he can be in his judgments he is equally sharp in identifying the virtues of what he doesnt like he gives a spacious view of the countryside whatever the particular road he hews through it he takes his subjects seriously but not himself like snow white you might say
6051890 i read the suicide index with a rapacity bordering on need with tears in my chest and in my eyes occasionally i had to put it down and leave the room more often i devoured it the book is the product of a loving daughters grief and part of her process of grieving but it is also the measured elegant gripping work of a professional writer who has set her powers of observation to work on her own family her parents and grandparents her uncle her sister her husband her son and on herself
6051891 the storys emotional intensity is relentless and all of it light or dark is rendered at the same fever pitch the most consuming love until tomorrow when itll get even better the most consuming pain until tomorrow when itll get even worse bella whose human self is bumbling always blushing and a terrible driver becomes the strongest most beautiful most confident vampire ever jacob who begins the tale impatient and cranky also ends up in a new exalted state it might be unreasonable to expect a young adult vampire romance novel to be anything other than hyper intense but what it left me with was this thought readers are permitted to be breathless but stories arent
6051892 it is a bold historian who writes a history of the caucasus as events of the past week have made all too clear
6051893 june is always an unusual month in the broadcast calendar because most programming is re runs and summer fare
6051894 however there are still a few big network program finales that dominate the ratings such as the 2 hour finale of lost which lead the top commercials for both total viewership and timeshifted viewership interestingly u s open final golf also placed high in total viewership but is nowhere to be found on the timeshifted viewership as the vast majority of viewing occurred live
6051895 what is particularly impressive is that every commercial in the top 10 for timeshifted viewing aired during the lost season finale in fact the top 86 commercials for timeshifted viewing aired during lost the rank order of the specific commercials continues to demonstrate the choices viewers are making about which commercials to watch the top 5 spots in timeshifted viewing were all for movies with the highest spot getting a 7 7 timeshifted rating the lowest spot from this lost episode got a 2 8 timeshifted rating approximately 64 lower than the audience of the highest rated spot

6051906 we would need to do high definition hd to have an online subscription model
6051907 generic content is the scourge of this sector so their ability to sign up original content deals is key
6051908 its major challenge is how to increase the user experience and add user interactivity to its services a video on demand like business is not the key selling point of video sharing and user loyalty for such services is not high youku cannot effectively grow merely by adding more content it needs to think of offering more services to compete with other online video companies

6051986 the new battle in british politics as the government mortgages our long term future for the sake of its short term survival
6051987 now winning the argument that the best way to achieve progressive goals is through conservative means
6051988 simply redistributing money simply chucking money at people simply relying on tax credits has failed
6051989 child poverty is rising in this country despite the amount of money that is being spent on the tax credit system
6051990 there is absolutely no conservative plan to in any way get rid of tax credits indeed if anything we want to strengthen tax credits
6051991 these conservative methods of achieving progressive goals are likely to be far more successful and create a fairer society
6051992 this is the same tory party that opposed the minimum wage opposed pension credit and the winter fuel allowance opposed support for families through tax credits and still wont commit to any real pledge on child poverty
6051993 were talking about educational facilities and so on some place working in the field of marine archeology there arent many that handle objects buried in the sea and sand theres maybe four or five firms were talking to

6052005 at the time sen mccain was separated from his first wife
6052006 the idea that were going to sacrifice critical pieces of our environment to protect other pieces of our environment seems a little ironic
6052007 thats an irony i cannot accept we have to find a way to do both
6052008 consider this in arguments something like 90 of our defense mechanisms and behaviors were learned from watching our parents argue
6052009 i cannot even make the assumption as the practical interests of morality require of god freedom and immortality if i do not deprive speculative reason of its pretensions to transcendent insight for to arrive at these it must make use of principles which in fact extend only to the objects of possible experience and which cannot be applied to objects beyond this sphere without converting them into phenomena and thus rendering the practical extension of pure reason impossible i must therefore abolish knowledge to make room for belief

6052015 and every day that goes by beyond the deadline of noon yesterday monday is a day when the world can see that russia is not living up to its word and that is something very serious not just for georgia it is very serious for russian reputation around the world
6052016 but the political consequences of this are over the more medium term and russia is finding itself isolated even from some of its traditional allies
6052017 i would like and appreciate that georgia joins nato but as far as i understood they didnt tell anything that georgia will join nato

6052047 the ballroom was the greatest challenge it had to be a ballroom as i wanted the zimmer to start dancing as the payoff for a successful crossing i had a vague memory of an ornate ballroom in blackpool and assumed there must be others but no one seemed to know of any eventually i rang a magazine called dancing times who rather doubtfully suggested the rivoli ballroom in south east london still not knowing what it looked like i persuaded the reluctant manageress to let me visit and take some photos it was fabulous and spookily exactly what id had in my mind not only were the ballroom and foyer perfect but so was the exterior which was almost identical to the one id drawn billy the owner and charles his barman were great characters and i stayed chatting for hours

6052116 nobody at the thought leader level was surprised that there were more new pml events
6052117 at the time of the reinstatement of the us license for tysabri the fda advisory committee stated that they expected there to be more events our panel discusses whether that sentiment will translate to community based neurologists
6052118 there have been a number of high profile failed trials both in relapsing remitting and in progressive ms
6052119 the panel talks about strategies for improving the odds of success through better designs and better metrics
6052120 we are at the moment in a curious situation in which speculation over global warming has reached fever pitch yet governments and scientists are expressing grave concerns about the development of bio fuels which bring their own environmental problems along with additional socio political complications
6052121 i would like to commend international fuel technology for tackling head on the key issues facing fleet operators in these increasingly difficult times our dependency on hydrocarbons is going to continue for the foreseeable future but companies need to pay heed to environmental concerns as well as shaving costs down to the bare minimum ift offers a workable means of accomplishing these aims i therefore urge fleet operators and other interested parties to fully investigate the options available at ift doing so will contribute not only to commercial success but to the ongoing battle to stave off environmental catastrophe

6052126 as the solar industry continues to shift toward thin film photovoltaic applications the technology will continue to evolve
6052127 today our expertise lies in the process know how required to produce a complete line of manufacturing equipment for the production of thin film amorphous silicon modules and we believe that amorphous silicon offers cost advantages over other commercially viable thin film materials available in the market at the same time we want to prepare for the emergence of other cost effective thin film technologies including cigs and micro crystalline by forming partnerships with companies like amelio solar and through our own research and development activities therefore our plan is to position solar thin to utilize other thin film materials as the industry evolves
6052128 since 2005 we have been working closely with amelio solar on developing thin film cigs technology they are an ideal partner for solar thin films as we continue to expand the companys technology portfolio without diverting our attention from the many opportunities available to us to expand our share of the amorphous silicon market having access to cigs technology is an important addition to our capability as we advance our goal of becoming a leader in supplying cost effective thin film photovoltaic module manufacturing equipment
6052129 the eda software industry in particular has been challenged to measure the true piracy loss for its software piracy effects more than license revenue it can have significant ripple effects because the use of pirated software greatly reduces the cost of created electronic devices
6052130 the codearmor intelligence solution is very important since it can give software vendors a way to generate concrete evidence of unauthorized use and reduce the revenue loss attributed to piracy
6052131 our isv customers have validated that a data gathering and lead generation product can better meet their needs for applications that are well established and widely deployed
6052132 by adding intelligence capabilities to codearmor we enable isvs not only to quantify their specific piracy risk but to target the actual users of pirated software to convert them into paying customers
6052133 our research indicates that the average infringing organization has greater than 17 million in revenue and more than 150 employees clearly they are using pirated software to generate their own revenue
6052134 many of the leads we act on come from insider or other sources with v i labs new technology organizations can potentially generate high quality leads to accelerate efforts to recover revenue from businesses using pirated software
6052135 we are pleased to report strong sales and earnings growth for both the second quarter and year to date periods we believe that our solid financial results were driven mainly by our ability to offer compelling bargains on fresh and exciting name brand fashions for the family and the home the tax rebate checks and favorable weather also benefited sales in the quarter dresses accessories and shoes were the strongest merchandise categories during the second quarter while the best performing markets were in texas and the mid atlantic
6052136 operating margin in the second quarter increased about 130 basis points to 7 1 as a 180 basis point gain in gross margin was partially offset by a 50 basis point increase in selling general and administrative expenses strong merchandise margin performance was the main driver of the increase in gross margin driven primarily by lower markdowns as expected selling general and administrative costs as a percent of sales were impacted by the prior year comparison which benefited about 25 basis points from insurance proceeds related to a store loss and lower legal settlement costs incentive plan accruals were also higher due to the strong above plan results in the quarter
6052137 as we ended the first half of the year our balance sheet and cash flows remained healthy we continued to return capital to stockholders through our stock repurchase and dividend programs during the first six months of 2008 we repurchased 4 6 million shares of common stock for an aggregate of 153 million we remain on track to complete during 2008 approximately 300 million of our current two year 600 million stock repurchase program
6052138 looking ahead to the important back to school and holiday periods we believe it is prudent to remain defensively positioned based on the uncertain macro economic and retail environments which no longer have the benefit of the tax rebate checks as a result we are maintaining our original target of comparable store sales gains of 2 to 3 for both the third and fourth quarters
6052139 based on this sales forecast earnings per share are projected to be in the range of 42 to 44 for the 13 weeks ending november 1 2008 and 78 to 81 for the 13 weeks ending january 31 2009 these ranges compare to earnings per share of 36 and 70 respectively for the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2007 for the 2008 fiscal year ending january 31 2009 earnings per share are now forecast to be in the range of 2 33 to 2 38 for a projected increase of 23 to 25 over earnings per share of 1 90 in fiscal 2007
6052140 with todays interconnected information systems bad data spreads the same way viruses are spread by travelers
6052141 companies in every industry know too well the costs of poor quality data including lost sales wasted employee hours unnecessary mailing costs and damaged reputations talend data quality cleanses dirty data until its accurate complete and consistent so companies can regain control of one of their most valuable assets their data
6052142 incorrect data leads to incorrect decisions thats why high quality data is crucial to any business
6052143 proper management of data quality is even more critical in the context of application interoperability because open source considerably lowers the barriers of entry many organizations will be able to reap the benefits
6052144 advanced robotic detection of chemical agents toxic industrial gases and improvised explosive devices ied s for force health protection
6052145 the army has hired several companies to build fast super sensitive detectors to protect soldiers one of them ionfinity says it plans to build a sensor capable of detecting roadside bombs from a distance of about 100 feet
6052146 this new sensor will change the paradigm used for future chemical detection and analysis making it much more convenient sensitive selective and timely
6052147 we are pleased with this acquisition and expect that our financial backing will not only help a better tomorrow develop additional treatment programs but enable the treatment center to eventually acquire additional facilities to expand its treatment programs in california and across the country
6052148 many families do not want to send their loved ones to government funded addiction treatment programs that mainly serve individuals who have been ordered into treatment after committing a crime
6052149 and while there are a handful of high end rehabilitation centers that cater to the rich and famous there are very few high quality private clinics that are affordable thats the niche a better tomorrow is targeting
6052150 year to date several of our encore medical staffing locations have posted triple digit revenue growth month over month even outpacing their initial expectations this indicates our encore medical franchise business model can be successfully replicated both locally and nationwide we foresee aggressive expansion in encore medicals franchise operations throughout the us which will position southern home to continue on its path of substantial top and bottom line growth
6052151 the fiscal quarters net inflows of 5 8 billion represent an annualized internal growth rate of 15 one of the highest growth rates in recent company history

6052153 newspaper print advertising has undergone unprecedented declines that are beyond analyst expectations for the industry
6052154 this has caused our revenues to decline in a corresponding magnitude adstar has responded by dramatically reducing costs we have postponed our mobile advertising initiative along with the attendant costs as well as the significant costs relating to our sec reporting which has resulted in a level of stability in our cash flow we are not aware of any significant pending customer cancellations at this time and we are at the same time adding new customers to our payment processing software and to our web based ad services we believe that there are opportunities arising from the adversity in the industry whereby publishers are seeking efficiencies in their operations that can be facilitated by adstar our payment processing software remains the premier solution in the industry for processing both circulation and advertising costs and we are exploring wider applications for this sophisticated solution we believe that adstar has a platform for growth as the industry reaches a new equilibrium

6052160 june is always an unusual month in the broadcast calendar because most programming is re runs and summer fare
6052161 however there are still a few big network program finales that dominate the ratings such as the 2 hour finale of lost which lead the top commercials for both total viewership and timeshifted viewership interestingly u s open final golf also placed high in total viewership but is nowhere to be found on the timeshifted viewership as the vast majority of viewing occurred live
6052162 what is particularly impressive is that every commercial in the top 10 for timeshifted viewing aired during the lost season finale in fact the top 86 commercials for timeshifted viewing aired during lost the rank order of the specific commercials continues to demonstrate the choices viewers are making about which commercials to watch the top 5 spots in timeshifted viewing were all for movies with the highest spot getting a 7 7 timeshifted rating the lowest spot from this lost episode got a 2 8 timeshifted rating approximately 64 lower than the audience of the highest rated spot

6052175 this agreement seriously upsets the balance of forces in the caucasus region and poses a treat to international security
6052176 what are the reasons for such sudden military activity in the caucasus region which is sensitive from the point of view of russias security
6052177 if it is counterterrorism it would be logical to include russia in the decision making process if such actions are taken without moscow it causes very understandable questions and concerns
6052178 the position of the russian defense ministry is that privileges for us military and civilian personnel in georgia do not contribute to friendship and cooperation between russia and georgia
6052179 provoke additional tension in a region that is sensitive from the viewpoint of russias security interests

6052193 in the absence of fresh interventions from the authorities mortgage lending activity is set to worsen in the second half of 2008
6052194 dampening of consumer demand due to tightened lending criteria declining house prices and pressures on household finances from higher food and energy costs
6052195 while there was a small month on month increase in activity it represented a notable decline from a year ago
6052196 this continues the weaker picture seen in june and points towards the more subdued levels of lending we are likely to see in the second half of 2008

6052203 that in pushing the envelope puts money in our customers pockets and results in designs that resonate with consumers at the point of sale
6052204 create designs that are both truer to the brand essence and enhance production
6052205 in this case our different way of working is demonstrably better and for custom oriented markets such as food packaging its an approach that is just a natural
6052206 now we have the capability to take our services to a new level which will truly delight our clients some of the most demanding consumer product makers in the world
6052207 we are much more than superior tool makers molders and manufacturers we have the complete industrial design piece too all available within one company
6052208 we realized that to do this right and best serve our customers we had to have separate and very different environments tethered in a way that permits two very different types of professionals to work together for a common purpose a superior package that supports the brand
6052209 we cut right to the brand essence and with our superior tooling and molding capability push the machines possibilities to the limit its an organizational structure
6052210 that allows the designers and the tooling molding and manufacturing teams to challenge each other for the good of the customer and the brand
6052211 we are not just a tooling company but a full service packaging solutions company rebranding is just part of diversifying our companies capabilities to adapt and thrive in an evolving industry by bringing solutions to both brand owners and converters while the rest of the industry lets itself become commoditized

6052243 coming from a person occupying the responsible post of a minister in a state the remark is deplorable and should be condemned by all the remark should be withdrawn immediately and the minister should tender an unqualified apology to the people of bihar

6052294 i didnt ever think id have a movie career i always thought id be a theatre actress and so just the idea now that ive gotten to play so many different roles im really having a blast doing that
6052295 my general broad thing that i look for when im choosing a role is i like to be the exact opposite of what was the last thing i played
6052296 shes the one whos willing to do more extreme stuff i think shes attracted to more provocative material
6052297 she just took that role and made it her own it couldve been something she did passively it couldve been something she kind of phoned in but she got into it a lot of the physicality of it a lot of the way she was moving and talking that was all her
6052298 shes also just cool in between takes i found her at the crafts service truck eating grilled cheese and smoking cigarettes talking to the grips
6052299 it was cool hes playing someone whos so immature and when you meet her mary kate she seems really wise and it was also three in the morning and so we were just like ah lets get it over with

6052314 ncbs sponsorship of al qaeda flowed largely although not exclusively through muwafaq foundation
6052315 plaintiffs offer only speculation and hearsay in their effort to link ncb to al qaeda terrorists who committed the sept 11 attacks
6052316 mr kadis actions and those of his muwafaq foundation and businesses give rise to a reasonable basis to believe that they have facilitated terrorist activities

6052337 our focus at the denver super rally will be to expand the debates beyond just two parties
6052338 its an issue of central concern to many americans and extends far beyond any one candidate it is a first amendment matter of speech petition and assembly during a presidential election for both the candidates and the voters
6052339 if tens of millions of americans could hear the nader gonzalez message through the presidential debates it would be a three way race
6052340 my apology to ralph nader for not demanding that he be included in the debates
6052341 i met with sean penn and we talked at length
6052342 he was very clear that he is not currently planning to endorse any candidate in the general election but that he has serious concerns about the state of presidential debates he did support kucinich in the primaries and saw how dennis was excluded from msnbc debates
6052343 debut had a great second quarter of 2008 comparatively with a quarterly increase in net revenue of more than 440 percent
6052344 debut continues to see an increase in net revenue as the radio syndication arm thrives and additional radio stations are brought under the debut broadcasting umbrella
6052345 for example we experienced a 60 percent growth in second quarter net revenue versus first quarter results in addition not counting one time and seasonal expenses our quarter over quarter losses are dropping as well
6052346 impact radio networks provides syndicated content and services to over 1 400 radio stations in the u s and canada reaching more than 45 million listeners weekly
6052347 as debut broadcasting continues to add properties to its growing number of owned and operated o amp o radio stations in the southeastern u s an opportunity is then created for additional radio programs to meet content needs as such we can then turn around and syndicate debut
6052348 our belief was that we could target undervalued and underutilized media properties acquire the radio stations and then group them into a super regional cluster to lower overall expenses
6052349 upon acquiring the rights to manage and operate the stations we improve the operating systems and generate more revenue at a decreased cost of production
6052350 debut s strategy was realized in greenville it was also successful in vicksburg and now as the seven stations operate as a single unit revenue is continuing to increase as operational costs decrease
6052351 after discounting one time or seasonal expenses debut has also seen a quarterly decrease in ordinary loss additionally the company
6052352 as we continue to grow all facets of debut broadcasting including syndication and o amp o radio stations we are confident that current investors will grow with us and potential investors who will join us as we continue our venture upward through tough economic times

6052356 in the absence of fresh interventions from the authorities mortgage lending activity is set to worsen in the second half of 2008
6052357 dampening of consumer demand due to tightened lending criteria declining house prices and pressures on household finances from higher food and energy costs
6052358 while there was a small month on month increase in activity it represented a notable decline from a year ago
6052359 this continues the weaker picture seen in june and points towards the more subdued levels of lending we are likely to see in the second half of 2008
6052360 were not just going to see mid sized banks go under in the next few months were going to see a whopper were going to see a big one one of the big investment banks or big banks
6052361 manufacturers are becoming more downbeat about forthcoming levels of activity but are still having to raise their prices due to the severity of recent cost increases
6052362 domestic conditions remain sluggish and the recent slowdown in the eurozone economies is starting to make conditions tougher for uk manufacturing exporters although the weaker pound will offer some relief
6052363 the result of the rise in the price of gold
6052364 the weaker economic climate is not necessarily a driver for our business its not true to say we will do well out of a recession we didnt see an improvement last time we have not seen any change in customer profiles or customer numbers

6052369 a single copy of a newspaper per customer is no longer adequate we have got to provide media in as many different forms as possible
6052370 cost management and business restructuring will continue to play a fundamental part in countering advertising decline
6052371 we expect the ftse 100 to be up 6pc in 2009 as we think the bank of england will cut rates by a full 1pc to 4pc and i think materials telecoms and financials will be key growth areas
6052372 investors should try and buy when the market is weak but it is difficult when there is sentiment against the market the key is to get investors to look through the poor sentiment to the find the fundamentals it is not as bad as it looks
6052373 we expect the market to be volatile over the months ahead this is because there is a lack of visibility in key areas and the outlook for economic growth is a concern however inflation spiked during the second quarter so that will help on the interest rate front
6052374 we expect this to continue into next year and believe the market will trade within quite a huge range during this time
6052375 for the ftse 250 going back towards the end of 2006 we suggested it was time to return to the large caps
6052376 working capital reserves are limited and advances under the loan facility are required as a matter of urgency

6052490 i cannot even make the assumption as the practical interests of morality require of god freedom and immortality if i do not deprive speculative reason of its pretensions to transcendent insight for to arrive at these it must make use of principles which in fact extend only to the objects of possible experience and which cannot be applied to objects beyond this sphere without converting them into phenomena and thus rendering the practical extension of pure reason impossible i must therefore abolish knowledge to make room for belief

6052526 in a sharp turnaround republican john mccain has opened a 5 point lead on democrat barack obama in the u s presidential race and is seen as a stronger manager of the economy according to a reuters zogby poll released on wednesday mccain leads obama among likely u s voters by 46 percent to 41 percent wiping out obamas solid 7 point advantage in july and taking his first lead in the monthly reuters zogby poll the reversal follows a month of attacks by mccain who has questioned obamas experience criticized his opposition to most new offshore oil drilling and mocked his overseas trip the poll was taken thursday through saturday as obama wrapped up a weeklong vacation in hawaii that ceded the political spotlight to mccain who seized on russias invasion of georgia to emphasize his foreign policy views

6052556 in the waning days of president bushs unpopular presidency senator arlen specter and senate minority leader mitch mcconnell are throwing temper tantrums over judges theyve even repeatedly threatened to shut down the senate which would hold up crucial legislation as the economy teeters on the edge of recession if they dont get their way
6052557 senators mcconnell and specter conveniently forget that over 300 of president bushs judicial nominees have been confirmed a greater percentage than were confirmed for president clinton
6052558 senator pat leahy who has gone far above and beyond what is required as committee chairman announced that three additional federal circuit court nominees would be confirmed in short order
6052559 senator specter apparently learned a lesson four years ago when he nearly lost a primary to patrick toomey the handpicked candidate of the religious right and club for growth ever since specter has been a pit bull for right wing judges thats bad for pennsylvania and bad for america
6052560 senators specter and mcconnell will continue their pressure tactics around judges but senate democrats must stand strong the clock is ticking for president bush but its already run out for his controversial nominees

6052564 this institute has a particular interest in looking at science and figuring out a way of making it practical
6052565 how do we apply this unbelievable information that is being developed now how do we apply it to basic management of cancer therapy cancer prevention
6052566 we can no longer think of things one piece at a time you have to think about it in terms of the whole system at once
6052567 we have looked at things like the amount of granitic rock you have that might be exuding radon the amount of natural arsenic in the water the amount of potential toxins
6052568 we suspect there may be problems associated with that but we have never really demonstrated it
6052569 what we ultimately want to be able to do is figure out some way to provide help to the public health system to reduce those rates
6052570 whether it is improvements to treatment or access to treatment whether it is development of community education programs to do something better ultimately our goal is to reduce that incidence of cancer by understanding what it is a bit better
6052571 its an ideal situation for us to collaborate certainly one of the major reasons for my team to be here today is to talk about these opportunities
6052572 these are the important things that ultimately lead to some improvements in public health care both in our state and in the province

6052582 i am pleased to announce these senior appointments which reflect our priorities as we reshape the organisation to ensure we continue to punch our weight in an increasingly competitive market and work in collaboration with all the nations and regions of britain
6052583 based upon the present state of unacceptable safety compliance of angel tours iguala busmex and de la torre their continued motor carrier operations affiliated with angel tours iguala busmex and or de la torre pose an imminent hazard to public safety
6052584 liberty charters leases and operates buses owned and maintained by angel tours angel de la torre and or iguala busmex liberty charters use of passenger vehicles which are subject to the egregiously deficient maintenance procedures of angel tours iguala busmex and angel de la torre places drivers and the motoring public at continued and substantially increased risk of serious injury or death
6052585 fmcsa is fully committed to continuing our investigation of motor coach carriers with significant connections to mr angel de la torre angel tours inc and or iguala busmex inc
6052586 we are thoroughly reviewing all relevant records and statements and will not stop until we get to the bottom of this rogue operation
6052587 britain is a sporting nation with a reputation earned in part by the popularity of our world renowned events and venues at destinations in every nation and region with visits to britain from china increasing 35 per cent last year and more and more chinese looking for their next destination the beijing olympic games is a wonderful opportunity for us to raise awareness of the range of destinations and experiences available in britain
6052588 visit london will be focussing on how we can translate the excitement of the chinese people about their own olympic games into enthusiasm for londons games in 2012 our ambition is to capture the spirit that is bringing millions of chinese domestic visitors to beijing and make london the next obvious choice as a visitor destination we expect visits to london from china to grow by over 300 by 2012 outpacing the growth rates in many of our traditional markets
6052589 there is no way that the bill would have had any effect on any method of abortion
6052590 americans can differ on the issue of abortion but senator obamas extreme record on this issue and his willingness to misrepresent that record should concern any american who believes that we should be working towards a society where there are fewer abortions not more
6052591 and i hate to say that people are lying but heres a situation where folks are lying
6052592 even if it was as a consequence of an induced abortion
6052593 so for people to suggest that i and the illinois medical society so illinois doctors were somehow in favor of withholding life saving support from an infant born alive is ridiculous
6052594 it defies commonsense and it defies imagination and for people to keep on pushing this is offensive
6052595 the obama campaign even had to acknowledge yesterday that all along whether intentionally or not they had basically been misrepresenting what he did
6052596 theres no question in my mind that when he killed that bill in his committee in 2003 he was killing a bill that was identical to the one that boxer heartily endorsed on the floor
6052597 sen obama has repeatedly mischaracterized this hes given so many false and at times even conflicting explanations for what he did that its been very hard for the truth to come out
6052598 this is a vote thats so over the top and so unpalatable that its almost hard for people to believe
6052599 receiving the body and blood of christ unworthily is a sacrilege
6052600 if it is done deliberately in mortal sin it is a sacrilege
6052601 public officials who with knowledge and consent uphold actions that are against the divine and eternal moral law for example if they support abortion which entails the taking of innocent and defenseless human lives a person who commits sin in this way should be publicly admonished in such a way as to not receive communion until he or she has reformed his life
6052602 if a person who has been admonished persists in public mortal sin and attempts to receive communion the minister of the eucharist has the obligation to deny it to him why above all for the salvation of that person preventing him from committing a sacrilege
6052603 we must avoid giving people the impression that one can be in a state of mortal sin and receive the eucharist
6052604 secondly there could be another form of scandal consisting of leading people to think that the public act that this person is doing which until now everyone believed was a serious sin is really not that serious if the church allows him or her to receive communion
6052605 if we have a public figure who is openly and deliberately upholding abortion rights and receiving the eucharist what will the average person think he or she could come to believe that it up to a certain point it is okay to do away with an innocent life in the mothers womb
6052606 it is not with the intention of interfering in public life but rather in the spiritual state of the politician or public official who if catholic should follow the divine law in the public sphere as well
6052607 therefore it is simply ridiculous and wrong to try to silence a pastor accusing him of interfering in politics so that he cannot do good to the soul of a member of his flock
6052608 you cant die youve got to look after me you stupid man wake up youve got to look after me you would go and get ill you stupid man

6052701 mccain and the forrestals skipper capt john k beling were warned about the danger of using m 65 1000 lb bombs manufactured in 1935 which were deemed too dangerous to use during world war ii and later on b 52 bombers the fire from the zuni missle misfire resulted in the heavy 1000 pound bombs being knocked loose from the pylons of mccains a 4 aircraft which were only designed to hold 500 pound bombs
6052702 the unstable bombs had a 60 second cook off threshold in a fire situation and this warning was known to both beling and mccain prior to the disaster
6052703 the neo cons who have had five years to examine every file within the department of defense have likely accessed documents that could prove embarrassing to mccain who was on board the uss forrestal on july 29 1967 and whose a 4 skyhawk was struck by an air to ground zuni missile that had misfired from an f 4 phantom

6052710 the small but vocal minority that originally supported the starr investigation was nurtured by the conspiracy stories circulating about clinton much of the media coverage of clinton from 1997 until 1999 focused on scandal and impeachment rather than ideological political issues or electoral politics this was true not only in alternative right wing media but also in mainstream corporate media

6052716 when asked by newsnight for an explanation of the list republican spokespersons claim the list merely records returned mail from either fundraising solicitations or returned letters sent to newly registered voters to verify their addresses for purposes of mailing campaign literature
6052717 republican state campaign spokeswoman mindy tucker fletcher stated the list was not put together
6052718 the real story is this there were thousands of reported illegal fake voter registrations around the country so some of the republican state parties mailed letters welcoming new voters to the newly registered voters the republican state parties ultimately wanted to show that thousands of fraudulent registrations had been completed

6052818 we are extremely concerned that the brigade has gone down this route
6052819 they should be listening to the workforce they are going to get a totally demoralised workforce that wont be responsive to anything
6052820 we thought we were going to reach an agreement but then they decided to impose these changes
6052821 the shifts are not very family friendly bearing in mind they are trying to recruit more female firefighters then i would consider family friendly shifts to be paramount
6052822 but it is not just women that will be affected there are a lot of fathers as well as mothers working in the fire service
6052823 it is not very family friendly and we didnt want a shift change
6052824 they are in accordance with firefighters existing contracts and take into account the needs of employees as well as those of the service as a whole
6052825 we need to ensure that we comply with health and safety legislation and provide value for money these moderate changes will maximise the efficiency of the current duty system without creating significant changes to the shift pattern which is what our firefighters said they wanted to avoid
6052826 were opposed to the plans to regionalise controls weve got no confidence that it will improve the fire service in any way
6052827 one of our fears is that the service will be worse you could be phoning from devon and get put through to a control centre in newcastle if the south west centre reaches capacity im pretty sure they wouldnt have the knowledge of the area that a devon control officer would
6052828 were also concerned about the technology and everything being based on a super computer ive seen examples of other systems that dont work
6052829 its one thing missing an appointment but quite another if your house is on fire
6052830 the new nationally linked fire control network will offer many benefits compared to the current system including tracking and deployment of appliances across boundaries automatic back up and transfer of calls to other regions when high volumes are received
6052831 it will benefit all front line firefighters providing them with site plans water location and hazard handling information direct into their cabs information that they currently do not have

6052857 one of the absolute best things about tilt seal is the paintability of the product
6052858 with urethane sealants the contractor has to wait 7 10 days to begin painting which often causes delays and ive seen numerous problems over the years with paint adhesion to various urethane sealants not only can tilt seal be painted within 24 hours but paint and coatings adhere to acrylic latex sealants significantly better than to polyurethane sealants
6052859 we appreciate fast curing paintable properties as well as the fact its easy to use competitively priced and offers exceptional adhesion

6052943 yes it was a dummy you all saw it it was for the baby that is coming
6052944 i dedicated the goal to gianinna and to all my family watching at home i miss them a lot
6052945 im very proud of having a son in law who can score two goals against brazil and then gets fouled in the box for a penalty

6052948 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
6052949 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
6052950 there isnt that much difference in maturity between 21 and 18
6052951 if the age is younger youre getting exposed to it at a younger age and you dont freak out when you get to campus
6052952 are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
6052953 by choosing to use fake ids students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law
6052954 im not sure where the dialogue will lead but its an important topic to american families and it deserves a straightforward dialogue
6052955 i remember college campuses when we had 18 year old drinking ages and i honestly believe weve made some progress
6052956 to just shift it back down to the high schools makes no sense at all
6052957 see a problem of drinking on college campuses and they dont want to deal with it
6052958 i understand why colleges are doing it because it splits their students and they like to treat them all alike rather than having to card some of them its a nuisance to them
6052959 i wish these college presidents sat around and tried to work out ways to deal with the problem on their campus rather than try to eliminate the problem by defining it out of existence
6052960 if you treat students like children theyre going to act like children
6052961 from addressing drinking with students as an issue of responsible choice
6052962 not mentally processing how many calories they are actually consuming
6052963 we need to see if there are targeted gene strategies to identify what keeps thin people thin
6052964 the causes of obesity are complicated and likely cannot be solely explained on differences in rates of metabolism
6052965 this suggests that differences in hunger fullness food intake and physical activity may be more important factors in why some people are thin
6052966 overall we found no evidence that thin people have a higher metabolic rate on a regular diet or that they burn more energy following a period of overfeeding
6052967 the most important take home message for clinicians is that people who are tending to gain weight may not be getting accurate information on how much they are eating through biologic mechanisms so self monitoring might be an important tool for them such as keeping food diaries and food records because they may be eating more than they think
6052968 we need to see if there are targeted gene strategies to identify what keeps thin people thin
6052969 dit is het werk waarvoor ik in de wieg ben gelegd

6052974 empirical thesis in which there are deep and widespread moral disagreements
6052975 the value of human well being comes first and foremost but what i see as constituting and contributing to well being has been developed in a particular cultural context to me that means were treading into the murky waters of moral relativism here
6052976 truth or justification of moral judgments is not absolute but relative to some group of persons
6052977 there is no greater sorrow on earth than the loss of ones native land

6052984 if you believe the british press the youth of today is aimless feckless and hopeless addicted to their playstations lacking in respect and lacking in the emotional discipline needed to cope with a big match occasion
6052985 if you believe the politicians we have a broken society in which the courage and morals of young people have been sapped by welfarism and political correctness

6052991 it was the perfect finish for a close race and definitely does not get any better than that
6052992 all the perplexities confusion and distress in america arise not from defects in their constitution or confederation nor from want of honor or virtue so much as downright ignorance of the nature of coin credit and circulation

6053067 commodization is an erosive competitive condition where it is very difficult for your customers to perceive any meaningful distinction between your products and services and those of your competitors
6053068 if your customers cant perceive any meaningful distinction between your products or services and everyone elses then theyll almost certainly buy the least expensive one
6053069 this leads to lowest cost being the sole basis for competition a strategy that only the most efficient companies can make work and usually only at razor thin margins
6053070 this is why we see commodization occurring across the board in virtually every industry today
6053071 its a sure sign of a systemic failure in companies with their products and services becoming commoditized

6053216 i was training as hard as i could and while my diet was healthy i figured that nutrition might be the key
6053217 so i went to a sports nutrition seminar afterwards i collared the speaker kerry kayes and we chatted about my injuries he went through my diet and said i wasnt getting enough protein it made sense so i started taking protein supplements that was the turning point
6053218 the trauma that modern triathletes put their bodies through is immense
6053219 that calls for extra protein to help muscles repair themselves to get enough extra protein from an ordinary diet would mean eating huge amounts of food and having to deal with subsequent weight issues a good protein supplement delivers the protein in a low calorie easily digested formula that gives the body what it needs when it needs it

6053473 this proposal includes some very good ideas to address our countrys many energy related challenges and while i do not agree with every part of it i very much appreciate the bipartisan spirit in which it was constructed

6053477 with americas workforce strained by increasing financial insecurity and rising prices we urge congress to enact comprehensive legislation to spur economic growth through tax credits and other business engage and invest in americas technology leadership its businesses

6053487 but these models also attest to how other factors measured by a comprehensive hra like the wellness checkpoint contribute to both impaired performance while at work and time away from work these factors exert their influence on productivity loss that are both independent of health and are considerable in their magnitude above and beyond the contribution of health
6053488 the result in this study is a wealth of information that can be used for shaping and guiding efforts to reduce productivity loss this information can help to build the rationale and consensus for taking action
6053489 health is not the only accessible and measurable candidate for intervention efforts

6053537 budgeting may not sound exciting but it is the no 1 sure fire way to save money
6053538 the key is to set goals with your spouse and children whether the goal is to save on weekly grocery bills save for a vacation next summer or save for kids education write down the goals and build your budget with the goals in mind that will dictate month to month expenditures and take the guesswork out of what you can spend for back to school items
6053539 we all know this but putting it into action takes thought and planning
6053540 in other words if you are used to making a day of back to school shopping think twice skip the lunch out just shop and go home
6053541 or reward the kids for their shopping patience with a picnic and playtime at a park you will all be more motivated to get the shopping done
6053542 buying only what you need is the best way to curb spending
6053543 moreover building a budget and not spending beyond your means is the best primer for personal finance that you can give your family and yourself

6053551 choosing the right self publishing company comes down to finding one that offers the best mix of price low printing markups high royalties and favorable contract terms

6053555 the policies meet monthly mortgage costs should an accident sickness or unemployment occur and the unemployment criterion is generally interpreted as being made unemployed by your employer however those opting to leave their job because of circumstances beyond their control ie caring are also covered

6053557 whilst this isnt a long term solution it does provide a temporary mortgage repayment financial safety net in that first year and will help people keep their homes and give them time to sort out their finances

6053601 we feel that our timeline offers greater insight than many others with its uniquely rich overlays of events trends drivers and archetypal patterns of change spanning america and the world

6053621 with some talented developers and a unique concept even a small company can launch a useful and or memorable application the challenge is creating an app that is unique and truly appeals to your target market ultimately the success of a branded app depends on its ability to deliver functionality that inspires the initial download encourages frequent and long term usage and creates a positive brand image

6053657 as early as 2004 when our employee base consisted of just 15 associates we made the decision not to develop an internal hr administrative department
6053658 about the time we reached 600 associates we started to evaluate alternatives mostly around hr systems we quickly eliminated the option of purchasing software and building an hr and it operations staff because again that option did not fit our corporate philosophy instead we decided on an approach in which the provider was responsible for managing and hosting a comprehensive fully integrated hr information system that met our unique needs this narrowed our search to just a few providers immediately
6053659 then as we got deeper into the evaluation of hr systems it became clear that the solution we really desired was broader than just access to good technology first we needed hr professionals with high competencies in the hr systems they used who would form a dedicated services team that was familiar with our business and who would manage our administrative workload and answer our associates calls using a devoted services center approach next we needed technologies that did more than the basics we needed technology that integrated the business processes between our management team our associates and the providers client team finally the solution had to fit within our budget constraints
6053660 going back to our corporate philosophy i mentioned that we are directed by our board to search out and implement any business solution that will free up time and capital our hr solution from platformone does both compared to the most conservative industry standards we would need 4 to 6 full time internal hr staff to administer our hr function for over 600 associates we require no it operating expense or personnel to run this solution best of all we avoided a huge capital outlay for hr software and technology infrastructure when you consider that the platformone solution meets our needs allows us to manage a single source provider relationship has been successfully implemented within our tight timeframes provides us superior day to day service response and costs 10 below the market price what more is there to ask a provider to do

6053805 our soccer team won the gold medal in martial arts
6053806 china has had a weird year with a freak snowstorm the tibetan riots and an earthquake but the performance of our soccer team shows that some things never change
6053807 our strikers did such a great job that i even told them they should start playing for our mens team now
6053808 its so beyond an embarrassment that it almost seems like a comedy
6053809 weve cried our tears dry and now its time for us to enjoy the big show because you never know how our team is going to lose this time
6053810 without rule of law corruption will get involved and nobody is responsible to anyone
6053811 if chinese continue to be obsessed with soccer theyll definitely demand something dramatic something political or involving rule of law it will start with sports and then it will move onto something bigger
6053812 it represents the most outdated management system that still exists in this country
6053813 you cant run a soccer team the same way you train table tennis players which is exactly what theyre doing right now
6053814 they enjoy playing soccer while the chinese view it as a fight

6053817 we initially launched the site in order to make it easier for consumers to find the best insurance quotes available
6053818 in our rush to get the site live as soon as possible we werent able to spend a great deal of time on the design after running the site for awhile and listening to feedback from our visitors we decided we could make the site even more useful to consumers by making a few changes to the site layout and the search engine used within the site
6053819 we have also been working on creating an extensive article directory that can provide our visitors with helpful information
6053820 after conducting a little research we noticed that there wasnt a great deal of information about auto insurance available on the internet sure you can find plenty of agencies that want to sell you auto insurance but not too many of them are providing consumers with real information that will help them make more informed decisions about their coverage
6053821 most u s households use mass market insurance companies which may not provide the breadth of coverage they need
6053822 this quality comes without the high price tag you might expect aig private client group programs feature competitive pricing without sacrificing quality of service or breadth of coverage

6053864 by the third game of the tournament we knew that we could play against the best in the world
6053865 we were expecting more they were better what can we say in the crucial moments when we had to score we didnt at the beginning they made the big gap and it was hard to get equal with them
6053866 we went into the match against italy relaxed about winning or losing thats why we lose
6053867 we were not on the level we should be for the beginning of the game
6053868 we are going for fifth place now and wishing montenegro all the best in the semifinals

6053871 waiting is frustrating demoralizing agonizing aggravating annoying time consuming and incredibly expensive

6053881 shawn ralph didnt leave him in the freezing cold water waiting for hours to be rescued
6053882 it was because of the coast guard and the department of national defence not shawn ralph that those bodies were lost
6053883 that man didnt set out on that voyage to destroy any lives
6053884 they shouldve and couldve been charged with neglecting their duty
6053885 it seemed like the coast guard had no backup system
6053886 i think this here was more of a deflection because of some neglect on their part and theyre coming out with charges i dont think its really reasonable
6053887 the system failed my brother and if anybody is guilty its the system we rely on
6053888 nothing has changed since this accident and im afraid something like this will happen again
6053889 when only one nuclear bomb could destroy a city like minneapolis we dont need 6 000
6053890 this is a private airline acting as a political censor
6053891 i just took a look and i can see how this would be offensive scary to some the concept of our city in the crosshairs of a nuclear bomb and the strong anti mccain message can we remove it
6053892 out of an abundance of respect for both parties we will not allow attack ads of either persuasion to be prominently displayed in our concourses our customers and employees complained and we responded we will not be a party to petty political attacks on either side
6053893 well agree that nukes are scary and thats why we think more people should be paying attention to the issue
6053894 to say that the ad is anti mccain is ludicrous
6053895 when only one nuclear bomb could destroy a city like minneapolis we dont need 6 000
6053896 barack obama has generated so much excitement that some progressives i talk to simply think there is no way he could lose and its not really hard to see why
6053897 obama is a terrific candidate and republicans have definitely made a mess of things but the truth is obama also faces some real hurdles between now and november
6053898 we can win but were gonna have to fight for every vote

6053900 youre looking at about 600 pounds of cod in one net thats phenomenal
6053901 ive been fishing for a long time and ive never seen the like of it in my life
6053902 theres no one can tell me theres no cod fish i dont believe scientists never did and never will
6053903 its littered out there the bottom is covered with cod
6053904 even more so this year it seems like theres more codfish around i think they dfo managers know but they are gun shy because of what happened in the past and we had the moratorium
6053905 if we dont start catching the cod and turbot the crab and shrimp stocks are going to decline
6053906 theres lots of fish out there we just cant catch it
6053907 so the preliminary numbers show about a 22 percent bycatch of cod overall
6053908 but we will be pursing options to allow fishers to catch the remaining 500 tonnes the objective is to give fishers the opportunity to harvest this allocation

6053939 pretty hard to imagine it would be legitimate for him to travel abroad again

6053942 one of the things we have learned generally about sex offenders is they do want to travel to places where they can exploit children
6053943 if there is evidence the person is travelling abroad to abuse children we can get an order that stops them travelling there should be more of those
6053944 in every single case the court has to make the decision but this is the type of case where i find it pretty hard to imagine it is legitimate for him to travel abroad again

6054410 im not saying that as a negative i think its very positive a lot of younger kids get turned on to classic bands because theyre trading files they have 4 000 or 5 000 songs on their ipod thats 4 000 or 5 000 on their ipod at
6054411 the second generation jazz presents one of toughest challenges in the development of a car of its kind as its predecessor already set a high benchmark in the compact 5 door hatchback segment
6054412 this is much more challenging than changing a cars total design but it pushes us to innovate further so that our customers get even more value out of the similarly compact all new jazz

6054415 each year our presence gets bigger and bigger and this year it is true to say theres never been anything like it in the world
6054416 it shows just how far we have moved on over the past 18 years
6054417 to have so many people take part in pride whether they be gay or straight is something i never dreamed i would see and it makes me so proud to be a police officer

6054420 gmp is committed to erasing hate crime from our communities anyone who has been targeted because of their sexual orientation or gender identity should report it to police we will take you seriously
6054421 and so the lion fell in love with the lamb

6054454 pending an international mechanism in south ossetia russian peacekeeping forces will implement additional security measures
6054455 we are of course not against international peacekeepers but the problem is that the abkhaz and the ossetians do not trust anyone except russian peacekeepers

6054464 there is no doubt the campaign to discredit obama is paying off for mccain right now
6054465 that hairline difference between nuance and what appears to be flip flopping is hurting him with liberal voters
6054466 conservatives were supposed to be the bigger problem for mccain
6054467 obama still has work to do on his base at this point mccain seems to be doing a better job with his
6054468 there were no wild swings there isnt one group that is radically different than last month or even two months ago it was just a steady decline for obama across the board
6054469 any decision to convene parliament will be a clear repudiation of the memorandum of understanding and an indication beyond reasonable doubt of unwillingness to continue to be part of the talks in short convening parliament decapitates the dialogue
6054470 yesterday they said they had no problem with parliament opening and today they have a problem i have no comment on that
6054471 the reintegration of iraq into the arab world is the principle objective that we should all work for

6054498 my end goal is for them to achieve whatever they want without being hindered

6054504 i dont usually respond to things like that but he said he could beat me at scrabble that was interesting
6054505 i walked in and hes in the middle of the hearing
6054506 he knew what i looked like because i sent him a photo i figured hed be the guy in the big chair wearing a black dress
6054507 he pointed his finger down at me where i was sitting in the row and he crooks it as if to say you
6054508 i always told him even if we never married i would stay with him because this is the best relationship of my life

6054526 cracked sidewalks decrepit classrooms structural blight megatons of gray concrete and a giant looming smokestack will leave you wondering what brutalist fiend slapped together this sorry excuse for a campus
6054527 the information you are prepared to validate through publication is years if not a decade out of date
6054528 if you visit our campus you can quickly see for yourself the report is false
6054529 a significant investment in campus security to ensure the safety of students faculty staff and visitors
6054530 spreading demonstrably false reports under the guise of calling it gossip is something we hope the daily news will not assist more than that radar is not a magazine deserving of the daily news attention
6054531 every one of them does touch the water they get surfed before they ever get shipped
6054532 i got this cryptic e mail from ric that just said i have this idea for a surfboard
6054533 i knew a lot about wood i knew a lot about design i just didnt really know much about surfboards
6054534 the original one looked more like a paddle board this would make more of a surfboard shape
6054535 the thinking was if you werent man enough to carry your board down to the beach then you shouldnt be surfing
6054536 you can make a chair and maybe over the course of a year a few people will sit in it but this is something you can really use everybody can use it its out there in public

6054544 sometimes i dont like people to see the man behind the curtain i dont like them to know that something wasnt awesome before they saw it
6054545 you know the things we had to tweak the things we had to cut that is inevitable
6054546 but now i dont think it is just us the whole world is so much about seeing behind the curtain and seeing how things are made and how they work and the extended cut and what we could have done and what we didnt do and the alternate ending and you just you kind of take it as part and parcel at the beginning
6054547 its a different field if you will but its no less important
6054548 its a privilege to represent this state particularly we have a great tradition here ted kennedy and going back to john quincy adams
6054549 the fact is john mccain still doesnt think it was a mistake to go to iraq barack obama knows that it was thats judgment
6054550 twelve billion dollars a month a month are being spent in place where there was no al qaida and there were no weapons of mass destruction and the place where there is al qaida and there are weapons of mass destruction pakistan and afghanistan they have ignored sufficiently that its now at great risk
6054551 im going to have cute boobs till im 90 so theres that
6054552 ill be the envy of all the ladies around the bridge table
6054553 my allegiance to senator john mccain becomes stronger with any assault that tries to deter my loyalty to him
6054554 i can only pray that good people see roseanne for what she is sick of mind
6054555 i decided to start a network where people from across the world might come together and get a conversation started over me
6054556 i wish i had been nude from the time i was 12 until i was 28 i looked great
6054557 no one understands what its like to live with a chronic condition
6054558 theyre excited high energy and fun to play to so its cool but i do feel my music can be brought to a wider audience and im excited to see if the movie will change that
6054559 the music in the film is harder rocking than the stuff ive done in the past i didnt write any of it but its more like the originals im now doing
6054560 plus im older almost 20 closer to the age of your average singer songwriter
6054561 all the posters advertising it on the new york city buses listed the wrong day and time
6054562 to look down the coast and not see anything its amazing
6054563 nearby were pools of blood watches tattered clothes and a mobile telephone still ringing
6054564 although we now know that jack kerouac indeed spent a great deal of time editing the paragraphs of on the road the spontaneity of his language lent his characters a fresh vitality a simultaneous romancing and rejection of the american dream on the road speaks to all that is contemplative and nomadic in us his characters hitched train hopped and drove their way across the united states and into the uncharted regions of their own interiors
6054565 its important that glitter comes back here and that hes carefully risk assessed here in the u k where we can do that
6054566 its important that we stop him traveling overseas again where he is a known risk of abusing children
6054567 it will help both the nato alliance and poland and the united states respond to the coming threats
6054568 missile defense of course is aimed at no one it is in our defense that we do this
6054569 missile defenses including an interceptor base in poland provide a necessary and critical capability that can be used to defend both nations and other nato allies from long range missile threats
6054570 which provides that an armed attack against one nato country shall be considered an armed attack against them all
6054571 the negotiations have sometimes been tough but they have never been unfriendly
6054572 they have sometimes been difficult but they have always been purposeful
6054573 the nation pays tribute to the memory of your 10 comrades
6054574 they fulfilled their duties to the fullest and it cost them their lives which reminds us that being a soldier is a job like no other
6054575 the cause is just it is an honor for france and its armies to defend them
6054576 reinforced with quick reaction forces close air support and mobile medical teams
6054577 why would mccain want to pursue obama past the gates of hell
6054578 bei den restlichen rund 20 prozent sind wir auf dem weg dahin
6054579 die aktuelle vcd auto umweltliste zeigt dass viele fahrzeuge auf dem markt sind die einen akzeptablen verbrauch haben und bei l rm und schadstoffen gut abschneiden autok ufer haben also die wahl wenn sie umweltschonend und sparsam unterwegs sein wollen
6054580 w hrend es gerade mal ein deutsches fabrikat unter die top ten schafft dominieren neun pkw aus deutschland klar die umweltbesten kompaktautos
6054581 wir hatten das fahrzeug in unser umweltranking aufgenommen weil uns die daimler ag verbindlich zugesichert hatte dass der diesel smart ab oktober endlich serienm ig mit einem geschlossenen partikelfilter gegen krankmachenden dieselru ausgeliefert wird
6054582 diese mogelpackung entspricht nicht dem stand der technik und unterl uft den notwendigen schutz der gesundheit insbesondere in ballungsgebieten niemand sollte den diesel smart ohne vollwertigen partikelfilter kaufen
6054583 considering that venue in this case is improperly laid this court has no authority to grant the ancillary as well as the final relief prayed for
6054584 used p889 million of its customers refundable money which should have been put in a trust fund
6054585 its a triumph of justice paving the way for the prosecution of meralco for declaring as income part of the interests earned by the meter and bill deposits of its customers
6054586 significant step towards making meralco accountable criminally and civilly for the misuse of its customers refundable money
6054587 yes it does stem from that its obvious people like what they like and this is part of my psyche
6054588 a little nonsense now and then is relished by the wisest men
6054589 there were lot of clandestine meetings in east london pubs
6054590 we referred to it as plan x it was a bit of a giggle i dont think more than 10 people knew about the idea until the last few days it was totally hush hush but we didnt want to go the whole in rainbows route and give away for free we live in a capitalist world and i do want to get paid and i do want to eat
6054591 i went through a breakup at the end of last year and i guess thats what the records about really i couldnt help thinking about it or talking about it or writing about it i wouldnt want anyone to think its the clich d breakup record but i havent written about true personal experiences all that much in the past
6054592 because it evokes a really great time in a relationship when everything was going right
6054593 you cant always get what you want you cant always get what you want you cant always get what you want but if you try sometimes you just might find you get what you need

6054595 we realise that carols shoes are extremely difficult ones to fill as she has done such an amazing job on countdown over the past 25 years
6054596 however just as we found carol through an ad in a local paper we really hope we can do the same again and find another outstanding mathematical mastermind
6054597 we know many countdown viewers have great heads for numbers so we are looking forward to seeing how talented they really are
6054598 what would be the greatest moral failure in your life
6054599 as far as north cotabato is concerned thats a dead group
6054600 we have received that report based on the intelligence information the group of christians reorganized the ilaga to fight against us their leaders way back in 1970s are still alive
6054601 however i dont think they will prosper they are not popular now there are some christians we know who are against their cause
6054602 we are going to defend our inherent right to self preservation
6054603 it did not come from rep vicente belmonte or me but from the people themselves because they want to protect their lives
6054604 this is how the good and peace loving people in iligan are thinking right now this is something that doesnt need my nod because they are doing it now we have the inherent right to self preservation we dont have to wait or call the police to help us we will protect ourselves
6054605 we dont want to be helpless like those civilians who were butchered strafed torched and properties looted and ransacked we dont want that to happen to us
6054606 you just cant imagine the heightened fear in our hearts we know and we have seen what theyre capable of doing and we dont want to be helpless
6054607 i could not imagine what would happen when we are going to campaign for no to inclusion when that plebiscite comes
6054608 be our protection against the malice and snares of the devil we humbly beseech god to subdue him and you oh prince of the heavenly hosts by the divine power thrust into hell satan and other evil spirits who roam thru the world seeking the ruin of souls amen
6054609 there is a bit of russian in all of us

6054618 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
6054619 when i saw the pictures in the papers i was absolutely baffled
6054620 i thought surely no member of the public is going to believe that a board game could be used as a weapon
6054621 could be used to conceal someones identity or could be used in the course of a criminal act
6054622 a beard can conceal someones identity are the police going to start banning beards
6054623 when we watched the news there was this endless sense of frustration and disbelief that despite the mass marches and protests we were off to war
6054624 we thought it was a ridiculous process that needed to be ridiculed
6054625 the manager of the local borders bookshop in cambridge thought it was a great idea and wanted to trial it
6054626 a day before it was due to appear head office said not to stock it that happened time and time again
6054627 we dont censor our products the game just wasnt selling

6054664 i believe that the reasonable responsible thing for the governor of this state to do is not make any decision before you bring in a team of engineers and scientists and you have someone tell you if the technology is there to do offshore drilling off the coast of north carolina

6054679 our board of directors remains committed to capital preservation during these times of challenging industry conditions and as a sign of that commitment unanimously elected to forego payment to serve on the board the decision to suspend dividends was not taken lightly especially given security banks history of continuous quarterly dividend payments for over eleven years however we believe maintaining a strong capital position is a priority at this time and eliminating our dividend will improve our capital position by conserving approximately 1 0 million of capital per quarter while this decision is difficult we believe it is the best course for our shareholders over the long term our board of directors and executive management who collectively own approximately 30 of security banks outstanding shares are firmly committed to grow long term shareholder value and we expect to resume paying dividends as soon as conditions permit
6054680 nick letztes jahr hast du anl sslich des americas cup in valencia an einem ungew hnlichen dreikampf teilgenommen segeln golfen und motorsport waren die disziplinen in denen du angetreten bist was hat dir am besten gefallen

6054684 ein sport bei dem man gut zu sich selbst finden kann ist ja auch das golfen du spielst schon seit deinem 15 lebensjahr wie oft kommst du momentan dazu
6054685 es kommt nicht h ufig vor aber vielleicht ein bis zweimal ber das jahr gesehen gibt es irgendwo ein event an der rennstrecke oder bei einer charity veranstaltung wo man dann auch hoffentlich zeit hat ich wei gar nicht was ich f r ein eingetragenes handicap habe wenn ich zwei dreimal spiele komme ich vielleicht so auf 20
6054686 die formel 1 war dieses jahr bereits einmal in spanien zu gast in barcelona was ist deiner meinung nach im vergleich dazu das besondere an valencia
6054687 der gr te unterschied ist dass valencia ein stadtkurs sein wird den keiner bis jetzt kennt dementsprechend ist es auch ein rennen auf das ich mich sehr freue weil es neu ist und man einfach nicht wei was einen erwartet das werde ich zu fu abschreiten wenn es geht auch mit dem motorroller oder pkw abfahren und vorher im kopf dann nat rlich einige male durchgehen

6054773 heaven the essentiality of being where everything achieves its full authenticity is already close to us in friendship
6054774 few things are as healing and life giving as is friendship between woman and man man and woman
6054775 a man needs something which is more than friendship and yet is not love as it is generally understood this something nevertheless a woman only can give
6054776 few things are likelier to kill a friendship quicker than a careful and strictly adhered to theory of what qualities are needed in friend
6054777 i do not wish to treat friendships daintily but with the roughest courage when they are real they are not glass threads or frostwork but the solidest things we know
6054778 authentic friendship is notoriously different and inescapably risky true friendships are not relationships we control but adventures we enter into
6054779 it is more important who they are as people and only then it is important who they are as dancers
6054780 there is a love that does not desire to possess it is called friendship when friendship is the determining force in a relationship individuals are able to find themselves and a passion for life not merely lose themselves in love
6054781 in this kingdom the distinctions and barriers between male and female were to be broken down to actualize the potential of any love in this case a male and female love of friendship can be to participate in the building of a kingdom of love spiritual friendships shared by men and women can be eschatological signs
6054782 friendship forms friendship is a much underestimated aspect of spirituality its every bit as significant as prayer and fasting like the sacramental use of water and bread and wine friendship takes what is common in human experience and turns it into something holy

6054797 most men have no interior spirituality they need something outside like a law to kick them to get them going to offer them security to promote them to reward them to make them happy spirituality is a matter of having a source of energy within which is a motivating and directing force for living the man of spirit or the spiritual man if you will is energized by something beyond money sex and power

6054848 i would love to see even more athletes involved in speaking out about not only what i believe in but what they believe in as well
6054849 i think that the games have run with amazing efficiency i believe that the chinese people are warm and have been generally wonderful hosts to the games
6054850 even if there was an athlete that wanted to speak out on issues of human rights he might be silenced by whatever ioc official is mediating that press event
6054851 massive suppression of any voice that the government doesnt want heard
6054852 the chinese governments own voluntary pledges to improve human rights allow public protests and guarantee complete freedom to report made meeting these self set human rights benchmarks one of the tests for a successful olympics
6054853 that is a test that both beijing and the ioc have failed
6054854 may leave in place permanent technological surveillance and monitoring networks that make doing human rights work even more dangerous and difficult for chinese citizens
6054855 the olympics related rights violations well documented in china forced evictions abuse of migrant workers repression of civil society will almost certainly be replayed in russia
6054856 but it could get even uglier in russia journalists are not only harassed they are sometimes murdered
6054857 silent diplomacy is fine but it has to be matched by change on the ground
6054858 if theres no evidence of change you have to back that up with public pressure
6054859 were a sports organization we stay clearly within our role which is to bring sport to host countries
6054860 were not an organization that is best placed or has the capacity to deal with human rights issues
6054861 tibet is part of china the whole world knows that
6054862 the goal for the chinese government is to promote nationalism further
6054863 but ironically the olympic games exposed more social crises than ever like the tibet issue to the chinese people
6054864 in the end they pretty much defined the terms in which the media was going to operate

6054879 if you remove our cables you had better move all the power from the area no one can have it if we are not allowed to have electricity
6054880 there is generally rampant theft of electricity and illegal connections in the sea cow lake area as fast as we replace these cables they are stolen again but unless we police 24 hours a day it will happen wherever there are informal settlements where poor people have not been provided with electricity the temptation to connect illegally is often too great for some
6054881 ultimately the only way to solve electricity theft is to provide everyone with power in their homes but we are improving our patrols and will definitely not sit on our hands and do nothing but unfortunately as cape town has success with these gangs they will move up the coast and as we have success they will move to other areas arrests are the only way of stopping it we will definitely curb it

6054904 im 47 years old isnt that hilarious it makes so much more sense now
6054905 no im 25 people have started younger than me i sometimes have regretted starting late starting at 20 because i could have done it in high school but im glad i got to do normal things when i was young
6054906 i always liked hanging out with adults and getting them to like me in that sketch group rugrats i was in when i was 7 and i was nixon for halloween when i was 10 and that was just to make parents laugh id try to be funny but itd be nonsensical id just parrot things i heard adults say like you need a lawyer id just say expressions
6054907 i grew up with the simpsons and waynes world and everything else but at the same time i was listening to a lot of jack benny and bob amp ray and burns and allen stuff to me i knew the comedy that existed but at the same time part of being an entertainer to me was those guys i dont know how i reconciled that in my mind i watched jack benny but i watched a lot of desi arnez too i watched a lot of i love lucy as a child
6054908 i dont know why id be mature but as far as cadence and ive listened to comedy my whole life and a lot of that was old fashioned entertainers my first thought about being an entertainer was being a bandleader id be a cuban bandleader like desi arnez
6054909 not at all i still really wanted to work in comedy tv film what have you still kind of amorphous stuff
6054910 but i remember my first week at georgetown thinking ive done a lot of theater stuff and comedy and thinking of comedy i should really develop some other interests that first week thinking these four years are going to be spent developing other interests that same hour literally i heard a knock on my door and they said did you hear there are auditions for the improv group and i went and i did it and nick kroll was the director i got it and did nothing else
6054911 there were a couple of open mics and the d c improv is a good club i only started doing stand up the summer before my senior year so i didnt get into the scene down there
6054912 first place i ever did stand up was the b3 in new york in the summer of 2003 the b3 had an open mic on tuesdays and it was hosted by romy rome and nick kroll actually took me there and i watched him and the next week i signed up to do it
6054913 i liked it a lot it felt very good i had a few ideas about what jokes i wanted to write though i think i tried to be very weird the first few times id been on stage though i dont think i knew this stuff at the time but it took me a while
6054914 law and order drag queens and pirates chests now i really speak to whats on peoples minds

6054920 they have a lot of great producers who keep you informed of what theyre going to talk about i recognize more names and things because weve talked about them on the show i follow my fair share of pop culture news but i haven not been one hundy percent engaged with it
6054921 its a funny story i thought it was really funny
6054922 i did it one night at rififi as just a tidbit i mentioned that we did this once and people laughed a lot and i thought wow id forgotten how funny it was id been on the road with mike birbiglia his stand up is really funny threads running through a lot of great stories i think it was after seeing paul f tompkins at bumpershoot i had a lot of personal stories to tell i wanted to put hard jokes into it i didnt want to just tell a yarn
6054923 i think part of it ive had this conversation with pete holmes the goal is to be as funny as we were at 13 so part of it is remembering s that i did when i was 12 or 13

6054972 we have used hct wire saws since the beginning of our manufacturing operations in 2006 and they have continued to demonstrate the performance necessary to deliver high quality cost effective wafers to our customers
6054973 as skypower has demonstrated over the last five years working with first nations and local communities not only provides clean energy results but also establishes more economic benefits directly in the region
6054974 skypower is excited to have formed a partnership with beardys and okemasis first nation
6054975 regardless of the parties there is a certain political intercourse that is thrown in with other broader benefits of future access and gratitude when you become a financier of the conventions
6054976 it is an agreement which will help us to respond to the threats of the 21st century
6054977 we have achieved our main goals which means that our country and the united states will be more secure

6054981 let me tell you first what i wont do i wont hand over my energy policy to my vice president and not know necessarily what hes doing
6054982 my vice president will be a member of the executive branch he wont be one of these fourth branches of government where he thinks hes above the law
6054983 i donated to the obama campaign because i was so excited and thrilled to hear him speak
6054984 i like what he says and i like what he represents and its a world stage today for any political leader
6054985 it was an error of me to give the donation and it was an error that it was accepted
6054986 cpv and siemens have a long standing relationship in the energy business the keenan project is a significant milestone for cpv and will bring a steady supply of renewable energy to oklahoma
6054987 its an opportunity for them to show that they know how to do it
6054988 in this regard a bad choice hurts much more than a good choice helps
6054989 the fact that mccain is a westerner from a nearby state will be offset by the democratic mood of the nation thereby making the race really competitive in the west
6054990 if obamas able to win in these states it will have more to do with national trends against the republican party manifesting themselves than with political and demographic changes on the ground
6054991 that national shift has to be great enough to upset the historical pattern of these states tending to vote republican for president
6054992 we are pleased the university is pursuing an agreement that would make these records publicly available
6054993 the donors only concerns regarding the collection are due to personnel information that could include names confidential salary information and even social security numbers
6054994 just gone through one of the most secretive administrations in our history
6054995 russian citizens are proud that russia came to the defense of the weaker one that it came to the defense of its compatriots that it stopped bloodshed
6054996 georgian president mikhail saakashvili went too far when georgia attacked at night and when peaceful civilians died
6054997 they perceive it as the lesser of the two evils
6054998 the media in the u s reflects the interests of the u s government of the u s imperialists
6054999 gloria featured on russia today television regarding russia georgia war
6055000 say no to war has been justin raimondos slogan for over a decade from the u s intervention in bosnia to the war in iraq and afghanistan now he has denounced u s support for georgia
6055001 for people to suggest that i and the illinois medical society so illinois doctors were somehow in favor of withholding lifesaving support from an infant born alive is ridiculous
6055002 barack obama is so radically pro abortion he supports infanticide
6055003 the suggestion that obama the proud father of two little girls and others who opposed these bills supported infanticide is deeply offensive and insulting
6055004 social entrepreneurs and leading nonprofit organizations that are assisting schools lifting families out of poverty filling health care gaps and inspiring others to lead change in their own communities
6055005 it will be the beginning of the end of her campaign
6055006 i feel momentum is definitely with the democrats moving to november with barack obama at the top of the ticket
6055007 the bottom line is this is going to be a sprint to the end

6055017 we are pleased to be working with a leader like broadwind and confident in its ability to efficiently manufacture high quality durable towers and ensure theyre delivered on time
6055018 upon which side shall the democratic party fight upon the side of the idle holders of idle capital or upon the side of the struggling masses

6055022 ive only had a couple of people say boo back to me
6055023 it still hurts a little that he used the word front runners book said had evolved into what he said was a sincere attempt to get fans at the ballpark to be more positive
6055024 you had some cheers you had some boos i guess
6055025 thats what i said it was pretty much going to be again like i said if we get the win theyll be cheering
6055026 i was speaking for a lot of guys i wasnt just speaking for ryan ryans had his share ive had my share pat burrell has had his share i think chase utley hasnt been touched and hopefully it remains that way
6055027 a lot of times and ive actually heard it they dont want to put their family and kids in a situation where they come to the field and these are the types of things their kids are going to have to sit through and listen to thats just the truth those arent my words those are words that ive actually heard
6055028 but it could have been worse in my opinion i saw people standing up for j roll i heard some claps even though its pretty hard to hear way up here
6055029 im glad i did it im still hoping it catches on some more i mean who knows
6055030 i have been receiving your panama guide com articles via email for a long time and my friend wants to get them as well her email address is snip can you start sending them to her

6055039 we studied the properties of disease causing viruses that evolved to infect mucosal surfaces to engineer a coating that enables our drug delivery particles to penetrate mucus layers in minutes in our new work we have improved the coatings considerably to allow faster penetration for a wider array of particle sizes
6055040 for example we constantly inhale particles into our lungs but they typically stick to mucus rather than penetrate it particles that stick are removed rapidly from the lungs on a mucus conveyor belt and are swallowed and sterilized in the gut mucus barriers protect us from constant infection as well as everyday things like the millions of particles in the black cloud emitted from a bus when it takes off from a stop
6055041 if a particle is small enough and not adhesive then it can get through the mucus net thats how some viruses penetrate mucus barriers
6055042 peg is one of the most widely used polymers for therapeutic applications
6055043 for example cervical cancer patients could locally apply chemo drugs inside mucus penetrating particles which would then deliver the drug locally in the female reproductive tract at efficient concentrations over prolonged periods of time instead of delivering it everywhere else in the body that could drastically reduce the side effects as well as prolong the presence of drugs at the target site
6055044 eventually we seek to engineer systems where a drug could be delivered to a specific tissue or set of cells anywhere in the body we want to make that possible
6055045 the more energy dense a food is the more a person with ear infections likes it you can see what that would do to weight gain
6055046 this finding gives a new environmental component to the obesity problem that allows a possibility of intervention
6055047 we need to study larger numbers of people and do taste testing on them to find out more about this possible connection
6055048 isolated just one milligram a very tiny amount from natural sources that were very difficult to grow
6055049 we needed to develop a concise and efficient synthetic route to make enough largazole for animal studies
6055050 my labs next task was finding the origin of lagarzoles biological activity
6055051 it could be a very good drug candidate for the treatment of various cancers
6055052 large companies are putting together server farms of tens of thousands of computers even approaching 100 thousand and the big challenge is to interconnect all these computers so that they can talk to each other as quickly as possible without incurring significant costs
6055053 we are proposing a new topology for ethernet data center connectivity
6055054 our work addresses the problem of data center network connectivity in a world where consolidation is increasingly taking place in data centers
6055055 the history of computing and technology has an innumerable set of examples where commodity parts take over the functionality of more specialized pieces of equipment
6055056 but that commoditization hasnt taken place on the communications side so we do have these specialized components still living in the network infrastructure that incur significant costs and complexity
6055057 the other issue is that people are treating the data center as a mini internet
6055058 thats fine but they are then forced to use the same components they might use in the wide area network with a bunch of concerns that dont come up in the data center environment adversarial environments attacks parties that might not trust each other etc so you have a lot of functionalities in these specialized switching components that you really dont need in your data center and you wind up paying for it in dollars and in complexity
6055059 independent of whether our technique is successful or someone elses is five years from now switching and communication infrastructure in the datacenter will be based on these small commodity building blocks
6055060 one of the big benefits of our approach is that it scales trivially to 10 gige at the edge whereas competing techniques rely on aggregation to ever faster links to achieve higher speeds
6055061 if you were to go to 10 gige at the edge for servers today you would need to aggregate to 40 gige or 100 gigelinks moving up the tree topology unfortunately the 40gbps ethernet standard isnt even out yet and when it does become available it will be very expensive because were using identical network elements in our topology today 48 port 10 gige ethernet switches are becoming relatively inexpensive so we would scale trivially to that environment as well
6055062 from a cost perspective to build out a 25 000 node cluster today using current techniques with 100 percent bandwidth just the switching equipment would cost somewhere in the order of 28 million whereas with our technique using the identical network elements would deliver the same performance but incur costs of maybe 4 million thats a factor of seven difference
6055063 electrical energy storage is very important for all electrical and electronic systems
6055064 even renewable energy systems like solar cells need somewhere to store excess energy to be used at night
6055065 traditional materials are ceramic materials which have high weight and are very fragile
6055066 matching the permittivity and uniformly dispersing the ceramic nanoparticles is not easy
6055067 both problems have to be tackled and solved at the same time for the material to have the desired characteristics
6055068 instead here is a case where processing is positive in terms of enhancing absorption of lycopene
6055069 what we have found is we can take the red tomato molecular form of lycopene and by processing it and heating it in combination with added oil we can change the shape of the molecule so it is configured in this bent form
6055070 some people like to cook tomato sauce for prolonged periods sometimes reheating it day after day because it tastes better on the second and third day they add fat by using oil or meat and thats going to start to induce cis isomers of lycopene if fat is present and the cooking continues
6055071 so its possible people could induce this process and increase lycopene absorption by routine food preparation procedures as well
6055072 rhodium is used most often for this kind of catalyst and it costs around 9 000 an ounce
6055073 there are many practical issues that need to be resolved before we can use hydrogen as fuel how to make it how to transport it how to create the infrastructure for people to fill their cars with it
6055074 our research lends itself to whats called a distributed production strategy instead of making hydrogen from biofuel at a centralized facility and transporting it to gas stations we could use our catalyst inside reactors that are actually located at the gas stations so we wouldnt have to transport or store the hydrogen we could store the biofuel and make hydrogen on the spot
6055075 precious metals have high catalytic activity and in most cases high stability but theyre also very expensive so our goal from the outset was to come up with a precious metal free catalyst one that was based on metals that are readily available and inexpensive but still highly active and stable so that sets us apart from most of the other groups in the world
6055076 whenever a process works at a lower temperature that brings energy savings and cost savings
6055077 also if the catalyst is highly active and can achieve high hydrogen yields we dont need as much of it that will bring down the size of the reactor and its cost
6055078 first solar has developed into the undisputed cost per watt leader in the solar industry
6055079 produce energy at less than half the cost of its cheapest competitor
6055080 the fund shareholder gets a much more stable ride because of the lending of different approaches
6055081 id say we know our companies better than anyone else
6055082 what have you learned from the pain of past decisions
6055083 the mind of sinful mans death but the mind controlled by the spirit is life and peace
6055084 i would love to see even more athletes involved in speaking out about not only what i believe in but what they believe in as well
6055085 i think that the games have run with amazing efficiency i believe that the chinese people are warm and have been generally wonderful hosts to the games
6055086 the reason i do the work i do on darfur is because of my experience as an olympian i and any other athlete or person of course but this is an olympics story who chooses to speak out about issues of conscience when people are losing their lives has every right to do so that freedom was said to be implicit in the olympic charter and it appears that the ioc and certainly china has no interest in protecting it and that i find outrageous
6055087 im augenblick kann ich etwa vierzig prozent der b cher die mich pers nlich interessieren so abrufen
6055088 wir wollten dass man beim lesen genauso eintaucht wie in ein buch und schnell vergisst dass man ein ger t in der hand hat
6055089 kindle ist revolution r und wird auf dem markt erfolgreich sein
6055090 ich glaube dass der kindle eine chance f r mehr vielfalt ist wenn die verleger erst einmal sein potenzial kapieren
6055091 meine tochter fasst das ger t nicht an die findet so einen schwarzwei bildschirm nur langweilig
6055092 es spielt keine rolle wie gut oder schlecht das produkt ist fakt ist dass die leute keine b cher mehr lesen vierzig prozent der us b rger lesen ein buch oder weniger im jahr das ganze konzept ist zum scheitern verurteilt weil keiner mehr liest
6055093 even if there was an athlete that wanted to speak out on issues of human rights he might be silenced by whatever ioc official is mediating that press event
6055094 massive suppression of any voice that the government doesnt want heard
6055095 the chinese governments own voluntary pledges to improve human rights allow public protests and guarantee complete freedom to report made meeting these self set human rights benchmarks one of the tests for a successful olympics
6055096 that is a test that both beijing and the ioc have failed
6055097 may leave in place permanent technological surveillance and monitoring networks that make doing human rights work even more dangerous and difficult for chinese citizens
6055098 the olympics related rights violations well documented in china forced evictions abuse of migrant workers repression of civil society will almost certainly be replayed in russia
6055099 but it could get even uglier in russia journalists are not only harassed they are sometimes murdered
6055100 silent diplomacy is fine but it has to be matched by change on the ground
6055101 if theres no evidence of change you have to back that up with public pressure
6055102 were a sports organization we stay clearly within our role which is to bring sport to host countries
6055103 were not an organization that is best placed or has the capacity to deal with human rights issues
6055104 tibet is part of china the whole world knows that
6055105 the goal for the chinese government is to promote nationalism further
6055106 but ironically the olympic games exposed more social crises than ever like the tibet issue to the chinese people
6055107 in the end they pretty much defined the terms in which the media was going to operate
6055108 those terms are not the same as in the western world
6055109 the coach called me and aaron mokoena to a meeting in london to outline his vision to the 2010 world cup
6055110 he stated very clearly he expects us to lead the campaign forward
6055111 i told the coach i will be available because i love my country and i always show that in every game i play
6055112 we have a bright future and the way we played against australia showed that we have the talent and direction
6055113 the remaining qualifiers are going to be tough and we need the support of all south africans
6055114 his outstanding contribution and scientific discoveries in the field of novel drug target research in helminth parasites
6055115 there are some exciting developments in the field of microscopy which could have a huge impact in public health including the development of three dimensional ultrastructural imaging which will help interpret more accurately processes taking place inside the cell
6055116 the symposium provides an excellent forum for young researchers to present their data at a conference and were delighted its being held at queens
6055117 es gibt die berechtigte sorge dass leute die nur vor dem computer hocken dick werden
6055118 he can talk all he wants about britney spears and paris hilton but i dont have time for that mess
6055119 one of the things that we have to change in this country is the idea that people cant disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism i have never suggested that sen mccain picks his positions on national security based on politics or personal ambition i have not suggested it because i believe that he genuinely wants to serve americas national interest now its time for him to acknowledge that i want to do the same
6055120 let me be clear i will let no one question my love of this country
6055121 barack obama has made it clear that unconditional withdrawal in iraq is more important to him than victory in iraq thats not a criticism of his patriotism thats a criticism of his judgment
6055122 we failed to head off this conflict and lost leverage in our ability to contain it because our leaders have been distracted our resources overstretched and our alliances frayed
6055123 we must not allow russia to believe it has a free hand to engage in policies that undermine georgian sovereignty
6055124 no country not even russia has recognized the claims of abkhaz and south ossetian leaders to independence yet through its latest moves russia is furthering its policy of de facto annexation that undermines security and stability in the region
6055125 unfortunately russias leaders have chosen a course of confrontation rather than cooperation

6055131 each to each a looking glass reflects the other that doth pass
6055132 measuring ones soul by the tape of a world that looks on in amused contempt and pity
6055133 there can be no business as usual with russia under present circumstances
6055134 this is the next frontier in assuring workplaces are safe
6055135 its not just for me but for the people you drive
6055136 we feel our health benefits and sick leave benefits are competitive and we feel good about it
6055137 very often these are the jobs where people are living very close to the bone
6055138 workers are sometimes putting their jobs on the line because they have a sick child or are sick
6055139 if we live in a society where all adults are working then we need to have a workplace to accommodate that reality
6055140 theres been some concern that employees are abusing the ordinance theres been a little bit of that but not as widespread as people thought at the beginning
6055141 i donated to the obama campaign because i was so excited and thrilled to hear him speak
6055142 i like what he says and i like what he represents and its a world stage today for any political leader
6055143 it was an error of me to give the donation and it was an error that it was accepted
6055144 consistently review our procedures to make sure that we are taking every reasonable step to ensure that the contributions we receive are appropriate and follow fec guidelines and we will do so again in light of this new information
6055145 were always looking for ways to best comply with all provisions of campaign finance regulations and obviously take swift action anytime flags are raised regarding potentially problematic campaign contributions
6055146 because i could see it wasnt going anywhere if i didnt do that
6055147 i wouldnt give up because i believe in the man i really do
6055148 maybe i just feel he can put a smile back on the face of the world
6055149 yeah i like it dont leave the house in it
6055150 i saw you mowed the grass in the front probably wore what youre wearing to do it dont do that again either
6055151 an agreement in principle has been reached between om and sunderland for the loan of djibril cisse to the english club until the end of the season
6055152 i have been given an amazing talent and i am just thankful i can go out and perform
6055153 my coach said that the race would be won in the last 50
6055154 he said people will start dying and he knows i wont die in the last 50 that is how i run and it works for me it is not about being the fastest person the greatest person but who has got the greatest will if you are going to beat me you are going to have to fight me very hard
6055155 how do you manage to peak at the right moments
6055156 i had not slept for the last two nights the pressure was getting to me after the semi final i was thinking i could win it but the closer it came you get scared if i dont win what is going to happen
6055157 it is literally on my doorstep and 15 minutes away from where my parents live and where i was brought up and have lived all my life
6055158 in 18 years of broadcasting alma college athletics there has not been one bump in the road
6055159 there has not been a season sport or coach who has not bent over backwards to be helpful that to me has meant as much as anything
6055160 sometimes in working day to day with individuals you lose track of the quality of the individuals you are dealing with that has been the case here
6055161 the coaches and all the people associated with alma college athletics are class acts
6055162 i used to ride my bike on the clay tennis courts where the heather room in the tyler van dusen campus center now sits
6055163 as a 7 year old i sold popcorn at old bahlke field to make money
6055164 the 30 years has been extremely rewarding and i have lots of memories and stories
6055165 one that made me especially proud to be associated with alma college was the first time the football team went to wittenberg the team was staying in a nice hotel and was having breakfast coach cole was standing at the cash register making some arrangements when the waitress came up and told him that this was the most well behaved football team she had seen in the 20 years she had worked there over the years that has impressed me more than anything else
6055166 the first game was at western georgia and we couldnt make the trip the only game we couldnt originate with our broadcast crew
6055167 we used western georgias crew which with their southern accents and idiosyncrasies was a stitch to listen to
6055168 how to be green many people have asked us this important question its really very simple and requires no expert knowledge or complex skills heres the answer consume less share more enjoy life

6055173 es gibt nichts was es nicht auch als brot geben kann
6055174 a lot of the procedural issues necessary for instant replay to be implemented need to be worked out
6055175 major league baseball needs to step up to the plate and iron out these issues
6055176 im not going to go through these one by one i will tell you that on a number of them the comments are simply not accurate
6055177 for example weve had an understanding with the wua for some time that the crew chief and the crew chief only would be the one responsible for reviewing the video and making the decision on instant replay
6055178 there are other issues that remain to be worked out it is my general policy that i dont comment when im trying to bargain but i remain confident that were gong to be able to make a deal
6055179 thus there will be a lack of transparency and obviousness for the public as to what is going on when instant replay is under way
6055180 there may be situations where the umpires will have to leave the field in shifts so that everyone can view the video while leaving the requisite number of umpires on the field
6055181 this could create a laurel and hardy effect and may cause delay of game problems
6055182 he doesnt trust the teams to behave themselves in their absence
6055183 the umpires raised concerns and brought potential problems to solomons attention at least six weeks ago
6055184 even though theres a sense that gas prices have topped off perceptions of the economy are not based on one thing alone theres a funk
6055185 i just got sick of paying the damned oil bill
6055186 the higher the efficiency the more its going to cost you but the more youre going to save
6055187 to tell the customer that you should convert for price would not be fair if we find that price of natural gas goes up
6055188 it may be close at some point to the price of oil
6055189 theres an enormous amount of interest from people wanting to change from oil to gas
6055190 anybody that has age on their system and its just a matter of time to change it out anyway those are the ones really benefiting by doing something now
6055191 a lot of heat was just going up the chimney
6055192 i didnt want to risk not being able to get it
6055193 i trust the availability of gas more than i do oil
6055194 do not look to my neck for a collar for you will not find one but if you look to my heart you will see who owns me
6055195 its a film that is rewriting the record books every day redefining our notions of what a blockbuster can be
6055196 the first weekend there was this huge pent up demand and eagerness by audiences to see this movie
6055197 nolan turns the manichean morality of comic books pure good vs pure evil into a bleak post 9 11 allegory about how terror and make no mistake ledgers joker is a terrorist breaks down those reassuring moral categories
6055198 there seems to me no question that the dark knight is at some level a paean of praise to the fortitude and moral courage that has been shown by george w bush in this time of terror and war

6055201 takes the viewer on a sometimes traumatic but ultimately redemptive and humanistic journey towards a post 9 11 ethic
6055202 warns against abandoning our principles out of fear grief and hatred as well as abdicating our moral agency to external authorities both of which comprised the hallmark moral syndrome of the years following 9 11
6055203 what batman is doing is heroic but it can be seen as vigilantism as a dark force outside the law
6055204 thats a very very dangerous road to go down hes always riding a knife edge in moral terms
6055205 anarchy and chaos even the threat of anarchy and chaos are the most frightening things society faces especially in this day and age

6055270 when they fail to report cases of corruption to the authorities how can the cases be investigated and the culprits brought to book

6055277 the russians are clearly not withdrawing in full as they promised
6055278 in fact there continue to be reports of them entering cities holding up ports refusing to let people move along highways asking for russian visas from people and so clearly the russian president has not kept his promise to abide by the terms of the ceasefire

6055290 he was just waking up to the thought that women around the country were upset over the treatment of hillary
6055291 the kind of language he uses and the kind of behavior he exhibits in the public domain toward women objectifies them and leads to bad things for our society and to domestic violence
6055292 our long term goal is to cultivate and groom women to run for public office at all levels of government including the presidency
6055293 the first order of business for our group is to persuade candidates for the presidency senate and house to incorporate a number of womens rights goals and policies into their platforms
6055294 its not that the new agenda doesnt view choice as a central womens issue its that roe v wade has been used a single defining issue to hold women voters hostage in the past there are many other issues that are important and relevant to a broad spectrum of women
6055295 its kind of a tightrope act sometimes but he has the ability to make pitches
6055296 he had some power on his fastball there were just a lot of men on base and only two of them scored it wasnt that easy it was five innings and a lot of work but because we scored runs its a win

6055307 my husbands siblings said i should take money for driving him around and everything else i did but i didnt want to do that
6055308 i wasnt comfortable taking that extra money but i dont disapprove of it
6055309 whether its a friendly or hostile situation families do squabble over it
6055310 a lot of times the siblings that arent taking care of the parent contribute money and thats their contribution to the care
6055311 its one of the most stressful things you can do
6055312 theres a recent study that showed even three years after the person being cared for has passed away the caregiver still has higher levels of stress than normal

6055315 survivors can do it after the death but its like signing a contract among themselves and it would be a rather complex document
6055316 but theres nowhere for it to come from in our case
6055317 we havent discussed the financial arrangement in any level of detail

6055327 i still had this idea that there was a whole world of marvelous golden people somewhere as far ahead of me as the seniors at rye when i was in sixth grade people who knew everything instinctively who made their lives work out the way they wanted without even trying who never had to make the best of a bad job because it never occurred to them to do anything less than perfectly the first time sort of heroic super people all of them beautiful and witty and calm and kind and i always imagined that when i did find them id suddenly know that i belonged among them that i was one of them that id been meant to be one of them all along and everything in the meantime had been a mistake and theyd know it too id be like the ugly duckling among the swans its a thing i wouldnt wish on anybody its the most stupid ruinous kind of self deception there is and it gets you into nothing but trouble

6055336 los cuartos de final te pueden marcar injustamente el resultado del campeonato si te quedas o te vas para tu casa as que ahora estamos contentos por el resultado y ya pensando en la semifinal
6055337 jugamos con mucha intensidad defensiva y eso nos quit presi n en ataque porque sab amos que pod amos estar m s o menos acertados que atr s est bamos cubiertos estuvimos a tope desde el comienzo
6055338 hemos conseguido un buen trabajo atr s con mucha concentraci n en ataque no estuvimos a la misma altura el nivel fue un poco inferior a la defensa pero el equipo ha jugado bien en l neas generales

6055377 of course i hope to win another medal at the beijing olympics but no match will be easy
6055378 although winning a medal in the singles will be very difficult because of china we will try our best
6055379 weve had silver before we dont want silver anymore we are going for the gold and well get it it doesnt matter who we are playing brazil or argentina we want the gold and we have the players to get it
6055380 i told you that we were changing players trying to get some balance in the team you saw how rough it was in the first two to three matches now we are getting somewhere we are striking some rhythm and the boys are determined

6055382 i dont want to compare the two sides i can only say that the atlanta team had great players who had experience and here i have great players who are young and determined they have done well and gold is within reach we cant go without it we are ready to play against any team
6055383 he had worked so hard and i wanted to allow him some rest before i knew what was happening he scored that great goal
6055384 if you have good players you can change at will we kept changing to find the balance now we are getting somewhere that place is where the gold is
6055385 we watched their games and found out about their left midfielder and what he does with the ball so we took care of him he moussa is fast on the break and good in taking chances we played sani kaita on him and that worked
6055386 we won because of our togetherness hard work and because the music our fans were playing in the stadium gave us power from god
6055387 we deserved it the weather here is hard to play in its not african weather it feels good to win a medal but i think we still have a chance to be the number one

6055413 i wish to remind that in accordance with the fifa standards statutes to which the nfa statutes conform and to which the npl statutes must conform elections are only due after the the current chairman has served a four year term may we also remind that the election of the current chairman was done in accordance with the fifa roadmap which culminated in the nfa elections on the 28th of october 2006 and as such part of that process
6055414 this so called fifa roadmap is just a guidance document and not a constitution as such and worse still it has nothing to do with the business of the npl because our constitution is very clear in this regard and as far as we are concerned the term of the current executive is coming to an end on the 30th of this month

6055435 many if not most people take vacations to other cities in order to experience their restaurants theatres parks and other amenities

6055486 mail from people im meeting with in the next 2 days
6055487 in order to realistically examine what apple might do with its 20 billion dollars one has to look at steve jobs stated goals from the past plus the biggest threats to apple in the future those two elements are good candidates for assessing how apple might spend some of that money in the grandest sense
6055488 i went back and looked at some of the most high profile goals steve jobs has had is his career also there is one significant unstated goal ill get to below those high profile goals are 1 move on to the next big thing 2 be like sony should have been
6055489 i believe mr jobs most significant unstated goal is to prove in the end that his original and continuing vision for personal computing is qualitatively superior to that of bill gates the problem in the past was that people like john sculley and michael spindler almost pissed it all away before steve jobs could fully implement his vision
6055490 the solution to many of apples potential problems the public relations disaster of indentured chinese laborers the threat of a disrupted delivery supply line and the ability of apple to make inexpensive consumer electronics reminiscent of sonys heyday well into the future is you guessed it to build their own completely automated computerized plant that can assemble these products without a human hand ever touching them
6055491 in the end however the real goal is to make exciting products that cost less to make than the competition could ever achieve when combined with the next generation apple products that use a gesture language instead of mice apple could surge far ahead of the competition and achieve mr jobs goals apple would be creating dazzling and beautiful consumer electronics that no one else on the planet can touch in price or technical vision
6055492 an apple factory or two in the right place costing several billions would be a worthy endeavor for apple and its cash
6055493 actually i was going to use it within the first five minutes of walking in there and seeing them

6055498 especially in the winter when i go down in the basement to get the jars its a nice feeling
6055499 so many things are unknown with the way food is produced that it feels really good to keep control of it
6055500 it fits with what weve seen historically from the 1970s and even before then when people tighten their belts they focus a little bit less on convenience items and convenience foods and focus a little bit more on staying home and making their own whether youre talking about food or fun
6055501 the straw that broke the camels back was the economy
6055502 but the underlying reason is healthier food were tired of food that has tons of sodium preservatives and all the nasty stuff they put in food that you dont have to be eating
6055503 what i hear is the words the economy and weve started growing a garden because we dont know whats going to happen to the economy in the future
6055504 if i had 1 000 acres i dont think i would have been able to accommodate all the phone calls i had

6055605 thousands of young people on princes trust schemes support their community every year with many actively volunteering to help older age groups there are young people across the uk with energy and enthusiasm that if harnessed could be a powerful force for change
6055606 older people clearly have an important role to play in their communities and many already give much of their time and expertise to others as grandparents carers and volunteers negative ageist stereotypes often disappear when different generations come together and learn to understand and appreciate each other breaking down barriers in this way undoubtedly lays the ground for building stronger communities

6055648 forget all that u s attorney indictment fiasco its over and obviously most people agree and forget about colm connolly getting a federal judgeship thats just as over
6055649 unlike coons gordon is actually a likable guy to total strangers and it shows on the campaign trail
6055650 could i say something here junior just a sentence or two
6055651 its the wrong time and wrong place for gordon to run watch for coons to trot out the desperation gordon freebery ads any day now itll kill gordon and put him on the defensive again
6055652 i dont care what you media people say gordon has the people coons raised property taxes twice the sewer tax imposed a license fee on the smallest of county businesses contractors and cut the tax break for senior citizens thats a formula for election disaster
6055653 we have had a pretty good prosperous time with low unemployment

6055663 i cant think of a more appropriate time or place to hold the world premiere of this film than in the middle of the obama media frenzy that will be the democratic convention
6055664 obama palooza is going to be more of a rock concert than a serious political event and that is exactly the phenomenon that hype cuts through to get to the past politics and policies that have propelled this freshman senator to the world stage
6055665 well theres two divisions in junior pee wee and the luck of the draw put us in the tougher division
6055666 one of the teams we play was undefeated last year and another was 8 1 its going to be a tough one but so was last year we beat a lot of good teams last year
6055667 i think we have the talent to be pretty competitive this year i think were going to surprise a lot of people again this year
6055668 some cities like carson or reno or sparks have more than one team and theyve got teams with 30 or 25 kids
6055669 obviously with 18 kids were only going to have one team we always could use more players id like to get about 22 that would be nice
6055670 we really need some players the problem is some kids take vacations on the weekend and that hurts us
6055671 last year we had to forfeit a game we dont want to forfeit any games this year
6055672 then you go from there if you lose youre done
6055673 the quality of the shows is excellent and the acting talent is far beyond the talent that weve ever seen on that stage before
6055674 weve been able to get a nice variety of actors and i think that has enhanced the performances
6055675 i think running into some challenges is something that happens any time you take over a huge endeavor
6055676 the directors had to learn an entirely new venue and thats a challenge as well
6055677 the talent this year is remarkably better than in previous years
6055678 we are very fortunate to be setting some foundations now for upcoming years
6055679 weve seen a tremendous audience response to a midsummer nights dream and its modern interpretation and cambio due to its impressive and moving original musical score that adding the additional performances is a natural extension to our successful season

6055684 he did not say who stabbed him before falling unconscious
6055685 he picked an arbitrary house knowing he could never make it back to where he was staying

6055687 the same treacherous and demonic immorality that was pervasive in ancient sodom has arisen again in the newly resurrected sodomic gay communities around the united states i have lived through six years inside of the gay community of hillcrest as a committed christian and i am a sure witness that sodom has in fact resurrected itself

6055695 but we do anyway and at every chance we get
6055696 we were devastated we didnt know what to do we didnt know how to help
6055697 i dont think were closer now than we were before to tell you the truth when something like that happens were going to stick together but weve always stuck together
6055698 and now obviously he needs a lot of help from us but i think the biggest help we can give him is going out there and trying as hard as we can

6055729 i just got home and was sitting on my backyard porch when i heard sirens coming up us highway 395
6055730 there sounded like a lot and they were really close after that i heard a bunch of popping noises and went out of my front door to see the flames they were so high
6055731 they tell you to remember to have a baggy with pictures and important documents in it in case of something like this but you dont even think of that
6055732 it was the first time ive ever seen uncontrollable destruction like that
6055733 when i left the flames were taller than trees and you could just feel this wave of heat that was pushed by the wind
6055734 what the board did was adopt the fire code and all sections published in those documents
6055735 so we needed to work in conjunction with the nevada state fire marshal to see if we could delete any of those sections
6055736 this is something we wanted to do so we can fall in line with our neighbors around the basin
6055737 but we still encourage anyone using open flame cooking devices to use caution and follow any manufacturers warnings
6055738 i think having this type of public forum is extremely helpful to disseminate all the misinformation as well as provide the facts on how it the town would work

6055774 the russians are clearly not withdrawing in full as they promised
6055775 in fact there continue to be reports of them entering cities holding up ports refusing to let people move along highways asking for russian visas from people and so clearly the russian president has not kept his promise to abide by the terms of the ceasefire
6055776 there can be no business as usual with russia under present circumstances

6055834 three of the suspects including an exco were detained immediately after allegedly accepting rm100 000 in return for expediting the application process for a housing project worth rm180 million

6055836 on august 16 the freezer containing the alleged corpse arrived with the searching for bigfoot team
6055837 the ice was being thawed slowly and the following day we were up early to discover that some hair was now exposed i extracted some from the alleged corpse examined it and had some concerns
6055838 within the next hour of thaw a break appeared up near the feet area
6055839 as the team and i began examining this area near the feet i observed the foot which looked unnatural reached in and confirmed it was a rubber foot
6055840 later that day we were informed that mr whitton and mr dyer had admitted it was a costume
6055841 we have spoken with other vets in our acquaintance and they likewise had never encountered anything like this
6055842 we began to realise that we had something very special as a result he has been an indoor cat and has a chip installed in case he gets lost

6055846 most people dont know what the term carbon footprint really means
6055847 but we hope this will be a launch pad for other companies to take part and increase public awareness
6055848 this is an interesting merger in that the new company will be a supplier to all the big mobile companies except motorola
6055849 in a business where scale matters the complementary product portfolios contributed by the parent companies will deliver significant scale and synergies
6055850 here they ericsson are in an instant creating a business with a critical mass and a market leading position within mobile platforms and at the same time focusing on the core operations
6055851 this type of streamlining is of course positive and i dont think we should rule out that we will see more of this
6055852 actually this possible negative effect of opioids such as morphine to cause increased sensitivity to pain was observed in the 19th century
6055853 id say this is the most fundamental change weve made ever to the marketplace
6055854 consumers are voting with their wallets and saying auctions arent really the way i want to buy cosmetics or something like that
6055855 very opportunistic but also in line with what their customers are telling them they want
6055856 this will be viewed as ebay continues to push paypal down everyones throat

6055894 this a flotation might have been a good way to realise funds but for various practical reasons an ipo was not deemed appropriate
6055895 in the aftermath of that becoming public we did receive several approaches thats because the norwegian business is highly attractive but our board has said on two separate occasions its strong preference is ownership of the norwegian business
6055896 to lose yourself as if you no longer existed to cease completely to experience yourself to reduce yourself to nothing is not a human sentiment but a divine experience

6055898 its easy to ignore 3 or 5 percent votes but its pretty hard to ignore 22 percent votes or 39 percent votes
6055899 that proposal was rejected by stockholders however the company elected to prepare a report simply because it had been a timely issue
6055900 the chairman thought it was the right thing to do at the time
6055901 it just doesnt seem to us that there is a whole lot of value to shareholders to do a study to tell them what they already know
6055902 when it takes to producing clean power were determined to make new york the number one city in the nation
6055903 it would be a thing of beauty if when lady liberty looks out on the horizon she not only welcomes new immigrants to our shores but lights their way with a torch powered by an ocean wind farm
6055904 the best that can be said about these ideas is that theyre pandering
6055905 far worse theyre distractions from the deadly serious business of creating a new national energy policy
6055906 theres a whole set of factors that go into the ultimate cost of energy
6055907 junior doctors are the people in hospitals most likely to prescribe medication and they are also the most likely to make errors in prescribing
6055908 we found that in all their training junior doctors learn about diseases and symptoms and what drugs to prescribe but they werent really taught about how to tailor those to individual patients such as dosage and frequency and this is where most errors occur
6055909 it really was a case of the pen being mightier than the scalpel
6055910 we dont let junior doctors operate on patients by themselves but we were letting them prescribe medication without proper training
6055911 we developed a safe prescribing training program that has been part of the training for all final year medical students at uq since 2006
6055912 parts of our program have also been adopted by the national prescribing service
6055913 we also developed a standardised medication chart that has been adopted by queensland health and implemented across all of its 108 facilities across the state as well as being rolled out nationally
6055914 no other country in the world has such a system of standardised charts and we are hoping to share our work around the world
6055915 while we will never eradicate mistakes completely these developments have seen a significant drop in prescribing errors
6055916 how do you win a war that is militarily unwinnable
6055917 obviously pulling out would be the worst of all outcomes but the solution can only be political even if that requires military supremacy the courage of soldiers demands the intelligence of politicians
6055918 even though the toll is so high you should be proud of what you are doing
6055919 theres been wide consensus for a long time in france that when the right times come the army must be used even if the price to pay for that will be the loss of soldiers
6055920 once the shock of these deaths eases people wont ask whether we can stand the losses we obviously can nor will it be whether this is a legitimate and important war for global stability it is debate will focus on how we get down to business and map out a way to beat an enemy that is very clearly getting stronger
6055921 as france moves closer to the inner circle of nato and especially after the new american administration is in place next year impatience and urgency will quickly grow to develop a clear political and strategic plan for afghanistan
6055922 sarkozy knows the risk in france isnt of people deciding this was a bad war after all instead its people getting fed up with not winning the damned thing and giving up on it
6055923 what you end up with is a very thick wall that is mostly made of air
6055924 but this kind of thing just makes me feel so honored to be recognized by people who empower kids who encourage them to just excel and not be held back by what society thinks
6055925 one of the makeup artists at pushing daises was like whats your next album gonna be
6055926 he was like how about for the gays i was like genius that is going to be the title of my next album for the gays
6055927 what government should be focused on is raising the incomes and the aspirations and the opportunities for the millions of people who are stuck on low incomes and that is where this government has failed not because they are bad people not because they dont have noble ambitions but because their measure which is entirely reliant on the state which is about redistribution has failed failed on their own terms
6055928 our education system is failing to spread opportunity our welfare system is keeping people out of work our tax system makes it extremely difficult for those on low incomes to get off those low incomes because those marginal tax rates are so high
6055929 labour has failed it has created a more unfair society and i think there is a real opportunity for the conservative party now to lead this debate
6055930 we will keep tax credits but we will add to the battle on poverty other things like welfare reform like extending educational opportunity like supporting families and these conservative methods of achieving progressive goals are likely to be far more successful and create a fairer society
6055931 at the moment borrowing is rising and thats a real issue
6055932 the truth is gordon browns old fashioned leftist idea that only the state can guarantee fairness has led to a decade of top down state control policies that have made our country less fair
6055933 first it was change then it was aspiration and earlier this year it was all about government being on your side
6055934 now were told before its even started that the next gordon brown relaunch will be about fairness

6055941 he hasnt done a lot of training he has been involved in a lot of small sided games and other aspects of training to play a competitive game is different
6055942 its good to have a proper look at him we will just keep an eye on him over the next few weeks and see how it progresses
6055943 if you think about it neither of them has played a full match for quite some considerable time
6055944 that was their first 45 minutes and they have both come through it ok
6055945 i thought lee and luis were the best two players on the pitch by a distance
6055946 they were both very good and their attitude and fitness was good bow created a lot of things
6055947 luis scored two so it was a good run out for us
6055948 e came here for a medal but we must face the defeat peacefully and have a good attitude argentina continued with their tough style and played well

6055983 but even if he does not win anything i will still be happy for him because he has worked really hard to reach where he is right now
6055984 renny has always said that he wanted to be the next ato boldon in terms of achievements and he is working hard towards achieving it

6055987 yes sasha had to get blood every month because of her low blood count but she wasnt a sickly child she was always playing and jumping she was healthy and never let her condition keep her down
6055988 the minister is lying and the only thing i can do is put the death certificate on his desk so he can see for himself he really doesnt know what is going on
6055989 i am maintaining that there is no dengue outbreak based on the definition based on the number of confirmed cases and based on my technical teams information to me but i will admit that there is a high incidence of mosquitoes that is a fact and that is the result of global warming and the amount of rainfall and other factors
6055990 we have had no confirmed deaths from dengue from 2003 to now is it possible that one can occur anything is possible so far based on the cmos chief medical officer information to me there have been no confirmed deaths
6055991 i went to the final awards committee meeting and they really pulled all resources together to ensure that the results were ready they took a lot of markers to correct the scripts and pulled out all stops to ensure that the papers were marked and results delivered on time
6055992 there was no impact on the students performances based on the excellent results and we are now looking at the number of scholarships given the ministers statements yesterday
6055993 i want justice and i want the government to do something about the spate of murders because the lives of innocent persons are being snuffed out
6055994 nouns may be verbalized or verbs nominalized simply by bringing the stem into a suitable rhythmic form most of the rhythmic patterns call for a tri consonantal stem if a stem is di consonantal in its primary form a consonant usually the glottal stop is added to give it the proper structure often in the course of forming derivatives stems that are too long are forced into one or the other of the regular patterns they are cut down by the loss of quantity or of vowels or consonants as may be necessary
6055995 i saw what looked like fire falling before me and then i felt pain in my arms stomach all over
6055996 i then blacked out and when i regained consciousness i was in the hospital
6055997 when i approached the scene and knelt close to the lady i observed that she was breathing i then used a piece of wood which i found nearby and with the help of other members of the public was able to extricate the woman from the lines
6055998 we then had the assistance of a policeman who transported the lady to the port of spain general hospital
6055999 we have launched an investigation to determine how the lines burst and this will be conducted by the northern distribution area of ttec and the safety department
6056000 jamaicas position has been quite clear with regards to a political union
6056001 historically we have said that we will fully participate in a caribbean single market and economy but however we are not interested in a political union at all that has been our position and we will maintain that position
6056002 the decision of some caricom countries to establish a political union has implications for the structure and indeed the future of caricom the government of jamaica will request that the issue be brought for discussions at the highest level of caricom jamaicas position will be evaluated based on those discussions
6056003 we would like to know a little bit more about what is being proposed in this political union and we are looking to have this discussion at the highest level which is at a head of government meeting of caricom because we would like to know what this will mean with regards to the future of caricom
6056004 we would love to know what is being proposed how this will affect the structure of caricom and from there we will evaluate jamaicas position within the structure of caricom and within the structure of the caribbean
6056005 we dont know if this is something that has been discussed with the opposition parties in these countries
6056006 in my mind something like this needs consensus both in the opposition party and also government because who is in the government now could be in the opposition years from now and we dont know if they would reverse what was established
6056007 we are not opposed to a countrys freedom in doing what they think will be best and to do what they think will be in the interest of their country jamaica reserves the right to do the same thing for our country

6056030 there is of course only one apostolic gospel as paul emphasized so that he could call down gods judgment on anybody who preaches a different gospel yet the apostles presented it in a wide variety of ways now sacrificial the shedding and sprinkling of christs blood now messianic the breaking in of the new age or of gods promised rule now mystic receiving and enjoying eternal life being in christ now legal the righteous judge pronouncing the unrighteous righteous now personal the father reconciling his wayward children now salvific the heavenly liberator coming to the rescue of his oppressed people and leading them out into a new exodus and now cosmic the universal lord claiming universal dominion over the powers and these seven are only a selection

6056053 these systems focus on the three areas that are most likely to affect application consolidation performance they have lots of processor cores lots of ram and lots of network bandwidth
6056054 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
6056055 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
6056056 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
6056057 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
6056058 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
6056059 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
6056060 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
6056061 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6056062 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6056063 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6056064 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
6056065 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
6056066 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
6056067 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6056068 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6056069 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6056070 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6056071 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6056072 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
6056073 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
6056074 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
6056075 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
6056076 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6056077 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6056078 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6056079 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6056080 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6056081 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6056082 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
6056083 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
6056084 filmmaker zhang yimou the ceremonys director insisted in an interview with local media that suffering and sacrifice were required to pull off the aug 8 opening which involved wrangling nearly 15 000 cast and crew only north korea could have done it better he said

6056093 wirtschafts und arbeitsminister martin bartenstein hat mit den sozialpartnern ein umfassendes jugendbesch ftigungspaket verhandelt das zur g nze bereits seit 1 juli 2008 umgesetzt ist
6056094 ich habe bundesminister bartenstein bereits anfang august auf dieses erschreckende szenario aufmerksam gemacht trotz der eindeutigen rechtslage wonach das wirtschaftsministerium hier die letztverantwortung trifft hat er jede verantwortung an der kritik des rechnungshofs abgestritten und steckt in dieser schwer bedenklichen angelegenheit den kopf in den sand
6056095 um geeignete ma nahmen zu beraten damit der sterreichische arbeitsmarkt in den vollen genuss der zustehenden esf mittel kommt
6056096 in zeiten des umbruchs immer mit augenma auf n tige ver nderungen und erneuerungen reagiert
6056097 dieser gro en verantwortung gestellt und alle aufgaben und herausforderungen sehr gut gemeistert es ist ihm gelungen mehrerau zu einem pastoralen und p dagogischen zentrum von berregionaler bedeutung zu machen
6056098 m sse es f r besonders verwerfliche taten bei entsprechender reife des jugendlichen auch harte strafrechtliche konsequenzen geben
6056099 deshalb ist diese schwarze interpretation durch die rosarote brille ein selbstbel gen sondergleichen man m sse das problem gerade im sinne der jugend anpacken und nicht den r ckgang bei den verurteilungen als einen r ckgang der kriminalit t verkaufen
6056100 diese eigenartige interpretation des zahlenmateriales durch das innenministerium so kurz vor der wahl ist nicht nur besonders durchsichtig sondern aufgrund der problemverharmlosung gef hrlich f r jene kr fte die sich der problembehebung annehmen sollen
6056101 die heutigen jugendlichen werden berwiegend fr her reif und sind sich ihrer handlungen durchwegs bewusst
6056102 es ist n tig ihnen vor augen zu f hren dass eine strafbare handlung kein spa ist
6056103 das ist aber nur m glich wenn vorher eine strafrechtliche verantwortlichkeit gegeben ist
6056104 als jugendsprecher des bz allemal lieber ist einen jugendlichen rechtzeitig vor einer strizzi karriere zu bewahren und daf r seinen groll auf sich zu nehmen als die

6056107 eine f hrende mitarbeiterin eines unabh ngigen forschungsinstitutes sollte besser aufpassen nicht ins fahrwasser eines sp wahlkampfes zu geraten dessen einer schwerpunkt die wiedereinf hrung der unter sp finanzminister lacina zu recht abgeschafften verm genssteuer ist

6056110 ohne sie w re die arbeit des wei en rings in dieser form nicht m glich viele menschen w ren mit ihren problemen und sorgen allein w ssten nicht wohin sie sich wenden sollten
6056111 das innenministerium und die polizei werden jedenfalls ihren weg der konsequenten kriminalit tsbek mpfung fortsetzen und neue strategien und methoden entwickeln und wir werden selbstverst ndlich weiterhin den wei en ring im rahmen des m glichen unterst tzen
6056112 es bleibt dabei acht von zehn lehrlingen in n berichten von rechtlichen bertretungen in den betrieben
6056113 tatkr ftiges anpacken der kritikpunkte ist die bessere strategie f r die jungen menschen in nieder sterreich gerne in gewohnt sozialpartnerschaftlicher weise gemeinsam mit der wirtschaftskammer
6056114 die gestrige alarmmeldung ist hieb und stichfest es tut auch uns weh solche zahlen ver ffentlichen zu m ssen aber es ist wie es ist acht von zehn lehrlingen in nieder sterreich berichten nun einmal von arbeits oder jugendschutzrechtlichen bertretungen in ihren betrieben das muss man besorgt zur kenntnis nehmen und damit arbeiten
6056115 die summe von ber 270 000 euro die wir im letzten jahr f r nieder sterreichs lehrlinge und damit die zukunft des bundeslandes zur ckgeholt haben sprechen eine deutliche sprache und sind weit von jedem populismus entfernt
6056116 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6056117 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
6056118 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
6056119 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
6056120 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6056121 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6056122 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
6056123 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6056124 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
6056125 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6056126 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6056127 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6056128 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6056129 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6056130 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6056131 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6056132 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6056133 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
6056134 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
6056135 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
6056136 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
6056137 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
6056138 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
6056139 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
6056140 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
6056141 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
6056142 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
6056143 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
6056144 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6056145 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6056146 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6056147 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
6056148 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6056149 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
6056150 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6056151 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6056152 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
6056153 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
6056154 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6056155 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6056156 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6056157 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort

6056227 dont be fooled by the headlines as gas prices lifted nominal sales but controlling for price effects unmasks a sharp decline in the volume of sales
6056228 the canadian consumer spent more in dollar terms during june but bought less with their money in terms of the volume of goods and services
6056229 this adds to the rapidly deteriorating picture in terms of canadian economic fundamentals
6056230 depressed confidence sagging job markets and cooling wealth gains are taking their toll on the canadian consumer

6056233 can you do kettlebell training for fat loss for example can you modify the afterburn program and do it with kettlebells
6056234 you cant really convert afterburn as it contains traditional but you can do a fat loss program with kettlebells so the principles would be the same

6056238 we lit up your world like the fourth of july
6056239 theres a big part of america that really believes that there is a war on terrorism and that we need to finish up
6056240 so i thought it was beautiful the other day when obama went to afghanistan and got educated about afghanistan and iraq
6056241 it is possible to significantly alter global climate through cuts in human greenhouse gas emissions
6056242 the co 2 radiative forcing increased by 20 in the last 10 years 1995 2005
6056243 since the great majority of the incoming solar radiation incident upon the earth strikes the tropics any reduction in tropical radiative forcing has a disproportionate effect on mean global forcings on the basis of lindzen 2007 the anthropogenic radiative forcing as established is divided by 3 to take account of the observed failure of the tropical mid troposphere to warm as projected by the models
6056244 the ipccs value for is dependent upon temperature at the surface and radiant energy flux at the tropopause so that its implicit value 0 313 k m
6056245 none of these papers provides any theoretical or empirical justification for a value as high as the 0 313 k m 2 w chosen by the ipcc
6056246 a runaway greenhouse effect would occur even in todays climate when b 3 2 w m 2 k but has not occurred
6056247 the ipccs high end estimates of the magnitude of individual temperature feedbacks are very likely to be excessive implying that its central estimates are also likely to be excessive
6056248 but at this stage i dont really consider myself a jazz musician
6056249 i have plenty of space to improvise to try new ideas
6056250 how great is the love the father has lavished on us that we should be called children of god and that is what we are dear friends now we are children of god and what we will be has not yet been made known but we know that when he appears we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is
6056251 come quickly and see look listen you cant imagine what i have to tell you
6056252 do not be afraid little flock for your father has been pleased to give you the kingdom
6056253 every little word in this stunning sentence is intended to help take away the fear that jesus knows we struggle with namely that god begrudges his benefits that he is constrained and out of character when he does nice things that at bottom he is angry and loves to vent his anger this is a sentence about the nature of god its about the kind of heart god has its a verse about what makes god glad not merely about what god will do or what he has to do but what he delights to do what he loves to do and takes pleasure in doing
6056254 a voice from heaven said this is my son whom i love with him i am well pleased
6056255 do you remember me telling you about my baptism the dove and the voice from heaven do you recall what i told you the father said about his love for me thats how he feels about you too god is as happy and delighted about giving you the kingdom with all its blessings as he is about my doing what im doing in fulfillment of his will
6056256 god receives us as sons and loves us with the same steadfast affection with which he eternally loves his beloved only begotten there are no distinctions of affection in the divine family we are all loved just as fully as jesus is loved this and nothing less than this is what adoption means no wonder that john cries behold what manner of love when once you understand adoption your heart will cry the same
6056257 he jesus was in the world and though the world was make through him the world did not recognize him he came to that which was his own but his own did not receive him yet to all who received him to those who believed in his name he gave the right to become children of god children born not of natural descent nor of human decision or a husbands will but born of god
6056258 for you did not receive a spirit that makes you a slave again to fear but you received the spirit of sonship and by him we cry abba father the spirit himself testifies with our spirit that we are gods children
6056259 you are all sons of god through faith in christ jesus
6056260 adoption was a practice ordinarily confined to the childless well to do its subjects were not normally infants as today but young adults who had shown themselves fit and able to carry on a family name in a worthy way in this case however god adopts us out of free love not because our character and record show us worthy to bear his name but despite the fact that they show the very opposite we are not fit for a place in gods family the idea of his loving and exalting us sinners as he loves and has exalted the lord jesus sounds ludicrous and wild yet that and nothing less than that is what our adoption means
6056261 not flesh of my flesh nor bone of my bone but still miraculously my own never forget for a single minute you didnt grow under my heart but in it
6056262 gives me an unusual ability to understand my adoption into gods arms my parents had no idea whether i would be a boy or girl they wanted me regardless of my gender god also loves us irrespective of gender knowing that they loved me before i was born deepens my gratitude that god knew me and chose me before the foundation of the world
6056263 my adoptive parents chose to ignore my impoverished past the fact that my natural mother was on welfare didnt diminish their love for me likewise god knows our wicked past our spiritual impoverishment down to the smallest disgusting detail yet he loves us anyway to have been twice adopted and loved in this way goes beyond any words in my vocabulary
6056264 for all intents and purposes whatsoever the said child is and is hereby declared to be in the same relationship to the petitioners the adoptive parents as if born to them by natural birth and remaining in such relationship as if the child were their own
6056265 the rights of all other persons if any they have to the care control and custody of said child be and the same are hereby forever and finally terminated
6056266 these words can be used to describe gods adoption of me into his family when i was adopted by my earthly parents my old identity was terminated legally speaking anyway i became a new and different person i became mary jane fox when i was adopted by my heavenly father i also left behind my old self and was reborn with a new identity a clean slate a fresh start
6056267 she is so fragile and vulnerable she stumbles and falls and whines and often makes such a mess of things but thats the way we are with god every day i stumble and fall and mess things up but my father is there to pick me up he comforts me when im down i complain and get into trouble yet he gently corrects me and loves me in a way that overshadows even the best of earthly affections
6056268 behold behold what manner of love the father has for us that we should be called the children of god and thats exactly what we are
6056269 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
6056270 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
6056271 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
6056272 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
6056273 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
6056274 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
6056275 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
6056276 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
6056277 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
6056278 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
6056279 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
6056280 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
6056281 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
6056282 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
6056283 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
6056284 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
6056285 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
6056286 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
6056287 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
6056288 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
6056289 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
6056290 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
6056291 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
6056292 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
6056293 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
6056294 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
6056295 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
6056296 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
6056297 this is a planning took where all things are going
6056298 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
6056299 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
6056300 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
6056301 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
6056302 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
6056303 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
6056304 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
6056305 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
6056306 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
6056307 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
6056308 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
6056309 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas

6056323 the angle bounded by two lines perpendicular to each other an angle of 90 degrees or 1 2 pi radians
6056324 neither acute nor obtuse of 90 degrees made by lines meeting not obliquely but perpendicularly
6056325 n mathematics an angle formed by the perpendicular intersection of two straight lines and angle of 90 degree
6056326 created when two straight lines meet perpendicularly at 90 degrees to each other
6056327 the angle bounded by two radii that intercept a quarter of a circle one fourth of a round angle or one half of a straight angle two lines forming right angles are perpendicular to each other
6056328 in geometry and trigonometry a right angle is an angle of 90 degrees corresponding to a quarter turn that is a quarter of a full circle it can be defined as the angle such that twice that angle amounts to a half turn or 180
6056329 the angle formed by a line extended from another which bisects the angle formed by the line itself in half
6056330 the right angle bisects the angle of the line into two equal parts

6056349 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation

6056351 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
6056352 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
6056353 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
6056354 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
6056355 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
6056356 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
6056357 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that

6056364 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
6056365 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
6056366 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
6056367 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
6056368 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
6056369 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that

6056382 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
6056383 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools

6056391 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
6056392 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
6056393 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
6056394 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
6056395 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
6056396 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
6056397 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
6056398 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best

6056411 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
6056412 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
6056413 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
6056414 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica

6056428 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
6056429 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
6056430 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
6056431 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
6056432 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
6056433 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
6056434 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
6056435 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
6056436 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
6056437 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
6056438 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos
6056439 we are deeply saddened that leroi moore saxophonist and founding member of dave matthews band died unexpectedly tuesday afternoon august 19 2008 at hollywood presbyterian medical center in los angeles from sudden complications stemming from his june atv accident on his farm near charlottesville virginia leroi had recently returned to his los angeles home to begin an intensive physical rehabilitation program
6056440 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6056441 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6056442 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
6056443 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
6056444 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
6056445 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros

6056450 why should the german be interested in the liberation of the jew if the jew is not interested in the liberation of the german we recognize in judaism therefore a general anti social element of the present time in the final analysis the emancipation of the jews is the emancipation of mankind from judaism indeed in north america the practical domination of judaism over the christian world has achieved as its unambiguous and normal expression that the preaching of the gospel itself and the christian ministry have become articles of trade money is the jealous god of israel in face of which no other god may exist

6056490 walking home from school was also an experience because all the boys carried marbles and would stop along the way to try their skills at the games
6056491 walking home i would sometimes walk the path through the goat pasture leffert and south feltus streets in the direction of the hospital and stop at fanny daytons spring for a drink and to catch a bullfrog the spring was located along a thick area of woods the path ran diagonal from catherine street to a point near the hospital

6056511 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche
6056512 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados

6056517 aporte potencial de energ as renovables no convencionales y eficiencia energ tica a la matriz el ctrica 2008 2025
6056518 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
6056519 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
6056520 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
6056521 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
6056522 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
6056523 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
6056524 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
6056525 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
6056526 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
6056527 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
6056528 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
6056529 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
6056530 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
6056531 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
6056532 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
6056533 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
6056534 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
6056535 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
6056536 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
6056537 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
6056538 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
6056539 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
6056540 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
6056541 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
6056542 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
6056543 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
6056544 esperamos que las autoridades de gobierno se abstengan de seguir interviniendo a favor del citado proyecto para que pueda ser evaluado correctamente
6056545 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
6056546 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
6056547 los pueblos originarios son los primeros que sufrimos la extranjerizacion
6056548 asumir la interculturalidad como hecho de todos no solo los indigenas qus somo interculturales a la fuerza
6056549 en san martin de los andes la confederacion con el pueblo mapuche puso un lote a disposicion del barrio entero
6056550 el art culo 53 es una herramienta de lucha para el pueblo mapuche
6056551 referente a los derechos humanos suiza es la capitalde la cruz roja suiza nunca tuvo colonias a nivel estatal
6056552 nuestra vinculacion con la pelicula est en que el empresario domenico panciotto viene de suiza y la realizadora fausta quattrini es suiza
6056553 los pueblos indigenas me han cambiado la forma de ver e l derecho
6056554 los funcionarios del estado aparecen en el documental ridiculos y sin comprender ciertas cosas
6056555 el secretario de derechos humanos de neuqun ve a la pelicula como muy pol tica y la criticaba por eso
6056556 el inciso 17 se introdujo por cansancio el convenio 169 se ratifico sin leerlo porque si lo leian bien no lo hacian
6056557 roca hizo una ciudadan a de escritorio nos homogeneiz es importante que los pueblos originarios llamen a revertir eso
6056558 los pueblos originarios nos son negocio pol tico porque est n aislados por eso se los invisibiliza hay que salir de la invisibilidad reconociendo la realidad y fortaleciendo su lucha
6056559 un consejo a los abogados no se disfracen de originarios son abogados de la v citma no la v ctima asi se cumple mejor la funci n
6056560 ser a bueno por ejemplo que el colegio de abogados organice una comiison de derecho indigena propuso zaffaroni ganandose el aplauso de la concurrencia tambien hacer un congreso de derecho indigena
6056561 aunque en reas diferentes a las que dedic juan porque su calidad de jurista y constitucionalista est n fuera de mi alcance

6056563 con el voto de la ley de delaci n una pol tica de seguridad se puso en marcha la oficina reclutaba los prisioneros pol ticos al interior y fuera de las prisiones era gente que estaba quebrada psicol gicamente y que ten an problemas econ micos se les ofrec a trabajo y dinero a cambio de informaci n
6056564 quer an informaci n del grupo lautaro porque dec an que los militares quer an matarlos mas vale que nosotros los ayudemos en la c rcel estar n mejor que muertos les respond que no pod a ayudarlos y tuve mucho miedo
6056565 todo el mundo sospechaba que todo el mundo era sapo dividieron para gobernar

6056568 toda democracia debe tener un servicio secreto no hay nada sorprendente en esto pero el fin no justifica todos los medios
6056569 en lugar de utilizar agentes de estado ellos utilizaron prisioneros pol ticos y sus familias
6056570 esta situaci n viene d ndose hace mucho tiempo atr s y se les ha notificado y dado tiempo para realizar los cambios correspondientes pero ellos s lo han respondido con promesas incumplidas es por eso que anunciamos que estamos dispuestos a recuperar nuestra escuela y se hace el llamado a todas las instituciones mapuche presente en el wall mapu ha colaborar en este proceso

6056577 all por la cordillera como en todos los caminos hay apellidos muy finos pero con una historia muy fiera cuando a los indios mataban para quitarle la tierra
6056578 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
6056579 los sistemas penales no deben inventar ning n m todo pues todos los que utilizan ya se construyeron en democracia para perseguir a las clases peligrosas

6056588 common denominator that allows for the discrimination of the living from the non living
6056589 a deterministic emergence of life would reflect an essential continuity between physics chemistry and biology
6056590 we propose that the only absolute requirements for life are a thermodynamic disequilibrium and temperatures consistent with chemical bonding
6056591 organisms do not maintain their complexity and become more complex in a vacuum their high organization and low entropy is made up for by pollution heat and entropic export to their surroundings
6056592 the pleasure the depth the craft of our subject lie in the details of how living organisms work out the solution to their challenges within the framework of physical law
6056593 more elaborate pathways leading to the complex amino acids nucleic acids and cofactors follow from these elementary steps in a dense and surprisingly simple web of reactions
6056594 it is interesting to contemplate an entangled bank clothed with many plants of many kinds with birds singing on the bushes with various insects flitting about and with worms crawling through the damp earth and to reflect that these elaborately constructed forms so different from each other and dependent on each other in so complex a manner have all been produced by laws acting around us these laws taken in the largest sense being growth with reproduction inheritance which is almost implied by reproduction variability from the indirect and direct action of the external conditions of life and from use and disuse a ratio of increase so high as to lead to a struggle for life and as a consequence to natural selection entailing divergence of character and the extinction of less improved forms thus from the war of nature from famine and death the most exalted object which we are capable of conceiving namely the production of the higher animals directly follows there is grandeur in this view of life with its several powers having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one and that whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been and are being evolved
6056595 unitary structures with coherent properties that can operate in an integrated way which allows for the acceptance of their changes on large time scales as evolutionary
6056596 an autonomous agent is something that can both reproduce itself and do at least one thermodynamic work cycle it turns out that this is true of all free living cells excepting weird special cases they all do work cycles just like the bacterium spinning its flagellum as it swims up the glucose gradient the cells in your body are busy doing work cycles all the time
6056597 living beings continuously lose information and would sink to thermodynamic equilibrium just as surely as nonliving systems do there is only one way to keep a system from sinking to equilibrium to infuse new information t o maintain its high order an organism must continuously pump in information now this is precisely what the protein demons do inside an organism they take information from the environment and funnel it into the organism by virtue of the conservation law this means that the environment must undergo an equivalent increase in thermodynamic entropy for every bit of information the organism gains the entropy in the demons environment must rise by a certain amount there is thus a trade off here an information for entropy barter and it is this curious trade which the protein demons ply indeed they know it from the ground up and have honed it to perfection bartering nonstop they draw in huge information amounts and so manage to maintain the organism above equilibrium and locally to turn the thermodynamic arrow around
6056598 thus when we try to explain how the whole system behaves we have to talk about its parts the context of the whole and cannot get away talking only about the parts
6056599 the constituent parts and processes of a living thing are related to the organism as a whole by a kind of reciprocal causation
6056600 all living organisms from the humble amoeba to the human are born with devices designed to solve automatically no proper reasoning required the basic problems of life those problems are finding sources of energy incorporating and transforming energy maintaining a chemical balance of the interior compatible with the life process maintaining the organisms structure by repairing its wear and tear and fending off external agents of disease and physical injury
6056601 we propose that the only absolute requirements for life are a thermodynamic disequilibrium and temperatures consistent with chemical bonding
6056602 what we really need to focus on is coming up with an adequately general theory of living systems as opposed to a definition of life
6056603 yet even the majestic giant sequoia is not the record holder
6056604 complex plasmas a state of matter common in outer space consisting of a mass of charged particles may naturally self organize themselves into stable interacting helical structures that exhibit features normally attributed to organic living matter the self organization is based on non trivial physical mechanisms of plasma interactions involving over screening of plasma polarization as a result each helical string composed of solid microparticles is topologically and dynamically controlled by plasma fluxes leading to particle charging and over screening the latter providing attraction even among helical strings of the same charge sign these interacting complex structures exhibit thermodynamic and evolutionary features thought to be peculiar only to living matter such as bifurcations that serve as memory marks self duplication metabolic rates in a thermodynamically open system and non hamiltonian dynamics we examine the salient features of this new complex state of soft matter in light of the autonomy evolution progenity and autopoiesis principles used to define life it is concluded that complex self organized plasma structures exhibit all the necessary properties to qualify them as candidates for inorganic living matter that may exist in space provided certain conditions allow them to evolve naturally
6056605 those who are aware of the most recent advances in plant cell biology are convinced that cell theory as it now stands is absolutely incompatible with a cell based organization of higher plants and requires an update
6056606 energy flow embeds life within the geosphere not just mechanistically but conceptually as an inevitable form of driven geochemical order
6056607 the production of motive power is then due in steam engines not to an actual consumption of caloric quantity of heat but to its transportation from a warm body to a cold body that is to its re establishment of equilibrium
6056608 evolution in these circumstances proceeds in such direction as to make the total energy flux through the system a maximum compatible with the constraints
6056609 life may be the ultimate in planetary stress relief morowitz and smith argue that life was the necessary consequence of available energy built up by geological processes on the early earth life sprang from this environment they say in the same way that lightning relieves the accumulation of electrical charge in thunderclouds
6056610 the common ancestor of eukaryotes bacteria and archaea may have been a community of organisms containing the following autotrophs that produced organic compounds from co2 either photosynthetically or by inorganic chemical reactions heterotrophs that obtained organics by leakage from other organisms saprotrophs that absorbed nutrients from decaying organisms and phagotrophs that were sufficiently complex to envelop and digest prey
6056611 we assert that reproduction and evolution are not constitutive features of the living organization and that the properties of a unity cannot be accounted for only through ac counting for the properties of its components
6056612 we also claim that all biological phenomenology including reproduction and evolution is secondary to the establishment of this unitary organization
6056613 what is the necessary and sufficient organization for a given system to be a living unity

6056618 darwinian medicine is the treatment of disease based on evolution the underlying assumption of darwinian medicine is that traits are coded by genes which are often assumed to be sequences of dna nucleotides the quantitative genetic ramification of this perspective is that traits including disease susceptibility are either caused by genes or by the environment with genotype by environment interactions usually considered statistical artefacts i emphasize also examining those epigenetic signals that can be altered by environmental perturbations and then transmitted to subsequent generations although seldom studied environmentally alterable meiotically heritable epigenetic signals exist and provide a mechanism underlying genotype by environment interactions environment of a parent can affect its descendants by heritably altering epigenetic signals neo lamarckian medicine is the application of these evolutionary epigenetic notions to diseases and could have enormous public health and environmental policy implications if industrial contaminants adversely affect organisms by meiotically heritably altering their epigenetic signals then cleaning up these contaminants will not remedy the problem once contaminants have adversely altered an individuals epigenetic signals this harm will be transmitted to future generations even if they are not exposed to the contaminant exposure to environmental shocks such as free radicals or other carcinogens can alter cytosine methylation patterns on regulatory genes this can cause cancer by up regulating genes for cell division or by down regulating tumour suppressor genes environmentally alterable meiotically heritable epigenetic signals could also underlie other diseases such as diabetes prader willi syndrome and many complex diseases if environmentally altered meiotically heritable epigenetic effects are widespread which is an important open empirical question they have the potential to alter paradigmatic views of evolutionary medicine and the putative dichotomy of nature versus nurture neo lamarckian medicine would thereby shift emphasis from cure to prevention of diseases
6056619 populations of ants and other social insects self organize and develop emergent properties through stigmergy in which individual ants communicate with one another via chemical trails of pheromones that attract or repulse other ants in this way sophisticated properties and functions develop under appropriate conditions in vitro microtubule preparations initially comprised of only tubulin and gtp behave in a similar manner they self organize and develop other higher level emergent phenomena by a process where individual microtubules are coupled together by the chemical trails they produce by their own reactive growing and shrinking this behaviour is described and compared with the behaviour of ant colonies viewing microtubules as populations of molecular ants may provide new insights as to how the cytoskeleton may spontaneously develop high level functions it is plausible that such processes occur during the early stages of embryogenesis and in cells
6056620 stem cells may be considered complex reactive systems because of their vast number in a living system their reactive nature and the influence of local environmental factors such as the state of neighboring cells tissue matrix stem cell physiological processes on their behavior in such systems emergent global behavior arises through the multitude of local interactions among the cell agents approaching hematopoietic and other stem cell lineages from this perspective have critical ramifications on current thinking relating to the plasticity of these lineage systems the modeling of stem cell systems and the interpretation of clinical data regarding many diseases within such models

6056636 what government should be focused on is raising the incomes and the aspirations and the opportunities for the millions of people who are stuck on low incomes and that is where this government has failed not because they are bad people not because they dont have noble ambitions but because their measure which is entirely reliant on the state which is about redistribution has failed failed on their own terms
6056637 our education system is failing to spread opportunity our welfare system is keeping people out of work our tax system makes it extremely difficult for those on low incomes to get off those low incomes because those marginal tax rates are so high
6056638 labour has failed it has created a more unfair society and i think there is a real opportunity for the conservative party now to lead this debate
6056639 we will keep tax credits but we will add to the battle on poverty other things like welfare reform like extending educational opportunity like supporting families and these conservative methods of achieving progressive goals are likely to be far more successful and create a fairer society
6056640 at the moment borrowing is rising and thats a real issue
6056641 the truth is gordon browns old fashioned leftist idea that only the state can guarantee fairness has led to a decade of top down state control policies that have made our country less fair

6056655 obama has begun the drive with little fanfare often eschewing the modern campaign technique of unveiling new spots for the news media before they run in an effort to win added free attention mr obama whose candidacy has been built in part on a promise to transcend traditional politics is running the negative commercials on local stations even as he runs generally positive spots nationally during prime time coverage of the olympics
6056656 the negative spots reflect the sharper tone mr obama has struck in recent days on the stump as he heads into his partys nominating convention in denver next week and seem to address the anxiety among some democrats that mr obama has not answered a volley of attacks by mr mccain with enough force

6056700 so nigeria has actually allowed cameroun to take over bakassi this is very shameful how can we allow this kind of thing to happen to us a place that belongs to us has suddenly become camerouns territory while our people who have lived there for many years have now become refugees in their own country honestly our leaders should hide their faces in shame for failing to defend nigerias interest in this matter
6056701 what has happened is obasanjos handiwork he was the one that signed an agreement with cameroun for them to take over bakassi and since the un is involved in the matter as a witness to that agreement theres nothing president yaradua could have done to stop cameroun from taking over the place so the whole blame should go to obasanjo since hes the one that signed that agreement in the first place without considering the fact that most nigerians are against bakassi going to cameroun
6056702 we should not blame obasanjo like that it was the world court that decided that bakassi belonged to cameroun and ordered nigeria to give up the place so obasanjo had to sign that agreement because of that world court judgement and the un was telling us that we have no choice but to obey the judgement obasanjo knew that if we try to disobey it might lead to war and who is ready to fight war now especially when the un and other countries in the world are against you
6056703 ehem what is wrong in fighting a war to defend what belongs to you which some people are trying to take away why should we be afraid to go to war with cameroun in order to stop them from taking away bakassi from us obasanjo and yaradua should be held response for this bakassi disaster why should it be when they were ruling nigeria that we lost bakassi to cameroun it was not today that cameroun started eyeing bakassi and made attempts to grab it they tried it when shagari buhari and abacha ruled nigeria and each time we showed them pepper by sending troops there to deal with them they didnt try anything again until obasanjo became president and started dancing to the tune of france and britain who wanted bakassi to be under cameroun so that they will be able to control the oil there if they had tried this nonsense under abacha or any nigerian leader that cares for the interest of the country war would have broken out there by now un or no un
6056704 what youre saying can only happen under military rule except for shagari buhari and abacha were military heads of state who could do anything they liked because they were not answerable to anybody the world court thing happened when obasanjo was nigerias president under a democratic rule so he was under obligation to sign that agreement on behalf of nigeria because to do otherwise will invite sanctions from the un and some of these super power countries who have interest in the bakassi matter
6056705 why did obasanjo agree to go to the world court with cameroun on behalf of nigeria who sent him message is it by force that we must go to the world court our past leaders knew that there was an international conspiracy to steal bakassi from nigeria and that is why they refused to go the world court with cameroun because they know that we will not get justice there but obasanjo did not think of that one before he rushed to world court for us now see where the whole thing has landed us
6056706 dont mind him he did it out of his selfish interest he did it to please the international community so that they will support his third term agenda he believed that after handing over bakassi to cameroun countries like france britain and america will compensate him by assisting him to succeed in his plan to become a third term president but that one didnt work for him but unfortunately for nigeria we lost bakassi in the process

6056914 probably you may say that there was no expectation from the people back home and the media too but me and my coach satpal always knew i had a fair chance of winning a medal and im happy i could achieve that

6056916 i want to dedicate this medal to my coach satpal
6056917 it was not easy out there i had to compete in four bouts today which did make me weary towards the end i had not played against doug schwab usa and albert batyrov belarus earlier so they were unknown rivals for me

6056961 the mccain campaign believes that some of hillary clintons tactics especially questioning whether obama is ready to lead can be a real winner
6056962 the mccain team has been very open that they went to school on the hillary clinton campaign that they learned from that
6056963 and on this 3 a m ad whats very striking as some have pointed out over the last few days is that barack obama was winning a steady streak of victories against hillary clinton
6056964 and then she ran that ad and she really went on the attack on the experience question and she won the bulk of the primaries thereafter in the closing months of the democratic primaries and won 500 000 more votes than he did and almost took it away from him
6056965 which candidate do voters believe is better qualified to deal with russia mccain by better than 2 1
6056966 going after more centrist voters more swing voters more conservative voters who will be a much bigger deal in the general election than they were in those primaries and caucuses
6056967 not only did the clinton campaign give mccain and his advisers a road map but they actually started the mccains down that path
6056968 thats why youre hearing from obama very specific policy oriented proposals here
6056969 theres not a lot of that kind of flash if you will from the earlier days
6056970 the big question now is whether obama can successfully regain control of the campaign agenda as we head into the democratic convention
6056971 what the clinton campaign demonstrated is when you bring obama back down to earth its a better battle

6056973 five percent of the time he can say something completely outrageous and thats when you wish somebody had told him to be a little more careful
6056974 i thought that that cartoon was gratuitous and obviously offensive
6056975 im very confident and proud of cindy that she has overcome this and gone on to do some very good things in her life and this world
6056976 impractical as it was for mccain to act the way he did by saying im a senator from arizona but im going to blackball the biggest newspaper in the state god bless him for being that angry on behalf of his wife
6056977 our sense of value and self worth is often tied to how much money we make
6056978 there is an illusion that we live with and believe that a bigger paycheck makes us happier and more valuable
6056979 compensation is based on an exchange of value for value depending on your life circumstances you may want to contribute less and put in more time on another key area of your life
6056980 if only i earned xx then i would be happy
6056981 the ultimate freedom is the executive who says pay me 1 a year because my salary doesnt matter
6056982 based on the intangibles hes making more than everyone else

6056989 the reuters zogby poll which was taken by telephone of 1 089 likely voters and had margin of error of 3 percentage points found that no one factor explains mccains gain
6056990 if my mental processes are determined wholly by the motions of atoms in my brain i have no reason to suppose that my beliefs are true and hence i have no reason for supposing by brain to be composed of atoms
6056991 but i object to the idea that young people need their own special segregated genre of books as if their minds are so dramatically different from adult minds that they require their own category of fantasy once a person has reached adolescence relegating their reading material to its own gated subgenre seems at best condescending and at worst censorious
6056992 i can confirm he is a deputy chief of the fire department
6056993 we only became aware of this a half hour ago
6056994 in relation to manoj saying he is die hard aishwariya fan with a gravataar that has hrithik in it too

6057000 i came outside and saw flames shooting about 10ft out of the roof
6057001 the wind was blowing the fire in the direction of my house
6057002 we werent told we could go back in until 5am i havent been to bed
6057003 its bad news for the area i never had any idea you hear of these factories but you dont expect to find them next door
6057004 as far as i know the people living there were chinese but i havent seen them
6057005 i joked to a neighbour that it must be a cannabis factory
6057006 they had managed to get two smaller engines down the road by about 3 45am but the larger engine with the platform was stuck
6057007 i know firefighters were knocking on doors from about 3 30am but they couldnt find all the owners to get the cars moved
6057008 one engine was able to get there and start tackling the fire straight away
6057009 the rest were slowed up a bit but thats fact of life because those streets werent made for modern times when households have more than one car
6057010 i am merely a single sardine jammed into the sealed up tin
6057011 oh my son in the bears class is much more quiet and even tempered than this one

6057014 they should have wiped out the shareholders nationalized the institutions with legislation that they are to be reconstituted with necessary taxpayer support to make them financially viable as five or 10 individual privately held units
6057015 this legislation accomplished two important goals providing confidence in the immediate term as these institutions play a critical role in weathering the housing correction and putting in place a new regulator with all the authorities necessary to address systemic risk posed by the gses
6057016 i dont want to second guess what the authorities have done
6057017 if i had been there i may well have done the same things the pressures are immense and the stakes are very high nevertheless we now confront the necessity of damping down sharply the expectation that the answer to every problem is government intervention
6057018 made a lot of mistakes in that race cant make mistakes at this level and i did

6057029 we will closely coordinate closely communicate with the judge as well as the other parties and we will finalize a plan for financing as well as plan for construction of new landfill as well as the closure of the ordot landfill and we will execute that plan
6057030 we just have to always remember that what isnt paid by system development charges are paid by the rest of the ratepayers so whatever is delayed by systems development charges could become a burden on the rest of t
6057031 create the greenest and most fun commuter vehicle on the freeway
6057032 because it is obvious that samantha has finally realized that her place is by elvis side
6057033 it seems like a diploma aint enough for a job no more
6057034 but right now i cant because i have to keep the talking to a minimum i need to focus on my job
6057035 theres so much expected of kids in school that i dont feel comfortable sending them to school if they struggle
6057036 i feel like a lot of stuff they learn in preschool is a prerequisite to kindergarten
6057037 by the time they go to kindergarten they know their abcs 123s the days of the week and how to tie their shoes
6057038 shes awesome im not really sure how much more you can elaborate
6057039 she loves the kids and the kids absolutely love her
6057040 some of the kids do end up learning to read small words by the end of the year
6057041 i do a lot of incentives when they learn a new skill
6057042 we celebrate everything here if a student learns how to sip and zipper the whole class celebrates
6057043 it eases the anxiety during the first day of school
6057044 i shop at the 99 cent stores there are ways of saving money
6057045 i was outraged these companies make their decisions and their bets and they should be responsible for that they should not be bailed out on the backs of the taxpayers
6057046 el acuerdo principal y b sico es convencer a la rep blica y al congreso de que pemex puede convertirse en una gran industria de estado y con ella transformar de manera responsable la riqueza del petr leo
6057047 ser un anuncio importante sobre el sindicato que se distinguir de lo que tienen pri y pan felipe calder n no puede buscar modificar la relaci n de empresa y sindicato y el revolucionario institucional tampoco ahora debe decidir si acepta nuestra propuesta
6057048 mandatos claros para el presupuesto de 2009 en materia de inversi n dirigida a exploraci n que de acuerdo con los expertos ha sido mal aplicada y comprobar que con el presupuesto que existe se pueden construir dos o tres refiner as y darle un impulso a pemex
6057049 fue un trabajo de complementariedad y empat a y hoy se ha avanzado tambi n con las ideas de legisladores y dirigentes pol ticos
6057050 this big push is making people crazy thinking theyre bad moms if they dont get their kids vaccinated
6057051 merck lobbied every opinion leader womens group medical society politicians and went directly to the people it created a sense of panic that says you have to have this vaccine now
6057052 i would have liked to see it go much slower
6057053 in that time you learn a lot about safety and side effects and how to use it
6057054 those getting it early should be the ones who really want it and willing to accept the risk
6057055 you can only study a vaccine for so long before you license and use it in a population where it has enormous value
6057056 our hope and belief is that this is a remarkable vaccine that will have huge impact on women
6057057 this kind of money could be better used to solve so many other problems in womens health
6057058 some of our provinces are running out of money to provide primary care im not against vaccines but in canada and the u s women are not dying in the streets of cervical cancer
6057059 this initiative was seen as a good use of resources that fits with the governments health priorities and political priorities
6057060 if we do this quickly and badly we could cause more deaths
6057061 when you get a letter saying this is what you need to do to protect your girls of course you do it
6057062 i chose to get vaccinated because my dreams dont include cervical cancer
6057063 i understand that the information i provide will be used by merck or those working on behalf of merck for market research purposes
6057064 to make sure they are providing accurate information in accordance with f d a approved labeling and to make sure dissemination of information is always appropriate
6057065 hpv is a very important health issue for college students
6057066 we are a poor nonprofit and ive been working on this issue for years
6057067 it is a very easy step that we can take to prevent a sometimes deadly but certainly serious form of cancer
6057068 the immunity of gardasil will not last that is dangerous to assume
6057069 well worry about whether boosters are needed down the road
6057070 gardasil continues to be safe and effective and its benefits continue to outweigh its risks
6057071 her parents are scientists they know better than to assume gardasil caused her disease
6057072 you inevitably find adverse events that you wouldnt have suspected
6057073 cervical cancer is a worthwhile disease to prevent in a country that has the resources
6057074 are you really going to say a girl cant start school because she hasnt had this vaccine
6057075 while the study once again illustrates the importance of a college education to americans it also points to areas of focus for all of us interested in higher education
6057076 for example too few parents and students are focusing on the total cost of college not enough are using available college savings tools too many are borrowing without considering how they will repay and too many are not completing federal financial aid forms that enable them to access free federal financial aid and lower cost student loans
6057077 will consider opening portions of the outer continental shelf for drilling with appropriate safeguards and without taxpayer subsidies to big oil
6057078 we hope our republican colleagues will join in a bipartisan effort not only to increase domestic supply but also to help consumers and to protect the environment
6057079 if speaker pelosi and her democratic colleagues were truly serious about increasing production of american energy and lowering the price of gasoline they would call congress back into session immediately to vote on our all of the above energy plan rather than taking a five week break away from washington
6057080 another flawed plan that will do little to lower gas prices
6057081 we are going to put them to the test on this issue
6057082 no passion so effectually robs the mind of all its powers of acting and reasoning as fear
6057083 un sacrificio humano para agradar a los dioses de los medios
6057084 fue una decisi n la remoci n de creel autodestructiva porque se prefiri coexistir con la censura de la tv a santiago creel antes que como partido y gobierno exigirle a las televisoras respeto a su l der parlamentario y por el presidente del senado
6057085 un sacrificio humano para agradar a los dioses no del olimpo sino de los medios
6057086 fue una decisi n autodestructiva porque se prefiri coexistir con la censura de la tv a santiago creel antes que como partido y gobierno exigirle a las televisoras respeto a su l der parlamentario y por el presidente del senado
6057087 iniciar en solitario una lucha contra gigantes como las televisoras
6057088 tienen m s que ver con su salida de la coordinaci n en el senado que con la realidad de lo que expresa
6057089 el presidente del partido germ n mart nez debe honrar la historia de acci n nacional respetando la disidencia interna y tratar a los coordinadores parlamentarios como pares y no como sirvientes de pocas pasadas
6057090 estamos en una lamentable subordinaci n pol tica de una buena parte de la clase pol tica en el gobierno y en el partido al poder de las televisoras lo que explica la forma pero sobre todo el fondo de la remoci n del senador santiago creel como coordinador panista en el senado
6057091 they came in real nervous but they settled in after that first game
6057092 some of the nerves and anxiety came back in the fourth and fifth game the girls started to play not to lose
6057093 i commended them on their serving then it fell apart
6057094 its hard to take this loss because there are tough ones ahead and were probably going to look back and say this should have been a win
6057095 ya fuera de bio tica y oh dolor las minifaldas
6057096 yo no propondr a un debate institucional sobre casi ning n tema pero en el de la impunidad s
6057097 son cad veres y cad veres y las relaciones de la polic a con el narco y etc tera pero no permite el debate se condena y punto
6057098 lo que s permite el debate son las estructuras de la impunidad
6057099 insistir en que el poder legislativo los medios electr nicos y las universidades tengan una actitud porque es el nico tema que permitir a testimonios y de alg n modo reflexiones colaterales sobre lo que m s nos importa
6057100 debe frenarse con la acci n de la justicia que detenga el narcotr fico los polic as involucrados los empresarios y pol ticos pero esto se ha dicho en demas a y no ha pasado nada
6057101 al lado de las acciones del poder judicial es un debate nacional de primer orden sobre la estructura de la impunidad y creo que al lado de la cumbre de seguridad debe darse la cumbre alternativa
6057102 en el mundo de los negocios en el universo bancario en la red judicial en el disfrute de los ecocidios en los tratos inquilinarios en el saqueo interminable a los pobres qu es la impunidad trat ndose de las corporaciones policiacas del laberinto de los jefes policiacos de los nexos con los narcotraficantes de la ligereza con que se ejecutan los asesinatos en serie qu es la impunidad en el mundo laboral con la guillotina del salario m nimo o de los contratos de riesgo o las esclavitudes de la maquila
6057103 la generalizaci n es injusta sobre todo si se trata de la polic a uniformada sometida a una serie de abusos donde figuran los salarios bajos
6057104 no todo es desastre y prueba irrefutable de ello es el n mero de polic as asesinados cada a o en el cumplimiento del deber como los soldados tambi n victimados por la delincuencia estos polic as han servido a la sociedad y a partir de esto han pertenecido a ella si no se reconoce el sentido de su muerte se dar por sentado que el pa s vivir mejor sin un solo polic a lo que no parece ser lo apropiado
6057105 no se necesita compartir la ideolog a de los organizadores para apreciar la decisi n de los que van a marchar como se quiera ver ejercen una alternativa ciudadana

6057113 valuable because not everyone sits in front of a computer or a television
6057114 at getting votes on election day and communicating the messages that we feel are important to our supporters
6057115 text messaging is really powerful if i have a text message i can forward that text message to over 100 people in my cell phone list
6057116 its going to be read by every single person have you ever not read a text message
6057117 maybe investors were hoping to shrug off the challenges of high commodity prices and inflation
6057118 but now we find out that perhaps the inflation situation is worse than we thought
6057119 coupling the two you have slow growth with higher inflation
6057120 im totally convinced that the decision was motivated by money and only money
6057121 this is a huge let down sic i cant believe that they are moving it back by nearly eight months

6057127 we were pretty ticked off to say the least the reason he got paddled was because he was untying his shoes and playing with the air conditioner thermostat
6057128 one of the things weve seen over and over again is that parents have difficulty getting redress if a child is paddled and severely injured or paddled in violation of parents wishes
6057129 international human rights law puts a pretty strong prohibition on corporal punishment
6057130 i didnt get any bruises but they still hurt and from that point on i told myself and my parents i wasnt going to take any more paddlings

6057184 que efectivamente el informativo municipal es un instrumento de difusi n de las pol ticas e iniciativas desarrolladas por el ayuntamiento de m rida no exclusivamente del equipo de gobierno
6057185 el im pasa de ser un instrumento de informaci n a un medio de manipulaci n de la junta de gobierno local

6057195 son todos contratos temporales en su mayor a precarios que finalizar n al final del verano si ese es el tipo de empleo que quiere crear la junta de extremadura estamos arreglados
6057196 a la se ora lucio ni se le ve ni se le espera esperamos que de la cara cuando tras el verano finalicen todos los contratos temporales y cuando finalicen algunos de los decretos de la junta sobre empleo que est n a n en vigor ser interesante escuchar a quien culpan en esta ocasi n y a quien cuelgan el mochuelo desde el pp pediremos su comparecencia en el parlamento extreme o en cuanto se inicie el curso pol tico para que rinda cuenta del arduo trabajo del gobierno regional frente a la crisis

6057264 the alliance is considering seriously the implications of russias actions for the nato russia relationship
6057265 we have determined that we cannot continue with business as usual

6057279 ubuntu has a huge user base and substantial community support around the world we think the passion these users have for linux and the open source movement generally will be important in helping the linux foundation to accelerate the uptake of linux in organizations of all size
6057280 so it seemed logical for us to join the other major vendors supporting the linux foundation at this time
6057281 even though canonical and ubuntu have been participating in our activities for the last few years the direct association with them means well have closer coordination across their organization it also means they see enough value in what we do to financially support it
6057282 we have great respect for all the other distros and the people that create and use them
6057283 thats a fundamental part of the ubuntu philosophy the many different types of distros are one of the greatest strengths of linux over proprietary solutions where you basically have to take what you are given

6057295 how do you win a war that is militarily unwinnable
6057296 obviously pulling out would be the worst of all outcomes but the solution can only be political even if that requires military supremacy the courage of soldiers demands the intelligence of politicians
6057297 even though the toll is so high you should be proud of what you are doing
6057298 theres been wide consensus for a long time in france that when the right times come the army must be used even if the price to pay for that will be the loss of soldiers

6057597 it would be a thing of beauty if when lady liberty looks out on the horizon she not only welcomes new immigrants to our shores but lights their way with a torch powered by an ocean wind farm

6057601 first we set up a single goal to represent educational success which will take four years to achieve no matter what is being taught we attach an economic reward to it that seldom has anything to do with what has been learned we urge large numbers of people who do not possess adequate ability to try to achieve the goal wait until they have spent a lot of time and money and then deny it to them we stigmatize everyone who doesnt meet the goal we call the goal a ba
6057602 outside a handful of majors engineering and some of the sciences a bachelors degree tells an employer nothing except that the applicant has a certain amount of intellectual ability and perseverance even a degree in a vocational major like business administration can mean anything from a solid base of knowledge to four years of barely remembered gut courses
6057603 the solution is not better degrees but no degrees young people entering the job market should have a known trusted measure of their qualifications they can carry into job interviews that measure should express what they know not where they learned it or how long it took them they need a certification not a degree
6057604 you may have learned accounting at an anonymous online university but your cpa score gives you a way to show employers youre a stronger applicant than someone from an ivy league school
6057605 under a certification system four years is not required residence is not required expensive tuitions are not required and a degree is not required
6057606 our obsession with the ba has created a two tiered entry to adulthood anointing some for admission to the club and labeling the rest as second best an educational world based on certification tests would be a better place in many ways but the overarching benefit is that the line between college and non college competencies would be blurred hardly any jobs would still have the ba as a requirement for a shot at being hired opportunities would be wider and fairer and the stigma of not having a ba would diminish
6057607 an international media outcry forced the chinese government to stop blocking access to websites but there has been no similar gesture towards the international radio stations such as the bbc voice of america radio free asia and voice of tibet which are being jammed within china
6057608 the right of foreign journalists to unrestricted internet access has been partially guaranteed but what about the hundreds of millions of chinese tibetans and uyghurs who are denied independent news and information
6057609 how will the olympic games have helped to loosen the governments grip on the news media
6057610 it was partly in order to draw attention to this censorship that reporters without borders organised a clandestine fm broadcast in beijing on 8 august
6057611 our three frequencies are registered internationally for exclusive use for the broadcasting of our stations programming
6057612 but no one is capable of defending us against the chinese jamming and whats more our website is still blocked

6057618 ya know its funny i got a you ever seen the show rob and big the producers want to do a reality show on me the first nba player to do a reality show but then i thought about it i was like my life is really not that exciting
6057619 ya know so im thinking about it because ya know i have players like nick young whos goofy so we can do paintball shooting and see who can get hurt on the grotto jumping into the pool
6057620 im sure well find more and more drugs that are affected this way
6057621 recently we discovered that grapefruit and these other fruit juices substantially decrease the oral absorption of certain drugs undergoing intestinal uptake transport
6057622 the concern is loss of benefit of medications essential for the treatment of serious medical conditions
6057623 a key drug uptake transporter called oatp1a2 involved in shuttling drugs from the small intestine to the bloodstream
6057624 blocking this transporter reduces drug absorption and neutralizes their potential benefits
6057625 by contrast drugs whose levels are boosted in the presence of grapefruit juice appear to block an important drug metabolizing enzyme called cyp3a4 that normally breaks down drugs
6057626 over the years every time there is a major election we have had people attempt to put up a listing we catch them very quickly
6057627 when we see these listings we definitely take them down
6057628 its possible that someone would put a listing up its possible to be up for a couple of hours before we catch it its possible that for a brief period of time something might actually be visible on the site
6057629 we are very clear if you engage in illegal activity on our site we absolutely will share information with law enforcement we provide testimony in court
6057630 and what this person was proposing was probably not so feasible unrealistic
6057631 i dont think it will happen more and more as the elections are approaching
6057632 its not anything thats widespread or cause for concern in any way
6057633 people are just looking for an audience they are really using that listing as an opportunity to put their opinion on there
6057634 we have had instances that would be similar in nature where we have sports fan who are really unhappy with the performance of their favorite team and they may try to list the coach for sale as a way to express their unhappiness with the performance of their team

6057667 i am keen to stress that we are committed to providing a service at singleton and i have reiterated this at all our meetings and conversations with our partners
6057668 however through our discussions and the feedback weve received from our clinical staff it is clear that the current service is not safe and sustainable as it stands
6057669 we are regularly left with no choice but to close the unit at various times particularly at night because no doctor is available and that situation cannot be allowed to continue indefinitely
6057670 one option being looked at is working with the gps to provide a safe effective and regular service at singleton nevertheless nothing has been decided yet
6057671 there has been difficulty recruiting appropriately skilled doctors to substantive posts at singleton for some time
6057672 the department has been increasingly dependent on locums despite an increase in the amount of consultant input and support
6057673 the intermittent unpredictable closure of the singleton service which is happening increasingly often is not in the best interest of patient safety

6057689 developers have been struggling for long not having a single platform and model that can help them develop applications for a variety of mobile phones
6057690 this move is just the latest in the growing trend by openstream and others to drive the speech and voice application business forward from its proprietary vertical roots into the horizontal world of standards based development and the contributions from openstream make it possible for more developers to take advantage of speech and multimodality in their applications

6057718 the abbey counselling centre is a new cover however the number advertised is that of the womens resource centre while we can work to expose this agency and its practices each time they reinvent themselves it is clear that regulations need to be set down to ensure that crisis pregnancy counselling is carried out in an ethical honest and compassionate way
6057719 we hope that our upcoming hearing with the oireachtas joint committee on health will further the development of legislation governing the operation of crisis pregnancy agencies this would close the legal loophole which allows these agencies to traumatise women facing a crisis pregnancy

6057731 im proudest of the impact of the record the thing that people dont talk about really is that it opened artists up to being themselves in a lot of ways they didnt have to try to figure out what to do or be to become stars they could just be themselves after n w a you didnt have to put on the polish to be a star

6057759 in medical research we have peer review which is a relatively stringent process this is not the same thing as open source
6057760 when we show our model researchers embrace it its taken a group think approach in a positive way for open source development in the medical field
6057761 a combination of two things is driving the open source movement in the medical field one is a growing interest in research collaboration the other is that a level of software sophistication to enhance medical collaboration is not there yet

6057770 the majority of closures of public toilets in the last 20 years has been due to the discretionary nature of the service coupled with the pressure on local authority finances

6057883 this was the use of sophisticated weapons against a small town against a sleeping people this was a barbaric assault
6057884 this is the man mr gorbachev who helped to you know bring down kgb kingdom and he is the one who is you know justifying what the kgb people are doing right now in my country
6057885 shame on him shame on you mr gorbachev for perpetuating the very regime you helped to defeat and you fought against as the head of the soviet union

6057894 i have to make myself look vulnerable to those people right now
6057895 he has said it will not solve our problem and that its not real
6057896 despite the urgency that mr mccain attached to the energy problem democrats noted that he had missed every vote on a 2007 energy bill that increased fuel economy standards for the first time in three decades mr mccain also missed all eight votes on a renewable energy bill that was defeated last month
6057897 john mccain has begun rallying dispirited republicans behind him while democratic rival barack obama has made scant progress building new support leaving the presidential race statistically tied the survey highlights obamas vulnerability on the question of his readiness to lead the nation less than half of the registered voters polled think the first term illinois senator has the right experience to be president while 80 believe mccain a four term senator does the poll also illustrates some racial undercurrents that confront obama as he strives to become the first african american president nine percent of voters say they would feel uncomfortable voting for a black candidate most voters say they know people who feel that way about one in six say the country is not ready to elect a black president
6057898 for now voters favor obama on the economy the issue they rank as most important also independents a crucial swing bloc are leaning toward obama and obamas supporters remain more enthusiastic than mccains a sign that the democratic candidate may be able to turn out more voters
6057899 obamas hesitant statement at the forum that defining the beginning of life is above my pay grade took even some supporters by surprise since then the national right to life committee has challenged him on an obscure law that protects babies born alive after failed abortions saying that his opposition to the measure in the illinois state legislature proves he is an extremist
6057900 mccains performance at the forum seemed to hearten many conservatives not only because of his firm uncompromising stand against abortion but his broader appeals on global warming genocide and the embrace of causes greater than self but the clarity that mccain exhibited at saddleback has been somewhat diminished with his suggestion that his running mate might favor abortion rights
6057901 in 2002 president bush signed a federal born alive law
6057902 but the illinois proposal always had a companion bill the accompanying legislation called the induced infant liability act would have allowed legal action on the childs behalf for damages including costs of care to preserve and protect the life health and safety of the child punitive damages and costs and attorneys fees against a hospital health care facility or health care provider who harms or neglects the child or fails to provide medical care to the child after the childs birth groups that favor abortion rights say that bill would have introduced the possibility that doctors could be sued for failing to take extraordinary measures to save the lives of pre viable infants those born so prematurely that they could not possibly survive as a result they argue it is disingenuous of anti abortion organizations to claim that mr obama was moving to quash only a narrow and innocuous definitional bill identical to federal law

6057924 ahora empezamos una nueva temporada y ojal podamos decir en un futuro que este sevilla de este a o es el mejor de todos los tiempos
6057925 es un equipo que tiene que ir paso a paso el objetivo principal es la liga de campeones es muy importante y si se consigue ser muy valioso pero tambi n soy consciente de que si est s entre los cuatro primeros como hace dos a os puedes tener opciones de luchar por algo m s y si queda margen para luchar claro que hay que ir a por la liga

6057938 i have plenty of space to improvise to try new ideas
6057939 we lit up your world like the fourth of july
6057940 theres a big part of america that really believes that there is a war on terrorism and that we need to finish up
6057941 so i thought it was beautiful the other day when obama went to afghanistan and got educated about afghanistan and iraq he came back and said some really nice things
6057942 so as far as leadership and patriotism goes i think its really important that those things have to take place and i think hes the best democratic candidate weve had since bill clinton and thats coming from a democrat
6057943 ah we nearly reached a record low in temperature last night

6057953 would have been completely in fully in support of the federal bill that everybody supported
6057954 i dont know whether he is lying or whether he forgot but with his words he is condemning himself
6057955 he voted one way and then covered it up and he has to explain that not just to me but to the american people
6057956 on the childs behalf for damages including costs of care to preserve and protect the life health and safety of the child punitive damages and costs and attorneys fees against a hospital health care facility or health care provider who harms or neglects the child or fails to provide medical care to the child after the childs birth
6057957 i can tell you the sponsors always wanted the entire package of bills which were introduced together and analyzed together
6057958 they never wanted them separated because they wanted to make sure that physicians would be chilled into not performing abortions for fear of going to jail
6057959 but when you take a definition comparable to the federal one and combine it with other provisions that attempt to give full personhood to a fetus that is pre viable and try to put fear of criminal and civil liability in the minds of physicians you have created a much different scenario
6057960 ontario can only cover a little bit of the issues that are around uranium

6057966 and really the results of most are common knowledge if one takes the time to think which we are all capable of
6057967 there is no greater risk of being struck from the rear when the subject vehicle is maintaining less than two seconds than having greater than two seconds following distance
6057968 incidents involving the subject rear ending the lead vehicle where the subject vehicle had less than two seconds of following distance was almost three times as common as those where the driver was maintaining a distance of two seconds or greater
6057969 this is partially due to the fact that more of the roads had only one or two lanes of same direction traffic
6057970 however it may also be due to the fact that the center lane has fewer traffic flow disturbances
6057971 industrial prices for petroleum and coal chemical products wood products and motor vehicles rose notably during the month

6058059 we are saying that we will not hand over any sudanese citizens to anyone for prosecution abroad
6058060 we are an independent state with an independent and fair judiciary system
6058061 we are bringing our case to galway to show people the terrible implications for people in galway as well as the north west of this poorly thought out strategy
6058062 ucgh is a great facility but is currently running at 108 per cent capacity has terrible parking problems and like a lot of irish hospitals is suffering from being under staffed and resourced yet from january if we dont stop this the hses plans up to an extra 12 000 people a year will have to be seen at galway this comprises about 7 000 from sligo general and around 5 000 from mayo general hospital
6058063 would endanger public safety by reason of traffic hazard because the access road servicing the site is seriously substandard in width and alignment structural strength and is inadequate to satisfactorily cater for the additional traffic movements likely to be generated by the development

6058065 there is considerable damage in ballyfarnon where three houses incuding the barracks were flooded and recently laid tarmacadam and footpaths have also been destroyed
6058066 there is also concern over the potential damage to the whole sewage treatment plant for ballyfarnon which has been submerged in flood water sandbags have been laid around the plant over the weekend and there is probably a lot of damage to the system but we wont know to what extent until a full assessment is made
6058067 it happened so fast within the space of a half an hour the river had burst its banks and began to flood the pitch and grounds at the community centre luckily there was nobody inside at the time because within 30 minutes the water began to come across the field and rise to three feet up the walls of the centre the force of the flooding broke a fence which fell on the other side of the road and lifted the tarmacadam and car park at the centre
6058068 then at around 10 30p m landslide from the geevagh mountain brought tonnes of black silt down into the field where the community centre is but it wasnt until thursday morning that we realised the extent of the damage
6058069 we have since been advised by an engineer that around 600 tonnes of silt lie on top of the pitch at present and there is still a threat of further damage if the rain and flooding continues

6058090 youre just petty politicians whod sooner sign onto the wisdom of a tyrant in another country than the demands of ticked off voters in your own
6058091 the point i made and ill make it again is that al qaeda functions on the basis that they think they can break our will thats their fundamental underlying strategy that if they can kill enough americans or cause enough havoc create enough chaos in iraq then well quit and go home and my statement was that if we adopt the pelosi policy that then we will validate the strategy of al qaeda i said it and i meant it
6058092 a political party cannot be all things to all people it must represent certain fundamental beliefs which must not be compromised to political expediency or simply to swell its numbers
6058093 oh no first of all if i took one vote away from a serious candidate it would be a sin

6058097 his judgement of a player is spot on so i have no problem trusting his opinion he also knows what i like and what we need
6058098 he tells me hes quick and can play on either wing although hes only 22 hes had plenty of experience so he seems well worth taking a chance on
6058099 im delighted to be signing for such a great club with great facilities great players and great ambition
6058100 rovers are a good side in some good form and theyve signed a couple of decent players
6058101 i think the fans want him to stay and for the length of time it has gone on it is hard to pre empt anything at this minute its not completely resolved
6058102 we realised last year we didnt have the numbers but i decided in january that having been knocked out of the fa cup that maybe with just the premier league to go for we could just go on with the squad we had
6058103 without the back door system we would have been more successful over the last 10 years
6058104 the system in place has definitely cost us a couple of all irelands
6058105 it is likely that you will have two teams in the final that came through the back door
6058106 i would like to see the back door system done away with altogether setanta readers comment of the day
6058107 this commitment by the minister to put the recommendations of this report forward as a white paper with a view to having a carers policy has to be welcomed this means that theres going to be a defined path for carers and the introduction of a carers strategy that will provide certain rights and entitlements for carers
6058108 there should be a carers needs assessment as soon as someone starts as a carer they shouldnt have to go out and source this and that there should be a scale of automatic entitlements depending on their circumstances to meet and support their needs
6058109 the work of roscommons family carers often goes unrecognised and unsupported we are urging those across roscommon to nominate their carer of the year in appreciation of the caring work carried out across the county for their loves ones those with special needs and those terminally ill
6058110 it was trippy man i was like really after being compared to jay leno for so long you dont think of yourself in that way
6058111 the holocaust where thousands of lgbt people trade unionists and disabled people were slaughtered
6058112 it wasnt about sleeping with minors it was about sleeping with bill eischeidt
6058113 i read your edu cons so i can grasp what the opposite of what happened to me is
6058114 ive covered sports all over hell and terra and i have see some really stupid crime and watched the media use the antics of poorly educated and ridiculously wealthy athletes of color trip over their jocks in spectacular ways o j and michael vick are two of the most glaring examples and some would recall doc gooden and darryl strawberry even mercury morris had his failures after swimming in an ocean of perfect success white athletes are often given attention in the media but what seems a moral pass roger clemens steve howe and art schlichter might be a documentary topics now and again on espn or the nfl network but o j and mike tyson are the devil incarnate
6058115 do this sometime dt figure out by percentage how many more youth pastors at white southern churches are fucking their sunday school classes than black pro athletes high school college and pro are being arrested for drug crimes assault or moving violations related to chemical impairment i bet your big blue eyes will roll out of your head
6058116 the dresses were recently donated by a local bridal boutiques end of line stock and as such are actually brand new and never worn before
6058117 the gowns are available in a range of sizes colours and styles from sleek modern designs to traditional fairytale dresses
6058118 we were also generously donated some gowns last year and that proved a great success too so we know from experience that brides to be will have to quick off the mark to snap up one of these newly donated wedding dresses
6058119 during the credit crunch anything that helps stretch your wedding budget is to be welcomed and even better if its ethical too by helping yourself to bargain for your big day you will also be helping others as oxfam ireland fights poverty and injustice in the developing world
6058120 i didnt want to go back to the doctors every four months for testing and squishing and everything
6058121 i just wanted to kind of get rid of this whole thing for me this was the choice that i made and it was a tough one
6058122 sometimes you know i cry and sometimes i scream and i get really angry and i get really upset you know into wallowing in self pity sometimes and i think that its all part of the healing
6058123 theres been lots of talk about it around here and its what the community here want it would be wonderful its something he deserves i dont think it would take mega bucks to turn it into a museum its time we recognised the talent we have here the way other countries do
6058124 it would be great if the council could buy it tourists already come down here to see the george best mural and go to the house so it would be great to turn it into something fitting there is so much memorabilia about george and people would travel from all over i think to see it
6058125 the mural already looks over the kids playing football and gives them inspiration as george looks over them i think this would also be an inspiration it would also give employment to the local area and boost the morale of the community it would really put east belfast on the map as a tourist destination it would be a great opportunity for the council
6058126 it would be interesting as a museum theres an awful lot of people coming through cregagh already ill raise it with council officials to see if it can be done
6058127 when we were flooded last year the rivers agency said they would come out every six weeks to clear the river to let it flow better but i havent seen them there is a lot of fly tipping and building material from nearby developments being dumped in the river blocking it that certainly didnt help on saturday we were trapped from the flooding coming in the back from the overflowing river and the sewage coming in from the front its been a nightmare we were knee deep in sewage it was disgusting
6058128 what if it rains again itll take no time before were flooded again
6058129 the flooding at sunderland road silvergrove home and montgomery road was caused in no small measure by obstructions placed in the river which prevented the free flow of water on the belfast side of the culvert
6058130 the rivers agency as a matter of urgency needs to live up to the promises that they have made in writing and on the telephone for the last four years and take action particularly within the 30m of the culvert on the sunderland side of montgomery road
6058131 they sat in my living room and said they would deal with it so well have to see its what happens now from here onwards thats whats important and thats what i told them i appreciate them coming but im still sceptical action on the ground is what is needed not just a one off appearance if they get it sorted well fair enough but if they dont well be on their case
6058132 the easy way to fix fill and seal virtually anything fast and make it last

6058135 the abbey counselling centre is a new cover however the number advertised is that of the womens resource centre while we can work to expose this agency and its practices each time they reinvent themselves it is clear that regulations need to be set down to ensure that crisis pregnancy counselling is carried out in an ethical honest and compassionate way
6058136 we hope that our upcoming hearing with the oireachtas joint committee on health will further the development of legislation governing the operation of crisis pregnancy agencies this would close the legal loophole which allows these agencies to traumatise women facing a crisis pregnancy
6058137 the award of 333 333 shares of news corp class a stock worth about 4 5 million as of tuesdays closing price helped lift mr ailess total compensation to 19 9 million for the fiscal year ended june 30

6058141 ive worked hard my whole life and did what i had to what i could to survive i didnt want to talk about it for a while because i didnt want people to gossip about it i didnt want people to make it out to be worse than it was
6058142 we kids made such a fuss over the dessert that my mother got the recipe from the cafe owners
6058143 there were no 18 wheelers just big trucks and the drivers knew where good food was to be had
6058144 because its easy and inexpensive and it can be stretched to serve 20

6058152 but a lot of it we cant control if theres a serious accident for instance 15 minutes before an officer goes off duty
6058153 its always good to hear that overtimes under control and crime is decreasing
6058154 it also gives everybody a chance to see what we have to offer
6058155 this pricing change significantly reduces the upfront cost of listing fixed price items on ebay and bases fees primarily on the successful sale of items
6058156 i felt that it was important to make this change now before the upcoming financing and the next stage of our company
6058157 i guided the company from its inception to a successful venture round and finally a tremendous public launch most people dont know that i started that almost two years ago and it is the appropriate time to hand the baton to a strategic dealmaker and growth leader

6058171 sushil kumar deserves the highest accolades for his achievement this is also the time for the government to consider an honour like bharat ratna for khashaba dadasaheb jadhav who had bagged indias first individual olympic bronze medal way back in 1952
6058172 as per the pay scales then my fathers last salary was rs 1 783 nearly 45 per month all his other dues including provident fund came to rs 75 000 which he invested to lay water pipeline in our ancestral farms
6058173 our financial condition was so bad that an amount of rs 5 000 unspent on the house had to be utilized for his final rites
6058174 there was no sponsorship no official help villagers helped with small individual contributions there was no professional coaching or a diet regimen they lived and travelled under pathetic conditions communications were poor this is the right time for the government to consider a major honour for k d jadhav
6058175 unfortunately our wrestlers only aim for the maharashtra kesri award

6058222 it is pretty obvious that the label change in 2007 was not adequate
6058223 we believe that amylin possessed data prior to the 2007 label revision that justified a stronger and more prominent warning than the precaution language that amylin ultimately negotiated with fda

6058233 beside and near objects so these words actually take on a concrete meaning for them
6058234 ready steady move lessons promote the vital mind body connection in childrens brains stimulating both right and left side brain functions for increased learning abilities along with better physical health
6058235 comprehension is immediate and long lasting because this type of learning creates more neural networks in the childs brain
6058236 another reason is that its simply more fun just watch children in a ready steady move lesson
6058237 in hungary like elsewhere children spend too much time watching television or sitting in front of a computer also because of the reduction in phys ed lessons in schools parents are enthused about enrolling their children in a fun all inclusive movement class that also helps them practice english
6058238 we plan to run ready steady move in budapest and the larger cities the first year with a projected target of 1000 2000 children hopefully doubling or even tripling that number in the coming year
6058239 our teachers are qualified movement specialists incorporating activities based on yoga martial arts and dance techniques they also have a proficiency in the target language and most importantly a sincere wish to better childrens lives
6058240 ready steady move is a quality program and candidate teachers undergo an intensive 2 3 day training seminar to receive certification they also receive plenty of non stop ongoing support and updates to make sure they keep on doing their very best

6058243 smiling is a way of tricking your brain into thinking that everythings ok even if its not
6058244 people who are mildly depressed should do their best to show the world a happy face as that will improve peoples reaction to you and lift your mood
6058245 we know of many psychiatrists who have only a rudimentary knowledge of the brain and its workings
6058246 we do not agree with the usual advice to keep taking your medication and eventually all will be well because doctor knows best
6058247 we challenge many of the conventions in the treatment of mental illness particularly the way that patients are prescribed medication without any diagnostic tests being carried out

6058256 derogatory comments profanity impede another guests view of the field or cover any stadium signage
6058257 all banners signs and flags are prohibited in scott stadium
6058258 as for relating this to last year i think it may
6058259 i sincerely regret the confusion over last years incident if it did in fact play a role in this decision
6058260 while its disappointing to see all signs banned i suspect the move was made to avoid any misinterpretation regarding the sign policy
6058261 im not sure it infringes on our freedom of speech as the athletic department has the power to regulate what is allowed to enter the athletic venues
6058262 the policy change is intended to support and promote sportsmanship in a positive game day environment for all fans in attendance

6058274 without the back door system we would have been more successful over the last 10 years
6058275 the system in place has definitely cost us a couple of all irelands

6058320 first as a current affairs journalist but also as someone who got to the heart of the sporting world thats so important in wales
6058321 he combined great knowledge and enthusiasm with humour and wit
6058322 bob had an unmistakable and distinctive style that brought him a huge following throughout wales
6058323 we realise that carols shoes are extremely difficult ones to fill as she has done such an amazing job on countdown over the past 25 years
6058324 however just as we found carol through an ad in a local paper we really hope we can do the same again and find another outstanding mathematical mastermind we know many countdown viewers have great heads for numbers so we are looking forward to seeing how talented they really are
6058325 there were no wild swings there isnt one group that is radically different than last month or even two months ago it was just a steady decline for obama across the board
6058326 where no surcharge and no steering rules have existed in other systems the board has encouraged their removal on the grounds that these rules can diminish competition in the payments system
6058327 consistent with this the bank will shortly be holding discussions with paypal with a view to seeking the removal of these rules
6058328 over the years every time there is a major election we have had people attempt to put up a listing we catch them very quickly
6058329 when we see these listings we definitely take them down
6058330 its possible that someone would put a listing up its possible to be up for a couple of hours before we catch it its possible that for a brief period of time something might actually be visible on the site
6058331 we are very clear if you engage in illegal activity on our site we absolutely will share information with law enforcement we provide testimony in court
6058332 and what this person was proposing was probably not so feasible unrealistic
6058333 i dont think it will happen more and more as the elections are approaching
6058334 its not anything thats widespread or cause for concern in any way
6058335 people are just looking for an audience they are really using that listing as an opportunity to put their opinion on there
6058336 we have had instances that would be similar in nature where we have sports fan who are really unhappy with the performance of their favorite team and they may try to list the coach for sale as a way to express their unhappiness with the performance of their team
6058337 they are trying to ensure teams present themselves in the best possible light i understand where the rule comes from but to suspend players is wrong
6058338 they are trying to ensure teams present themselves in the best possible light i understand where the rule comes from but to suspend players is wrong
6058339 the best values from trusted sellers become better and better
6058340 i have no control i have to comply with anything they choose to do and i have no voice in the matter
6058341 id be giving up a months income to get that done thats the only thing thats keeping me on ebay the inconvenience of leaving
6058342 i talk to other people who have done what i did and theyre happy with their decision theyve been able to get their business to the ebay business levels or beyond
6058343 many times you feel like theyre really pushing it to see if youll give them some kind of a refund
6058344 theyll float the suggestion that this isnt exactly what i expected
6058345 when ebay makes these dramatic changes it can make you very nervous
6058346 but again ebay is doing what ebay believes it has to do to protect its marketplace
6058347 weve been on this path for the last few years
6058348 theres no doubt this year has seen some very very bold changes necessarily so and entirely reflective of what our buyers and sellers want
6058349 i dont think anything can surpass ebay in terms of choice but e commerce is now mainstream we see our competitive set as a broad one anywhere where a buyer can buy stuff online that might be amazon or the more traditional bricks and clicks but the big advantage we have is choice mums sitting alongside entrepreneurs sitting alongside big retailers
6058350 i think theres room for everybody at the end of the day having big brands on there helps legitimise ebay as a marketplace having big retailers on there makes it more exciting as a buying experience
6058351 we hope to see significant increase in the choice our sellers give to buyers
6058352 if you are a buyer and searching on ebay youll have far more chance of finding what you are looking for in a credit crunch environment its far easier to shop around online for a bargain than it is offline
6058353 any change to the site that benefits one seller automatically disadvantages others the sellers who are disadvantaged will always shout the loudest
6058354 ebay has realised there is quite a lot of fear among sellers
6058355 they are realising that sellers are ebay customers too and listening to their customers
6058356 people forget the internet has changed when ebay started out a lot was taken on trust and people were sending envelopes stuffed with dollars across the atlantic now with instant payments buyers are expecting better service and almost instant delivery
6058357 if ebay doesnt take steps to ensure its sellers are providing the right level of service and customer satisfaction it will fail buyers will go to amazon or argos instead amazon is doing really well and sellers are flocking to amazon you can buy almost anything on ebay the challenge is to make sure you can carry on doing that and maintain a good level of service its a hard tightrope to walk
6058358 poland and u states intend to enhance their security through cooperation in the following areas political and military cooperation information sharing defense industrial and research and technological operations
6058359 the physical platform that we are creating is for the 21st century and this is the first deep water port to be built in the uk in the 21st century
6058360 we aim to be the most competitive marketplace online and this new incredibly low pricing helps us achieve that goal
6058361 a 35 cent listing fee virtually eliminates the upfront cost for sellers to put more of their great inventory on ebay and creates more opportunity than ever for sellers to build successful businesses
6058362 we love auctions auction style listings remain the ideal choice for sellers who are uncertain about the value of their item have a scarce item in high demand or are willing to start at a low price and let bidding determine the final value
6058363 we realized there was such interest and excitement in these categories to do with height that it was too important a category for us to leave it to a doctor alone
6058364 so we decided to tighten things up completely to make sure there was no doubt
6058365 he has gone on record saying he doesnt want to be bothered basically he doesnt want the fame and publicity that comes with being the worlds tallest man
6058366 whether or not thats the real reason im not sure but thats what hes told us
6058367 why doesnt he just take out that laser pistol thingy or the whip he used in his other movies
6058368 online learning is a crowded field and students must be able to trust the website that provides access to online bachelors degree
6058369 we ensure that all courses are accredited and that the institutions are reliable and recognized
6058370 he pees up in the air in a big arc so it goes in the coin slot and out the hole where people collect their tickets
6058371 i couldnt stand properly i wasnt aware of what i was doing
6058372 i dont want to be known forever as the piddler on the roof
6058373 boris johnson is immensely proud of what young british athletes have achieved in beijing
6058374 their success is a tribute to their sense of ambition determination and self discipline
6058375 these are the qualities he is keen to encourage in teenagers across london where a lack of purpose discipline and self esteem lead many to wasted lives and violence
6058376 david cameron is right to highlight that serious and destructive social breakdown
6058377 politicians who pretend there is not a problem are complacent and should recognise that there is a huge challenge if every teenager is to fulfil their potential as our athletes have managed this week
6058378 if you believe the politicians we have a broken society in which the courage and morals of young people have been sapped by welfarism and political correctness
6058379 and if you look at what is happening at the beijing olympics you can see what piffle that is
6058380 i dont think the british people have ever been broken by anything or anyone
6058381 we are not surprised by the us reaction as our scientific achievements have always been denied by the americans
6058382 today we are strengthening our commitment by adding 40 million to help the palestinian authority overcome the financial difficulties it is facing
6058383 i hope that other donors will continue to make every effort to fulfill their pledges or even go beyond as we do today
6058384 if not the situation of the palestinian authority will continue to be precarious
6058385 ban ki moon plans to come to myanmar in the last week of december but this time the trip will be focused on politics
6058386 economic collapse scenarios which the negative trend of economic indicators simply continues are however exaggerated
6058387 the financial market experts have for good reason not been impressed by the negative gross domestic product gdp growth rate in the second quarter of 2008
6058388 overall they reckon with a weaker but all in all robust economic development and rightly do not fear a recession
6058389 amnesty international has written to egypts president hosny mubarak this week urging him to end the use of lethal force against african migrants attempting to cross egypts the borders into israel
6058390 to date none of those tried have been allowed access to united nations high commissioner for refugees unhcr representatives in egypt despite the fact that many are considered to be refugees or asylum seekers in need of international protection
6058391 we thought musharrafs resignation will bring stability and calm but it looks like the turf battle between the coalition partners will set towards another path of instability
6058392 the agitation will be a warning to the government not to pamper the corporates and speculators both domestic and foreign at the cost of the rights and livelihoods of the toiling people
6058393 we have organized this strike to protest against the privatization merger and consolidation of public sector banks
6058394 we have to await the formal letter on the supreme courts rulings
6058395 before i thought the execution could be carried out before the fasting month but not anymore
6058396 we have to await the formal letter on the supreme courts rulings
6058397 before i thought the execution could be carried out before the fasting month but not anymore
6058398 if there are five blokes to every girl we should find out where there are beauty disadvantaged women and ask them to proceed to mount isa
6058399 quite often you will see walking down the street a lass who is not so attractive with a wide smile on her face
6058400 whether it is recollection of something previous or anticipation for the next evening there is a degree of happiness
6058401 theres a great incentive because theres that much attention focused on them and they become interested in looking better and in no time they just shed it
6058402 it paints the women here as second rate and suggests that the men will settle for anything he has put everyone down
6058403 i think the women who turned up at that protest rally tonight are beauty disadvantaged themselves and they cant get over it so they attack me
6058404 the availability of the super tucano will make a positive contribution to pilot training in the chilean air force
6058405 however police and paramilitary troops have been deployed in large numbers to avoid any untoward incident
6058406 we have found the severed head and limbs of the suspected bomber which have been sent to the forensic lab for dna testing
6058407 my clients the sponsors and broadcasters are happy with the positive view that the olympics is about sport and the focus is quite rightly on that
6058408 the resolution of these protests were through dialogue and communication
6058409 this is the way we like to deal with things in chinese culture chinese culture always emphasises harmony
6058410 we categorically reject that any sudanese be tried outside sudan we will never surrender any citizen to be tried abroad
6058411 the attempt to use the so called international justice against the country is an attempt to encourage rebel groups opposing peace to continue destruction and destabilisation to topple the regime in sudan
6058412 its own judicial institutions and is capable of trying anyone who violates justice
6058413 that the suffering in darfur must definitely stop that human rights must be respected and that the sudanese government should make great efforts to that end
6058414 are we there yet are we there yet are we there yet
6058415 day am is gots ta get me summa dat issue

6058420 what if you had a magical superpower and it hated your guts
6058421 i slept with nic and all i got was this stupid t shirt and a funny itch wait there was also some burning
6058422 it is a wise and prudent move the market is going through a period of uncertainty now but the chances of the market picking up in the next four years is quite high
6058423 they certainly have the capacity to wait it out and the four years gives them the option of working out the best possible strategy
6058424 will have the strongest product offering in semiconductors and platforms for mobile applications
6058425 an important supplier to nokia samsung sony ericsson lg and sharp
6058426 st is expected to exercise its option to buy nxps 20 percent of st nxp wireless before the closing of this transaction
6058427 the mobile phone industry is very much controlled by nokia ericsson has to do something to compete
6058428 ericsson is becoming more and more a pure network company the first step was the spinning off of the sony ericsson mobile phone part and now they are doing the same thing with the mobile phone platform part
6058429 in a business where scale matters the complementary product portfolios contributed by the parent companies will deliver significant scale and synergies by leveraging and expanding the existing strategic cooperation
6058430 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
6058431 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
6058432 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
6058433 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state

6058455 life is like a bicycle to keep your balance your must keep on moving
6058456 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
6058457 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
6058458 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
6058459 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
6058460 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
6058461 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
6058462 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
6058463 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
6058464 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
6058465 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
6058466 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
6058467 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
6058468 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
6058469 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
6058470 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
6058471 he was australias answer to the crazy frog but psycho teddys ringtone frenzy has been toned down after protests from a mental health charity
6058472 hes cute hes cuddly hes a great dancer but he is also insane dont call him at a bad time or you may trigger a psychotic episode
6058473 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
6058474 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
6058475 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
6058476 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
6058477 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
6058478 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
6058479 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come

6058486 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
6058487 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
6058488 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
6058489 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
6058490 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
6058491 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
6058492 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
6058493 who are open to doing something on the production side
6058494 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
6058495 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
6058496 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
6058497 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
6058498 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
6058499 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
6058500 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
6058501 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
6058502 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
6058503 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
6058504 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
6058505 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
6058506 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
6058507 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
6058508 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
6058509 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
6058510 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
6058511 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
6058512 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
6058513 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
6058514 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on

6058523 there can be no business as usual with russia under present circumstances
6058524 this is the next frontier in assuring workplaces are safe
6058525 its not just for me but for the people you drive
6058526 we feel our health benefits and sick leave benefits are competitive and we feel good about it
6058527 very often these are the jobs where people are living very close to the bone
6058528 workers are sometimes putting their jobs on the line because they have a sick child or are sick
6058529 if we live in a society where all adults are working then we need to have a workplace to accommodate that reality
6058530 theres been some concern that employees are abusing the ordinance theres been a little bit of that but not as widespread as people thought at the beginning
6058531 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
6058532 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
6058533 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
6058534 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
6058535 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
6058536 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
6058537 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
6058538 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
6058539 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
6058540 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
6058541 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
6058542 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
6058543 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
6058544 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
6058545 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
6058546 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
6058547 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
6058548 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
6058549 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
6058550 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
6058551 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
6058552 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
6058553 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
6058554 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
6058555 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
6058556 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
6058557 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
6058558 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
6058559 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
6058560 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
6058561 these pirates are not afraid to use significant firepower in attempts to bring vessels under their control
6058562 it is clear that the threat or presence of coalition navies has done little to stem the tide of attacks in this region
6058563 i donated to the obama campaign because i was so excited and thrilled to hear him speak
6058564 i like what he says and i like what he represents and its a world stage today for any political leader
6058565 it was an error of me to give the donation and it was an error that it was accepted
6058566 consistently review our procedures to make sure that we are taking every reasonable step to ensure that the contributions we receive are appropriate and follow fec guidelines and we will do so again in light of this new information
6058567 were always looking for ways to best comply with all provisions of campaign finance regulations and obviously take swift action anytime flags are raised regarding potentially problematic campaign contributions

6058591 so this was the choice i made and it was a tough one
6058592 sometimes you know i cry and sometimes i scream and i get really angry and i get really like you know into wallowing in self pity sometimes
6058593 and i think thats its all part of healing and anyone whos going through it out there its ok to cry its ok to fall on the ground and just scream if you want to

6058595 recently i have experienced an increase in organizations questioning how real is the threat of internet terrorism and what they can do to protect themselves

6058598 sometimes you know i cry and sometimes i scream and i get really angry and i get really like you know into wallowing in self pity sometimes
6058599 and i think thats its all part of healing and anyone whos going through it out there its ok to cry its ok to fall on the ground and just scream if you want to

6058603 id love a half cent tax rate reduction or even more a penny but i dont want us to cripple ourselves in the deal
6058604 i just wanted to kind of be rid of it
6058605 so this was the choice i made and it was a tough one
6058606 sometimes you know i cry and sometimes i scream and i get really angry and i get really like you know into wallowing in self pity sometimes
6058607 and i think thats its all part of healing and anyone whos going through it out there its ok to cry its ok to fall on the ground and just scream if you want to
6058608 i love living and i really love my life and i knew that from this moment on it was only going to be good that was going to be coming
6058609 i was ready at this time in my life to do some other things and i got tired of doing some of the things i had been doing for over 30 years
6058610 it means a lot to her and i was getting tired of it
6058611 phased retirement is currently akin to motherhood and apple pie win win for everybody
6058612 that said it is relevant only for employers who are seeing potential shortages of experienced workers
6058613 we were looking for officers and upper management was looking for ways to retain skills and experience
6058614 the irs merely asking the question how should this be administered raised questions in the minds of employers
6058615 if the irs is asking how to administer the ppa how are plan sponsors to know how to administer it
6058616 no evidence that workers who retire gradually are happier than those who retire cold turkey
6058617 the big goal should be keeping people working longer and educating people on the skills and strengths of older workers rather than fighting this battle
6058618 as long as an employee wants to work here this will be a way to allow them to work
6058619 if any hospital administrator tells you they can make cuts in staff without impacting patient care advertisement theyre lying to you
6058620 our balance sheet is stronger than it has ever been
6058621 the builders are now having to lower prices to be competitive with the resales
6058622 thats why i think we are seeing a little more impact on the new homes youre sitting there with a developer who has a lot of inventory up there thats costing them money day to day at the bank
6058623 if you normally have a higher ratio of sales in the upper price classes but thats just not selling now then that can skew your median price more than the norm
6058624 i just wanted to kind of be rid of it
6058625 so this was the choice i made and it was a tough one
6058626 sometimes you know i cry and sometimes i scream and i get really angry and i get really like you know into wallowing in self pity sometimes
6058627 and i think thats its all part of healing and anyone whos going through it out there its ok to cry its ok to fall on the ground and just scream if you want to
6058628 i love living and i really love my life and i knew that from this moment on it was only going to be good that was going to be coming

6058723 their success is a tribute to their sense of ambition determination and self discipline
6058724 these are the qualities he is keen to encourage in teenagers across london where a lack of purpose discipline and self esteem lead many to wasted lives and violence
6058725 david cameron is right to highlight that serious and destructive social breakdown
6058726 politicians who pretend there is not a problem are complacent and should recognise that there is a huge challenge if every teenager is to fulfil their potential as our athletes have managed this week
6058727 if you believe the politicians we have a broken society in which the courage and morals of young people have been sapped by welfarism and political correctness

6058746 montags prose is thoughtful and unhurried opening out into moments of beauty and wry humor echoing in its quiet rhythms and low key observations the gentle roll of the rich midwestern landscape he loves he celebrates the countrys most overlooked and underestimated region and movingly portrays his hardworking and loving parents
6058747 this ben fellow teaches us to see in new ways and to consider possibilities we hadnt counted upon ben would be a little monk with an ancient wisdom who wanders the modern world and says things that sound like poems
6058748 the middlewestern farmer and the buddhist monk would find much to talk of and i think each would understand the others silences
6058749 i was able to visualize a literal blossoming as the poems moved from observations of snow shifting across roadways and fields to the warmth of spring the emergence of new life and on to the intense clear blue sky heat of summer montag provides an incredible journey across time and season that any true midwesterner can actually feel in their skin montags strength in this work is his brevity and concise use of language with a special ability to create strong and lasting images through his choice of details
6058750 tom montag has a gentle style you get the sense as you read this that here is a wise man not a perfect man but a good man and he is letting us into his house and his life for a few moments each day so we can experience the richness that is his i look forward to reading whatever montag writes in the future

6058753 we cant have strong enforcement of our clean air laws unless we know what polluters are putting into the air
6058754 these poems are filled with a sane decent clear eyed melancholy the world and our life has limits and we reach them these things that weigh me down ill have to start giving away thats mark vinzs great gift to readers memories of rooms people landscapes loved and named with clarity and affection interior travels where the past finds wisdom in clouds grass kitchens backroads
6058755 movement in three sections of mark vinzs newest collection of poems is the interplay between life roads more traveled and frosts less traveled road the familiar wide roads of love labor father and motherhood family history and genealogy of place form a cohesive neighborhood of subjects from which the poet as lone traveler creates poems that harbor nostalgia for ordered respectful human relations these true to prairie life landscape works stand as testaments to plains folk character and fortitude in a short tender work vinz describes the planting of lilacs on the plains when they came west the women brought them gifts perhaps from mothers to daughters they knew theyd never see again for beautys sake a piece of home a shady place to nurture children reminders of whats lost or hidden of all that couldnt be cut down these lines serve as a metaphor for the poets own work practicing in the west a rather barren place according to some the poet plants hardy works in collections like long distance works that nurture that beautify that will last
6058756 vinz isnt miltonic his topics come from close at hand he considers stuff that we all see but brings it closer and in doing so fulfills robert penn warrens stricture that literature broaden and deepen the readers understanding of life gee i went and blew an entire column on mark vinz what better way to do it
6058757 mark vinz talks to us of family landscape work memory travel and kitchens in his new collection
6058758 peter had come into the room with the friend whod driven him to the library and he took his place at the table
6058759 when i looked over at him it was as if a nimbus enveloped him he seemed almost as if he were an angel he sat at the table and smiled i dont usually see halos around people so i was intrigued i walked over and introduced myself and who are you i asked him im peter he said
6058760 i had hoped peter could write his own story and put the bits of memory into chronological order on his own he tried but wasnt very successful at it because he was nearly blind writing was difficult for him and the pages were nearly impossible for me to read and because he is essentially an oral story teller and not a writer the narratives were cramped and crooked and didnt have the flair of his telling nor the color of his inflection peter is italian and you might say he talks with his hands
6058761 i realized that if peters story was going to be told as it deserved to be peter needed more than my advice and while i really didnt need another project at that point his was a story worth telling so i interviewed him at length about his life
6058762 it was clear that this was not going to be autobiography with a straight ahead push there would be starts and stops and overlaps my task was to transcribe peters remembering so that it would be both engaging and accurate i wanted to retain the sound of peters voice in the telling yet i had to make the prose readable on the page i massaged the oral narratives so that theyd work on the page i arranged and re arranged the discrete elements trying to create a coherent whole an arc of greater meaning because so much went on in such a short time during his early years and because there was overlap in his telling i was not been able to fashion an exact chronological version of peters life but stayed with the chronology to the extent that i was able this version of peters story is as accurate as it is humanly possible to make it and where the actual chronology may vary i think this doesnt distort the truth of peters life this is not fictionalized memoir but a telling as true as we could make it
6058763 you may wonder why i did not worry that peter was just making this stuff up
6058764 i did consider that early on yet there has been such an internal consistency in his telling that i am convinced this is indeed peters story to the best that he can remember it he may not have been aware of it or maybe he was but i laid little traps for him i would say you remember when you told me about such and such tell me more about that and he would recount the incident and it was the same story and he might give me additional details i didnt have i might ask him a question i already knew the answer to and he gave me the same answer several months later sometimes in telling an entirely different incident hed make passing reference to another event and frame it the same way and highlight the same details as i had already heard if i have been conned i have been conned by a master i am convinced that to the extent it is humanly possible this is peters life as he remembers it
6058765 i have waited a long time for this book by phil hey
6058766 philip hey distills thirty plus years of life in poems that take flight at every moments crossroad in order to preserve the hard daily lives of men and women who are living scant but like the farmers wife who buys day lilies with egg money learn to flower in the midst of such neglect often writing with humor sometimes with irony but always with unflinching directness hey builds a scaffolding to carry us through the trials of being human entangling us by immersion in sensual particulars poems in how it seems to me show how pleasure is derived from the physical world by a carpenter who cuts red cedar just for the smell of it or the workman who holds drill bits to the light to admire silver to counter human isolation hey celebrates moments of communion on the back porch with his grandfather to exchange a few last moments with the sun or sitting at a diners chromecraft table immersed in the smell of fried fish deeply rooted in place poems describe the auction of a farm where a whole life is parceled out a dollar at a time playing pool at sharkeys a game of horse with an aging basketball star and men working in engine shops who take the time to do it right heys poems are messengers of shadow but also messengers of light when he depicts men surrounded by fuel pumps and carburetors in a used car parts shop as they drink beer and smoke cigars or old men who work concrete dip snuff and are happy showing us that we must pray for the things of this world this impressive collection of living glowing poems teach our hearts to persevere
6058767 these poems bring the ordinary world so thoroughly in accord with the thinking feeling human mind that it is impossible to tell where one starts and the other ends hey respects things in themselves and depicts them with language of perfect simplicity and accuracy yet in his hands conversations overheard places discovered on the road found objects and the events of everyday life become gifts and graces occasions for a finely tuned emotional and intellectual response and an uncommon depth and wisdom like the short wave radio buff in one of the poems hey traverses the subtleties of the bands with an ear of perfect pitch the result is absolute clarity no static
6058768 enthusiastically recommended reading how it seems to me is a collection showcasing 76 of phil heys very special poems celebrating hard lives small joys and memorable landscapes

6058852 it certainly would be my view that with the sort of record that hes got he shouldnt be travelling anywhere in the world
6058853 i want gary glitter to be controlled whilst hes here and i dont want him to be able to go anywhere else in the world in order to abuse children

6058864 i think the boys have been disappointed with the last fortnight so that is all you can really ask of the guys
6058865 in the last two weeks we have gone away from the game plan that won us those six or seven wins as long as the guys out there play their role then you know the team will benefit from that
6058866 i think we can do that on friday and although it will be an uphill battle the bulldogs have not set the world on fire either at the moment
6058867 we have only got two games left so hopefully the guys will respond to that and make the most of what is left of the season
6058868 i havent put any expectations or any added pressure on myself i just want to enjoy it for what it is
6058869 i hope to be able to contribute to the side like knighta wants me to do
6058870 i am a little bit nervous because i havent played for so long but we went through the team tactics and rules and set ups on tuesday and im pretty confident that i have got my head around it
6058871 it is an opportunity for me to show my leadership
6058872 i guess with my personality i tend to let other people take the lead if there are other people around but when those people arent around i am quite prepared to step up
6058873 i am actually looking forward to that challenge and have been enjoying that role in the vfl for the past two weeks
6058874 were dealing with a weakening economy in the second half of this year and early 09 doesnt look that great either
6058875 we dont have any numbers that really show stabilization in the housing market yet
6058876 coming from a person occupying the responsible post of a minister in a state the remark is deplorable and should be condemned by all the remark should be withdrawn immediately and the minister should tender an unqualified apology to the people of bihar
6058877 though the ministers unwarranted remark has not lowered our respect for the state or its people it merits to be denounced and an apology from naik would be in place biharis are not beggars but have earned respect and status and done our state proud through sheer merit and hard work

6058881 i started my own farming in 1969 with 50 acres of land and today i grow grapes on 14 000 acres out of which 10 000 acres is owned by me and the rest is on lease
6058882 as an individual i am the biggest producer of raisins in the world
6058883 my biggest target is to provide maximum employment to the needy i love doing a job where i can absorb more and more people in farming alone i have employed 100 200 people
6058884 absolutely 100 percent clear and clean it did not spread they got everything out so im definitely not going to die from breast cancer
6058885 sometimes i scream and i get really angry and i get really into wallowing in self pity sometimes and i think its all part of healing
6058886 i just wanted to kind of be rid of this whole thing for me this was the choice that i made and it was a tough one
6058887 deze fotoshoot is veel persoonlijker je ziet veel meer de lieke die mijn vriendje ook ziet

6058894 recent history has been one of growing demand for u s commodities tight u s and world stocks of feed grains and wheat sporadic production problems and record high prices
6058895 with record large feed grain wheat and soybean crops expected for 2008 09 and some cracks forming in the demand picture prices may take on a weaker tone
6058896 in addition prices are not expected to return to the average level experienced in the period 1973 through 2006 however with the much higher level of production costs for 2009 prices below the early august lows of 4 50 for corn and 11 50 for soybeans would begin to substantially reduce operator returns particularly for those with relatively high land costs
6058897 factors thought to be important for prices have provided very mixed signals for price direction
6058898 usdas expanded survey coverage for the august report should make the acreage estimate a bit more accurate than usual
6058899 still harvested acreage reflects intentions and with more than a normal amount of late planted and re planted crops as well as unplanted areas estimates could change on the surface the usda estimates seem to capture the effect of abandoned acreage
6058900 the august u s average yield forecast for soybeans was well below that indicated by crop condition ratings and our crop weather models perhaps reflecting the lateness of the crop
6058901 regional yield forecasts within states appear to be very consistent with weather patterns to date
6058902 in illinois both corn and soybean average yields are expected to be well above the 2007 averages in the southern two crop reporting district where drought was an issue last year
6058903 yields of both crops are expected to be sharply lower in the east crop reporting district where flooding was more widespread this spring
6058904 yield forecasts may remain high after that if some late season rain is received in the dry areas and if the crop reaches maturity without a widespread killing frost
6058905 soybean yield prospects are more difficult to anticipate particularly since the august forecast was lower than suggested by other indicators
6058906 parts of the eastern corn belt have been dry in august but much of the delta has received beneficial precipitation the crop is more vulnerable than corn to late season disease and insect pressure and cooler weather in august may have hampered development
6058907 declining energy prices and a sharp drop in ethanol prices mean that the breakeven corn prices for ethanol producers are now much lower
6058908 prospects of large world supplies of feed wheat and a strengthening of the u s dollar suggest that u s corn exports could continue to be a little sluggish
6058909 liquidation of livestock numbers may slow but liquidation that has already occurred may slow domestic feed demand as well

6058960 nosotros sospechamos de un sector pero yo no lo puedo decir suponemos que las amenazas vienen de aquellos para quienes la labor de la personer a en el tema de la defensa de los derechos humanos causa malestar
6058961 si hablamos de los derechos a la salud se molestan las eps si hablamos del derecho al trabajo o a la vivienda se molestan otros si hablamos del derecho a la seguridad se molestan los grupos armados
6058962 de hecho hace alg n tiempo tuvimos que acoger a los personeros de caldono y torib o cauca por amenazas graves contra su vida al uno lo amenazaba la guerrilla y al otro las autodefensas tambi n conocimos de amenazas en contra de la personera de argelia antioquia y de otros municipios del oriente
6058963 los rusos una y otra vez mueven sus tanques hacia tsjinvali la capital de osetia del sur desde gori y luego de vuelta niego que esto corresponda a un retiro

6058967 i think the fans want him to stay and for the length of time it has gone on it is hard to pre empt anything at this minute its not completely resolved
6058968 we realised last year we didnt have the numbers but i decided in january that having been knocked out of the fa cup that maybe with just the premier league to go for we could just go on with the squad we had
6058969 without the back door system we would have been more successful over the last 10 years
6058970 the system in place has definitely cost us a couple of all irelands
6058971 it is likely that you will have two teams in the final that came through the back door
6058972 i would like to see the back door system done away with altogether setanta readers comment of the day
6058973 we warned these whores but they did not stop their business
6058974 we have sent the bodies for autopsy they were shot dead and the face of one woman was brutally mutilated

6058985 polls do indicate that the next election is in all likelihood a minority one way or the other
6058986 the fact of the matter is what i will have to decide over the next few weeks is whether or not we can have a productive fall session of parliament or whether in fact the government needs a new mandate
6058987 i will assess it this fall we are during the summer and there are byelections to win
6058988 have to make a judgment in the next little while
6058989 they have no intention of respecting the fixed election date
6058990 so i think obviously were going to have to judge how the parliamentary agenda is unfolding
6058991 and today he said that this government is so terrible that it should be removed from office at any time hes just not sure when
6058992 harpers telling you hes not going to wait for an election
6058993 we are deeply saddened that leroi moore saxophonist and founding member of dave matthews band died unexpectedly tuesday afternoon august 19 2008 at hollywood presbyterian medical center in los angeles from sudden complications stemming from his june atv accident on his farm near charlottesville virginia leroi had recently returned to his los angeles home to begin an intensive physical rehabilitation program
6058994 its a movie that would definitely lend itself to seeing further adventures
6058995 lets do death race 2 i had a terrific time working with this group of people pauls terrific if they want to make another one then im in
6058996 we did the movie that is the beginning of roger cormans original death race 2000 the genesis of the death race that is portrayed in that 1975 film
6058997 if you watch this movie you can imagine how that would develop into what roger portrayed
6058998 but there are aspects to the first movie that we havent really addressed in this movie
6058999 for example in the first movie you run people down for points in this movie certainly lots of people get run down you just dont score points if we did do another movie i would like to address that if this develops into a franchise it would be slowly building towards what rogers movie was it feels like that movie actually takes place about 20 years after the events of this movie

6059005 i was upset about the part of me being sold for 2 million
6059006 at times like this nobody is trying to sell me i could have come out and said oh yeah cam got bought out but i didnt go that route they just gotta watch me move we gonna make it hot
6059007 im just gonna say a lot of big records i was on a good portion of those records or asked to be on a good portion of those records that lil wayne was on along with him not like they asked me before they asked him or vice versa i know i was on a good portion of those records cause the i cant feel my face thing we were pushing that hard people wanted to get both of us i couldnt go as far as the clearances i could do my verse then it got to the point where i couldnt go there with people because i didnt want them to think that it was me being the bad guy not clearing stuff i didnt want that on my name so i would let people know i cant really if you wanna just put it out on the mixtapes we could do that all day the fans definitely missed out on a lot of juelz due to my contract
6059008 i tell people i couldnt do business with him but i will say he gave me the biggest chance i needed im a dude from the hood so the chance he gave me is a chance i needed to never turn back im good my artistry my talent my career was never built on controversy so i would never come out and say a whole bunch of things that could be said all i can say is im sorry he cant be here to be a part of whats about to happen because were about to tear em up

6059011 its no hard feelings and now that im out of my situation i dont mind putting a diplomat album together
6059012 at first people kinda looked at us like damn whats going on
6059013 they looking at us like were disloyal but as the time went by its kinda like what we gonna do just die out because the dude that was supposed to be the boss and the head of the table decided to disappear that means we would have vanished along with that we from harlem baby we hustlers were gonna stay afloat were not even floating right now were surfing we not even surfing im the ocean

6059027 treatment of prostate cancer with radiotherapy should the entire seminal vesicles be included in the clinical target volume
6059028 a randomized comparison of interfraction and intrafraction prostate motion with and without abdominal compression
6059029 although significant prostate displacement can occur between treatments the typical range of movement seen along a major axis was less than 5 mm proper treatment planning should consider the movement of the target independent of surrounding bony anatomy
6059030 changes in prostate position of this magnitude preclude the use of standard margins
6059031 prostatic displacement during a course of radiotherapy is more pronounced among patients with initial planning scans with large rectal and bladder volumes such patients may require more generous margins around the ctv to assure its enclosure within the prescription dose region
6059032 margins between the ctv and ptv based on the simple geometric requirement that a point on the edge of the ctv is enclosed by the ptv 95 of the time are 0 7 cm in the lateral and cranial caudal directions and 1 1 cm in the anterior posterior direction however minimum dose to the ctv and avoidance of organs at risk are more important considerations when drawing beam apertures more consistent methods for reproducing prostate position e g empty rectum and more sophisticated beam aperture optimization are needed to guarantee consistent coverage of the ctv while avoiding organs at risk
6059033 target motion occurs during the course of treatment planning and delivery and should be considered when designing conformal radiation fields
6059034 changes in the location of the prostate seminal vesicles and normal tissue volumes during the course of radiation therapy occur and have dosimetric consequences that may impact tumor control and normal tissue complication probabilities

6059057 phase ii dose escalation study of image guided adaptive radiotherapy for prostate cancer use of dose volume constraints to achieve rectal isotoxicity
6059058 in intermediate and high risk prostate cancer patients although it appears that radiation dose escalation may improve psa df outcome the price paid in treatment morbidity can be high without adequate attention to dose volume constraints of normal tissue care must be taken to consider not only the hazard of tumor recurrence but also that of complications
6059059 dose volume histogram analyses clearly indicated a volume effect on the probability of developing late rectal complications therefore dose escalation may be safely achieved by adherence to dose volume histogram constraints during treatment planning and organ localization at the time of treatment to ensure consistent patient setup
6059060 significant volume effects were found in the probability of late rectal bleeding for patients undergoing 3d crt for prostate cancer with prescription doses of 70 2 and 75 6 gy the percent volumes exposed to 71 and 77 gy in the 70 2 and 75 6 gy dose groups respectively were significantly correlated with rectal bleeding the independent correlation of small v rw with rectal bleeding may indicate the existence of a functional reserve for the rectum the independent association with larger percent volumes exposed to intermediate doses approximately 46 gy seen in both dose groups may indicate that a large surrounding region of intermediate dose may interfere with the ability to repair the effects of a central high dose region
6059061 wir haben als deutsche automobilindustrie den anspruch die co2 toprunner also die jeweils effizientesten fahrzeuge ihrer klasse unseren kunden anzubieten dabei sind wir unseren mitbewerbern einen deutlichen schritt voraus
6059062 entscheidend f r den klimaschutz ist dass die masse der verkauften fahrzeuge weniger co2 ausst t

6059076 i was doing it out of the kindness of my heart but i was also being deceived and i felt really stupid
6059077 at this point no one is taking responsibility for which law is holding him there
6059078 now i understand that theres a florida law on fugitives that allows them to give no bond and the florida judge said he wont give bond unless the prosecutor here in arizona says its ok which is not happening
6059079 he will sit in jail until he adjudicates the charges there in miami and then well pick him up
6059080 unless its something that happened with chris when it gets that serious its time to speak out
6059081 really my thing is i talked to the cats and its sad what people will do when theyre in the position of dont have
6059082 people will say omarion is still out there and in the pubic
6059083 i used to rock with them dudes and now when i see them its not like that
6059084 its gotta be like i look at you funny or you look at me funny if somebody has done something to disrespect you as a man i feel like i have to protect myself so now when i see them after everything that happened how do i be nice how do i be cool im a spiritual dude and a part of me is forgiving but there is so much that has been done you get tired of that this whole next album youll see a whole new omarion
6059085 a release is different from a drop when an artist is dropped usually they havent brought any revenue to the company as you know ive been with that company for a long time roughly over six years throughout b2k and my solo albums revenue was still brought in an artist like me could never get dropped how did i get dropped and i still ended up in a great situation usually when you hear drop it means oh hes over its a wrap its unfortunate that stuff like that gets put out there everybody likes to associate especially me being such a cool dude with negative things are you kidding me
6059086 hes a great producer and hes really at the top of his game right now
6059087 i cant ask for a better person to guide me we did ice box it wasnt enough for us to really build a solid relationship but ive got to spend time with him and we have a strong relationship its the biggest blessing that has happened to me musically
6059088 were just picking each others brains to see what can be done differently
6059089 my energetic style and aggressiveness when i perform i dont think thats necessarily been captured for the length of an album i always felt like i had joints like touch even entourage where its upbeat but it hasnt been captured in an album all these crazy new dances all these different things i wanna do when i look at my peers in the game they capture the true essence of who they are i kinda felt like throughout my career i had just blots of that

6059093 we had just pulled up to the dock and some kids came over and said hey weve got a fish over here with two mouths
6059094 it was really unusual the fish has an obvious abnormality i had never seen anything like that myself before i cant speculate on what might have caused it
6059095 it was important for the fish to be displayed at the conference to show people what we have been claiming all along
6059096 people were in disbelief here they saw a fish that we suspect is very much linked to tarsands development and contamination of the athabasca river our elders tell us that what happens to the animals and the fish is just a sign of what is going to happen to human life
6059097 for the most part what we have been getting is natural parasites and fin erosion which are normal in sand bed rivers
6059098 throughout the 12 years there has been no significant impact shown from oilsands development
6059099 it is very heavily represented by industry and government and we feel that it doesnt do any justice as far as accurately representing any data to the community
6059100 this is evidence and we need to ensure that is preserved

6059105 on our radar we had two vessels that we knew had been taken by pirates
6059106 so the threat is real its almost eerie coming down that coast and seeing a radar contact with a name on it and knowing that those vessels are held by pirates
6059107 the crews lives are in danger and ransoms are being demanded from the companies who own them
6059108 the danger is if we threaten them they may think that were the navy special forces coming in to try to do a rescue and the next thing weve got is dead hostages
6059109 they typically will threaten the ships by firing rocket propelled grenades small arms or mortars at them so they show that force get them to slow down and they have built ladders that they hook onto the sides of vessels to get on board
6059110 be very careful then how you live not as unwise but as wise making the most of every opportunity because the days are evil
6059111 thats a wrong way to be generous to the needy
6059112 we were pretty ticked off to say the least the reason he got paddled was because he was untying his shoes and playing with the air conditioner thermostat
6059113 one of the things weve seen over and over again is that parents have difficulty getting redress if a child is paddled and severely injured or paddled in violation of parents wishes
6059114 international human rights law puts a pretty strong prohibition on corporal punishment
6059115 i didnt get any bruises but they still hurt and from that point on i told myself and my parents i wasnt going to take any more paddlings
6059116 just about everyone at the beginning of the year said if he or she gives you any trouble you can paddle them
6059117 its really just a part of the culture of the school environment there
6059118 the use of corporal punishment is associated almost overwhelmingly with negative effects and that it increases childrens problem behavior over time
6059119 initial tests have shown that network load could be reduced by a factor of five or more without compromising network performance
6059120 at the same time speeds are increased by about 20 percent
6059121 we think we have one of the most extensible rigorous architectures for making these applications run more efficiently
6059122 the project seems to have a momentum of its own

6059133 in seminary mack had been taught that god had completely stopped any overt communication with moderns preferring to have them only listen to and follow sacred scripture properly interpreted of course gods voice has been reduced to paper and even that paper had to be moderated and deciphered by the proper authorities and intellects it seemed that direct communication with god was something exclusively for the ancients and uncivilized while the educated westerners access to god was mediated and controlled by the intelligentsia nobody wanted god in a box just a book
6059134 god created man in his image and man has since more than reciprocated
6059135 those who love me come from every system that exists they were buddhists or mormons baptists or muslims democrats republicans some are bankers and bookies americans and iraqis jews and palestinians i have no desire to make them christian but i do want to join them in their transformation into sons and daughters of my papa into brothers and sisters into my beloved

6059140 lt bob thrasher and i worked on getting this grant for two years
6059141 last year our request made it to the 28th round of grant appropriations but homeland security just ran out of money
6059142 in march 2008 we applied again and just received word that our application was granted
6059143 we applied this year to buy all new air packs
6059144 in february the city bought six air packs for us and this grant will allow us to continue replacement of all 31 units well also replace the cascade system air compressor that is used to refill the air tanks
6059145 everything in the new packs is compliant with 2007 national fire protection association standards
6059146 the new packs have three built in alarms to let firefighters know when their air is about to run out and each mans mask will be custom fitted
6059147 that system is lighter and will provide 6 000 pounds of pressure per square inch so we can fill more air bottles more quickly
6059148 we try to keep two sets of turnout gear for each fireman as one set may get wet during a fire then the men get called out on a second fire wearing wet suits that can result in steam burns
6059149 so we want each man to have dry gear available
6059150 ive been with the department for 22 years and have been through four or five sets
6059151 what obama represents is we as a people are a part of the american dream
6059152 the message is for a kid from in marcy projects right now to say maybe i can be the president
6059153 not just for us blacks but also with all americans i think theres so much our president can do obama seems like a human being i say that because a lot of presidents dont seem like human beings they seem like straight up businessmen who care about nothing but the business
6059154 were a small part of it but were showing our support to show that we are aware of whats going on and where its going
6059155 we really want change we really need it its not the same no more
6059156 listen to what hes saying hes saying what i wanna hear just like my favorite rapper if an mc is saying what i wanna hear imma go buy his album if a candidate is saying what i wanna hear imma go vote for him i can vote by the way watch me im going to register to vote
6059157 i think the first thing the hip hop community has to do is let the man become president
6059158 they gotta work in other ways to get him in the white house its not really about doing a song right now he has to separate himself from that stuff hes in a political race everybody should kick back for a minute see what happens in november if he becomes president he wouldnt have to separate himself as much from some of these statements because obama cant come as hard core as ludacris as far as his message right now he cant do that us rappers might have to hold our tongues for a few months
6059159 all it takes is for a mutha er getting out there being real ghetto and people will be like we dont wanna f with obama theyll wanna smash on him because of what somebody else said someone speaks for himself and its baracks fault what did luda say thats baracks fault is it baracks fault what im saying i dont wanna be the reason he dont get the presidency
6059160 the most problematic hip hop gets 90 percent of the coverage in the non music press
6059161 hip hop is associated in so many peoples minds with crime drugs and misogyny so obamas faced with a constellation of problematic images the question is how do you send a message that doesnt wind up demonizing somebody
6059162 its cool to make a couple comments but be careful about what you say because theyre gonna try to pin it towards him
6059163 we know its so much tension around politics right now theyre trying to take him down maybe everybody needs to chill out a little bit im not sure how much barack mixtapes are helping him i dont think no person is doing a mixtape addressing baracks political views
6059164 i dont think luda or anybody ever thought it would be that big i heard the freestyle the minute it came out and in his defense thats what people do on the mixtape circuit ive put out multiple mixtapes where i might not actually feel a certain way about somebody but ill say a punch line to give them that shock value its nothing new to the mixtape circuit i dont think he really wants mccain in a wheelchair the lyric reads mccain dont belong in any chair unless hes paralyzed its just a freestyle thing it was crazy they took it that big
6059165 during this election young people from all walks of life have responded to senator obamas message of hope and change for the future with great enthusiasm
6059166 and that includes those in the hip hop community individuals who are talented intelligent and entrepreneurial in spirit but who in the past have felt that government and politics dont really work for them
6059167 senator obama wants to engage the hip hop community more in the political process because issues including education jobs and health care are as important to this generation as any other we will be talking to the hip hop community more throughout this campaign and letting them know they have reason to put their trust in senator obama because he will work to fundamentally change their lives
6059168 the hip hop experience is for some the black experience and the campaign has been very inclusive and has been one that has welcomed voices from all over the country
6059169 with the hip hop community its been an interesting conversation because on the one hand we know the hip hop community has reflected a great deal of whats been happening in our inner cities for a long time and the systemic challenges that face that community senator obama has a plan as part of his overall call for change that will address those challenges the voice of the hip hop community will be reflected in this campaign with senator obamas plan for inner city communities
6059170 these situations are a case by case basis when and where and timing
6059171 the hip hop community has clearly embraced senator obama and they see him as someone who can effect change in a dramatic way the key with us as we go through the next few months is identifying opportunities where we can work together to communicate the senators message
6059172 i thought about hip hop associations harming obamas chances i really did
6059173 so in the concert i always say this is not sponsored by obama i make it very clear to say that cause i know obama associated with this guy from f in marcy projects i know thats coming any day i think about that often i mean what do you do what do i do i have to support the guy but i dont wanna hurt him i aint like the preachers and all those guys i dont wanna make the inappropriate statements and keep going im the guy that will fall back
6059174 you gotta speak what you feel you gotta be respectful though
6059175 like anything you do you cant come to anybodys show and be disrespectful if youre supporting them so you dont speak on nobody and act a fool
6059176 in some ways you have to assume most of the hip hop community will be behind him because they dont have a choice because their vote aint going to mccain
6059177 but if he uses this kind of secret code the dirt off the shoulder saying you and i both know it but i cant afford to say so it could work for him
6059178 rappers have to realize that supporting obama publicly is like a corporate meeting come support us but dress for the occasion
6059179 if a king goes out and fights wars with his people his people will do anything for him
6059180 if youre just a king in your castle and you calling shots then the respect from the people will never be there we dont see our leaders with us in our situations on a heavy heavy level
6059181 a lot of people may not feel me on this but you gotta feel me if you real im not voting for obama
6059182 i dont like obama obama is a traitor he turned his back on everybody he turned his back on reverend jeremiah wright reverend wright has been with him since the beginning ludacris has done stuff in his support he speaks the truth but obama feels that a certain demographic may not vote for him because of it so he turns his back on luda he invited bernie mac to come in and do his roast or whatever it was called bernie mac said some things that were offensive thats what bernie mac is known for what does he do turn his back on bernie mac whos he gonna denounce next im not even voting this year if i did vote it would be for mccain i like to know the enemy barack i dont know
6059183 i feel like its better not for us to dwell on that type of thing it could only go wrong
6059184 weve all been playing in bands for a very long time with little or no success depending on how you define that but the fact is that we went into this with only one ambition to have a good time and for us being able to still do that is really all thats important
6059185 we do like the thought of trying to be the best band in america
6059186 i mean who really knows who the best band is i dont thats for sure so for us striving to be really good at what we do and trying to have a good time thats the fun part everything else is just a little beyond us
6059187 on a good night we move more alcohol than most bands do in a week
6059188 when we first started out our audiences were maybe a little reflection of us you know people in their later 20s early 30s and predominately dudes guys who buy records and watch sports and a smattering of angry girlfriends
6059189 i think as the bands audience has grown weve actually expanded younger and there are a lot more girls coming to the shows and a lot of girls making their presence more upfront and thats just amazing
6059190 one of the coolest things i see now is fathers and sons coming to the show together
6059191 were kind of a classic rock band and people who grew up in the 70s and 80s even can probably relate to us as much as a 21 year old kid now theres also a really interesting sense of community with the fans theres a particular group called the unified scene who wear matching t shirts and form these bonds through the shows and i never thought wed see that
6059192 its really exciting to think about where this band has been and where were going
6059193 when we started we wanted to play a show and drink some beer and then last summer we opened for the rolling stones and played glastonbury and we opened for the stooges in croatia this band has really taken us around the world and its allowed all of us to see so much im pretty much amazed on a daily basis

6059225 i wanted to understand what was happening in the state in my absence
6059226 and i wanted to understand the challenges and i wanted to understand whats changed
6059227 as far as i know there is no select agenda for the evening
6059228 we need to get away from this arbitrary approach to education i think it would be at least moving in the right direction
6059229 i think its something we need to have a serious discussion about
6059230 in my experience if you treat a person like an adult they will act like an adult
6059231 as an ohio state grad i think its wonderful that he came to marietta
6059232 i was called about this dinner two or three days ago i actually didnt even know the location until yesterday
6059233 se fosse por rejei o provavelmente a morte teria acontecido mais r pido
6059234 you have been convicted of theft and fraud to the value of over 62 000
6059235 the time span involved was almost two years and the offences took place whilst you were a trusted and valued employee at charlie miller in edinburgh
6059236 therefore particularly in respect of the breach of trust i have come to the view that such is the nature of the charges and the circumstances surrounding the offences there has to be a custodial sentence
6059237 since saturday night ive seen a lot of confusion in the younger christian voting bloc because they thought they had figured this thing out
6059238 theres no absolutely right candidate for an evangelical and theres no absolutely wrong candidate theyre both right and theyre both wrong
6059239 to be perceived as authentic on this issue you need to have some grounding in it and usually that grounding is faith
6059240 essentially says that a doctor is required to provide treatment to a pre viable child or fetus
6059241 and i hate to say that people are lying but heres a situation where folks are lying
6059242 i think that the pro life position is one of the important aspects or fundamentals of the republican party and i also feel that and im not trying to equivocate here that americans want us to work together
6059243 would make a fatal mistake to assume that social issues especially abortion are ever off an equally blazing front burner for an inestimable number of social conservatives
6059244 he had lived close to the elementary school and everybody in the community knew him
6059245 grief counseling will be provided at the school through washington county mental health services and we have also contacted some area youth pastors
6059246 theyre doing a reconstruction of the accident and the coroner estimated it could take four to eight days to complete the toxicology report that will tell us if drugs or alcohol were involved
6059247 we have to wait for those other reports to come in before we can complete our investigation report
6059248 we probably wont release the name of the juvenile until we get the information and can file our full report
6059249 i knew i needed to be participating and not just watching and hoping for the best
6059250 i was kind of undecided of who to vote for
6059251 when i went to the secretary of state to register to vote though i made my mind up it took me an hour and 15 minutes to get my address changed
6059252 mike rogers passed the bill and its keeping students from voting
6059253 students already have a deplorably low rate of voter turnout and this law attempts to silently drag students out of the democratic process in order to vote id have to drive an hour and half each way
6059254 two years ago when i first came to state i registered to vote using my address at wonders hall
6059255 this year before the election i was contacted and asked if i want to change my registered address and i said sure
6059256 i went to city council i found out i couldnt vote because the address you registered with had to be the same as the one on your license
6059257 in edinburgh we have a fantastic range of world class festivals and its great that so many of these festivals are already gearing up for next years homecoming celebrations
6059258 every year the festivals delight and engage thousands of scots and visitors and in 2009 we hope the homecoming message will encourage even more of our global family to join us enjoy these outstanding events and celebrate scotlands contributions to the world
6059259 the edinburgh military tattoo is one of the summer highlights a spectacular show that sees edinburgh castle transformed into a dazzling stage set
6059260 thats why im delighted that next year it will be widening access and enabling more scots across the country to be a part of the experience
6059261 for homecomers this will open up opportunities to explore edinburgh and beyond and to be a part of the historic extension of the military tattoo
6059262 the edinburgh tattoos 2009 production will reflect the work of robert burns and engage visitors from around the world with one of the main themes of homecoming scotland
6059263 we are delighted to be included as a flagship event in the homecoming scotland tourism initiative and we expect our involvement will attract a substantial global audience which will generate in excess of 50m for the scottish economy
6059264 in 2009 we will be working closely with fringe venues and encouraging them to develop the homecoming theme across their programmes
6059265 august will provide the perfect opportunity for scots and those with a passion for scotland to come home and join the party
6059266 scotland has an enormously rich literary heritage and contemporary literary scene which are pivotal features of the edinburgh international book festival each year
6059267 we passionately believe that inspiring and challenging words and thoughts have never been more important or more in demand and homecoming 2009 offers us the opportunity to debate and celebrate the written word in scotland
6059268 this is encouraging news obviously the vast majority of these people would under no circumstances use these guns in crimes although they have to be commended for surrendering them
6059269 the real criminals will retain their weapons and we have to combat them
6059270 we welcome the rise in the number of weapons that are being surrendered to us which to some extent marks a changing attitude in society as regards the use of airguns and other firearms
6059271 at the same time the force is pro active in its approach to removing dangerous weapons from our streets which is a key part of our commitment to reducing violent crime and increasing public safety
6059272 the types of weapons that have been surrendered and destroyed include everything from shotguns to air weapons replica guns and other imitation firearms
6059273 i am pleased that these weapons have been taken off the streets those who have surrendered them to the police have done the right thing we know that there is a lot of concern about the minority who misuse firearms and are causing distress damage and injury in their communities
6059274 i am not indifferent to israels concerns over a nuclear armed iran there should be no doubt that russia does not want a nuclear iran
6059275 supernatural things really scare me i saw a picture of a ghost when i was younger and it was very creepy and very graphic i definitely believe theres something else out there
6059276 the last film i saw was spider man 3 i watched it on a plane and i think everybody was a bit surprised when i started crying i cry at stupid things i cry so much its just ridiculous
6059277 likes attending fancy shindigs and events is still thinking about their best party idea ever

6059279 over 1000 level 1 and level 2 companies are struggling with pci and are coming to realize that the cost of pci compliance is vastly underestimated achieving pci compliance avoiding fines and retaining the privilege to accept credit cards requires merchants and service providers to address approximately 180 individual pci requirements in 12 categories this is no small task and the entire program can be compromised by insufficient people process or controls
6059280 brabeion is helping major enterprises achieve dramatic returns on their pci compliance programs and is pleased to be a sponsor of nrftech 2008
6059281 security audits should be conducted continuously or as frequently as possible and not be limited to whats required by pci

6059287 using its system of border checkpoints to greatly expand a database on travelers entering the country by compiling data that will be stored for 15 years and may be used in criminal and intelligence investigations
6059288 congress pledging to clean up washingtons culture of corruption approved a rule last year to end the practice of lobbyists or their clients throwing lavish events honoring lawmakers at the parties national conventions
6059289 house ethics committee they issued guidelines in december saying it was fine for lobbyists or their employers to throw parties for a group of house members just not for a single lawmaker
6059290 thats why at the democratic convention in denver next week visa and us bank will host an event honoring the freshman class of house democrats at amp t is among the sponsors of a party celebrating the conservative house blue dog democrats on sunday night
6059291 in our view any house member who goes to a party that honors a member or a group of members is violating the ethics rules
6059292 its a violation of the spirit the language and the meaning of the provisions

6059338 secure sdi is vital because ogc standards are strongly influencing development of the national and international sdis especially data access and collaborative production operations but these efforts have reached the point where broad acceptance is dependent on securing online data resources including access control to ogc data services these requirements will continue to increase as simple data access transitions into collaborative data management based on standards like the web feature server transactional wfs t from ogc

6059343 more the delay more it will harm the integrity of the country the government must address the nationalist aspirations and not buckle under the pressure of separatists
6059344 the bjp demands that india must protest strongly with pakistan about their continued interventions in the internal affairs of india the pakistan national assembly resolution demanding plebiscite is totally unacceptable and condemnable
6059345 the bjp condemns in the strongest possible words and demands strong action against arundhati roy as her irresponsible utterances amount to nothing less than sedition
6059346 when she says that kashmir needs azadi freedom from india and india needs azadi from kashmir our response is that india can live without arundhati but not without kashmir
6059347 the situation in jammu and kashmir is deteriorating because of a complete lack of vision and political will on the part of the congress led upa united progressive alliance government its omissions and commissions without any clear cut policy direction have led to this current situation and impasse
6059348 there has been a mass exodus of non kashmiri labourers from the valley because of the continuous threats from the separatists but the government instead of acting tough against those issuing such threats is arranging extra buses to carry them out of the valley

6059352 i dont want anything to do with this industry it absolutely stinks
6059353 i feel like a sore thumb in a piranha pool in this industry i dont like the way its all run by rich men in their 50s who went to private school its not something i want to be part of
6059354 you get these bands who have a few hits say like the
6059355 im going to make a record thats truly artistic which is the
6059356 it the music industry makes me tired and it makes me feel ill and i dont want anything more to do with it
6059357 no way i would have thought of that but im glad somebody did
6059358 man i hope i dont suck as much as usual
6059359 didnt know this was a 23 year old girls birthday party
6059360 do you also want your wine in a sippy cup cowboy grow the fuck up
6059361 i saw a georgian soldier throw a grenade into a basement full of women and children
6059362 i was training as hard as i could and while my diet was healthy i figured that nutrition might be the key
6059363 so i went to a sports nutrition seminar afterwards i collared the speaker kerry kayes and we chatted about my injuries he went through my diet and said i wasnt getting enough protein it made sense so i started taking protein supplements that was the turning point
6059364 the trauma that modern triathletes put their bodies through is immense
6059365 that calls for extra protein to help muscles repair themselves to get enough extra protein from an ordinary diet would mean eating huge amounts of food and having to deal with subsequent weight issues a good protein supplement delivers the protein in a low calorie easily digested formula that gives the body what it needs when it needs it
6059366 i tend to go back to certain races each year to gauge my level of fitness
6059367 at wetherby in 2007 i came sixth with an overall time of two hours eight minutes this year in much worse conditions i came third in two hours three minutes
6059368 typically in the past id take around 25 minutes for a 1500 metre swim ive shaved at least two minutes off that this year
6059369 its the best job i could be doing i get to train every day while other people are at work and i can keep a close eye on my diet too
6059370 i live nine miles from the fire station so i run or bike in every day
6059371 theres no doubt that kerrys protein supplements have made all the difference this year
6059372 my performance has improved and im really enjoying competing theyre very easy to drink too absolutely spot on
6059373 the break is over and its time to start the final sprint of the season
6059374 the most challenging time is here with every single race becoming more and more important and every point more and more valuable
6059375 the less points there are the more valuable they are but again this season has shown you should never give up
6059376 there have been some races where everything has gone badly but for one reason or another ive got more points than my toughest competitors
6059377 you never know how it goes in f1 and at least my season now looks better after the last race in hungary than it did before
6059378 we have not lost anything but we need to consistently get points because i feel the championship will go to the wire so maximising each point will be the deciding factor
6059379 with ferrari and mclaren very close in performance and with seven races remaining any one of the first three drivers can still win the title
6059380 all i care about is having one more point than anyone else after the last race in brazil because my only target is the championship everything else is a minor detail
6059381 ive only seen in car video footage and it is very quick for a street circuit
6059382 valencia is much quicker than monaco and there looks to be one or two places where overtaking looks possible
6059383 but i cannot remember a new track i have not learned very quickly so track time will be important
6059384 a clean weekend with no problems will help i need to get a good balance in the car over one lap so will be working hard in that department
6059385 obviously we need the best possible result and the team has put a lot of effort into getting things right for the whole weekend
6059386 as in canada you probably need some luck in this race
6059387 i just hope luck wont stab me in the back like it did in montreal
6059388 pure 24 bit headroom that the professionalism and skill of sound engeener
6059389 logic is a professional tool i get professional results with it every day

6059402 i want to take your money and give it to the hobos
6059403 i never got invited you dont go to the olympics just to say i am going to go especially because of who i am
6059404 i am going to sit there and watch michael phelps break my record anonymously thats almost demeaning to me it is not almost it is
6059405 i won seven events if they had the 50m freestyle back then which they do now i probably would have won that too
6059406 but as soon as the swimming was over and michael phelps didnt break my record every time i went to beach volley they put my face on the volleyballs
6059407 they didnt bring me a water pitcher up here to the podium im a legend wheres my water pitcher

6059430 ante la consulta el mayor problema que tenemos es que existen dos partidos psoe y pp que no reconocen ni la soberan a ni el derecho a decidir de euskal herria eso es todo
6059431 lo dem s son cuestiones secundarias que deber an resolverse discretamente entre todos los partidos que formamos parte del gobierno vasco
6059432 si lo que quiere el se or urkullu es buscarnos las cosquillas para iniciar un rifirrafe p blico sobre nuestras posturas frente a la consulta no nos va a encontrar
6059433 hace escasos d as se al que el sr urkullu no se deb a equivocar de adversario ya que su partido y eusko alkartasuna apoyamos inequ vocamente la propuesta de ley de consulta del gobierno vasco y todas las iniciativas que estamos llevando a cabo para que madrid no amordace la libre voluntad de los vascos
6059434 lo que realmente no entiende la sociedad en este momento es que ante un asunto como este sigamos con declaraciones de esta naturaleza
6059435 somos un pueblo peque o que lleva muchas generaciones tratando de defender el derecho a decidir tenemos delante a dos de los mayores estados de europa que no nos lo permiten acaso no es ese el mayor problema que unas declaraciones puntuales de un l der de ea se pregunta
6059436 si bien es cierto que en el tema de la consulta vamos en el mismo barco eso no significa que en asuntos como el segundo guggenheim en urdaibai no podamos discrepar ya que son cuestiones completamente distintas

6059439 the circuit has been used only once for formula 3 and a sports car race and the event passed off well with the only complaint being that the swing bridge which takes the track across the canal that links the inner basin to the main port has a gap of three centimetres between the bridge and road with a variation in height of a couple of millimetres compared to the old tramlines on which f1 cars used to race this is nothing but with modern f1 technology teams need to see whether this will make a difference
6059440 moog inc announced today that ferrari has placed an order for the engineering design development and deployment of a next generation driving simulator to be located at ferraris headquarters in maranello italy
6059441 this will help us to deal with the new threats of the 21st century of long range missile threats from countries like iran or from north korea
6059442 it is defensive and is not aimed at anyone it is nonetheless a system that establishes firmly again and reaffirms our cooperation and relationship with poland it will deepen our defence cooperation and it will deepen our ability to deal with threats
6059443 this is an excellent opportunity for us not only to build up our agri portfolio but also to be involved in the fast growing microfinance field
6059444 the transaction allows us to diversify our asset base by partnering with globally recognised microfinance players
6059445 normally the assignment of agri portfolio picks up in the fourth quarter only we are glad that we were able to warm up the market right in july itself

6059450 que a la fecha supera las metas del presente a o y que sigue influyendo sobre las expectativas del crecimiento de los precios para los agentes tanto en el corto como en el mediano plazos

6059453 que podr a implicar menores crecimientos de precios en los bienes transables
6059454 en lo corrido de 2008 la apreciaci n no ha sido suficiente para compensar los incrementos en los precios internacionales de materias primas tal como lo refleja el ipp ndice de precios al productor
6059455 una inflaci n baja y estable contribuye a maximizar el crecimiento de la econom a en el largo plazo
6059456 maruti suzuki india managing director and ceo shinzo nakanishi said in his address to shareholders in the companys annual report
6059457 it will be exported mainly to europe but also to other markets in the world
6059458 while europe is important we need not be confined to it suzuki operations in south asia south east asia the west asia and africa can also gain from the experience and expertise of maruti suzuki
6059459 at the moment our primary focus is on investing behind the brand himalayan and we are creating a 360 degree communication platform to give our consumers an experience of going back to nature by means of a pristine and authentic mineral water
6059460 we have just introduced our new repositioned himalayan brand in the mumbai market and it would be available in other big cities within a few weeks after that we will think of going into the smaller cities and towns
6059461 the mineral water market is the now the fastest growing segment in the beverages market and we want to reinforce himalayan as a premium segment brand our holistic brand communication is intended as an exercise in this regard
6059462 it makes a woman happy when i call to her it makes her know shes attractive
6059463 the woman herself is the one who makes men harass her
6059464 if shes walking swinging as she goes of course it will happen
6059465 the issue is not the act itself it is the profile of fans that follow the act wiltshire police do not have an issue with pete doherty or babyshambles
6059466 we might even do it at petes house in a big barn
6059467 were getting really close and im very comfortable with that
6059468 im really excited i want to compete i want to get it done
6059469 training has been going really well so everything is good so far
6059470 my partner did four times so i have video i can see what he does
6059471 here we have only one hour every day its not enough there we had four hours a day
6059472 we had time to do everything we wanted we can train relaxed with no pressure
6059473 we did not reject the concert we asked them to find another date as the original date is so close to the independence day thats the only reason
6059474 as far as we are concerned the show is still on
6059475 only russian peacekeepers will be deployed in abkhazia and south ossetia
6059476 no georgian peacekeepers who not only ran away but also shot in the backs of their russian and south ossetian colleagues in the most dastardly and treacherous way will be on south ossetian soil ever again
6059477 only russian peacekeepers will be stationed on south ossetian and abkhaz soil today we can talk with the osce the european union and the un group of friends and discuss only the number of observers but not on the territory of south ossetia these observers should conduct monitoring on georgian territory
6059478 the differences are fairly wide however we have made a lot of progress today on a percentage of questions
6059479 there are some questions of principle where we are working on language which will be acceptable to everybody but we are not there yet
6059480 dear god should there be war there ill be the first to die
6059481 dont feel bad to what extent is any soldier responsible for the mistakes of his government the main thing is that you now realize what it was you were actually came to liberate us from
6059482 it was a wonderful time we were all living as though in some beautiful dream
6059483 and then those tanks rolled in and shook us awake
6059484 on tour its weird im kind of like a dog that hasnt been brought up properly

6059487 the thing is i rub a little bit on the other guys put on a lot suckers
6059488 by outlining specific barriers to use in this population we provide a framework for future early interventions such as parent education and addressing confidentiality concerns
6059489 multiple misconceptions such as side effects that are not known to occur and concerns about confidentiality exist in this population and may influence future use

6059503 people are upbeat about the chinese market turning around and of course hps numbers gave a good face to whats been a tough sell off for a couple of days
6059504 its always nice to see a bellwether company report solid earnings it reflects a view that even in times like these there are companies that are doing well
6059505 as an entrepreneur i am always looking for ways to diversify my portfolio with good ideas and good people
6059506 yes i work out and take care of myself but i also like a cold beer once in a while

6059510 adrian sudbury died peacefully in his sleep with his dad keith and mum kay last night
6059511 every parent thinks their son or daughter is special and we are no different
6059512 adrian touched all who knew him were very proud of all his achievements in tragically such a short time
6059513 kay and i hope that all adrians good work will be continued by all those who knew and loved him
6059514 adrian sudbury was a true hero whose selflessness and courage made him an inspiration to all who knew him and to many who didnt
6059515 adrians campaign to raise awareness about blood bone marrow and organ donation has already attracted thousands of supporters myself among them and his memory will continue to inspire action for many years to come
6059516 my microcontroller can beat the hell out of your microcontroller
6059517 it is amazing what you can accomplish if you do not care who gets the credit
6059518 state laws serve the valuable purpose of exposing dangers about drugs and alerting manufacturers and regulators about issues and potential risks associated with pharmaceuticals
6059519 the outcome of this case will affect the fate of hundreds of state tort suits consumer protection actions of state attorneys general and the role of the states in our federal government
6059520 in the case of pch the protein complex the so called trna splicing endonuclease is mutated this complex in involved in the manufacture of proteins in the human body and was identified in connection with a disease for the first time
6059521 the identification of mutations which cause pch2 and pch4 is an important step in the research of ponto cerebellar hypoplasia
6059522 since screening intervention and treatment services for these risk factors are often beyond the reach of minority and low income populations these populations have a disproportionate burden of death and disability from cardiovascular disease
6059523 the implication is that people at risk of macular degeneration could help prevent the disease by consuming antioxidants
6059524 this work by dr vollmer snarr and colleagues ties these two damaging processes together and demonstrates the harm they cause in combination is much more than would be expected
6059525 this new knowledge suggests the possibility of interventions which could prove to be powerful ways to prevent or delay age related macular degeneration
6059526 why not take a page out of one diseases book in the fight against other diseases
6059527 thousands of cases of west nile virus have been reported worldwide but 80 of infected people dont show any symptoms
6059528 it is important to have highly sensitive and specific tests to diagnose infections and also to help track the ecology and epidemiology of west nile encephalitis
6059529 although the methods developed are for diagnosing west nile virus in horses the procedures can be easily modified to develop new antibody tests for humans and wildlife
6059530 it is essential to test wildlife for infection to determine the ecological and epidemiological aspects of west nile virus infections in nature so that we can try to control the disease by managing mosquito populations
6059531 we tested 43 privately owned horses for the infection the results showed that none of the horses with undiagnosed illnesses had been infected prior to the 1999 outbreak of west nile virus in connecticut usa
6059532 this kind of information is useful in confirming the epidemiology of the virus determining when it arrived in certain areas and how it spreads
6059533 in the uk alone two million people have diabetes and up to 750 000 are believed to be carriers of the condition without even realising
6059534 these are worrying statistics but by diagnosing the disease in patients early on a number of measures can be put in place to minimise any related health issues findings from this research could really help with early diagnosis if opticians were equipped with the knowledge and technology to spot health concerns which could indicate the first signs of diabetes the uks early diagnosis rate could be improved significantly
6059535 sponges have one of the most ancient lineages and dont have nerve cells
6059536 so we are pretty confident it was after the sponges split from trunk of the tree of life and sponges went one way and animals developed from the other that nerves started to form
6059537 what we found in sponges though were the building blocks for nerves something we never expected to find
6059538 what we have done is try to find the molecular building blocks of nerves or what may be called the nerves ancestor the proto neuron
6059539 we found sets of these genes in sponges when we really didnt expect it
6059540 but what was really cool is we took some of these genes and expressed them in frog and flies and the sponge gene became functional the sponge gene directed the formation of nerves in these more complex animals
6059541 we are working to see that the face of health care is changing as well
6059542 blacks and latinos have much higher incidences of obesity heart disease diabetes and many other treatable and preventable health problems blacks and latinos also are often clustered in communities that are more toxic that have more health hazards present and yet also have significantly fewer health care providers in or near those communities our mission at the urban health program goes beyond just training black latino and native american health care providers we are dedicated to helping solve these disparities we encourage our students to work in the communities that need them most
6059543 the urban health program is a model for other colleges and universities around the country when it comes to attracting and graduating a cadre of black latino and native american students for the health professions
6059544 the relationship between hiv and ckd is very important for clinicians to address early in patients with hiv and there is a need for resources to help clinicians connect hiv with an increased risk for ckd
6059545 hiv treatment educators also play a pivotal role in the care of patients with hiv which is why we developed resources specifically tailored to their needs and the needs of the patients they work with
6059546 traditionally patients with mental health conditions were treated solely for their mental condition by a mental health provider we are fostering an environment of integrated treatment for both the mental and medical health and tracking the outcome of caring for both the body and the mind
6059547 we have a unique opportunity to align two distinctive medical disciplines to benefit the patients these are ground breaking concepts that have the ability to impact the health care industry as a whole
6059548 for some reason cancer cells become addicted to certain genes when we blocked the gene that results in the enzyme pi3k c2alpha using a fairly new tool used extensively by our lab called rna interference we found this had an abrupt adverse effect on a variety of cancer cells
6059549 although we must further determine what happens in normal cells to confirm the therapeutic value we also found that decreasing levels of pi3k class 2 alpha to a certain point didnt kill the cancer cells but did sensitize them to chemotherapeutic agents such as taxol
6059550 this alone could contribute to a more effective anti cancer strategy in a subset of cancers
6059551 each awardee brings a fresh perspective to his or her clinical challenges and we are confident great ideas will emerge
6059552 we are honored to partner with cimit because they drive innovation by surrounding these clinicians with inventive engineers and other support to move their ideas forward its a critical function
6059553 the grants are designed to enable them to pursue their research while continuing their work in the clinic
6059554 this is a very important advance for the understanding and treatment of fragile x syndrome and paves the way for early identification and early intervention for these children
6059555 identification of the condition in early infancy will allow families to seek crucial early intervention services for their children that we hope will mitigate the disabling affects of the disorder
6059556 once we have identified the affected infants we will propose treatment options for them and also will assess the genes impact on other family members in many instances families may not even know that the gene exists
6059557 this will allow us to also look at a larger group of extended family members and the effects that the mutation may cause
6059558 that includes emotional problems aging disorders fxtas and premature ovarian failure all of that
6059559 for effective newborn screening a test has to be quick cheap it has to work on a very small amount of dna and it has to detect everyone
6059560 its not necessary to expose a large surface of the brain in order to access a small abnormality
6059561 because the openings are smaller less brain tissue is exposed
6059562 theres less blood loss surgery times are shorter and patients spend less time in the hospital its better cosmetically too smaller incisions leave smaller scars
6059563 what our team has identified is an experimental drug therapy that can provide pain relief to patients within 20 minutes
6059564 depending on the individual in my experience one dose can last from 6 to 40 hours the ability of the therapy to provide immediate relief is something entirely new for sufferers of interstitial cystitis
6059565 women who suffer from this condition may find themselves having to urinate ten or more times per day usually have pain or symptom flares after sexual intercourse and frequently have chronic pelvic pain
6059566 las becas estudiantiles porque est n llegando a las escuelas menos del 40 que se solicitaron
6059567 una suerte de respuesta frente al tema de las sanciones algo que no est claro porque nos enteramos por los medios que hablan de la vuelta de las amonestaciones pero en las escuelas no se dijo nada

6059583 el cristianismo como religi n oficial es un paradigma por superar

6059604 they didnt lower their guidance which brings a bit of a relief for investors

6059640 on average fuel now makes up 20 per cent of the total cost depreciation counts for between 30 and 50 per cent
6059641 the racs report shows that while the rising cost of fuel is very high on motorists minds the hidden cost of depreciation is still the biggest cost in owning and operating a vehicle
6059642 however it is very likely that fuel will continue to grow as a dominant cost of car ownership this makes a vehicles fuel consumption an even more important factor when choosing your next car
6059643 small car drivers fare better than those with people movers and 4wds while a hyundai getz costs about 120 a week to run toyota landcruiser drivers are paying more than triple those costs about 405 a week
6059644 the rac recommends that people purchase vehicles with a four or five star safety rating some of the cheaper vehicles like the hyundai i30 which costs its owner 152 a week on average to run also have a four or five star safety rating

6059855 if the dog breeders insist on going further down that road i can say with confidence really that there is a universe of suffering waiting for many of these breeds and many if not most of these breeds will not survive

6059873 we feel the deterrent effect plays a part in what we see athletes know that at this event the ioc which is the organisation running the doping programmes means business when it comes to not having those who cheat be part of this event
