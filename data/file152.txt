1520059 my son was supposed to take the taks a for math and have it orally administered to him
1520060 now the difference between that test and the regular test was to eliminate eight field test questions he was mentally exhausted and he was tired the entire day he was convinced at the end of it that he had failed and he kept apologizing to me for not doing well i repeatedly consoled him
1520061 i am sorry that you find this amusing but it wasnt for me
1520062 i repeatedly consoled him i asked him if he tried his best and he said yes
1520063 i informed him that i was proud of him for achieving that i hugged him and i kissed him and in my heart i contemplated whether my words were touching his defeated ego
1520064 later that afternoon i was informed that the taks test was given to him rather than the taks accommodated it was an error after many tears and many apologies i was simply asked if i wanted the test scored or voided but that is not what concerned me i had the task of motivating my son in less than 24 hours for the taks reading test the next day
1520065 you have my deepest apologies if i have used poor judgment misspoken regarding district needs or have not been thorough enough in my communications with you

1520127 its better time they send them home with homework so that time is going to come out of their homework time but i guarantee you they wont have less homework
1520128 by adding 15 additional minutes you are adding about five additional days of instruction
1520129 it creates for a little bit longer instruction time so that campuses can better adjust their schedule within the day and students could have appropriate passing time and appropriate time in their classrooms
1520130 most school districts around us have a longer instructional time than seven hours
1520131 we are the district that has probably the shortest instructional time
1520132 i love the 15 extra minutes for instruction but they should be spread out the same way throughout
1520133 if they are going to add them at the end of the day for some students they should add them at the end for all of the students

1520151 apabila saya sedang berhadapan dengan rasulullah saw maka segala ajaran beliau meresap ke dalam hati saya akan teapi saat saya sudah berpisah berjauhan dengan beliau dan sibuk menghadapi masalah sehari hari maka semua ajaran beliau tersebut saya lupa sama sekali sehinga kadangkala saya berbuat sesuatu yang bertentangan dengan ajaran ajaran beliau tersebut
1520152 wahai rasulullah apabila kami sedang berada di hadapan tuan dan mendengarkan nasihat nasihat tuan hati kami segera terbuka dan seolah olah kami menjadi orang yang baik baik kami tidak menginginkan dunia lagi dan seolah olah akhirat itu kami lihat
1520153 jika kami telah berpisah dan meningalkan majelis tuan lalu kami berada di tengah tengah keluarga dan anak anak kami maka seolah olah dunia telah menakjubkan kami pula sehinga kami lalai dan lupa dengan ajaran ajaran nasehat yang tuan berikan
1520154 jikalau kalian tetap sadar sebagaimana halnya kalian berada di hadapanku maka malaikat akan tetap melindungi kalian dengan sayapnya dan akan berkunjung ke rumah kalian semua jika kalian tidak berbuat dosa niscaya allah bermurah hati mendatangkan kaum lain yang berdosa untuk diberinya ampun karena limpahan dari kebaikan kalian
1520155 akan tetapi sungguh pun demikian wahai hanzhalah ingatlah selalu dari waktu ke waktu
1520156 ya allah tuhan kami berikan kami kebahagiaan di dunia dan akhirat serta periharalah kami dari siksa api neraka
1520157 ya rabbi apakah engkau jni jauh sehinga tidak perlu menjawabku
1520158 ya amirul mukminin mengapa doa kami tidak di ijabahi padahal allah swt berfirman dalam
1520159 kedelapan engkau letakkan cacat atau kejelekan orang lain didepan mata lalu kau cela orang itu padahal sebenarnya engkau lebih pantas dicela dari pada dia
1520160 nah bagaimana mungkin doamu diterima sementara engkau telah menutup seluruh pintu dan jalan doa tersebut bertakwalah kepada allah perbaikilah amalmu ikhlaskanlah batinmu dan lakukanlah amal maruf nabi mungkar insya allah dia akan segera mengabulkan doa itu
1520161 seringkali rasulullah saw bertanya kepada sahabatnya adakah di antara kalian yang bermimpi
1520162 semalam saya bermimpi didatangi dua orang dan membangunkanku seraya berkata pergilah
1520163 maka aku melihat ke atas mendadak terlihat olehku gedung bagaikan awan putih
1520164 semalam ini aku telah melihat yang aneh aneh maka apakah arti semua yang aku lihat itu
1520165 kelima orang yang jelek mukanya serem dan menyala api di sekitarnya itu adalah
1520166 sementara yang terakhir ketujuh orang orang yang sebagian bagus bagus dan sebagian jelek jelek maka mereka itu orang orang bercampur amal baiknya dengan dosanya tetapi allah memaafkan mereka
1520167 kabar besaaar kabar besar wahai saudara sebangsa sudah tahukah anda bahwa lelaki kekar yang suka bertanding gulat di pekan ukadh itu kini telah masuk islam bersama muhammad
1520168 umar tak mungkin masuk islam kecuali keledainya telah masuk islam lebih dahulu bahkan pada detik detik sebelum masuk islam umar telah menghunus pedang untuk membunuh adik iparnya karena mengikuti ajaran
1520169 demi allah tidak suatu tempat pun yang telah saya duduki dalam kekapiran keculali akan saya isi dengan keimanan
1520170 bahwa sesungguhnya allah swt telah menempatkan kebenaran melalui lidah dan hati umar
1520171 andai kata sesudahku ada nabi maka umar lah orangmya yang paling tepat
1520172 jangankan kalian setan saja bila melihat umar berjalan di ujung gang niscaya akan menyingkir dari jalan itu
1520173 saya terlambat karena kemeja ini saya menunggu kering dulu karena saya tak mempunyai kemeja lainnya

1520181 but i didnt have bi or bisexual anywhere in my ad
1520182 i wrote the sweetest most normal ad ever seriously i titled it not seeking barbie and wrote that i was a girl looking for a non plastic real girl the sweetest most genuine ad ever not seeking barbie i described myself and what i was looking for followed all the rules for a w4w post and never mentioned i was bi five seconds later its flagged
1520183 and the creepiest grossest obviously fake ads where some guy is seeking three women to stick live animals up his behind never get flagged
1520184 have you written to craigslist and asked them why your post was flagged

1520280 vede e insolito per la nostra compagnia permettere a una persona con biglietto di classe economica di sedersi in prima classe ma viste le circostanze il comandante pensa che sarebbe scandaloso obbligare qualcuno a sedersi a fianco di una persona sgradevole

1520284 im not white but im certainly not a woman of color
1520285 im not an oppressor noooo noooo i dont benefit from looking like a white woman in any way at all this is quite location centric speaking from solely within the one highly constrained circumstances in which she wouldnt be considered white rather than acknowledge the global context in which she would and in which it would be doubly advantageous given that she speaks english but im also not one of those perpetual black victims i occupy a never never land of neutrality

1520380 police are investigating the arrival of campaigners believed to have breached their bail conditions but we cannot confirm how many arrests have been made
1520381 im pretty nervous about being arrested because ive never been to prison it will be bad but the worst thing about being arrested will be that i wont get to go to an event that i have been planning for a long time this is one of the most important issues of our generation and its vital that we are allowed to discuss it its tragic that the police seem to want to stop that
1520382 im sorry i havent said anything before but i didnt want to worry you it looks like i might be arrested at climate camp it is my choice and its something i feel strongly about please dont be angry
1520383 we are also doing this because we feel our bail conditions are disproportionate to our supposed offences i can see the logic in keeping us away from power stations but to keep us away from this event where people are meeting to discuss how to tackle climate change is wrong

1520394 mit dem ruhigen leben ist es wohl vorbei hier kann man sicherlich nicht unerkannt irgendwo in die stadt gehen
1520395 ich muss erst mal richtig gut spanisch sprechen ich werde sofort mit einem kurs beginnen bald auch wieder einen intensiv besuch in einem sprach kloster starten
1520396 es ist nicht ungew hnlich dass ein kader zu trainingsbeginn nicht komplett ist die zeit l uft f r uns
1520397 alle spieler die keinen nba vertrag erhalten haben dr ngen jetzt auf den markt
1520398 ich bin in der form meines lebens ich springe nur ins wasser und mache das was ich am liebsten tue um die wette schwimmen
1520399 michael hat eine gro e chance es zu schaffen es ist an der zeit dass ich den stab weitergebe
1520400 michael zu trainieren ist wie einen hengst einzureiten mit dem unterschied man muss ihn jeden tag aufs neue z hmen zur not mit sporen
1520401 der letzte der das wasser so berherrscht hat war moses
1520402 mason hat mir gesagt dass ich schuld daran sei dass die haie nicht meister geworden sind
1520403 ich habe in all der zeit hier nichts anderes gemacht als ivan zu loben zu unterst tzen und ihm viel eiszeit zu geben
1520404 ich habe nie gesagt dass wir das finale verloren haben weil ivan schlecht war
1520405 ich habe versucht ihm klar zu machen dass wir nur eine chance auf den titel haben wenn wir alle auf top niveau spielen auch in zukunft
1520406 er hat nur einen satz gesagt ich brauche mehr eiszeit dann ist er gegangen
1520407 ich bereue nichts weil ich nichts falsch gemacht habe soll ich als trainer denn vor ivan auf die knie gehen
1520408 aber ich habe schon mit einzelgespr chen begonnen und versuche den spielern meine position zu erkl ren
1520409 stimmt als ich die letzten vier jahre in leverkusen spielte habe ich auch hier gewohnt bin t glich gependelt
1520410 ich bin ja nie zur ckgetreten beim vfl werde ich richtig gas geben mal sehen was dann passiert
1520411 los m nner zum aufw rmen zehn minuten leichtes laufen
1520412 ich bin zufrieden alle haben gut mitgezogen ihre hausaufgaben in der sommer pause gemacht
1520413 zu bedenken ist dass ein sportler aus zehn meter h he mit rund 60 km h ins wasser eintaucht und dabei enorme kr fte auf den k rper wirken ist ein junger sportler technisch noch nicht richtig ausgebildet kann es zu verletzungen im handgelenk und schulterbereich oder zu wirbels ulensch den kommen
1520414 kinder haben noch keine mechanismen um mit misserfolg umzugehen um ihrem trainer zu gefallen tun sie oft sachen die ihnen nicht gut tun sie werden so dessen beraubt was ein kind am meisten braucht um seiner selbst geliebt zu werden nicht um seiner leistung wegen
1520415 f r die wettk mpfe gibt es keine altersgrenze au er denen die in den von der ioc exekutivkommission genehmigten wettkampfregeln der internationalen verb nde enthalten sind
1520416 ein traum f r mich ich will zeigen dass mein land gute sportler hat
1520417 ich war ja 1999 lang genug mit jan aage zimmerpartner er macht halt gern einen spruch platz 9 zu wiederholen ist f r uns schwer genug
1520418 nur ber eine preiserh hung k nnten wir mehr einnehmen
1520419 wir m ssten uns wirklich was gutes einfallen lassen um neue einnahmequellen zu schaffen
1520420 aber jemanden bitten 20 millionen darlehen auf den tisch zu legen das wollen wir nicht
1520421 die nr 10 ist eine gro e ehre f r mich
1520422 wir wollen nur eine kleine entsch digung bochum hat 30 000 euro berwiesen soviel herz sollte arminia auch zeigen
1520423 es sind durch diesen abscheulichen vorfall auch noch depressionen dazu gekommen herr radic wird von seiner mutter und schwester rund um die uhr gepflegt jetzt muss er sogar in die psychiatrie eingewiesen werden wird wohl sein leben lang berufsunf hig bleiben
1520424 wenn arminia nicht freiwillig f r das opfer zahlen will werden wir den verein auf 150 000 euro schmerzensgeld verklagen
1520425 ich habe starke schmerzen und depressionen arminia war 18 jahre mein verein jetzt muss ich betteln dass man mir etwas hilft

1520433 hi i just finished listening to your most interesting program on lymes disease the statement concerning the possibility of a mother transmitting this disease to her breastfeeding child gave rise to a question concerning an undiscussed issue
1520434 if it is in fact possible to transmit the disease through breast milk would it also be possible to transmit the causative bacteria in seminal fluid during intercourse please confer with your specialists and then respond
1520435 when im away from work i want to do what makes me happy and relaxed so i could never be with somebody who nagged me about smoking
1520436 although there is room for improvement the food and beverage industries have made significant progress
1520437 given the concerning picture of food marketings infiltration of childrens lives painted by the ftc report it is disappointing that they continue to perpetuate the myth that self regulation can effectively rein in an industry whose profits rely on commercializing childhood
1520438 disconnect between the food industrys talking points and what we actually see on television during childrens programming
1520439 we are defending islam and its sanctity this is the country we were raised in why should we stand by while our men are defending the country
1520440 the americans took my husband they destroyed our home weve got nothing were living by the grace of god we will not stay silent and everything including bombings we can do in response
1520441 violence by u s or iraqi forces will lead in many cases to grudges and a wish to take revenge especially when husbands are killed i think this is one of the main reasons for female bomb attacks
1520442 female suicide bombers cost little provide ease of planning and are relatively free of risk to terror organizations there is little chance that security forces will obtain sensitive information from them
1520443 we hope that more women will join us in this work
1520444 weve raised concerns for years about primates being in peril but now we have solid data to show the situation is far more severe than we imagined
1520445 tropical forest destruction has always been the main cause but now it appears that hunting is just as serious a threat in some areas even where the habitat is still quite intact in many places primates are quite literally being eaten to extinction
1520446 to have a group of animals under such a high level of threat is quite frankly unlike anything we have recorded among any other group of species to date
1520447 the situation could well have been as bad as this say five years ago we just didnt know but now we have a much better indication of the state of the worlds primates and the news is not good
1520448 the work with lion tamarins shows that conserving forest fragments and reforesting to create corridors that connect them is not only vital for primates but offers the multiple benefits of maintaining healthy ecosystems and water supplies while reducing greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change
1520449 i cant understand why there arent rings of young people blocking bulldozers and preventing them from constructing coal fired power plants
1520450 the gap between the carbon price and the cost of ccs
1520451 i hope that the strengthening of carbon markets will bring forward a sufficiently good price for carbon that it will provide some of the financial incentive for ccs will it be enough i do not know
1520452 as a fig leaf to give unabated coal fired power stations an appearance of environmental acceptability

1520454 thanks i wont include hope to get the set of draft conditions out today or tomorrow
1520455 one trip i spent 10 days in the mentawais borrowing size 36 boardshorts and safety pinning em up

1520457 taking your camera gear from a nicely chilled room to the hot and humid outdoors will fog up your equipment making it unusable
1520458 this sometimes means getting a room without ac in places like mainland mexico youll probably have to drink at least a few beers to help you get through the night this usually means youll be waking up in a pool of your own sweat enjoy
1520459 the digital age of photos has changed the way photos are distributed
1520460 having an image run both editorially and in an ad at the same time is horrific and if it ends up in two competing magazines at the same time career damaging

1520464 whenever the waves are pumping thats when youll do something stupid like forgetting to put a fresh battery in your water housing camera or reformatting your memory card or failing to properly screw down a housing port
1520465 ive learned to be patient and double check everything before i swim out
1520466 when traveling anywhere in the world you must carry your gear with you at all times
1520467 it doesnt matter where you are your gear can and will get stolen
1520468 unless youre at home you have to sleep with it or have a damn good hiding place
1520469 unfortunately the odds of getting pro surfers out of bed early or into the water right before dark and have good waves with no haze and no fog is about as easy as finding osama bin laden
1520470 i work for billabong and they buff me and my family out and thats the shit
1520471 most surfers dont really understand what makes a good surf photo
1520472 never trust what the surfer says about the waves they dont usually look at a wave from a photo perspective i always have to see them to make the call
1520473 we want to lift a loud voice to change our food system
1520474 we need to change the ways we grow distribute and eat food which needs to be good clean and fair things are at a crisis point with respect to health and the environment
1520475 we have been talking about a vegetable garden on the white house lawn this would be a way to talk about stewardship and nourishment thomas jefferson had such a garden
1520476 a big message of slow food nation is that we all need to be planting gardens
1520477 we need to have more greenhouses in the future whether it gets too hot or too cold
1520478 if you want to help grind up large quantities of gravenstein apples to make fresh juice drink lots of juice join a pot luck bbq lunch and get covered in apple pulp come on over
1520479 activists who campaign on behalf of farm workers and meatpacking workers
1520480 how do you create a system in which eating well and treating people well are inextricably linked
1520481 to empower networks of students and young farmers cooks artisans activists and eaters
1520482 we will speak in classes during the last week of august to inform students of the event we will make a film of the youth program there that will be shown at the october terra madre gathering in italy we have been working to get michael pollan and some of the other key speakers to come to campus
1520483 slow food is the opposite of fast food it is food that comes from local sustainable farms
1520484 we intend to raise awareness about the profound effects of our food choices on the environment on our health and on issues of social justice
1520485 the current industrial model will soon fail for its heavy dependency on homogeneity and petroleum as such slow food is about survival
1520486 on a long 200 person table for a meal curated by outstanding in the field
1520487 26 dynamic presentations on topics ranging from the viability of rare breeds to the nuts and bolts of engaging our isolated urban and rural communities in the sustainable food movement
1520488 lay the groundwork for more concrete inclusive and effective collaboration in the sustainable food and farming movement
1520489 the clash of ideas critical thinking from incisive minds and inspiring dialog
1520490 more people are thinking about what they eat these days
1520491 im proud to be a small part of this movement with a vision for a better food system it can help activate people to work to change food policies
1520492 i went to slow food nations parent terra madre in italy
1520493 it was life changing i plan to go to slow food nation because i do not want to miss another chance for a life changing event
1520494 terra madre was a heart event it was a thrill to see families still making the food they have made for centuries you feel this human thing it was very emotional and made me cry some recipes for corn bread for example had been handed down for twenty generations
1520495 i love the apple farmers here in sonoma county they are courageous there is a history here that we need to remember
1520496 slow food is an opportunity to re connect with our food and local growers and to understand the plight our planet is in our immunity and the immune system of the earth are linked building from here is a source of our healing
1520497 it helps create a sense of what real nourishment is it brings farmers children and the community back into the food system rather than leaving it in the hands of large corporations slow food encourages people to grow and cook their own food and remember the pleasure in that
1520498 it was intense being around people from over 150 countries in their traditional dress who have this common bond and language of the land growing food preserving local food cultures preparing serving and nourishing others
1520499 they have a delicious heritage bean they so inspired me that i bought them as christmas presents and included information about slow food
1520500 i traded them for tomatoes of which i have many
1520501 we need to do more foraging and gleaning lots of food is wasted on the ground which is very edible
1520502 have a long history yet are mostly ignored by the culinary mainstream
1520503 weve been writing a declaration and petition calling for a new national food policy
1520504 when kids grow and cook their own food they all want to eat it
1520505 they want an interactive education they are happy to be in the garden kids are not just hungry for food they are hungry for people to take care of them and for nature
1520506 the way of the world a story of truth and hope in an age of extremism
1520507 it was the kind of thing where the cia said look this is not our charge were not here to carry forth a political mandate which is clearly what this was to solve a political problem in america and it was a cause of great grievance inside of the agency
1520508 one of the greatest lies in modern american political history
1520509 its on the record its in the book and people can read it for themselves
1520510 why dont they ask him to give us something we can use to help make our case
1520511 bush wanted to go to war in iraq from the very first days he was in office nothing was going to stop that
1520512 in the book youll see people who are involved and talking about the debate and it was quite a fierce debate at the highest levels of the government is habbush reliable whats he saying how can we check it
1520513 and a lot of people at the end of the day said it was hard for him to prove the negative that what he said was no weapons were actually not there thats hard to do
1520514 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammed atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operation link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade
1520515 a handwritten letter with habbushs name on it would be fashioned by cia and then hand carried by a cia agent to baghdad for dissemination
1520516 well the cia folks involved in the book and others talk about george tenet coming back from the white house with the assignment on white house stationery and turning to the cia operatives who are professionals and saying you may not like this but here is our next mission
1520517 and they carried it through step by step all the way to the finish
1520518 is really concrete proof that al qaeda was working with saddam
1520519 it is in my opinion true that the administration for whatever reason was determined to have a showdown with iraq that predated this whole wmd stuff
1520520 well you know a lot of them have been walking around with this lump in their chest for a couple of years five years now
1520521 and because theyre essentially free theyre not the original source they said look why hide now
1520522 id done this sort of thing for a while and the way it worked was there were off the record sources who played out the story and then i went to people actually involved
1520523 they were freed up because theyre not the original source if you will to sort of talk about the context what they felt what they did and the people actually involved and of course theyre all through the book on the record talking about how it all worked
1520524 a hope in the unseen an american odyssey from the inner city to the ivy league
1520525 wrote it as fast as possible and were publishing it as fast as possible because there is news in the book and we dont want to sit on it
1520526 its hard to keep waiting for something you know will never happen but its even harder to give it all up knowing its everything you want
1520527 this is when we show them how much we love them by letting them go

1520539 the better the opponent the tougher the game the more excited he is about pitching
1520540 i dont its just a little disagreement i apologize for the way it went down but i dont apologize for the passion and intensity i definitely could have handled it a little better but just at that moment thats how it went down i cant take it back the way i handled it probably could have been dealt with better
1520541 i want guys that compete i want guys that play with fire and passion and sometimes when you do things like that happen
1520542 id much rather deal with this than a bunch of guys sitting on the bench getting their butts kicked every day and not caring about it to be honest with you
1520543 were a good team and we havent been playing well
1520544 things happen like i said were not in middle school we should be able to get over it
1520545 these things could be very very beneficial for a team
1520546 yes they could be detrimental or they could be very very beneficial they sure can and not only for the team but for individual players i guess well find out

1520572 because marriage gives an implied consent to intercourse it is legally impossible for a man to rape his wife
1520573 if the couple were sent presents before the wedding was cancelled then generally those presents must be returned to the people who gave them the law assumes that the gifts were given on the understanding that the couple were to be married and so if the marriage is called off they are no longer entitled to the presents

1520581 the plaintiffs describe the alleged violations in this case as classic per se antitrust violations in this courts judgment that label does not fit so neatly as they would like the complexity of these particular arrangements the peculiar industry of sports and the ambiguity of the bounds of the relevant market all counsel against treating the business practices in dispute here as per se violations of antitrust law

1520585 hmm ja ik zie dat er aanzienlijke bedragen in yen zijn afgeschreven maar ogenblik ik verbind u door met de afdeling fraude en diefstal
1520586 dat schept op zich een band want ik schrik hier ook van het zweet staat op mijn voorhoofd
1520587 nee dat moet u zeker niet doen ik schrik dat dit door onze veiligheidssystemen heen is gegaan u bent niet in china geweest zegt u terwijl er de afgelopen periode grote bedragen daar zijn afschreven uw kaart is gekopieerd maar u hoeft u nergens zorgen over te maken want u bent hier tegen verzekerd
1520588 ik vind het echt heel vervelend voor u want u begrijpt dat wij uw kaart direct blokkeren maar u krijgt zo snel mogelijk een nieuwe kaart opgestuurd en alles wordt in orde gemaakt maar bent u recentelijk ook niet in het verre oosten geweest
1520589 nou in november ben ik in jakarta geweest maar verder niet

1520596 one of the trends for zoos that has come about in the renovation process is expansive homes for animals making them very realistic to what you would find out in nature
1520597 we want to ask the voters of salt lake county to fund continued improvements at hogle zoo their zoo and its really as simple as that
1520598 what we hoped was there would be an opportunity from the public for some infusion of public funds and that in turn would stimulate the private capital campaign

1520605 i think as a quarterback you are always having to go out there and earn the confidence of a coach that youre a leader
1520606 i have one year left and a chance to do something special
1520607 ben is certainly experienced but i dont know if he has ever been a leader
1520608 every coach has a different style on how they want you to lead
1520609 its good to sit down with the coach and hear what he wants you to do im excited about the chance to prove the type of leader i am
1520610 i have been playing offense my whole life im going to be happy wherever i play its football as long as i have the opportunity to be on field it doesnt matter where im going to play but they gave me the choice to play offense or defense and i chose offense
1520611 the bottom line is were a family but were all trying to get on the field
1520612 the running backs that get on the field are the ones who make the team better the only thing you can do is make sure you play harder than everyone else and were all going to try to do that if youre not doing that then youre not a college athlete
1520613 i will see you then thanks for everything love you

1520619 atp took the steps that it believed is right and is going to help improve the game of tennis
1520620 its an exciting time for him to be a parent for the first time
1520621 we certainly have had our work cut out for us
1520622 with the depth that we have weve been able to piece it together
1520623 fortunately getting some people back from their injury has helped us in that regard
1520624 we will never use injuries as an excuse for anything
1520625 were going to go into this game expecting and planning with positive expectancy to win the game
1520626 if you saw him on the street you would have no idea that he is our running back
1520627 having golf an olympic sport is exponentially more important to the game of golf than the majors
1520628 the reason for that is it would bring in 168 different countries and their olympic foundation and all those revenues and that would be going towards the growth of the game
1520629 its for growing the game around the world and something we can all do together
1520630 the value for the players is that the more people that play around the world the more people will be watching theyll be paid back eventually
1520631 i want to watch the olympic sports where basically professionals arent playing
1520632 where that is the absolute pinnacle of their career and they had to wait four years for this one moment and they go out and they perform break a world record win a gold medal and they were able to perform on the spot
1520633 im not competing until next year so ive got another five months to kill
1520634 this one is more frustrating because im the two time defending champion
1520635 its a frustrating process for any athlete whos ever gone through it to be at the top of the game moving around and all of a sudden going to the bathroom is one of the hardest things to do
1520636 its been a struggle its also been a great learning experience
1520637 the last three holes i knew i had a two shot lead
1520638 i didnt step on my big toe and make any bogeys i parred the last three nothing heroic
1520639 they talk about all the camaraderie that the europeans have
1520640 i dont know about all this camaraderie stuff sure it helps but the fact is our guys just need to play better
1520641 i had him over for dinner in ireland about six weeks ago
1520642 the first question i asked him was it a blind par 3 at home when you have a blind par 3 often the caddies stick the golf balls in the hole so ive been teasing him about that
1520643 i was over there throwing the football on the side he said give me that kids name i want him to play quarterback for me when hes in high school and sure enough i played quarterback for him five years later it worked out well for me
1520644 i told my wife when i first saw him ill have to wait for that kid to come around
1520645 what i saw was just tremendous form in throwing the ball its hard to get a kid that age to throw the ball that well he threw it with such poise and motion but he wasnt sure he was going to play football so we had to do a little talking to him and his family to try football we were smart enough to say the right things to make him give it a try
1520646 he is still becoming a leader with the voice but hes a leader by his actions i remember in the off season he was in the weight room as much as any offensive or defensive lineman that stands out in march when the season is six months away that showed me a lot
1520647 it was working on your timing with routes and just talking football but also talking life and relationship and politics and those sorts of things
1520648 just getting to know each other better you look at them in the huddle and you know them a little better than just the name on the back of the jersey
1520649 although we clearly face more challenging macro economic conditions in fiscal 09 were well positioned to deliver continued if somewhat less robust growth
1520650 but companies willing to invest in new forms of delivery which have a commitment to quality will prosper
1520651 the stop will be closed to the public and there will be only limited media coverage
1520652 why is senator mccain in west virginia talking football behind closed doors when he should be here talking about gas prices
1520653 with some of the longest commuting times in the nation west virginians are hurting more from the high cost of fuel than residents of almost any other state

1520655 dizzyingly inventive and hypnotically engaging a dirty job is like no other book ive ever read
1520656 we are carefully evaluating all aspects of our operations in the uk
1520657 our goal is to reduce our operating losses to 13m in fiscal year 2009 7m in fiscal year 2010 and to approach break even in 2011
1520658 we believe the long term growth potential in the uk is much greater th an in canada
1520659 how many potholes might we have fixed with that money
1520660 now the election for the federal seat of lyne has been set for september 6 a week before the council elections
1520661 what sort of person would approve such a decision and such a waste of money
1520662 why couldnt they have had the two polls on the one day september 13 and saved all that money
1520663 we would have saved both us and the federal taxpayer lots of money
1520664 four years ago the council elections cost our council 120 000
1520665 so for the past four years we have budgeted about 30 000 each year set aside in anticipation of this years poll
1520666 what we have noticed is that since old bar entrance was opened in april there is a lot more flow in and out of the entrances
1520667 were now seeing bigger high tides and lower low tides
1520668 while a high tide in the day might be 1 4 metres the high tide that night might be 1 8 metres and therefore that is the one well use to launch a new vessel
1520669 there has been no feedback from local operators to say they are suffering which is a good sign
1520670 i think the reason we are on the positive side is our close proximity to the areas of sydney newcastle and the central coast
1520671 many of us well remember the youth drop in centre run by mal cochrane at purfleet some years ago
1520672 it was successful in targeting many of the youth that were then falling through the educational community net
1520673 there is widespread community support at purfleet for a similar drop in centre to again operate and i understand my proposal is to be considered by the land council
1520674 what we need is a longer range proposal to stop kids falling through the cracks a place where frustrated kids can go and feel they are doing something with their lives
1520675 what these rockthrowing kids are doing is seeking attention we know they run off when they have committed their crimes but by that time they have achieved their aim and got their kicks
1520676 i can see there can be a change of attitude with an infrastructure in place manned by people they can trust i even have volunteers prepared to come aboard if the government can put forward the revenue
1520677 on top of that and most importantly taree and purfleet would have a far better reputation than at present
1520678 this is a problem to be attacked by everyone in the community
1520679 and why sob why do people sob why do people treat animals badly
1520680 ive been so screwed up for so long and it took me 38 years to find the help i needed im not nearly ready to wean off of it
1520681 but he wont see the bad bit loads of baths
1520682 repeated commit or defer decisions with a deadline the influenza vaccine composition
1520683 first that the fda should be willing to consider deferring a decision about which strains to include if early conclusive evidence isnt available
1520684 second the fda should reexamine its commitment to the rigid structure of the vaccine with exactly one strain from each of three categories for example if theres agreement on choosing two of the strains and disagreement about which strain to pick for the third why not include four
1520685 importantly we discovered that this fibrosis occurs more rapidly and to a greater extent in the portion of the gut the largest lymphatic tissue in the body containing the t cells compared with other immune tissues
1520686 the fibrosis stops cells from returning to immune tissues especially in the gut
1520687 hello everyone i wonder if anyone would be so kind as to give me some advice or let me know where i can get some
1520688 no no more i dont want to give you any money and i dont want to have sex with you so leave me alone
1520689 hey im not asking for money i will drop 1 000 on you right now if you want im just trying to talk to you girl why you gotta get an attitude
1520690 bullshit go away i dont care unless you want to talk to my mom here extends the phone
1520691 its not worth it if it doesnt cater to me
1520692 a few bucks to promote such a mission and serve the entire community that is not represented by commercial radio that sounds like a bargain
1520693 well it did the whole thing is sitting out there on the edge of campus
1520694 wir haben zwar wie gegen barcelona 0 1 verloren aber ich glaube nicht dass das ein schlechtes zeichen war
1520695 wir haben gegen eine sehr ausgefuchste mannschaft gespielt mit einem sehr cleveren trainer der hier mit zehn abwehrspielern und einem st rmer gespielt hat da wird es dann nat rlich schwer wenn die in f hrung gehen es ist ganz normal dass wir ohne luca toni und franck ribery nicht die durchschlagskraft haben um so ein bollwerk unter druck zu setzen ich war deswegen auch nicht so unzufrieden spielerisch war es ein gutes fu ballspiel es haben halt nur die tore gefehlt
1520696 man will nat rlich gegen so eine prestigetr chtige mannschaft wie inter mailand gewinnen aber ich glaube wir haben trotzdem gut gespielt wir haben versucht dass spiel schnell zu machen und torchancen heraus zu spielen inter mailand stand nur hintern drin und dann wird es nat rlich schwer wir sind zudem noch nicht k rperlich in der lage dass wir pressing spielen und sie komplett unter druck setzen die leistung geht in ordnung das resultat nat rlich nicht
1520697 wir sind eine woche vor dem supercup und drei wochen vor dem beginn der meisterschaft nat rlich wollen wir jede gelegenheit nutzen uns zu verbessern die mannschaft ist hinter zwar gut gestanden trotzdem w rde ich mir w nschen dass die abwehr offensiver agiert bayern spielte etwas schneller als wir darauf haben wir aber intelligent regiert beiden trainern fehlen aber noch so viele spieler dass sie momentan noch nicht die besten voraussetzungen habe
1520698 wir haben zwar wie gegen barcelona 0 1l verloren aber ich glaube nicht dass das ein schlechtes zeichen war in der ersten halbzeit haben wir gut gespielt in der zweiten halbzeit haben wir auch die ganze zeit nach vorne gespielt und inter ist nur hinten gestanden dann macht inter durch einen fehler von uns das tor und dann wird es nat rlich schwer
1520699 die zuschauer kamen hierher um ein gutes spiel zu sehen und dass die eigene mannschaft gewinnt dass haben wir heute leider nicht geschafft in der ersten halbzeit haben wir ganz ordentlich gespielt aber in der zweiten nicht mehr so zielstrebig nach vorne aber wir sind noch nicht bei hundert prozent und deswegen war es ein guter test f r uns dass noch nicht alles klappt ist ganz normal die em spieler sind viel sp ter zur mannschaft gesto en trotzdem gehen wir am sonntag gut ger stet in das pokalspiel
1520700 weve lost 1 0 like we did against barcelona but i dont think that turned out to be a bad omen
1520701 weve played a very cunning team with a very clever coach whos come here with ten defenders and one striker so it was always going to be tough if they took the lead you wouldnt expect us to put such a packed defence under pressure without luca toni and franck ribery so im not particularly unhappy it was a decent game of football it just lacked goals
1520702 youre obviously looking to win against prestige opponents such as inter milan but i still think we gave a good account of ourselves we tried to keep the pace high and create chances but inter had no ambitions other than to defend and that obviously made it difficult on top of that were not yet physically strong enough for a comprehensive pressing game with constant pressure the display was fine but the result obviously wasnt
1520703 we have a week to go until the supercup and three weeks until the league restarts obviously we want to use every possible opportunity to improve i know we defended well but id still like to see my defenders take a more attack minded approach bayern were a little quicker than we were but we reacted intelligently to that however the circumstances were nothing like the best as both coaches were missing so many players
1520704 weve lost 1 0 like we did against barcelona but i dont think that turned out to be a bad omen we played well in the first half in the second half we spent the whole time attacking but inter just pulled men back then we made a mistake and inter scored and it was always going to be hard after that

1520795 while it is rather rash to make detailed prophecies it is i think fairly clear that in future a human body from the moment of conception will not be regarded merely as something which must be left to grow in accordance with natural forces with no human interference beyond what is required for the preservation of health the tendency of scientific technique is to cause everything to be regarded as not just a brute datum but raw material for the carrying out of some human purpose the child and even the embryo will come to be viewed more and more in this way as the mentality connected with scientific technique becomes more dominant in this as in all other forms of scientific power there are possibilities of good and possibilities of evil science alone will not decide which is to prevail
1520796 science when it has once acquired a firm hold upon social organization is hardly likely to stop short at those biological aspects of human life which have hitherto been left to the joint guidance of religion and instinct we may i think assume that both the quantity and the quality of the population will be carefully regulated by the state but that sexual intercourse apart from children will be regarded as a private matter so long as it is not allowed to interfere with work as regards quantity the state statisticians will determine as carefully as they can whether the population of the world at the moment is above or below the number which leads to the greatest material comfort per head they will also take account of all such changes of technique as can be foreseen no doubt the usual rule will be to aim at a stationary population but if some important invention such as artificial food should greatly cheapen the production of necessaries an increase of population might for a time be thought wise i shall however assume that in normal times the world government will decree a stationary population if we were right in supposing that the scientific society will have different social grades according to the kind of work to be performed we may assume also that it will have uses for human beings who are not of the highest grade of intelligence it is probable that there will be certain kinds of labour mainly performed by negroes and that manual workers in general will be bred for patience and muscle rather than for brains the governors and experts on the contrary will be bred chiefly for their intellectual powers and their strength of character assuming that both kinds of breeding are scientifically carried out there will come to be an increasing divergence between the two types making them in the end almost different species scientific breeding in any truly scientific form would at present encounter insuperable obstacles both from religion and from sentiment to carry it out scientifically it would be necessary as among domestic animals to employ only a small percentage of males for purposes of breeding it may be thought that religion and sentiment will always succeed in opposing an immovable veto to such a system i wish i could think so but i believe that sentiment is quite extraordinarily plastic and that the individualistic religion to which we have been accustomed is likely to be increasingly replaced by a religion of devotion to the state among russian communists this has already happened in any case what is demanded is scarcely as difficult a control of natural impulses as is involved in the celibacy of the catholic priesthood wherever remarkable achievements are possible and are at the same time such as to satisfy mens moral idealism the love of power is capable of swallowing up the instinctive life of the affections especially if an outlet is permitted to purely physical sexual impulses traditional religion which has been violently dispossessed in russia will suffer a setback everywhere if the russian experiment proves successful in any case its outlook is difficult to reconcile with that of industrialism and scientific technique traditional religion was based upon a sense of mans impotence in the face of natural forces whereas scientific technique induces a sense of the impotence of natural forces in the face of mans intelligence combined with this sense of power a certain degree of austerity in regard to the softer pleasures is quite natural one sees it already in many of those who are creating the mechanistic society of the future in america this austerity has taken the form of protestant piety in russia of devotion to communism i think therefore that there is hardly any limit to the departures from traditional sentiment which science may introduce into the question of reproduction if the simultaneous regulation of quantity and quality is taken seriously in the future we may expect that in each generation some 25 per cent of women and some 5 per cent of men will be selected to be the parents of the next generation while the remainder of the population will be sterilized which will in no way interfere with their sexual pleasures but will merely render these pleasures destitute of social importance the women who are selected for breeding will have to have eight or nine children each but will not be expected to perform any other work except the suckling of the children for a suitable number of months no obstacles will be placed upon their relations with sterile men or upon the relations of sterile men and women with each other but reproduction will be regarded as a matter which concerns the state and will not be left to the free choice of the persons concerned perhaps it will be found that artificial impregnation is more certain and less embarrassing since it will obviate the need of any personal contact between the father and mother of the prospective child sentiments of personal affection may still be connected with intercourse not intended to be fruitful while impregnation will be regarded in an entirely different manner more in the light of a surgical operation so that it will be thought not ladylike to have it performed in the natural manner the qualities for which parents will be chosen will differ greatly according to the status which it is hoped the child will occupy in the governing class a considerable degree of intelligence will be demanded of parents perfect health will of course be indispensable so long as gestation is allowed to persist to its natural period mothers will also have to be selected by their capacity for easy delivery and will therefore have to be free from an unduly narrow pelvis it is probable however that as time goes on the period of gestation will be shortened and that later months of foetal development will take place in an incubator this would also free mothers from the need of suckling their children and would thus make maternity a not very onerous matter the care of infants intended to belong to the governing class would seldom be left to the mothers mothers would be selected by their eugenic qualities and these would not necessarily be the qualities required in a nurse on the other hand the early months of pregnancy might be more burdensome than at present since the foetus would be subjected to various kinds of scientific treatment intended to affect beneficially not only its own characteristics but those of its possible descendants fathers would of course have nothing to do with their own children there would be in general only one father to every five mothers and it is quite likely that he would never have even seen the mothers of his children the sentiment of paternity would thus disappear completely probably in time the same thing would happen though to a slightly less degree in regard to mothers if birth were prematurely induced and the child separated from its mother at birth maternal sentiment would have little chance to develop
1520797 among the workers it is probable that less elaborate care would be taken since it is easier to breed for muscle than to breed for brains and it is not unlikely that women would be allowed to bring up their own children in the old fashioned natural manner there would not be among the workers the same need as among the governors for fanatical devotion to the state and there would not be therefore on the part of the government the same jealousy of the private affections among the governors one must suppose all private sentiments would be viewed with suspicion a man and woman who showed any ardent devotion to each other would be regarded as they are at present regarded by moralists when they are not married there would be professional nurses in cr ches and professional teachers in nursery schools but they would be considered to be failing in their duty if they felt any special affection for special children children who showed any special affection for a particular adult would be separated form that adult ideas of this kind are already widespread they will be found suggested for example in dr john b watsons book on education the tendency of the scientific manipulator is to regard all private affections as unfortunate freudians have shown us that they are the sources of complexes administrators realize that they stand in the way of a whole hearted devotion to business the church sanctioned certain kinds of love while condemning others but the modern ascetic is more thoroughgoing and condemns all kinds of love equally as mere folly and waste of time
1520798 what should we expect of the mental make up of people in such a world the manual workers may i think be fairly happy one may assume that the rulers will be successful in making the manual workers foolish and frivolous work will not be too severe and there will be endless amusements of a trivial sort owing to sterilization love affairs need not have awkward consequences so long as they are not between a man and woman who are both of them unsterilized in this way a life of easygoing and frivolous pleasure may be provided for the manual workers combined of course with a superstitious reverence for the governors instilled in childhood and prolonged by the propaganda to which adults will be exposed the psychology of the governors will be a more difficult matter they will be expected to display an arduous and hard working devotion to the ideal of the scientific state and to sacrifice to this ideal all the softer sentiments such as love of wife and children friendships between fellow workers whether of the same or of different sexes will tend to become ardent and will not infrequently overstep the limits which the public moralists will have fixed in such a case the authorities will separate the friends unless in doing so they will interrupt some important research or administrative undertaking when for some such public reason friends are not separated they will be admonished by means of governmental microphones the censors will listen in to their conversations and if these should at any time become tinged with sentiment disciplinary measures will be adopted all the deeper feelings will be frustrated with the sole exception of devotion to science and the state the governors will of course have their amusements for leisure hours i do not see how art or literature could flourish in such a world nor do i think that the emotions from which they spring and to which they appeal would meet with governmental approval but athletics of a strenuous kind will be encouraged among the young of the governing class and dangerous sports will be considered valuable as a training in those habits of mind and body by which authority over the manual workers will be maintained love making among the sterilized will be subjected to no restrictions either of law or of public opinion but it will be casual and temporary involving none of the deeper feelings and no serious affection persons suffering from unendurable boredom will be encouraged to ascend mount everest or fly over the south pole but the need for such distractions will be regarded as a sign of mental or physical ill health in such a world though there may be pleasure there will be no joy the result will be a type displaying the usual characteristics of vigorous ascetics they will be harsh and unbending tending towards cruelty in their ideals and their readiness to consider that the infliction of pain is necessary for he public good i do not imagine that pain will be much inflicted as punishment for sin since no sin will be recognized except insubordination and failure to carry out the purposes of the state it is more probable that the sadistic impulses which the asceticism will generate will find their outlet in scientific experiment the advancement of knowledge will be held to justify much torture of individuals by surgeons biochemists and experimental psychologist as time goes on the amount of added knowledge required to justify a given amount of pain will diminish and the number of governors attracted to the kinds of research necessitating cruel experiments will increase just as the sun worship of the aztecs demanded the painful death of thousands of human beings annually so the new scientific religion will demand its holocausts of sacred victims gradually the world will grow more dark and more terrible strange perversions of instinct will first lurk in the dark corners and then gradually overwhelm the men in high places sadistic pleasures will not suffer the moral condemnation that will be meted out to the softer joys since like the persecutions of the inquisition they will be found in harmony with the prevailing asceticism in the end such a system must break down either in an orgy of bloodshed or in the rediscovery of joy such at least is the only ray of hope to lighten the darkness of these visions of cassandra but perhaps in permitting this ray of hope we have allowed ourselves to yield to a foolish optimism perhaps by means of injections and drugs and chemicals the population could be induced to bear whatever its scientific masters may decide to be for its good new forms of drunkenness involving no subsequent headache may be discovered and new forms of intoxication may be invented so delicious that for their sakes these are possibilities in a world governed by knowledge without love and power without delight the man drunk with power is destitute of wisdom and so long as he rules the world the world will be a place devoid of beauty and of joy
1520799 take again such a matter as housing in england individualism leads most families to prefer a small house of their own rather than an apartment in a large house the result is that the suburbs of london are spread out through mile after mile of dreariness to the immense detriment of the women and children each housewife cooks an abominable dinner at great expenditure of labour for an infuriated husband the children when they come home from school or while they are too young to go to school find themselves cooped up in small stuffy premises where either they are a nuisance to their parents or their parents are a nuisance to them in a more sensible community each family would occupy a part of an immense building with a courtyard in the middle there would be no individual cooking but only communal meals children as soon as they were no longer at the breast would spend their day in large airy halls under the care of women possessing the knowledge the training and the temperament required for making young children happy the wives who at present drudge all day doing wasteful work badly would be set free to earn their living outside the home the benefit of such a system to the mothers and still more to the children would be incalculable at the rachel macmillan nursery school it was found that about 90 per cent of the children had rickets when they first came and almost all were cured at the end of the first year in the school in the ordinary home the necessary modicum of light and air and good food cannot be provided whereas all these things can be provided quite cheaply if they are provided for many children at once the freedom to cause ones children to grow up stunted and crippled on the ground that one is too fond of them to part with them is a freedom which is certainly not in the public interest

1520843 nafta has become a diversion a pi ata for pandering pundits and politicans
1520844 the future of north america replacing a bad neighbor policy
1520845 fue una excelente performance hubo saltos al vacio en lo coreogr fico y muy bien resueltos
1520846 i am nothing special there are no monuments dedicated to me and my name would soon be forgotten but ive loved another with all my heart and soul and to me this has always been enough i have no complaints about my path and the places it had taken me but the path i have chosen has always been the right one and i wouldnt have it any other way
1520847 ive learned that if you cant get it all together and accomplish this thing called peace you at least do your part in your own life because thats where you can make an immediate difference
1520848 we need to be able to address a national energy strategy and then try to work on environmental efficiencies as part of that plan
1520849 we cant just start with things like emission standards at a time when were at a crisis with the entire national energy policy
1520850 there was not enough emphasis that if we move aggressively toward sustainable energy we will transform our energy costs
1520851 we were not as clear as we might have been
1520852 a lot of environmental activists still have not come to accept that the humans are also part of the environment
1520853 we need your help to get this film into theatres and schools across the country to defeat al gores lies and exaggerations
1520854 not evil just wrong is the film al gore and hollywood dont want you to see
1520855 al gore has raised us 300 million to bombard the world with his message that all the energy in the us should be renewable in 10 years he is even running his ads during sponge bob square pants our children are watching this propaganda and are being forced to watch
1520856 please help us as much as you can to get this film out now
1520857 does this mean you endorse using gas hogs and large mansions
1520858 i have a recommendation but its not of a person and i shared this with them back in march
1520859 wait till the democrat convention is over and see who they pick youll have more information
1520860 there is no convincing scientific evidence that human release of carbon dioxide methane or other greenhouse gasses is causing or will cause in the future catastrophic heating of the earths atmosphere and disruption of the earths climate
1520861 an overwhelming number of scientists have determined that catastrophic manmade global warming is real and that any further debate over the science is pointless
1520862 marketed not on the basis of science its about what is known or what can be proved about the natural world rather than the number of scientists who are willing to publicly commit to a particular opinion
1520863 an overwhelming number of scientists they are referring to scientists working under the auspices of the u n s intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc that agrees man made greenhouse gas emissions are or will in the future wreak havoc on the climate
1520864 head counts of scientists seem to be the name of the global warming game
1520865 the white house has taken a beating over the years in the press on climate and facts no longer matter
1520866 the latest move was to list the polar bear as an endangered species
1520867 there are many more polar bears today than 40 years ago and predictions of the bears demise are entirely based on politically inspired speculation
1520868 we cant drive our suvs and eat as much as we want and keep our homes on 72 degrees at all times and then just expect other countries to say ok
1520869 regulate the pantries of america as well as thermostats and modes of personal transportation mccain and the bush administration are drinking the same kool aid the initial response from the bush administration to relevant new facts seems to be see no consensus hear no consensus speak no consensuses
1520870 if president bush had pursued the right energy policies and made the investments in clean coal technology that he promised eight years ago he might not be talking about the high gasoline prices today
1520871 big hurdle is fund raising even among a business community that is desperate to throw out mr mcgraw
1520872 10 thinks you didnt know about west virginia gov joe manchin
1520873 in my 31 years of social work i dont think ive seen a crime this heinous perpetrated against a social worker in the line of duty
1520874 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
1520875 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
1520876 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
1520877 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
1520878 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
1520879 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
1520880 my heart goes out to the families of the victims as well as to the community and the whole u p i was raised in the up and i know how much we yoopers value the serenity and safety that goes with living there when i was a kid we didnt even have a lock on our front door it wasnt needed and were not talking that long ago this kind of senseless act will bring the community together but will also leave scars that will make people think twice about their safety
1520881 i demand to know where al gore is declaring that this rise in the lake levels is all just media bunk and that were all still doomed because of global warming
1520882 he wants to tax oil companies profits which will raise the price of gas and use the money to help motorist pay for the more expensive gas is this robbing peter to pay peter
1520883 like any dog this breed needs to be matched with the right owner i dont know much about this specific owner or the circumstances but pit bulls are often a thugged out status symbol and are not given the assertive leadership they require heck it may have to come to the point where one needs to be licensed to own certain breeds banning them may only increase their mystique and status amongst those ill equipped to care for them
1520884 madge gives a great show she is very talented its good she is coming back home to michigan its time
1520885 the involvement of charities means that not only will the film inspire people to act but we can also give them a way to put this inspiration to use afterwards
1520886 we want people to realise that they have the power to resist
1520887 we hope that ngos will be able to tell their members about the project driving more people to the site when we make the film hopefully it will inspire more people to visit the site and join the resist network continuing the whole process
1520888 in most cases the support is not just financial we have worked with all sorts of films including features such as blood diamond in the past people came to us with completed projects and asked us for support but now we work in a more holistic way from script development and research onwards
1520889 if the film maker wants to tell both sides of the story they can do that
1520890 we support freedom of expression any storytelling is positive for us if it shines a light on what is happening in the world we get involved to tell our side of the story correctly documentaries can be overwhelming if they do not contain a solution to the problems they highlight ngos can give that al gores film ended with an example of what people can do people are ripe for that kind of activism
1520891 then we went to britdoc and its organisers supported us pitching for funding when people have seen what we have made we want them to feel inspired to act
1520892 we got involved with britdoc two years ago because we thought documentaries were an effective way of getting complicated issues which cant be summed up in a soundbite through to the public erasing david looks like it will be entertaining and this makes it more accessible which is perfect when trying to interest people in a debate
1520893 it is easy to see how these collaborations can work with subjects such as science if there is transparency
1520894 but i think that where for example a film maker wants to make a documentary on the international criminal court one needs to be particularly careful that both sides of the argument are properly analysed
1520895 i sense that film makers often want to make a film and they are not too concerned where they come from i am a journalist and i like to see things investigated with a critical eye when there is more than one view on a topic we need to be careful about where backing comes from
1520896 i cant think of subjective journalism that i have a problem with if it is marked as subjective and clear
1520897 most journalism is already subjective even if it is labelled as objective i am suspicious of all organisations including news organisations there always needs to be proper controls to protect editorial integrity for ngos collaboration wont work if they ask for something too specific but if say they want to fund increased reporting from congo it can work
1520898 there used to be five broadcasters paying high sums for documentaries now with for example the probability that itv will be able to reduce its public service commitments everything is different commercial and third sector brands can invest in documentaries if it is done sensibly
1520899 you need people who will email friends and walk the streets to talk about a project third sector people care enough to do that
1520900 young gore sets out for his new home where the sky is clear the water is clean and there are no republicans
1520901 former vice president al gore who for the past three decades has unsuccessfully attempted to warn humanity of the coming destruction of our planet only to be mocked and derided by the very people he has tried to save launched his infant son into space monday in the faint hope that his only child would reach the safety of another world
1520902 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
1520903 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
1520904 this is no fantasy no careless product of wild imagination no my friends these indictments that i have brought to you today specific charges herein against the individuals their acts of treason their ultimate aim of sedition these are matters of undeniable fact i ask you now to pronounce judgment on those accused
1520905 this is the moment that the world is waiting for
1520906 i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
1520907 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
1520908 i cant understand why there arent rings of young people blocking bulldozers and preventing them from constructing coal fired power plants
1520909 the gap between the carbon price and the cost of ccs
1520910 i hope that the strengthening of carbon markets will bring forward a sufficiently good price for carbon that it will provide some of the financial incentive for ccs will it be enough i do not know
1520911 as a fig leaf to give unabated coal fired power stations an appearance of environmental acceptability
1520912 has no right to withhold approval for a conventional plant
1520913 thanks i wont include hope to get the set of draft conditions out today or tomorrow

1520922 el problema no es que se le den poderes especiales a esos presidentes para legislar el problema es qu hacen con esos poderes qu hacen con esa habilitaci n cu les son los resultados
1520923 la habilitaci n otorgada a los gobiernos de la cuarta rep blica se tradujo en la aplicaci n de las medidas del fondo monetario internacional en la creaci n de instrumentos para privatizar las empresas b sicas la modificaci n de la ley del impuesto sobre la renta para facilitar a pdvsa la disminuci n progresiva de sus contribuciones al fisco nacional para volver a establecer los cr ditos indexados modificando la ley de protecci n al deudor hipotecario esto ltimo se hizo durante el gobierno de ram n j vel squez breve administraci n de terribles consecuencias
1520924 han sido terribles para los trabajadores pues se privatizaron todas las empresas b sicas se produjeron las fusiones bancarias que no derivaron en m s intermediaci n ni m s financiamiento agr cola ni la creaci n de m s puestos de trabajo por el contrario todo se tradujo en m s desempleo pobreza cr tica y exclusi n

1520935 em termos pr ticos seria voc montar um esquema de patrulhamento eficiente na regi o intermedi ria entre a terra e marte

1520937 when you look up at the sky at night since ill be living on one of them since ill be laughing on one of them for you itll be as if all the stars are laughing youll have stars that can laugh

1520939 people on incomes of 300 000 are getting tax breaks of 3 000 to enable them to buy private health insurance which they would buy anyway
1520940 woolworths says if you give us 12 to 18 months to do it it really shouldnt drive up our costs mr bowen told the nine network on wednesday
1520941 now the smaller retailers of course there would be a tight increased cost as a percentage so i need to work with industry and consumer groups over the next few weeks to try and get that balance right
1520942 the last thing we want to do is put more compliance costs on smaller businesses
1520943 the key is working out what is significant and where you draw the line
1520944 we do need to ensure that everybody has a level playing field and were not giving one supermarket an advantage over another but we do need to ensure that smaller supermarkets arent disadvantaged
1520945 if they cant provide that guarantee then this is another political stunt by prime minister mr kevin rudd
1520946 given queensland healths poor record in managing these issues to date we have concerns about the governance structures and the management accountability within queensland health
1520947 do you need to take it a few days before the irritability starts or would it be like taking an aspirin take it the same day when the symptoms first surface
1520948 in the border regions of north hamkyung province the first round of harvesting was successful accordingly the price of new potatoes has fallen below 300 won since mid july
1520949 in the market in hyesan yangkang province potatoes cost 280 won per kilogram newly harvested barley has also been appearing its a huge help to the civilians
1520950 in the north hamkyung and yangang provinces the price of rice is 2 200 2 400 won per kg and the price of corn 1 200 1 400 won originally during the collective farms harvest distribution in december 4kg of potato was equivalent to 1kg of corn so the prices of rice and corn are not actually any more expensive now
1520951 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of that has got to change
1520952 gore backed his case for renewable electricity with logical case studies
1520953 the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived or his imagination conceived
1520954 and yet few politicians have seemed inclined to address solutions particularly if those solutions involve a modest individual sacrifice
1520955 since taking steps to make his home more environmentally friendly last june gore devours an average of 17 768 kwh per month 1 638 kwh more energy per month than the year before the renovations by comparison the average american household consumes 11 040 kwh in an entire year according to the energy information administration the cost of gores electric bills over the past year topped 16 533
1520956 the worst thing you could do is raise peoples payroll taxes my god
1520957 on social security he sen obama wants to raise social security taxes i am opposed to raising taxes on social security i want to fix the system without raising taxes
1520958 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
1520959 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
1520960 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
1520961 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
1520962 surrender of personal excellence and community value in the mere accumulation of material things it measures neither our wit nor our wisdom and can tell us everything about america except why were proud to be americans
1520963 he is a great surrogate he is the top surrogate
1520964 we just found out last week that gore could come to the island
1520965 he asked gore to come and to be his surrogate
1520966 obama is the first presidential candidate to refuse federal funds in a general election
1520967 while mccain will get 85 million from the federal government for his campaign our goal is to raise 300 to 400 million
1520968 this will be the second or third fundraiser hell attend its pretty special gores a nobel prize winner an academy award winner and almost president
1520969 i had just come out of the cotton fields and corn fields
1520970 i was on welfare with my family and i hated welfare i got angry and upset and told them i wanted to go to work
1520971 we wanted better health care shoes and clothing i felt during the years of my life working in the cotton field they owed me that i just got angry went from door to door we pulled together a few hundred women
1520972 we started marching on the welfare department demanding what we wanted and needed it was about 6 000 people
1520973 the police came and arrested us we had to do something to call attention to our agenda of wanting jobs and wanting to get away from welfare
1520974 i feel good about the honor i am grateful because i earned it i worked for it and i do it from the cotton fields to the bright street of las vegas earned that
1520975 the conrad foundation is based on petes history of innovation and entrepreneurship
1520976 we believe that ultimately it will offer a platform to encourage students to explore entrepreneurship while creating innovative solutions to important issues that face our world and their future
1520977 when al gore recently challenged america to convert to clean renewable energy he struck a chord within our foundation
1520978 if al gores challenge can galvanize the nation to develop renewable energy why not ask americas youth to answer the challenge in our 2009 competition we have invited our students to answer al gores challenge
1520979 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
1520980 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
1520981 the reality is we will have a new president in three months and what bush and the republicans are trying to do amounts to a land grab for the oil companies
1520982 i dont think we have to give in at all pre election we have many more options postelection
1520983 i will sit down with her when im president and will say lets work together
1520984 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there
1520985 se elevan de acuerdo a su capacidad coercitiva implicando en ltima instancia el cierre temporal de la empresa que incurra en las violaciones
1520986 con esto se aspira que el instituto venezolano de seguros sociales ivss obtenga una mayor cantidad de recursos con el fin de ampliar lo que ha hecho hasta el momento
1520987 contempla dos m dulos muy importantes del sistema de seguridad social como son por una parte la salud y por otra las jubilaciones una vez entregado el proyecto a la an ser objeto de una amplia discusi n por parte de todos los sectores de la poblaci n particularmente por los beneficiados los trabajadores
1520988 transcends the boundaries of gender and has the ability to leave any man or woman breathless
1520989 there are proven benefits to the patient from e prescribing including the potential to reduce the incidence of medication and dispensing errors due to illegible prescriptions
1520990 hace unos d as estaba deseando irme y ya estoy aqu otra vez
1520991 setiap dua hari sekali suara dada ayi melonjak tidak wajar di polling web antum bisa ajak temen temen netter yang lain nggak untuk ikut voting
1520992 ini murni dari kami karena kami menganggap pak dada masih cocok dan masih yang terbaik untuk memimpin kota bandung lima tahun mendatang
1520993 masak iya sekarang ada mahasiswa yang bisa dibeli sama dada rosada
1520994 ah lagu lama menurunkan mahasiswa kejalan ngapain ngirim mahasiswa ke kejagung dan kajati segala
1520995 we have to live with our feet very much rooted in reality
1520996 were pursuing renewables as well but you cant simply take away half of your energy base
1520997 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
1520998 it would be difficult for north carolina to meet a 10 percent renewable portfolio standard with only new north carolina renewable supply resources by 2021
1520999 by 2010 were lowering sulfur oxide and nitrous oxide emissions by 70 percent from 2002 three years before required
1521000 the main reason we did it was just to show people what the possibilities are
1521001 a price point comparison will be low enough to do it one day i guess the way of capturing solar energy is kind of expensive silicon is expensive
1521002 this is really just our first dip of our toe into the water
1521003 this is our time to step up and see if its feasible
1521004 were just getting into it right now we wont know probably for at least a couple of years how it works
1521005 coal is dirty any way you slice it coal isnt good
1521006 if you were to put a price on health coal would cost a whole lot and solar would begin to seem more reasonable
1521007 the need for math and science education and higher level thinking skills
1521008 the capital costs of wind and solar are terrifying to contemplate
1521009 a middle course between the republicans insistence on more drilling and democrats demands for more renewables and efficiency measures
1521010 educational levels tend to be higher among those who actually use the label yes
1521011 move quickly and boldly to shake off complacency throw aside old habits and rise clear eyed and alert to the necessity of big changes
1521012 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
1521013 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
1521014 to those who say the costs are still too high i ask them to consider whether the costs of oil and coal will ever stop increasing if we keep relying on quickly depleting energy sources to feed a rapidly growing demand all around the world
1521015 reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years
1521016 provide funding and global business building expertise to a range of businesses both public and private and to entrepreneurs
1521017 an oil and gas exploration and production e amp p company
1521018 has already dug 100 wells around the world and is in the processing of raising additional capital
1521019 it would be ironic to say the least if kleiners first green jackpot turns out to be a company that actually drills for oil
1521020 designs microbes that when injected into oil wells increase oil production and decrease use of water
1521021 al gores carbon crusade the money and connections behind it
1521022 coal makes us sick its global warming its ruining our country its ruining the world weve got to stop using fossil fuel
1521023 do you think running a campaign ad in which you feature britney spears and paris hilton with barack obama is respectful
1521024 its a bit of humor its a way to draw people into the ad
1521025 were not deciding whos our favorite celebrity who we are fans of
1521026 the only strategy theyve got in this election is to try to scare you about me
1521027 well you know hes got a funny name and he doesnt look like all the presidents on the dollar bills and the five dollar bills
1521028 what obama was saying is theyre trying to scare you
1521029 theyre trying to scare the american people and believe me im an expert on how they do that
1521030 to insinuate that his celebrity is somehow all he has
1521031 theyre trying to say to america somehow hes not like you
1521032 the mccain campaign is to use barack obamas words raising the question is he a risky guy but it has nothing to do with his name or his skin color it has to do with his lack of experience and bad judgment his unreadiness to be president
1521033 in 2000 al gore gave me the extraordinary honor of being the first jewish american to run for national office and al gore said he had confidence in the american people that they would judge me based on my record not on my religion
1521034 and i urge barack obama to have the same faith in the american people that they will judge him on his record or lack of record certainly not on his name or his race
1521035 break americas gridlock by honoring a bipartisan effort if that is the only way to move us towards alternative and renewable fuels
1521036 when john mccain brings american troops home from iraq theyre staying home
1521037 i think liebermans going to want to be part of the stronger democratic majority
1521038 weve stopped thinking in terms of hillary people and obama people what was good about this was that we got everybody involved
1521039 our dangerous dependence on foreign oil has been thirty years in the making and was caused by the failure of politicians in washington to think long term about the future of the country
1521040 this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of
1521041 any time you pick up a newspaper and see the terms climate change or global warming just think jobs for michigan
1521042 believe me the production people can do it if they really try
1521043 if hed been president we wouldnt have hadthese bush administration messes the past eight years
1521044 hes charismatic hes a strong orator he has a presencethat draws you in
1521045 al gore is one of the few public figureschallenging my generation to do anything hes inspirational
1521046 i dont think im very good at some of the things that themodern political system rewards and requires and ive foundother ways to make a difference and to serve the publicinterests
1521047 hebecame a star by rising above politics with his passion for theenvironment hes now international leader on an issue more andmore people care about there has been no more successfuldefeated presidential candidate
1521048 if the vice president says its do able i believe
1521049 its a strategy that willcreate millions of new jobs and one that will leave ourchildren a world that is cleaner and safer
1521050 it cannot be the basis of a soundenergy policy by any responsible official in america it seemsto me maybe i am wrong but i dont think so
1521051 you win some you lose some and then theres that little known third category
1521052 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
1521053 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
1521054 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
1521055 achieving the goal before this decade is out of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth
1521056 we are being told by scientists we may have less than 10 years to make dramatic change lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
1521057 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you

1521071 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
1521072 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
1521073 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
1521074 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
1521075 we talk about new york sen hillary clinton and her inspiration to millions of americans speaker pelosi has been an inspiration as well
1521076 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
1521077 but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
1521078 mccain is going to be just like obama mccain is a socialist and will pick nancy pelosi as his vp because he hates conservatives
1521079 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
1521080 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
1521081 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
1521082 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
1521083 the quickest cheapest and best way to start using all this renewable energy is in the production of electricity in fact we can start right now using solar power wind power and geothermal power to make electricity for our homes and businesses
1521084 our struggling auto giants switch to the manufacture of plug in electric cars
1521085 new and replacement generating plants will cost about 560 billon through 2030 absent a significant expansion of energy efficiency programs or new climate initiatives
1521086 of course there are those who will tell us this cant be done
1521087 when we brought the organization to philadelphia and we did research with then television partner nbc polling people of the philadelphia area the awareness factor of arena football was about 1 5 percent

1521089 i know that the players are happy i know that our fans are happy i know that the recipients of our philanthropy are happy
1521090 if this victory can clear the way and get rid of the curse that theyve had here for a number of years i hope it does

1521094 so many people that weve run into over the years that just had the best of wishes for what we just accomplished it was pretty cool
1521095 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
1521096 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
1521097 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
1521098 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
1521099 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
1521100 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
1521101 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature

1521111 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
1521112 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
1521113 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
1521114 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
1521115 i have sifted through hundreds of websites and quite a few beginner books
1521116 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
1521117 the leading experts predict that we have less than 10 years to make dramatic changes in our global warming pollution lest we lose our ability to ever recover from this environmental crisis
1521118 eliminate carbon from the us electricity supply by 2018 or we are doomed
1521119 a challenge to all americans in every walk of life to our political leaders entrepreneurs innovators engineers and to every citizen
1521120 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront this issue as president next year
1521121 given how hot its been this summer can there be any doubt about global warming
1521122 does anyone have any reliable information from knowledgeable sources regarding how much oil is out there
1521123 on this anniversary of his first landmark testimony hansen once again appeared before congress today
1521124 i tell you the truth it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven again i tell you it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of god
1521125 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
1521126 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
1521127 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
1521128 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
1521129 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
1521130 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
1521131 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
1521132 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
1521133 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
1521134 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
1521135 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
1521136 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
1521137 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
1521138 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
1521139 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
1521140 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
1521141 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
1521142 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
1521143 i didnt read all the specifics of his plan i agree with his goal i may disagree on all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue
1521144 i am in no way trying to get in a fight with gore because we share the same goal
1521145 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
1521146 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
1521147 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
1521148 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
1521149 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
1521150 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
1521151 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
1521152 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
1521153 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
1521154 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
1521155 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
1521156 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
1521157 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
1521158 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
1521159 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
1521160 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
1521161 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to

1521168 all over this country people are asking whether or not george bush is smart enough to be president of the united states
1521169 does anyone in america doubt that kerry has a higher iq than bush im sure the candidates sats and college transcripts would put kerry far ahead
1521170 i dont know how theyve done it because my record is not public
1521171 i must have been drinking the night before i took that military aptitude test
1521172 once you settle for a ronald reagan then its easy to settle for a george bush and once you settle for a george bush then its real easy to settle for bush ii you know this should be evolution instead its devolution whats next
1521173 all of us are ignorant of many things its just that the liberal here thinkss he knows what the conservative is ignorant of
1521174 small c conservatives are smeared as stupid by liberals because they respect the values of western civilisation
1521175 a few months later another study emerged demonstrating that the average iq of states that had voted for gore was much higher than those that went for bush connecticut was given an average iq of 113 while conservative utah scored an 87 again barely above retarded according to these numbers the 16 smartest states all went for kerry while the 26 dumbest went for bush
1521176 liberals believe in free speech individual liberty religious freedom the right to make a living

1521184 i was a tourist in england at the time and my friend and i decided to visit where the battle of hastings took place the site is located some ten or twenty miles north and inland from the town of hastings it is called battle abbey named after the church built on the spot where harold of england fell in battle to the forces of william the conqueror my friend and i were walking through the town of battle on our way to the abbey we hadnt seen each other in years and were catching up we were walking along an old stone wall and my friend had just told me a joke i was laughing and enjoying my friends company when all of a sudden i felt as if someone had pulled the rug out from under me from one moment to the next my mood shifted 180 degrees i felt as if there were an invisible cloud over my head like that character in the little abner cartoons i could hardly speak somehow i managed to ask my friend if we could split up for the battlefield tour he graciously agreed the battlefield is now a sheep pasture the original church built on the site is in ruins there is a standard tour that most people take walking along a path that circles the battlefield and stopping to study dioramas that depict key moments in the day long conflict i skipped all of that and walked to the heart of the battlefield where the fighting had taken place there on a gentle hill i seated myself in the midst of a flock of sheep what happened next was very unusual i havent experienced anything like it before or since as i gazed at that sheep pasture i saw superimposed on it a moving line drawing of soldiers hacking at each other with swords of horses rearing and spears being raised and shields going up my eyes seemed to focus on one particular soldier and i watched as he died as the sheep gently nudged me i wept with abandon for about 45 minutes i felt that i was releasing something i had held deep inside for nearly a thousand years which if i had been in that battle would have been true i am spiritually sensitive and ive experienced battlefields before and the residue of sorrow and pain that often lingers there from what others have gone through but this was different it was very clear to me that what i was experiencing had to do with no one else but me it was very real very personal and very powerful at the end of it i felt a deep healing and inner freedom it was partially because of this experience that i decided to share what i was learning about past lives with others

1521284 in my lifetime i have never seen a candidate brazenly fabricate so many different stories debunked by so many different people
1521285 the democratic party of oregon is attempting to run a non issue based campaign by tossing out false accusations against mike erickson
1521286 on the mailing list it explicitly said in 2006 erickson was endorsed by so and so
1521287 greg came with roy spoke just as long as roy did and said mike was a great candidate
1521288 in every sector of his life you see erickson making false claims
1521289 hes not only prolific at making lies hes bad at it
1521290 i think its time for mike erickson to tell the truth about the lack of support hes receiving from republicans much less independents and democrats
1521291 i think the cigarette tax will be in play next session
1521292 despite all the advertising we see somehow the message doesnt seem to be getting through that bad driving and alcohol results in injury and death
1521293 i dont feel he is a bad person i think he lives in his own hell he made a terrible decision a bad choice he has faced up to it

1521307 id had a couple of conversations with him and it seemed like there might be something going on so he came in and sure it was a surprise
1521308 for someone to discuss retirement and then to come back and change his mind a day later im worried a lot about it
1521309 im worried about where hes at mentally because these things happen sometimes and they come back up again because maybe they come back and maybe it isnt necessarily for the right reasons so were going to continue to communicate with him and push him out there on the field and get him better

1521348 greek cypriots fled the moment there was rumor or sight of military forces creating a virtual vacuum into which the turkish army could and did move without resistance and without the presence of people
1521349 at the first opportunity we get the greek cypriot national guard will attack and regain by force of arms our occupied lands

1521352 we have been asking for ten years for our community to be able to go to morphou through limnitis while at the same time the un and the turkish cypriots use this road every day without any problem by this logic there is no reason why we cant go to morphou
1521353 i have no quibble with the turkish cypriots and i have good co operation with the turkish cypriot village leaders but if we are not allowed to go this time i am sorry we will not allow them to pass the turkish cypriots are allowed to come to celebrate their victory against us and all we ask is to go to morphou to pray for the missing and dead who are buried there
1521354 the man is trying as best he can but unless we get a formal reply that we can go on august 8 and september 2 to pray we will not allow the turkish cypriot buses to pass through our area
1521355 we have tolerated the turkish cypriots crossing despite their reasons because we wanted to be good but with the developments despite the good will shown by our side the occupation army have not moved from their position
1521356 and according to what we are hearing now nothing different can be expected this time either
1521357 it is not wise at this time nor will it help efforts to open a crossing
1521358 there is a strong likelihood that such demonstrations could lead ultimately to greater delays
1521359 the irish conflict once seemed as intractable as any in the world the irish solved it by mutual concessions persistent negotiation refusal to give in to momentary setbacks and a willingness to let friendly outsiders help thats a good template for others to follow

1521361 its funny the milk just tastes sweeter its fabulous quality
1521362 something i havent really experienced before in dairy is to have that wonderful sweetness that full sweetness that wonderful flavorful cream
1521363 the industry has made us think its all supposed to taste the same with a very consistent flavor but their nonfat milk is just unbelievable too it tastes like theres fat in it
1521364 but thats what farming is youre always on the edge
1521365 weve been at a regular loss of about 10 percent of the states dairy farms per year
1521366 basically all your decisions are based on economics rather than the good of the family
1521367 someone has got to step back and look at this and change
1521368 if there were already 10 people doing it we wouldnt have done it
1521369 you get a little bit of as we call it farm fresh taste which is different than a lot of the milk people are used to tasting there was definitely a curve there but it seems to have really caught on
1521370 you dont have single family farms anymore involved in dairies
1521371 theyve exceeded our expectations as far as customers instantly latching on to the fact that they are so close to us
1521372 instead of the milk going into processing plants and warehouses and more trucks there are just less steps between us and the cow i think thats really recognized
1521373 we want to keep it a family a small family farm we cant get much bigger than that
1521374 its also limited because you have to pasture your cows and you have to have enough fields around for that
1521375 but if someone goes down someone gets sick someone gets injured then what
1521376 thats where i see almost all of these small niche operations theyre fun its exciting but they work themselves to death

1521392 they are actually hunting the younger ones once the hypacrosaurus reaches that adult size we think its safer from predation its a size refuge
1521393 our duck billed dinosaur grew three to five times faster than any potential predators that lived alongside it
1521394 by the time the duck billed dinosaur was fully grown the tyrannosaurs were only half grown it was a huge size difference
1521395 thats another added bonus when facing predators if you can keep reproducing youre set
1521396 thats a big negative vote against the yahoo board but it doesnt change anything
1521397 it is a statement that they shouldnt be under any illusion that their support is broad

1521496 in the last three or four months the momentum has really built up for more spending
1521497 congress has moved a whole range of bills that take the problem up another notch
1521498 well below the record deficit of all time which was 6 percent of gdp back in 1983
1521499 the important point to remember is that near term deficits are both temporary and manageable if and only if we keep spending in check the tax burden low and the economy growing
1521500 excessive spending beyond the presidents budget plan will make the problem worse
1521501 mr bush came to office with the biggest surpluses in history and he will leave office with the biggest deficits in history thats the bottom line

1521551 eventually i would like to see this role extended across the country so there are many of us helping other sexual abuse survivors

1521553 my first experiences with the legal side of things were quite horrible
1521554 i feel more positive now than i have in 20 years and thats because of the taskforce on sexual violence and that is a result of the bravery of louise nicholas
1521555 we started campaigning for the taskforce on the back of the marches throughout the country in outrage over the acquittals
1521556 as cuesta fights for his life this attack is a chilling reminder of the culture of impunity for those who would attack the philippines media with four journalists already losing their lives for their profession in 2008
1521557 the philippines authorities must fulfill their responsibility to protect each and every person from such violence the fact that journalists continue to be targeted is a clear indication that the authorities actions or lack of actions are not delivering the message of zero tolerance
1521558 demanding an immediate investigation to catch the perpetrators of such heinous acts of brutality
1521559 this course is rough hot rocky dusty with very steep uphill terrain and narrow trails

1521561 one way or another i will make a formal announcement
1521562 winds of change adapting our communities to the changing realities of the 21st century
1521563 the mayor seems like the kind of person you could just have a conversation with
1521564 all the things shes taught me ive been implementing we sort of bounce ideas off each other
1521565 ladan has an idea and then she finds out how we can do it
1521566 shes created so many different partnerships when you have leaders like that you really want to support them in being powerful with what they do
1521567 i was so blown away by the presentation i literally came scurrying back here and said this is a game change
1521568 the implications of this movie theater experience are something i have not seen or imagined in my 35 years of doing this and i think it is a huge opportunity and we need to get on it
1521569 the movie theater experience has not been innovated in any meaningful way in decades meanwhile the home experience with the big flat screen tvs and surround sound blu ray and everything else has just become amazing so one experience has stood still while the other has continued to rise up
1521570 i love the movie theater experience i think that its very special when a couple hundred people to share a experience everything is amplified things are scarier things are funnier things are sadder everything in that shared experience is enhanced and i would like that experience to stay around and to me this offers the first opportunity to innovate the theater experience in ways we cant in our home for many years to come
1521571 the difference between a live sport event and being in the arena and everything that it brings and how immersive it is vs watching it on tv
1521572 samsung is making monitors right now that are 3d capable so i dont think thats the challenge its actually the viewing experience
1521573 theres 2 things about 3d in order to really give the full rolls royce version of it one is the size of the screen needs to hit your peripheral vision if you think about it if you have a 50
1521574 the second thing is that the more light the more it diminishes the 3d experience and so i made a joke which is i walked around my house in terms of where i have a tv set and the only place i can go in my home in which i can have a 3d experience as good as what i can have in the movie theatre is in coat closet where i come into my and i cant fit a 50
1521575 these are polarized glasses as opposed to my fathers 3d the blue and red anaglyph which kind of disintegrated forget the fact they were made of cardboard beyond that they sort of disintegrate the color and the art of the film they were really more for gimmick than a quality experience
1521576 absolute precision in doing the right eye left eye so that all of the imperfections and things that we all associate with the old 3d in terms of what happens on the theater side are corrected and if you remember with the old 3d there were two projectors and if youre trying to line those things up it is impossible to have precision in it and those imperfections cause many of those things that people identify with motion blur eye strain nausea those things
1521577 if you have seen a black and white movie that has been colorized it is that big of a gap because a movie that was designed and shot in black and white everything about it from the set dressing to the cinematography to directing the film is very specifically designed to show shades of white to black and all of the colors and skews of gray in between it
1521578 so literally a color would be picked for a piece of set dressing because it would translate to a color of gray so to go in and literally colorize it it doesnt look right thats what happens when you post produce a movie in 3d
1521579 this is where one of the largest gaps has occurred in terms of the understanding of where we are tomorrow versus where we have been yesterday almost everything that you have seen are movies that were authored in 2d and post produced in 3d i cant emphasize enough the difference that happens
1521580 when you author in 3d its a very different thing
1521581 the tools are great but nobody shoots like steven spielberg everybody takes film and puts it through a camera even when he works with different cinematographers there is something singular signature and unique about it thats his art and the same thing is true with 3d 3d is going to be used in many different ways and so again as much as i appreciated journey to the center of the earth thats not how we imagine using 3d because i felt that the 3d in that is very self conscious
1521582 this is an opportunity for us to actually immerse the audience into an experience rather than to break the proscenium to play with the audience we will bring images in a way that will force the perspective of something in it but never once does it actually reach out and hold images in a way in which that first thing you go oh im watching 3d if you do that in a way you break the storytelling this is a storytelling tool
1521583 our movies cost about 150 million a piece to make and 3d is about 15 million more so its about 10 more for us to do 3d less for live action movies because a lot of us is the rendering we actually have to make the movie 3 times once in 2d once right eye and once left eye so we actually have to render 3 versions of the movie but from a time standpoint once everybody is up to speed with the tools it doesnt seem to be taking a whole lot longer to do
1521584 it took five million hours of rendering time on shrek on monsters vs aliens it will take 40 million hours to render and a very large portion of that is 3d the demands are much much much more complicated with the rendering issues were faced with
1521585 it depends on how their footprint expands over time in it but when you look at
1521586 if you could roll the clock back here and we were in movie theaters you know 85 90 years ago and they were silent films and then they became talkies there was tremendous debate if you go back and ive actually done a fair amount of research and reading about it and both transitions the last 2 revolutions that i spoke of were highly debated both in the business model and by the creative community lot of people talked about color just being a gimmick a fad and it would come and go and 5 7 years later no movies were made in black amp white my instinct says to me this is how we see you are watching right now we are looking and working our eyes are in 3d its how we take in emotions all of these things are about emotion you know the device of telling the narrative of a storytelling and a filmmaker uses his tools are sight and sound we have 5 senses the ones that they use to make you feel something which is what theyre doing to raise your spirits up or down or make you jump in the seat or give you anxiety the things that affect you emotionally are sight and sound think about how sound has completely revolutionized not for you in your lifetime but in mine ive now gone from vinyl to an 8 track to a cd to digital delivery and today we actually can capture store and replay sound with near perfect fidelity for our ears its that beautiful so pick any music whatever your tastes are in this you take those buds and put that sound in your ear and it literally raises your spirits up you can feel how exciting it is to listen to sound with beautiful fidelity in it and emotionally it makes us well same thing with sight so why would i go back what you watch and hear is deceiving the mind its a trick you think youre watching something that has dimension to it its not its a flat image in it but its tricking your mind so if you could have that dimensionality to it it makes what youre doing more powerful so for a storyteller i dont know how you go backwards
1521587 i dont know whether it takes 2 years 4 years 6 years 8 years to actually roll into it but i think its in that time frame or less that
1521588 the technology of retro fitting a black amp white movie to color has not gotten to a place where i would feel comfortable doing that and representing that as a quality experience
1521589 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
1521590 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
1521591 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
1521592 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
1521593 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
1521594 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
1521595 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
1521596 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
1521597 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
1521598 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
1521599 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
1521600 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
1521601 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally

1521794 but there is still the tendency for women to be shown off the court or off the field and the shots shown to be of a more sexualised nature

1521865 this administration is driven by department of defense officials and combatant commanders who believe that the effort to study replacement concepts is important to the long term assurance of the stockpile
1521866 the march 13 2008 paper addresses technical issues for the congress such as design manufacturing and operational status of the u s nuclear arsenal
1521867 these are properly the responsibilities of the departments of defense and energy
1521868 appropriate offices of the department of state were consulted early in the papers preparation and the department supports the papers conclusions

1521879 the racial fantasy factor in this presidential campaign is out of control it was at work in that new yorker cover that caused such a stir mr obama in muslim garb with the american flag burning in the fireplace its driving the idea that barack obama is somehow presumptuous too arrogant too big for his britches a man who obviously does not know his place mr obama has to endure these grotesque insults with a smile and heroic levels of equanimity the reason he has to do this the sole reason is that he is black
1521880 theres no doubt in my mind that what senator obama is trying to suggest that hes a victim of something
1521881 the second of the bombshell words that obama didnt say but that graham would like you to think that he said is an even bigger canard he called me a racist has become a popular and convenient refuge of scoundrels
1521882 has never said that he believes that john mccain is a racist

1521892 i was merely trying to express my delight at obamas commitment to his campaign in every aspect and his interest and his support in his surrogates and his staff and his fellows and how wonderful and refreshing that is and it was manipulated into such an unfortunate media frenzy of kind of a nonstory

1521956 physical beauty provokes all kinds of strange and strong reactions in people suspicion among them both michelle and cindy are attractive women but theyre not supermodels and they are quite conservative in their hair makeup and dress i think if the country was faced with a beauty like carla it would become an issue the opposing party would use it as a weapon the candidates morals would be called into question and no matter what the wife had accomplished she would be viewed as a trophy wife and the candidate seen as the sort of man who wants and needs a trophy wife

1522000 you cannot send this person a message unless you are on their friends list
1522001 we think of the being of persons on analogy with the being of static inanimate objects however in hebrew thinking the being of objects is in analogy to the being of living animate persons
1522002 motionless and fixed being the being that greek thinking always presumes is most important is for the hebrews a nonentity it does not exist for them only being which stands in inner relation with something active and moving is a reality to them

1522004 a branch of greek philosophy that has strongly influenced western thought especially in science and education
1522005 oh but dad loved this dress wait dad died in 1991 even he would say enough is enough
1522006 i dont think youd like that one its fiction that one well maybe but maybe not
1522007 the greek language having reigned for centuries over philosophy became the vehicle of christian literature and ritual
1522008 it was impossible for greeks with an education which penetrated their whole nature to receive or to retain christianity in its primitive simplicity
1522009 natural theology is that part of the philosophy of religion dealing with attempts to prove the existence of god and other divine attributes purely philosophically that is without recourse to any special or supposedly supernatural revelation
1522010 to be like god as far as man can attain the divine likeness
1522011 originates primarily where a lot of western intellectual culture originates greek philosophy and culture
1522012 there came a synthesis of greek philosophy and christian doctrine in which the orthodox christians of that day lost the fullness of truth about the nature of god
1522013 comparing the practical implications of secular and christian truth in psychotherapy
1522014 pursuing psychology as science of the ethical contributions of the work of emmanuel levinas
1522015 know ye not that there are more nations than one know ye not that i the lord your god have created all men and that i remember those who are upon the isles of the sea and that i rule in the heavens above and in the earth beneath and i bring forth my word unto the children of men yea even upon all the nations of the earth wherefore murmur ye because that ye shall receive more of my word know ye not that the testimony of two nations is a witness unto you that i am god that i remember one nation like unto another wherefore i speak the same words unto one nation like unto another and when the two nations shall run together the testimony of the two nations shall run together also and i do this that i may prove unto many that i am the same yesterday today and forever and that i speak forth my words according to mine own pleasure and because that i have spoken one word ye need not suppose that i cannot speak another for my work is not yet finished neither shall it be until the end of man neither from that time henceforth and forever
1522016 a sacred text that was written originally in the hebrew language
1522017 much if not most of the new testament was actually recorded in a semitic language and only later translated into greek
1522018 the issue is not the name we give the worldview but rather the ways in which it differs from our own
1522019 personally i believe the greeks were wrong in many of their assumptions about the world thus it would do injustice to the revealed word to apply those assumptions while reading them
1522020 also we think in language our language in some ways constrains the ways in which we can think and in other ways expands it
1522021 if a language does not have a future verb tense we certainly dont conclude that those who speak it dont believe in the future but we can certainly suppose that they may have thought about the future differently
1522022 thats a remarkably fringe viewpoint that the overwhelming majority of scholars have rejected for about two thousand years
1522023 these are quite controversial statements far from being universally accepted claims about language most linguists today would tend toward opposing these claims rather than accepting them
1522024 we cant get nearer to god with a lateral shift from greek thinking to hebrew thinking
1522025 the greek language having reigned for centuries over philosophy became the vehicle of christian literature and ritual
1522026 it was impossible for greeks with an education which penetrated their whole nature to receive or to retain christianity in its primitive simplicity
1522027 this new doctrine for thou bringest strange things to our ears
1522028 so what linguistic based differences are there between how greeks view the future and how we do
1522029 in indo european languages time is a straight line we can stand on it gazing forward at the future with the past behind us
1522030 when hebrew does correlate seeing to time it speaks of the past as before and the future behind
1522031 also the literature on the differences between semitic and greek worldviews is vast and well documented and not all of it relies on language so it isnt the only evidence that seemed to be your primary concern
1522032 thus it is perfectly fair to say that the doctrines of the gospel may be more incompatible with some worldviews and languages than others i believe that it is more compatible with a hebrew worldview than a greek one at least the doctrines of the gospel make more sense when approached from a hebrew perspective and we do less violence to the scriptures when we read them from a hebrew worldview
1522033 21 for after that in the wisdom of god the world by wisdom knew not god it pleased god by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe 22 for the jews require a sign and the greeks seek after wisdom 23 but we preach christ crucified unto the jews a stumblingblock and unto the greeks foolishness 24 but unto them which are called both jews and greeks christ the power of god and the wisdom of god
1522034 for the jews require a sign and the greeks seek after wisdom but we preach christ crucified unto the jews a stumblingblock and unto the greeks foolishness
1522035 but i also cant help but think that a particular group of people that was directly influenced by the lord and his prophets for so long across so many generations and centuries would have certain truths ingrained into their culture and language in subtle ways
1522036 now when it comes to using a lens to view the scriptures it makes sense that we should consider what language each particular book was given in if isaiah was originally written in hebrew then i expect my insights to be limited if i study it in greek even if isaiahs linguistic worldview wasnt divinely perfect i would still expect that im going to get closer to his and the lords message and intent by reading him through a hebrew lens
1522037 hebrew philosophy is an available alternative that does more justice to the true nature of god i believe than the assumptions weve grown up with perfect probably not better i think so
1522038 for behold isaiah spake many things which were hard for many of my people to understand for they know not concerning the manner of prophesying among the jews for i nephi have not taught them many things concerning the manner of the jews for their works were works of darkness and their doings were doings of abominations i know that the jews do understand the things of the prophets and there is none other people that understand the things which were spoken unto the jews like unto them save it be that they are taught after the manner of the things of the jews but behold i nephi have not taught my children after the manner of the jews
1522039 but behold the jews were a stiffnecked people and they despised the words of plainness and killed the prophets and sought for things that they could not understand wherefore because of their blindness which blindness came by looking beyond the mark they must needs fall for god hath taken away his plainness from them and delivered unto them many things which they cannot understand because they desired it and because they desired it god hath done it that they may stumble
1522040 wherefore as i said unto you it must needs be expedient that christ for in the last night the angel spake unto me that this should be his name should come among the jews among those who are the more wicked part of the world and they shall crucify him for thus it behooveth our god and there is none other nation on earth that would crucify their god
1522041 i dont believe that gospel truths taught in the old testament were meant to act as a cultural corrective
1522042 33 hear another parable there was a certain householder which planted a vineyard and hedged it round about and digged a winepress in it and built a tower and let it out to husbandmen and went into a far country 34 and when the time of the fruit drew near he sent his servants to the husbandmen that they might receive the fruits of it 35 and the husbandmen took his servants and beat one and killed another and stoned another 36 again he sent other servants more than the first and they did unto them likewise 37 but last of all he sent unto them his son saying they will reverence my son 38 but when the husbandmen saw the son they said among themselves this is the heir come let us kill him and let us seize on his inheritance 39 and they caught him and cast him out of the vineyard and slew him 40 when the lord therefore of the vineyard cometh what will he do unto those husbandmen 41 they say unto him he will miserably destroy those wicked men and will let out his vineyard unto other husbandmen which shall render him the fruits in their seasons 42 jesus saith unto them did ye never read in the scriptures the stone which the builders rejected the same is become the head of the corner this is the lords doing and it is marvellous in our eyes 43 therefore say i unto you the kingdom of god shall be taken from you and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof
1522043 im not advocating a complete switch over so much as a reconsideration of many of the philosophical assumptions we inherited from the greeks one of the best ways to transcend philosophical assumptions is to present an alternative
1522044 hebrew philosophy is an available alternative that does more justice to the true nature of god i believe than the assumptions weve grown up with perfect probably not better i think so
1522045 thus it is perfectly fair to say that the doctrines of the gospel may be more incompatible with some worldviews than others i believe that it is more compatible with a hebrew worldview than a greek one at least the doctrines of the gospel make more sense when approached from a hebrew perspective and we do less violence to the scriptures when we read them from a hebrew worldview
1522046 there is neither jew nor greek there is neither bond nor free there is neither male nor female for ye are all one in christ jesus
1522047 is more compatible with a hebrew worldview than our greek influenced one
1522048 the doctrines of the gospel make more sense when approached from a hebrew perspective
1522049 we do less violence to the scriptures when we read them from a hebrew worldview
1522050 hebrew philosophy is an available alternative that does more justice to the true nature of god i believe than the assumptions weve grown up with perfect probably not better i think so
1522051 hebrew philosophy is somehow better or holier or godlier than any other human philosophy
1522052 but to suppose that hebrew philosophy is somehow better or holier or godlier than any other human philosophy strikes me as a mistake especially in light of the scriptures that seem to indicate it might in fact be worse viler and more devilish than any other human philosophy
1522053 were apparently more wicked than any other nation on earth

1522084 it was saturday morning at the cabin luke and his cousin adam went snorkeling about 100 feet off the dock and noticed a large fish hanging out in a rocky area
1522085 luke came back all excited and told his mom i am going to catch that big fish today
1522086 with no fishing boat available and the rocky area too far for casting from the dock luke put on his snorkel gear and while carrying his fishing pole in his right hand snorkeled out to the spot where he had seen the fish
1522087 in about 6 feet of water luke happened to find a rock to stand on dropped his line and seconds later snagged the fish

1522109 eu acho que um filme inteiramente diferente mais uma hist ria de aventura do que um coment rio social eu diria que se existe uma maior dire o emocional que determina no filme tem a haver com o conceito de vingan a e o dano que o desejo de vingan a pode causar e eu tenho sido sempre interessado nisso como uma preocupa o eu acho que n s temos visto em nosso tempo v rias fac es pol ticas v rios l deres pol ticos que querem se vingar pelo que eles sentem ter sido atacados injustamente e o ciclo vai se repetindo se repetindo e n o para algu m tem de dizer vamos parar com isso porque estamos destruindo um ao outro ent o eu acho que de fato sigo o filme com este conceito
1522110 eu estava preocupado em entrar num personagem em que estive fora por 18 anos eu estava preocupado no que poderia encontrar como identificador o que poderia achar como ponto de entrada do personagem acredito que essas preocupa es foram embora quando entrei no cen rio e comecei a trabalhar com j j abrams e meus colegas atores esse sempre tem sido o ponto de contato como trabalhar com o diretor e colegas atores e o script claro se nos forem dadas oportunidades de estabelecer isso de certo modo com o cen rio diretores c meras e assim sucessivamente com os atores e estabelecer com xito seus relacionamentos um com o outro encontrar seus momentos dram ticos e c micos na cena ent o tudo problemas desaparece gradualmente e acho que foi certamente o caso deste filme eu tive um maravilhoso divertimento e me senti totalmente seguro nas m os do diretor e do script e trabalhei com alguns timos atores eu realmente fiquei extremamente satisfeito creio que a audi ncia ir descobrir esses atores maravilhosos e ir gostar muito deles
1522111 todos os diretores anteriores trouxeram alguma coisa que foi valiosa para seus projetos mas nenhum deles teve o tamanho e a dimens o de produ o oferecida para lidar com esse filme
1522112 diferente n o porque eu me senti muito em casa bill estava trabalhando com um elenco de personagens que eram totalmente estranhos a ele eu j tive uma experi ncia muito diferente nesse novo filme interpretei frente a frente com os personagens que embora estivessem sendo conduzidos por novos atores eu os conhecia ent o me senti muito em casa

1522114 this is the confidence we have in approaching god that if we ask anything according to his will he hears us
1522115 when you ask you do not receive because you ask with wrong motives that you may spend what you get on your pleasures
1522116 he will also send you rain for the seed you sow in the ground and the food that comes from the land will be rich and plentiful

1522140 i doubt the credibility and impartiality of this court i think they are just bias or it is being politicized to suit the interest of some few people

1522155 it is conceivable that opinions are shifting as the shine of the super mum syndrome wears off and the idea of women juggling high powered careers while also baking cookies and reading bedtime stories is increasingly seen to be unrealisable by ordinary mortals
1522156 women particularly mothers can experience considerable strain when attitudes reinforce the notion that employment and family interests conflict

1522169 to have somebody that i consider a friend have been with dozens of times shared meals with treated as a friend to have her be an employee a subcontracted spy for the nra is just mind boggling its so venal

1522190 when we talk in terms of affecting the quarterback we talk about sacks we talk about resets we talk about hits on the quarterback we talk about batted balls we talk about moving the front and disguising coverage
1522191 sacks are important theyre great game changers theyre great vertical field position changers they put you behind in down and distance but it isnt always the answer to affecting the quarterback
1522192 anything we can do so that the quarterback doesnt get the ball across the line of scrimmage is a good thing
1522193 the most important thing is the pressure quarterback hits arent a bad thing
1522194 with offenses nowadays im lined up a mile away from the quarterback
1522195 the sack is a great stat especially for my position but the pressure game thats the thing
1522196 the way of the world a story of truth and hope in an age of extremism
1522197 i feel like by the time we break camp that well have five or six receivers who we feel really comfortable about
1522198 we picked up monday morning at a very high level it was the same level we came out of spring training what that tells you is they worked really hard in the summer in their 7 on 7 and their team pass drills
1522199 i dont think anybody on the staff could be any more pleased with the way the first three practices have gone
1522200 i told john when he reported sunday that were going to see if youre in shape or not because hes getting a bunch of reps
1522201 im concerned with his feet im not near as concerned as you know about motion but the feet are important because you throw with your feet where they are aligned before you throw has a lot to do with accuracy and velocity
1522202 it gives us the way to see how we look at all our players
1522203 thats how we knew we wanted to get chiles the ball in the nfl they have several kinds of boards the big board has no regard to position its just about who you would take first who you would take second so thats what we did
1522204 in many places primates are quite literally being eaten to extinction
1522205 tropical forest destruction has always been the main cause but now it appears that hunting is just as serious a threat in some areas even where the habitat is still quite intact
1522206 it is quite spectacular we are just wiping out primates
1522207 the problem with these species is that they have long lives so it takes time to reverse the decline it is quite depressing
1522208 this creates access allowing people to go to places that they could not go in the past
1522209 primates are relatively easy to hunt because they are diurnal live in groups and are noisy they are really easy targets
1522210 many of the asian primates like langurs are 5 10kg so they are a good target generally you find that what is big and easy to get disappears very quickly
1522211 if you kill seven 10 or 20 mountain gorillas it has a devastating impact on the entire population
1522212 within the red list criteria you are allowed to anticipate what will happen in the future as well as look at what has happened in the past
1522213 so it was decided not to change the mountain gorillas listing because of the sudden deaths and we do not know when it is going to stop
1522214 militias have been in control of the gorilla sector since september last year which means the congolese wildlife authority has been unable to manage the area and protect the gorillas
1522215 until the war ends and the rangers are able to get back in and patrol the area we have no idea as to the fate of almost a third of the mountain gorillas left in the world
1522216 the lion tamarins were almost extinct in the wild but they were very popular in zoos so there was a large captive population
1522217 so zoos around the world decided to join forces to introduce a captive breeding programme to reintroduce the tamarins in brazil
1522218 they were not exposed to eagles or snakes and they did not know how to find food so a lot of them died but some did survive and slowly the numbers began to increase
1522219 it took time money and effort at all levels from the politicians to scientists and volunteers on the ground for just two species
1522220 there have been isolated pieces of data around for years which have sketched an ever darker picture
1522221 i think whats most alarming is just how bad the situation is in the asian region particularly in southeast asia
1522222 in countries like vietnam and cambodia pretty much 90 percent of the primate fauna including gibbons monkeys and langurs is at risk of extinction that is pretty scary
1522223 tropical forest destruction has always been the main cause but now it appears that hunting is just as serious a threat in some areas even where the habitat is still quite intact
1522224 in many places primates are quite literally being eaten to extinction
1522225 when you go into even some of the protected areas there you just dont see anything the forest is pretty much empty
1522226 this situation can be changed only with the explicit support of governments in the primates native countries as well as the international community
1522227 we already know that if we invest in targeted conservation action we can see results
1522228 once you initiate a conservation action plan youre probably going to see some rewards and species recovering but then you cannot assume the species is safe
1522229 see what people are doing on the ground to save these species
1522230 local conservation ngos are out there doing fantastic work ask how you can get involved in some way
1522231 its painfully easy to ignore the role that each of us can play in primate conservation because the ex situ work is so far removed from our daily lives
1522232 however its critical that we recognize that even small things that we do can make a conservation impact and do whatever we can in this regard whether it is recycling cell phones or purchasing products made with sustainable palm oil which combats deforestation we need to act
1522233 primates also help us understand ourselves and our evolution since we are primates
1522234 its a pathetic situation that half our relatives may disappear
1522235 what is happening in south east asia is terrifying to have a group of animals under such a high level of threat is quite frankly unlike anything we have recorded among any other group of species to date
1522236 weve raised concerns for years about primates being in peril but now we have solid data to show the situation is far more severe than we imagined
1522237 tropical forest destruction has always been the main cause but now it appears that hunting is just as serious a threat in some areas even where the habitat is still intact in many places primates are quite literally being eaten to extinction
1522238 the pressures on them have increased with the big push towards growing monoculture crops in part for their use as biofuels the growing of palm oil crops in south east asia and soya beans in the amazon have taken their toll
1522239 but hunting of primates for bushmeat has also increased this was a subsistence issue but now its almost become a luxury food with a higher price than for chicken or fish both in african and in south east asia
1522240 this award is dedicated to the many who nourish and enrich the spirit and creativity of others
1522241 we dont know how many pandas died in the wild but the habitat loss is very bad
1522242 has it reached an evolutionary dead end i think the answer to that is no
1522243 there are many more pandas in the wild than we thought i am an optimist about the future of the panda
1522244 we hope the sides will manage to find compromise decisions that will promote the removal of tensions in the region
1522245 if events develop in the worst possible way with the use of force russia will not be able to stand by seeing as russian citizens live in south ossetia
1522246 if we use force it is only in cases where it is absolutely necessary to defend the lives of law enforcement officers
1522247 neither the ossetian nor the georgian people want war but someone is trying to provoke a conflict
1522248 we dont believe that now is the time for any parties to be acting in a provocative way
1522249 we believe that the violence should stop and all parties should begin a discussion so that they can move forward towards settling the situation
1522250 all decisions and orders of the international court of justice must be respected by states

1522252 should texas execute mr medellin before congress has a reasonable opportunity to convert the icj judgment into a justifiable federal right the state of texas will forever deprive mr medellin of his constitutionally protected right not to be deprived of his life without a due process of law
1522253 even president bush who signed scores of death warrants as texas governor concurred some time ago that the united states must honor its international obligations in this case
1522254 there will be no clearer sign that texas will have gone beyond the pale than if jos medellins execution goes forward

1522260 all of our business segments generated year over year gains with record profits reported at our satellite broadcasting cable programming film and television businesses
1522261 although we clearly face more challenging macroeconomic conditions in fiscal 09 were well positioned to deliver continued if somewhat less robust growth
1522262 unnecessary printing of emails multiple copies single sided printing and the sending of massive documents to the printer which are unlikely to be read are just some of the regular scenarios lived out by businesses every day
1522263 most offices will find they can reduce waste costs by around 20 through simple no or low cost actions measures such as double sided or multiple page printing and recycling instead of paying for disposal can really help
1522264 4 is an average but weve found some manufacturing companies can save as much as 10 of their turnover
1522265 the residents are so angry and have said they will put poison around the plantation areas to kill the elephants unless officials take quick action
1522266 im afraid that another attack on their plantations will push villagers to launch their plan
1522267 people here eagerly planted palmoil as it brings more profits but its all been easily destroyed by elephants
1522268 under senator mccains plan the oil companies get billions more we dont pay any less at the pump and we stay in the same cycle of dependence on oil that got us into this crisis
1522269 the oil companies have placed their bet on senator mccain and if he wins they will continue to cash in while our families and our economy suffer and our future is put in jeopardy
1522270 they know theyre lying about what my energy plan is
1522271 instead of running ads about paris hilton and britney spears they should go talk to some energy experts and actually make a difference
1522272 senator obama has said that expanding our nuclear power plants doesnt make sense for america
1522273 if we want to enable the technologies of tomorrow like plug in electric cars we need electricity to plug into
1522274 i believe senator obama has just misunderstood and under appreciated this crisis it is going to need to be dealt with boldly and aggressively
1522275 he is obviously thrashing about trying to grab on to the idea and catch up to the idea for the week it is obviously belated it is obviously haphazard
1522276 ethically dubious killing one species for the sake of another
1522277 the map is the most precise depiction yet of the limits and the future dividing lines that could be drawn across the arctic region
1522278 the results have huge implications for policy making as the rush to carve up the polar region continues
1522279 its a cartographic means of showing and an attempt to collate information and predict the way in which the arctic region may eventually be divided up the freezing land and seas of the arctic are likely to be getting hotter in terms of geopolitics the durham map aims to assist national and international policy makers across the world
1522280 the map is the most precise depiction yet of the limits and the future dividing lines that could be drawn across the arctic region
1522281 the results have huge implications for policy making as the rush to carve up the polar region continues
1522282 there has been a lot written about this coming conflict but it is largely based on rather poor geographic information
1522283 we wanted to give a clear visual guide to what the situation really is
1522284 mccains spokesperson tucker bounds tells tmz that on the subject of energy paris is deeper than barack he says sounds like paris is taking the all of the above energy approach that john mccain has advocated both alternatives and drilling perhaps the reality is that paris has a more substantive energy plan than barack obama

1522286 youve got to say right heres the line in the sand were going to stop it here because its madness to continue
1522287 it doesnt paint a very good picture of the future for carbon emissions but there is no other real choice coal is one of the few fuel sources which has a real capacity to expand
1522288 i dont think in my lifetime i will ever see more than 50 percent of the coal fired plants in china being fitted with ccs
1522289 i think you resign yourself to the fact that youll only be able to stabilise temperatures at a higher level and then well see what the impact is
1522290 we knew from our own observations that there were a lot of gorillas out there but we had no idea there were so many
1522291 we hope that the results of this survey will allow us to work with the congolese government to establish and protect the new ntokou pikounda protected area
1522292 these figures show that northern republic of congo contains the mother lode of gorillas
1522293 it also shows that conservation in the republic of congo is working
1522294 these figures show that northern republic of congo contains the mother lode of gorillas
1522295 it also shows that conservation in the republic of congo is working this discovery should be a rallying cry for the world that we can protect other vulnerable and endangered species whether they be gorillas in africa tigers in india or lemurs in madagascar
1522296 we knew there were apes there we just had no idea how many
1522297 shows that conservation in the republic of congo is working
1522298 if these new gorilla census figures are confirmed by further surveys it would be the most exciting ape conservation news in years
1522299 nest census data are notorious for varying from one method to the next however and i think we should be cautious before assuming the worlds known gorilla population has just doubled
1522300 technical problems with the conversion of ape nest density to estimates of gorilla density preclude a rigorous estimate of range wide gorilla abundance
1522301 it is not that i think that the numbers are necessarily too high
1522302 it is just that i do not trust the assumptions made by the estimation models that are being used
1522303 what does seem clear is that there are still plenty of western gorillas in northern congo
1522304 no evidence of ebola in ntokou pikounda our general philosophy is ebola can hit anywhere anytime
1522305 there could be a population of a hundred thousand or more gorillas that were essentially unknown to science
1522306 this discovery should be a rallying cry for the world that we can protect other vulnerable and endangered species whether they be gorillas in africa tigers in india or lemurs in madagascar
1522307 we knew from our own observatinos that there were a lot of gorillas out there but we had no idea there were so many
1522308 if we dont find a cure or treatment to delay the onset of alzheimers disease were going to be overwhelmed by the burden of these individuals on the health care system the mayo studys lead author dr ronald petersen said in a statement
1522309 the animal has been using up a lot of energy developing its genitalia and using a lot less to defend itself
1522310 so the new religion of global warming however convenient it may be to politicians is not as harmless as it may appear at first sight indeed the more one examines it the more it resembles a da vinci code of environmentalism it is a great story and a phenomenal best seller it contains a grain of truth and a mountain of nonsense and that nonsense could be very damaging indeed we appear to have entered a new age of unreason which threatens to be as economically harmful as it is profoundly disquieting it is from this above all that we really do need to save the planet
1522311 the readiness to embrace this fashionable belief has led the present labour government enthusiastically supported by the conservatives and liberal democrats to commit itself to a policy of drastically cutting back carbon dioxide emissions at huge cost to the british economy and to the living standards not merely of this generation but of our childrens generation too that is why i have written a book about the subject now i readily admit that i am not a scientist but then neither are the vast majority of those who espouse the currently fashionable madness moreover most of those scientists who speak with such certainty about global warming and climate change are not climate scientists or earth scientists of any kind and thus have no special knowledge to contribute
1522312 the first day of school brings lots of excitement and lots of questions
1522313 we want to alleviate as much anxiety as possible as students return to class and hope that parents will give us a call if they have questions about going back to school
1522314 we havent started the season well at all its disappointing that we havent reached any sort of level we havent reached the right level so far this season i think everyone who is involved with the club is extremely disappointed at what has happened so far
1522315 its a reasonable excuse to use that the effects of last season are still with the players but i dont think it is a relevant one it seems fairly ridiculous that you can reach a european final and then get knocked out at the first game of the next season but thats the way it has happened
1522316 if it had been last season and you lose out in the first game because it is a new team that has been put together then fine you would have said to yourself that it was something you could have expected but we have been a year into it now and we are a reasonably experienced team and we never really handled either game particularly well
1522317 with young players coming of age we are not only targeting the top teams in the domestic league but also aiming to break new ground for chinese teams in asian competition
1522318 we are now fully prepared for the tournament and we are confident of reaching the second round
1522319 the match with new zealand is crucial for both sides and we have to win if we are to achieve our goal
1522320 we finished empty handed last time so we must work harder to satisfy our fans this time not only with good results but also with convincing performances
1522321 i would rather keep it a secret until after the match
1522322 i dont see why not the core of the team is still the same of course we had a little thing with cristiano ronaldo this summer but we have a good squad of players
1522323 during the season we are bound to suffer setbacks every team does there will be injuries loss of form red cards and clearly we need luck at crucial times as well but hopefully we will end up in the right place
1522324 in the last three or four years it has been chelsea and manchester united going for the title but liverpool won the champions league then lost the final a couple of years later arsenal have been in it as well you can see from our results in europe how much quality there is in the premier league so i expect us all to be quite close to each other
1522325 so far its been a great experience and we havent even played a match yet
1522326 weve been waiting a long time to come here and experience this atmosphere its something unique its a once in a lifetime opportunity im sure at one stage we all dreamed about participating in this kind of tournament and winning the gold medal i guess were living a dream
1522327 were not familiar with any of these teams and at this age level the unknown quantities are the most dangerous they will all be viewing us as a scalp so i am sure that honduras korea and cameroon will be very tough to play against and to beat
1522328 its always been my dream to play for italy but id like to thank usa for giving me the opportunity to play for them
1522329 i dont feel any pressure about being one of the over age players but i realise that i have an important responsibility
1522330 i have the experience of the last olympics and ive told my younger team mates about the unique situations they will face here plus as the senior defender it will be my duty to marshal the back four during the 90 minutes just as it is responsibility to look after the midfielders
1522331 however it is going to be a fairly straightforward role for me this team is far better prepared than we were four years ago in terms of our organisation on and off the pitch we went to greece with a group of internationally inexperienced players but this group has already has exposure of previous fifa youth tournaments
1522332 aside from the age issue for me theres no difference between the olympic games and the world cup
1522333 the olympics is the worlds biggest sporting event while the world cup is the worlds biggest event for a single sport both are huge as a player there is certainly the same desire for me to do well i want a medal in this tournament just as much as i wanted to finish in the top three in germany two years ago

1522360 i had to go and get my son from the babysitter
1522361 i messed up with the timing and i realized that my son was going to basically be sitting out there all alone waiting for me so i needed to go and grab him i had no idea the movie was going to be sooooo long so unfortunately i had to just get up and try and get out of there
1522362 when i got up though i heard this voice say have some respect i sort of looked around because it was dark and then i heard it again have some respect next thing i know this wildebeest like behemoth is attacking me
1522363 really really scary i mean prince is just an enormous man and he could have really hurt me i just think its sort of unfair that hed react like that to me needing to take care of my kid what sort of animal is he
1522364 ive got stuff happening and so did every other person in that theater weve all got places wed like to be but you stay with your group we all came into that theater together and we were all going to be there together until the end

1522372 what theyre telling us is this stinks to high heaven the timing is questionable and they see right through it
1522373 weve taken 10 million dollars of meth off the street
1522374 i started the special victims unit and we have sent more sex offenders to prison than ever before
1522375 in 2004 the last administration they had 13 murder trials you know our murder rate in colorado springs has been going up up up ever since yet the last year we only had three murder trials that means youre plea bargaining all the murders
1522376 by ignoring the other jurisdictions youre able to spin it to the community that homicides are up and if you elect me homicides will stop thats the definition of being a demagogue
1522377 ive been under four d as here promoted by each one of them john suthers i was his chief trial attorney he put me in charge of all homicide prosecutions
1522378 i know for a fact were losing jurors jurors who are coming in and saying i know what happened and i can not be a fair juror in this case it is effecting the system

1522382 were in a generation that was kind of shielded from a lot of financial responsibilities
1522383 twenty years ago when you were in college you didnt have a credit card and now all of a sudden we had to take on debt to go to college then we get out of college and we have to have that handbag and an ipod
1522384 the financial landscape is dramatically different today and yet financial education has not caught up
1522385 the democratization of credit has really generated a competitive spending culture and plastic has allowed for material goods not had in the previous generation
1522386 this generation feels that somehow or another theyre going to figure out some technological advancement thats going to get them out of their financial troubles and outsmart the market
1522387 its a generation that thinks it has so much freedom of expression but it is so encumbered with debt it might not be able to pursue the career and goals of its choice
1522388 there is hope for straightening young people out if they get an education
1522389 my heat comes from a wood burning stove that sits in the corner of my living room so it basically has to heat the whole house
1522390 we really became aware that the house had stalled and that work was not progressing at the colorado contractors convention when they presented a check to her so at that time we knew we wanted to give additional help
1522391 when we bought this land in 2001 that was our plan to move out here build a house raise cattle and live out our days so now it is my job to keep that dream going

1522401 i am ecstatic words cant describe how ready and excited i am for this season
1522402 it takes a lot of pressure off of me and not just me but the young guys that played last year as freshmen james and darrell
1522403 sammie is always getting open and making plays and that draws the defenses attention it takes a lot of pressure off james and darrell knowing that a guy like that is coming back and can show them how it is done
1522404 were in that position and we cant do anything about that all we can do is make sure our chemistry is good and when its time to play our guys just need to buckle up and put in their mouthpieces
1522405 every year we hear the same thing so we dont really pay attention to that stuff at all
1522406 coach riley says a two star athlete can come out of high school and play here and a five star athlete can come out of high school and play somewhere else and the two star can end up playing better than the five star because he wants it more
1522407 we just need to go out there and prove all the doubters wrong just like we always seem to do
1522408 weve thought all along that area 4 is the toughest in the state and this kind of proves it
1522409 knowing that weve already played teams like medford klamath and eugene and knowing that weve beaten them gives us a lot of confidence
1522410 im glad we could give the fans at legion field an exciting finish in our last game in roseburg
1522411 now were ready to take on the next part of our season
1522412 typically the summer is a slow period for this market
1522413 but many of the sites we surveyed have reported 20 to 30 per cent growth in membership rates since mid may when the cheques were sent out
1522414 in a june 2008 survey of our members 32 per cent referenced the recent stimulus package as part of their decision to either become a new member or renew an existing membership
1522415 getting more people to buy porn was probably the last thing bush had on his mind when he came up with his stimulus package but well take it

1522421 i dont think so i dont think hes in that place
1522422 we talked about a lot of things and this has been very stressful for him and very stressful to his family
1522423 i didnt get the answers that i was looking for to open that competition
1522424 so why would i do that it would be poor leadership its not a popularity contest i wasnt gonna do it
1522425 my whole intent with the meeting was if youre coming into the locker room to play for the green bay packers where is your mind we could never get past that question
1522426 why would i want anybody with a negative mindset in my locker room
1522427 upon review it was determined that there was a truncation error in the final printout sent to the tabulator
1522428 this resulted in the under reporting of shares withheld for certain directors
1522429 well have tests just so we can rule out everything it kind of grabbed and it was a little bit tighter in the fifth inning
1522430 well see what the tests reveal i dont think its serious i dont think hell be shut down a long time
1522431 he said he felt ok but ive got to hear that he feels great
1522432 developing an aids vaccine may take more time and innovation than we might have once imagined but we are confident that science will prevail the necessary direction for the field is clear
1522433 the cells status was indeed bad as they had been stored for a long time so we cautiously approached the work
1522434 but the scientific technology has also developed compared with when we cloned snuppy there is no room for any doubt over whether they are real clones
1522435 for the rest of my life i will love them and consider them my korean brothers
1522436 the market is clearly in transition and we will use this time as an opportunity to expand our share of customer spend and to aggressively move into market adjacencies
1522437 my main objective in my discussions on religious freedom is to remind this new generation of leadership that religion is not to be feared but to be welcomed in society
1522438 oh i think he listens absolutely i think hes interested he absorbs he takes in he listens
1522439 and my hope is of course that as they have their security in place that theyre mindful of the spirit of the games and that if there is a provocation they handle it in a responsible way without violence
1522440 one of the reasons im going is because i want to show respect to the chinese people and this is a proud moment for china
1522441 i mean this is a closed society in many ways
1522442 the internet provides interesting opportunities for people to express themselves sometimes its open sometimes the filters are there ive talked to the evangelicals who go there who feel like the underground church movement has gotten a few steps forward a step and a half back its really hard to tell
1522443 it seemed to me to be like a product of extreme sexism and i kept thinking to myself god if this was just like kal penn or george clooney or any of the other obama surrogates or supporters there wouldnt be any question about it nobody would even talk about it
1522444 i was merely trying to express my delight at obamas commitment to his campaign in every aspect and his interest and his support in his surrogates and his staff and his fellows and how wonderful and refreshing that is and it was manipulated into such an unfortunate media frenzy of kind of a nonstory
1522445 its just silly because the way people are talking about it youd think it was a bertolucci movie or something
1522446 i dont want to go back to the bad old days before the psa
1522447 i wouldnt want my family members to die of metastatic prostate cancer i went through that with my father in law and i dont wish that on anybody

1522449 there are all kinds of people walking along that street
1522450 is china winning the hearts and minds of uighur people
1522451 there are a lot of vengeance attacks against police or government officials or imams seen as collaborators
1522452 i wouldnt be surprised if one of these guys has a personal connection with the police
1522453 a lot of these are personal vendettas this seems to make more sense
1522454 they want to turn the year 2008 into a year of mourning for china

1522462 galveston is open for business and we certainly welcome the tourists back to the island
1522463 perhaps the best marketing plan i ever had was closing the place
1522464 the turf club is already sold out for closing day aug 17 and we have booked more than 8 000 people in group sales we have never had demand like that during a regular meet or the fair and we did really well the final weekend of our last regular season
1522465 i dont have a hail mary left in my arm
1522466 its very difficult and not just for me but for the employees and my management team well all miss it but to some extent ive been reconciled to this for years it has lasted longer than any of us thought it would
1522467 i dont its just a little disagreement i apologize for the way it went down but i dont apologize for the passion and intensity i definitely could have handled it a little better but just at that moment thats how it went down i cant take it back the way i handled it probably could have been dealt with better
1522468 i want guys that compete i want guys that play with fire and passion and sometimes when you do things like that happen
1522469 id much rather deal with this than a bunch of guys sitting on the bench getting their butts kicked every day and not caring about it to be honest with you
1522470 were a good team and we havent been playing well
1522471 things happen like i said were not in middle school we should be able to get over it
1522472 these things could be very very beneficial for a team
1522473 yes they could be detrimental or they could be very very beneficial they sure can and not only for the team but for individual players i guess well find out
1522474 mexico has a big yard down there full of filth and murders and gangs and drug cartels and theyre not mentioning anything about that
1522475 i dont want sympathy or pity id rather have your anger
1522476 dont feel sorry for me im where im at because i made an adolescent choice thats it
1522477 they used sophisticated computer hacking techniques that would allow them to breach security systems and install programs that gathered enormous quantities of personal financial data which they then allegedly either sold to others or used themselves
1522478 and in total they caused widespread losses by banks retailers and consumers
1522479 i suspect that a lot of people are unaware that their identifying information has been compromised
1522480 that was the first time ever that a computer system was wiretapped
1522481 obviously we werent happy that a person working for us as an informant was double dealing
1522482 it seems to me its pretty much a slam dunk
1522483 owed a duty of care the highest degree of care
1522484 one of the real areas of satisfaction if you can call it that is that weve maintained all along this was an inside job
1522485 i hope somebody who has some authority will call us and make it right with this family
1522486 it seems to me they botched this thing from the beginning it was one of their own people

1522496 the arbys brand stands for high quality products which has resulted in higher check average relative to our competitors
1522497 during the second quarter we did not waiver from this long established cut above brand positioning and results were negatively impacted by the effect of aggressive competitor discounting looking ahead we believe continued competitor discounting at the current level is unsustainable given rising commodity costs and increasing profitability pressure on operators we are already seeing reports of competitors re evaluating the prices of their value menus
1522498 longer term we believe arbys will remain well positioned to deliver superior results due to our unique brand attributes loyal customers supportive franchisee base and strong operations centric business model
1522499 we are continuing to focus on the two growth themes expanding our curriculum and delivery methods and making further improvements to our sales and marketing that we announced earlier this year
1522500 we are currently on or ahead of schedule in implementing each of our seven growth initiatives for these two themes and we expect that the results will become apparent in fiscal 2009 and beyond
1522501 inflation has been high spurred by earlier increases in the prices of energy and some other commodities and some indicators of inflation expectations have been elevated

1522506 it is our belief that all of tysons can be changed from the suburban auto dependent office model to a mixed use transit oriented development model
1522507 remaking all of tysons along the transit oriented development model is also the only way to achieve the full potential of environmental sustainability that tysons offers our region
1522508 as we have demonstrated with previous acquisitions we will take a long term view of ips we will invest in their infrastructure and expand their marketing initiatives through ips our current and prospective clients will have a mail service option which provides a greater level of financial transparency and higher level of service
1522509 our first quarter performance clearly demonstrates we are making good progress toward our annual financial goals including free cash flow which is on plan and we expect to continue to move forward in achieving our strategic target of diversifying our portfolio

1522515 as a matter of public record obama did not vote for
1522516 the day the democratic convention ended in san francisco in 1984 the newsweek poll showed walter mondale 18 points ahead of president ronald reagan
1522517 the day after new years 1996 operatives for barack obama filed into a barren hearing room of the chicago board of election commissioners
1522518 there they began the tedious process of challenging hundreds of signatures on the nominating petitions of state sen alice palmer the longtime progressive activist from the citys south side and they kept challenging petitions until every one of obamas four democratic primary rivals was forced off the ballot
1522519 his overwhelming legal onslaught signaled his impatience to gain office even if that meant elbowing aside an elder stateswoman like palmer
1522520 a close examination of obamas first campaign clouds the image he has cultivated throughout his political career
1522521 palmer to this day does not concede the flaws that obamas team found in her signatures she maintains that she could have overcome the obama teams objections and stayed on the ballot if she had more time and resources
1522522 little known candidate marc ewell filed 1 286 names but obamas objections left him 86 short of the minimum and election officials struck him from the ballot records show ewell filed a federal lawsuit contesting the boards decision but johnson intervened on obamas behalf and prevailed when ewells case was dismissed days later

1522527 transdisciplinaritatea priveste ceea ce se afla in acelasi timp intre discipline ceea ce trece prin ele si ceea ce e dincolo de orice disciplina finalitatea ei consta in intelegerea lumii actuale unul din imperative fiind unitatea cunoasterii
1522528 in fata unei tehnostructuri izvorite din gindirea scientista si reductionista gindirea transdisciplinara combate inchiderea intr o stiinta fara constiinta si deschide o noua realitate convergenta a cunostintelor si disciplinelor interactiuni intre sfere de cunoastere ce si regasesc unitatea profunda intoarcere a sensului intr un echilibru intre rational si spiritual

1522534 da l am vazut mare om politic domnule vezi dumneata trotki care e enorm de destept si stalin care e un prost linie schimbata din prudenta probabil dar minciuna a ramas minciuna din simpla bravada pentru ca nu se indura sa scada ceva din gloria in care s a angajat
1522535 ei iti place cum ne au lucrat sirbii daca eu strig de trei ani ca trebuie sa facem intelegerea directa cu bulgarii nimeni nu vrea sa ma auda si uite ca acum s au inteles sirbii cu ei si ne au lasat in aer i am spus o regelui de atitea ori n a vrut sa ma inteleaga acuma daca ar functiona un tribunal revolutionar l ar pune pur si simplu la zid cite ocazii pierdute acum un an nemtii imi faceau propuneri extraordinare ca sa ne intelegem cu bulgarii mergeam la adrianopol faceam un imperiu acum doi ani i am dus regelui coroana poloniei pe tava n a vrut sa ma auda

1522538 tocmai le ziceam la berlin vorbeam cu un ministru al lor i am explicat cu de amanuntul care sint caracterele regimului hitlerist m a ascultat omul in tacere si la urma s a ridicat in picioare si mi a spus domnule profesor ma duc chiar astazi la f hrer sa i comunic ca am stat de vorba cu singurul om care a inteles revolutia national socialista
1522539 s a prevazut initial ca acest drept cuvenit elevilor si prescolarilor sa fie alocat de la bugetul de stat prin ministerul educatiei cercetarii si tineretului si nu din bugetele locale asa cum era normal
1522540 tehnica de lupta va fi imbunatatita rapid avind in vedere ca ministerul apararii acorda o atentie deosebita celor sase programe majore de investitii pentru toate categoriile de forte in ceea ce priveste fortele terestre care sint angajate cu trupe in teatrele de operatii prioritatea pe care o urmarim este achizitia de transportoare blindate si de autovehicule de teren cu grad ridicat de protectie o parte dintre transportoarele amfibii aflate in prezent in dotarea trupelor din afganistan va fi inlocuita treptat cu transportoare piranha cel mai probabil la inceputul anului viitor
1522541 casa alba a inventat o scrisoare de la habbush catre saddam hussein datata 1 iulie 2001
1522542 scrisoarea preciza ca mohammad atta organizatorul atentatelor de la 11 septembrie s a pregatit pentru misiunea sa in irak sugerind astfel ca exista o legatura operationala intre saddam si al qaida asociere pe care vicepresedintele ceruse cia sa o dovedeasca dupa atentatele de la 11 septembrie pentru a justifica invadarea irakului nu exista o astfel de legatura
1522543 nu se explica o astfel de solutie aceasta sentinta a stirnit hohote de ris in toate cercurile cum pentru instigare neurmata de executare la omor calificat poti primi 18 ani de inchisoare numai in unele cazuri in care a fost vorba despre crima am auzit o astfel de sentinta am audiat zeci de martori am contestat procesele verbale de interceptare si am pledat pentru achitare in acest caz
1522544 18 ani asta da justitie sintem multumiti cu pedeapsa acordata de judecatorii tribunalului bucuresti
1522545 la mai multi oricine ar fi trecut prin asa ceva i s ar fi parut ca pedeapsa este corecta
1522546 dupa ce solutia va ramine definitiva voi cere daune nu m am gindit inca la o suma ma voi consulta cu avocatul acum sint mai precaut inca imi porneste o alta persoana masina inainte de a ma urca la volan e clar ca si de acum va trebui sa ma pazesc

1522559 era ora cind salvamarii se retrageau de pe plaja au fost avertizati de doua trei ori sa nu intre in apa sa se intoarca pentru ca valurile erau din ce in ce mai mari steagul arborat era rosu adica este interzis scaldatul
1522560 s au depus toate eforturile ca sa fie salvati toti trei celalalt baiat nu a fost gasit probabil l au tras curentii spre larg fata a fost scoasa resuscitata si transportata la spitalul din mangalia tinarul scos din apa nu a rezistat si in ciuda manevrelor de resuscitare a decedat
1522561 mi am recunoscut fata la televizor cind era transportata la spital
1522562 nu vreau sa imi mai amintesc nimic cind o sa pot o sa spun
1522563 nu stiu ce s a intimplat nu mi a spus mai nimic doar ca este bine ca a scapat cu viata nu am vorbit despre asta ca erau bulversati va dati seama le au murit doi prieteni sub ochii lor
1522564 ce sa caute tatiana in apa remus la fel nici unul nu stia sa inoate ca s au dus toti sa inoate sau ca s a dus ea si ceilalti au venit sa o scoata numai ei stiu ce a fost acolo
1522565 am vazut dimineata la stiri era o filmare in care fata mea era adusa la spital si a acoperit fata dar am recunoscut o am pus o pe sora ei sa o sune telefonul tatianei era inchis si fata a intrat pe internet un var de al ei i a spus ca andrei si cu remus au murit si ca tatiana este la spital
1522566 simbata am vorbit cu tatiana si mi a spus ca sint bine si ca pleaca spre mare astazi am vorbit cu ea din nou la telefon si mi a spus ca o sa ajunga acasa la noapte dupa ce se mai linisteste poate o sa mai poata povesti ce s a intimpat daca nu nu voi sti niciodata
1522567 la cei napastuiti ajung miine n r azi 2 000 de piini 2 000 de litri de apa minerala cite 200 de kilograme de zahar ulei orez si faina 250 de conserve si trei tone de sapun la acestea se adauga circa 15 000 lei bani donati de mai multe persoane juridice si 50 de saci de imbracaminte si incaltaminte de la persoane fizice
1522568 ca urmare a inundatiilor produse romtelecom ofera locuitorilor din zonele afectate posibilitatea de a efectua convorbiri gratuite in reteaua companiei de la telefoanele publice din localitatile mentionate romtelecom isi exprima astfel solidaritatea fata de cei care trec prin momente dificile asigurindu le posibilitatea de a ramine in legatura cu persoanele de care au nevoie
1522569 deocamdata nu avem nici o informatie legata de situatia suprafetelor arse fermierii trebuie sa stie ca daca aceste arderi nu sint autorizate isi pot pierde nu numai cei 50 5 euro de la ue pe hectar ci intreaga subventie fiind exclusi de la plata pe o perioada de trei ani
1522570 imi pare rau de ceea ce s a intimplat si sper sa ma inteleg cu firma de asigurari pe de alta parte regret faptul ca vecinii mei nu au fost de acord cu taierea arborilor periculosi pe care am propus o nu o singura data ei sint oameni in virsta care vor sa protejeze spatiul verde dar in acest caz au dat dovada de exces de zel ar fi fost bine sa ma asculte
1522571 asta este rezultatul actiunilor firmelor care fac tot felul de interventii si taie radacinile copacilor arborii nu au mai rezistat vintului puternic si au cazut din pacate nu i putem verifica pe cei care fac astfel de lucrari
1522572 cinci minute de furtuna iti dau de lucru pentru doua zile
1522573 pentru inceput am ales sa ducem o parte din ce s a adunat la 20 de familii din localitatea lespezi am luat legatura cu primarul care ne a recomandat familiile cele mai afectate de inundatii si care au reala nevoie de acest sprijin nu avem produse in valoare foarte mare insa eu cred ca putin cite putin de la fiecare poate ajuta primul transport va pleca joi urmind ca saptamina viitoare sa mai trimitem si la sinistratii din zona radauti avem bani produse alimentare care rezista la caldura paturi haine lenjerii de pat tot ce a putut dona fiecare
1522574 inainte de a ma decide sa vin la vilcea am sunat o pe handbalista luminita dinu pentru ca ea stie limba slovena de cind a jucat la ljubljana am discutat cu ea si m a asigurat ca la vilcea sunt conditii pentru performanta si mi a recomandat sa vin in romania
1522575 dupa ce am analizat programul echipei nationale si cel al realului am realizat ca nu voi mai putea face fata din punct de vedere psihic jucind in ambele parti nu a fost usor sa iau o astfel de decizie pentru ca m am simtit foarte bine cind am imbracat tricoul olandei
1522576 a declarat bubka al carui mandat expira la finalul jocurilor olimpice de la beijing fredericks campion mondial la 200 m in 1993 a fost de patru ori medaliat cu argint la jocurile olimpice in probele de 100 si 200 m 1992 si 1996
1522577 voi incerca in continuare sa ajut la dezvoltarea fotbalului si a sportului in genereal
1522578 nu mai simt nici o durere parca nu am avut niciodata piciorul rupt nu am vrut sa revad imagini cu faza la care m am accidentat am uitat totul si vreau sa mi recapat forma cat mai rapid
1522579 sint firme care fac mezeluri in curte si nu le vede nimeni
1522580 sint tot felul de firme in iasi care fac mezeluri in curte si nu le vede nimeni probabil ca este la mijloc o rafuiala cu cineva de la aldis oricum e dreptul lor sa controleze si pe unii si pe altii eu nu contest dreptul lor de a controla
1522581 noi avem tot felul de comisii de la uniunea europeana care ne verifica periodic marfa din punct de vedere calitativ si nu am avut probleme am prelevat si noi probe din nou si asteptam rezultatele apoi vom decide daca vom contesta amenda in instanta
1522582 fiind operator la nivel national o astfel de decizie revine autoritatii centrale
1522583 noi am trimis propunerea prin posta si posibil sa mai dureze citeva zile pina ajunge
1522584 pentru afectarea grava si in mod repetat a intereselor economice ale mai multor consumatori s a decis sanctionarea societatii cu amenda contraventionala iar ca masura complementara oprirea temporara a fabricatiei si comercializarea produselor respective pina la remedierea deficientelor
1522585 amenda variaza intre 5 000 si 25 000 lei dar am decis sa dam maximul prevazut de lege pentru ca marcel a savirsit patru nereguli intr un interval scurt de timp in plus am incadrat abaterea intr un articol legislativ care nu i a permis acestuia sa plateasca jumatate din valoarea minima a amenzii in 48 de ore
1522586 ori a fost la mijloc o eroare umana din partea angajatilor nostri ori un viciu ascuns corpul strain aflindu se in materia prima importata de noi de la producatori din austria si olanda
1522587 alte controale nu au fost la marii producatori in afara de cele desfasurate la agentii economici care au fost si amendati probabil ca nu am avut in vedere acest aspect dar saptamina aceasta voi dispune un control si la ei
1522588 nu am primit inca banii insa dupa ce voi restabili legatura cu cei e la revista ii voi dona
1522589 am fost prezenta alaturi de diaconu la intilnirea cu care acesta a avut o cu fetele in afara de patru toate celelalte au spus ca am stricat imaginea concursului ca nu e normal sa apar topless m am simtit foarte prost eu nu am facut nimic rau dar nu se intelege chiar daca nu am incalcat regulamentul cu nimic am decis sa ma retrag
1522590 am cheltuit destui bani si am facut mari eforturi sa ajung aici dar cred ca totul a fost o iluzie nu pot sa le inteleg reactia directorul hotelului mi a zis ca pot ramine aici pina pe 15 august cind sa termina acest concurs dar cred ca voi pleca
1522591 sistemul nu e scuza buna pentru escrocherii insa te obliga sa gasesti portite de scapare
1522592 cele mai frecvente cauze ale hipocalcemiei prin scaderea activitatii glandelor paratiroide sint ca urmare a operatiei prin care se inlatura glanda tiroida sau o parte din ea ori dupa extirparea chirurgicala a unui adenom paratiroidian
1522593 astfel se explica efectul spectaculos al injectiei intravenoase cu calciu mult uzitata in camerele de garda sau de catre medicii de la serviciul de ambulanta senzatia de caldura disparitia spasmelor musculare restabilirea valorilor normale ale tensiunii arteriale
1522594 acestea duc la pierderi masive de electroliti ce pot sa declanseze o criza de hipocalcemie care poate merge de la furnicaturi si amorteli in membre pina la inclestarea musculaturii fetei sau a miinilor dificultati respiratorii slabiciune musculara cu imposibilitatea de a sta in picioare persoanele care sufera de sindrom de malabsorbtie cu diaree cronica sau alcoolicii prezinta hipocalcemie rapid reversibila dupa administrarea de magneziu si calciu explicatia consta in pierderea de calciu dar si in posibila asociere a unui deficit paratiroidian
1522595 in functie de afectiune medicul va stabili preparatul adaptat nevoilor personale preparatele de calciu nu se administreaza odata cu cele care scad aciditatea gastrica aceasta fiind necesara unei bune absorbtii nu se administreaza diuretice de tipul furosemidului care scad suplimentar valoarea plasmatica a calciului crizele acute de tetanie se trateaza cu calciu intravenos dupa asigurarea permeabilitatii cailor aeriene de multe ori crizele de spasmofilie sint precipitate de alcaloza respiratorie din urma unei hiperventilatii fie ca este vara cald si respiram mai frecvent intr o tentativa de a ne racori fie ca sintem in mijlocul unei discutii sau ne am emotionat cert este ca alcaloza scade concentratia calciului ionizat din singe si precipita manifestarile de hipocalcemie o metoda rapida si usoara de tratament este provocarea unei acidoze respiratorii cum ar fi inspiratia si expiratia intr o punga datorita acidozei respiratorii calciul este deplasat de pe albumina si creste fractiunea libera ameliorind simptomatologia
1522596 daca insa in ciuda tratamentului cu preparate de calciu si vitamina d valorile sangvine nu se normalizeaza sau se apropie de normal doar pe durata tratamentului dupa care scad dramatic cel mai probabil este vorba de un sindrom de malabsorbtie si tratamentul va trebui sa fie cronic cu preparate injectabile desi nu foarte frecventa exista si aceasta posibilitate
1522597 calciul se absoarbe in intestinul subtire pentru aceasta fiind necesara vitamina d dar si prezenta aciditatii gastrice a acidului citric aminoacizilor si a sarurilor biliare
1522598 organismul uman este astfel creat ca indiferent de temperatura ambianta sa isi mentina o temperatura fixa de 37 grade celsius cind este prea cald pielea devine foarte calda iar inima incepe sa bata mai repede tocmai pentru a pompa mai mult singe fierbinte spre piele si a l raci in mod normal zilnic se pierde o cantitate importanta de apa aproape un litru prin respiratie si transpiratie cind afara este foarte cald cantitatea de apa pierduta prin transpiratie poate creste foarte mult apa se evapora de pe suprafata pielii si preia caldura daca umiditatea aerului este mare apa se va evapora mai incet sau deloc si de aceea este mai greu de suportat o caldura umeda fata de una uscata
1522599 tulburarile date de supraincalzire afecteaza toate virstele dar pe masura ce imbatrinim le facem fata din ce in ce mai greu aceleasi conditii care la un tinar de 18 ani produc doar crampe musculare la un adult de 40 determina extenuarea termica iar la un batrin de 70 de ani soc termic
1522600 extenuarea termica este o situatie mult mai serioasa care necesita atentie imediata
1522601 chiar daca extenuarea si socul termic sint inrudite exista o mare diferenta intre ele in timp ce extenuarea este cauzata de pierderea unei cantitati foarte mari de apa si electroliti socul termic apare cind sistemul de termoreglare s a stricat socul termic este o urgenta medicala netratat la timp si corect el poate duce la coma ireversibila si la moarte
1522602 in diversele afectiuni cronice sint afectate anumite verigi ale sistemului de racire a organismului rezultatul final este acelasi organismul bolnav nu mai este la fel de eficient in pierderea caldurii si se supraincalzeste mult mai usor asta chiar daca persoana in cauza nu face altceva decit sa stea afara la umbra in miezul unei zile caniculare tocmai de aceea persoanelor cu boli cronice persoanelor in virsta li se recomanda cu insistenta sa nu iasa din casa in miezul zielelor caniculare cel mai bine este sa iasa la plimbare la cumparaturi etc dimineata sau seara
1522603 in mod normal se recomanda ca zilnic sa bei 1 5 2 litri de lichide aproximativ 8 10 pahare
1522604 acum citeva saptamini am aflat ca sint insarcinata este primul meu copil si as dori sa duc cit mai bine sarcina si sa fac toate controalele si analizele necesare as dori sa stiu care sint acestea si ce inseamna o supraveghere corecta a sarcinii
1522605 citeva investigatii simple si controalele periodice la ginecolog sau la medicul de familie pot scadea riscul aparitiei de complicatii de a lungul celor noua luni
1522606 adesea hepatita cronica se descopera intimplator cauzele cele mai frecvente sint virusurile hepatice b c sau d consumul de alcool si toxicitatea indusa de medicamente hepatita virala a este o afectiune acuta transmisa prin apa sau alimente contaminate ori prin miini murdare doar sub 0 1 evolueaza spre insuficienta hepatica acuta fulminanta potential letala
1522607 astfel in perioada acuta a bolii caracterizata prin intoleranta digestiva se recomanda mese mici si repetate de tip hidro lacto zaharat cu o compozitie echilibrata in principii nutritive vitamine si valori energetice se vor prefera alimentele usor digerabile si absorbabile fara reziduuri importante se vor evita dulciurile concentrate si alimentele iritante pentru stomac fara grasimi fara condimente iuti care contin derivati de alil considerati hepatotoxici erorile intilnite cel mai frecvent in practica sint desconsiderarea totala a rolului dietei in convalescenta in raport cu starea clinica favorabila a pacientului sau dimpotriva exagerarea unor restrictii de exemplu la sare la carne sau supraincarcarea inutila cu vitamina c consum excesiv de citrice ori aport crescut de brinza de vaci proaspata si altele
1522608 este dovedit faptul ca ficatul in sine nu doare singura structura anatomica cu terminatii nervoase pentru durere este capsula hepatica
1522609 consumul crescut de alcool pe termen lung produce doua tipuri de afectiuni hepatice hepatita alcoolica si ciroza hepatica toxic nutritionala leziunile induse de alcool se pot suprapune peste o hepatita cronica virala accelerind evolutia spre ciroza precipitind instalarea complicatiilor acesteia si crescind riscul aparitiei hepato carcinomului alcoolismul ramine principala cauza a cirozei in europa si in lume studiile au aratat ca exista o corelatie intre consumul regulat de alcool cantitatea si durata consumului si incidenta cirozei nu toti consumatorii de alcool dezvolta hepatopatie alcoolica sugerind si implicarea unor factori genetici
1522610 va rog daca poate explica un medic ce este sindromul picioarelor nelinistite eu nu am stiut ca exista aceasta boala am auzit intimplator de ea si cred ca sufar si eu de asa ceva in unele seri adorm foarte greu si ma trezesc din somn din cauza ca misc fara sa vreau picioarele poate parea de ris dar credeti ma ca este foarte obositor nici mie nu mi venea sa cred ca ceea ce am eu este o boala atunci cind la o discutie intimplatoare m am plins cuiva si persoana respectiva mi a spus ca ar trebui sa merg la medic as dori sa stiu de la ce apare aceasta problema cum se poate pune diagnosticul si cum se trateaza va multumesc
1522611 sindromul picioarelor nelinistite restless legs sindrome rls este o afectiune neurologica comuna avind atit o componenta motorie cit si una senzoriala se manifesta clinic sub forma unei nevoi imperioase de a misca picioarele adesea acompaniata de disestezii furnicaturi circei cald rece etc in loc de senzatiile corespunzatoare stimulului ce apare predominant seara sau in timpul noptii in stare de repaus nevoia aceasta este calmata temporar de miscare somnul este adesea intrerupt de miscari involuntare stereotipice si regulate ale membrelor inferioare cunoscute sub denumirea de miscari periodice ale membrelor periodic limb movements plm in timpul somnului acestea constau in dorsiflexii ale piciorului si ale gambei piciorul se intoarce spre spate miscari cu o durata de 2 5 secunde repetate la fiecare 20 30 de secunde majoritatea pacientilor cu rls au dificultati in a adormi sau in a si mentine somnul ei sint extenuati acuzind oboseala diurna in timpul zilei si somnolenta tulburari de concentrare si de memorie aceste simptome le afecteaza serviciul relatiile personale si activitatile cotidiene rls afecteaza atit barbatii cit si femeile numarul femeilor afectate fiind usor mai crescut boala debuteaza cel mai frecvent in jurul virstei de 40 50 de ani dar poate sa apara la orice virsta boala este mai grava la virstnici manifestarile cele mei severe sint la virstnici deoarece miscarea picioarelor usureaza disconfortul majoritatea pacientilor prezinta un somn agitat catre dimineata toate aceste manifestari se reduc si pacientii reusesc sa doarma simptomele acestei boli variaza ca intensitate si durata de la persoana la persoana in formele usoare manifestarile apar episodic cu putine intreruperi ale somnului in formele moderate simptomele apar o data sau de doua ori pe saptamina intirziind ora de adormire cind simptomele apar in mai mult de doua zile pe saptamina cu intreruperi frecvente ale somnului si cu afectarea calitatii activitatilor cotidiene ne confruntam cu forma severa a acestei boli diagnosticul se pune cu ajutorul polisomnografului pacientului care acuza necesitatea de a misca picioarele asociata cu parestezii sau disestezii simptome prezente in stare de repaus calmate partial de miscare si care se inrautatesc in timpul noptii trebuie sa i se aplice un chestionar simplu ce contine 10 intrebari si in functie de rezultatul chestionarului acesta trebuie indrumat catre un laborator unde i se va efectua o polisomnografie nocturna explorare care va oferi diagnosticul de certitudine t ratamentul rls se aplica in functie de severitatea bolii si consta in masuri igieno dietetice precum eliminarea cafelei alcoolului tutunului corectarea deficitelor de fier magneziu efectuarea de exercitii fizice dimineata masuri de igiena somnului cazurilor moderate sau severe le este rezervat tratamentul medicamentos la spitalul clinic de pneumologie avem un polisomnograf cu care putem ajuta in stabilirea ddiagnosticului de certitudine pentru aceasta va trebui sa dormiti o noapte la spital si sa fiti urmarit cu acest aparat in functie de diagnostic de severitatea bolii vi se va recomanda tratamentul necesar
1522612 what up with that are they crushed under debris that is not cool
1522613 become a critic on either side there were too many critics when my issue came along and i dont think i can lend to this one
1522614 who espouse aggressive policies to achieve total victory in the war on terror
1522615 on thursday august 28th obama is scheduled to formally accept the democratic nomination in a speech at the convention hall in front of the assembled delegates instead barack will leave the convention hall and join more than 75 000 people for a huge free open air event where he will deliver his acceptance speech to the american people
1522616 an extraordinary thing that to my knowledge has never been done in the history of the democratic party
1522617 make a donation now and you could have a front row seat to history
1522618 a gross misrepresentation of the groundwork that has been laid to date
1522619 honestly the host committee has done well it is true that they havent raised all the money that they were hoping to raise but that has happened at every convention for quite some years so we think the conventions going very very well are there some last minute changes yes are all conventions smooth no none of them ever are but we would not be doing this if we didnt think we could do it
1522620 weve had senior level teams discussing this for about a week so obviously we dont have all the questions answered and at some point we will and when we do i think well be happy to have another conference call with all the folks who are actually doing all of this nitty gritty work
1522621 we dont expect to leave the host committee high and dry we expect to get them some help
1522622 because of the length of the nominating season the fact that the nomination was not decided until the beginning of june clearly many donors would have hung back a little to see if the candidate of their choice was going to get the nomination clearly people wanted to see what was going to happen its not unusual we feel strongly that this is going to be a great convention and were going to be working with the convention with the host committee so this is a historic and great occasion we do not anticipate there will be problems
1522623 we now have the ability to examine how this money is being spent
1522624 at the end of the day its a step in the direction of ending the pay to play culture here in d c where lobbyists and special interests do spend a lot of money courting elected officials to get the policies they want
1522625 led the way on some of the atus top priorities including increasing funding for mass transit and preserving transit labor protections
1522626 i intend to tell the corporate lobbyists that their days of setting the agenda in washington are over that they had not funded my campaigns and from my first day as president i will launch the most sweeping ethics reform in u s history
1522627 has been abandoned because of political expediency hes a calculating politician
1522628 im not sure this is the place this debate should go but if you talk about flip flopping youve got john mccain changing his position on iraq he started off talking about how they were going to be accepted and greeted with open arms and how wed have a lot of money to pay oil to pay for this war etc
1522629 ive always said its up to the states and i still say that
1522630 i have adjusted to the realities of the world we live in today and if i dont adjust to those realities then i would be stuck in the past
1522631 one of the worst decisions in the history of this country
1522632 overall i think a year from now we will have made a fair amount of progress if we stay the course
1522633 we will win this conflict we will win it easily
1522634 thats the reason i run i run because it angers me
1522635 all you minnesotans take a good hard look at all three of us and you decide if you were in a dark alley which one of the three of us would you want with you
1522636 conditions are ripe this is the kind of race that hes got a real chance of winning
1522637 he doesnt need a majority he doesnt need close to a majority if he can lock down 36 37 percent that would probably be enough to win in this race
1522638 the people of the district want to hear what the candidates stand for and if shes not going to be the candidate for her to get out of the way and allow them a voice in selecting the real candidate
1522639 the democratic parties in the first congressional district look forward to a vigorous campaign that includes a meaningful debate with the republican nominee in the fall
1522640 if and when nonpartisan credible organizations sponsor debates ms andrews will gladly participate on behalf of the democratic party and address the issues important to the voters of the first congressional district
1522641 she doesnt have to pay attention to a person who is probably not going to get many very many votes in a district that votes overwhelmingly democratic
1522642 bayh passes all of the negative tests his abortion stance is acceptable for his party he is replaceable in the senate
1522643 we had every hope to reconvene the state convention but feel strongly the nominating committee has chosen a wide range of delegates who will make our party proud
1522644 with so many people concerned about the economy it simply wouldnt fair for us to ask delegates from all over the state to spend money to attend a convention if we know that a quorum wont be present
1522645 republicans ended their april 26 convention without finalizing the 34 delegates to the national convention after procedural maneuvering by hundreds of well organized ron paul supporters grounded the convention to a halt
1522646 the democrats are in a strong position to expand their congressional majorities
1522647 he believes in a strong national defense limited government and traditional family values
1522648 in just a few weeks we are now over 70 000 and climbing fast
1522649 the response has been phenomenal from conservatives across the country because they are excited about a way to focus their energies on principled candidates
1522650 the fact that martinez is polling so closely at this stage of the race should give them republicans tremendous pause
1522651 an election is coming and there is a sense among all of the commissioners that we want to move advisory opinions quickly
1522652 i think that we are committed to trying to expedite the advisory opinion process
1522653 the fight for better gas mileage and a cleaner environment
1522654 shes baracks greatest asset but after tough criticism is it time for michelle obama 2 0
1522655 im a girl that grew up on the south side of chicago
1522656 my father was a working class guy he worked a shift all his life and because of his hard work he sent not just me but my brother to princeton
1522657 i grew up in a working class family on the south side of chicago my father was a city worker all his life a blue collar shift worker
1522658 ive talked about this all over the country i grew up on the south side of chicago in a working class community
1522659 can you even remember the last time you had a date night
1522660 when will we have policies that truly reflect the reality of families dealing with life in todays society when will our leaders not only support but champion the cause of working families
1522661 ive always been and will probably always be in some way shape or form a working mom i used to get up in the morning and go to an office now i get up and go to a plane
1522662 when we think about hispanic voters as opposed to the hispanic community hispanic voters are all u s citizens and many of them are native born so its not surprising that immigration is not one of the top issues for hispanics
1522663 the issues that you would expect to see important for a group of voters that tends to be younger than the population as a whole and is more likely to have children under the age of 18 living in their household
1522664 the latino community is going to vote their self interest and theyre going to vote their future and when they do that i think that it will be overwhelmingly for
1522665 it is so important for us to make sure that every child in america is getting the education that will ultimately make us all stronger and improve our economy
1522666 he has earned the trust of latinos and has a history of supporting us
1522667 so when it comes to our values and understanding latinos this election i know for john its not political it comes from the heart
1522668 i am innocent of these charges and intend to prove that
1522669 i demanded that he resign today to stop the corruption
1522670 he thinks he is the emperor of alaska and he thinks he owns that office
1522671 theres an electoral process in place and theres a legal process in place and we will let the process play out
1522672 its just incredible that he would die on july 4th the same day of the declaration of independence and the same day that thomas jefferson and john adams died and he certainly is a patriot in the mold of those great men
1522673 compromise hell if freedom is right and tyranny is wrong why should those who believe in freedom treat it as if it were a roll of bologna to be bartered a slice at a time
1522674 im not going to put a lesbian in a position like that
1522675 when he wrote his book heres where i stand i felt no book was needed
1522676 my husband bob would say you dont have to look under the table for jesse
1522677 there was trouble in my band for even having the meeting with the senator
1522678 he said i had to turn my hearing aid down in fact i had to turn it off
1522679 under his leadership the senate foreign relations committee was a powerful force for freedom
1522680 and today from central america to central europe and beyond people remember in the dark days when the forces of tyranny seemed on the rise jesse helms took their side
1522681 i will never be silent about the death of those who cannot speak for themselves
1522682 he stood by the things that he believed in and the incredible thing that was so wonderful about him is that he never whether you agreed with him or not on issues it never affected his personal relationship with you
1522683 he believed he had a right to stand for what he believed in and he believed you did too
1522684 you needed that job but they had to give it to a minority
1522685 hell be remembered in part for the strong racist streak that articulated his politics and almost all of his political campaigns they were racialized in the most negative ways
1522686 its not saying too much to say that had senator helms not put his weight and his political organization behind ronald reagan so that he was able to win north carolina there may have never been a reagan presidency
1522687 most people feel like there would have never been a president reagan had it not been for jesse helms
1522688 will be based on the truth and not the deliberate inaccuracies those who disagreed with me took such delight in repeating
1522689 senator stevens campaign for re election is continuing to move full steam ahead
1522690 our office has been flooded today with calls and e mails from supporters urging the senator to press on the message from them is clear alaska needs
1522691 im sure it puts mark begich in an even stronger position now
1522692 people in alaska are really sick and tired of all the corruption thats been going on
1522693 its hard to find an alaska political leader without any connections to veco
1522694 news such as this rocks the foundation of our state
1522695 i am innocent of these charges and intend to prove that
1522696 when allegations like this are made that seem very thin the fbis done a lot of research into this and this is the best they could get we seem to take this positively and want to move forward because we believe the senator is innocent
1522697 he made time to go to the gym but canceled a visit with wounded troops
1522698 nobody denied sen obama the opportunity to visit our wounded being cared for at landstuhl obviously as a sitting senator he has an interest in that and can certainly visit in an official capacity
1522699 there are as you know though restrictions on what you can do as a candidate for political office that stems from trying to maintain political neutrality and not have the military involved in politics
1522700 under no circumstances may a candidate make a campaign related statement on an instillation
1522701 any activity that may be reasonably viewed as directly or indirectly associating the department of defense with a partisan political activity shall be avoided
1522702 the senators staff was informed of the limits on what the military can do with respect to a political campaign and how we could support a senators visit to landstuhl and quite frankly i expected them to have the visit
1522703 sen obama did not want to have a trip to see our wounded warriors perceived as a campaign event when his visit was to show his appreciation for our troops and decided instead not to go retired maj gen scott gration a foreign policy adviser to obama stated in a release from the campaign
1522704 well i know this that those troops would have loved to have seen him
1522705 and i know of no pentagon regulation that would have prevented him from going there without the media and the press and all of the associated people
1522706 the important thing is that if i had been told by the pentagon that i couldnt visit those troops and i was there and wanted to be there i guarantee you there would have been a seismic event
1522707 i believe he had the opportunity to go without the media and ill let the facts speak for themselves
1522708 we told military officials explicitly that sen obama had absolutely no intention of bringing any members of the media or photographers in with him to visit the wounded warriors
1522709 in all of our communications with the military we stressed that this was to be a private visit by sen obama
1522710 at that point it was a political trip for sen obama
1522711 i think it would have been inappropriate for him and certainly he would have been criticized by the mccain people and the press and probably should have been if on a political trip in europe paid for by political funds not the taxpayers to go essentially then and be accused of using our wounded men and women as props for his campaign i think it would be totally inappropriate for him on a campaign trip to go to a military hospital and use those soldiers as props so i think he probably based on what i know did the right thing
1522712 the staff was working this so i dont know each and every detail but here is what i understand happened
1522713 we had scheduled to go we had no problem at all in leaving we always leave press and staff off that is why we left it off the schedule we were treating it in the same way we treat a visit to walter reed which i was able to do a few weeks ago without any fanfare whatsoever i was going to be accompanied by one of my advisors a former military officer gration
1522714 and we got notice that he would be treated as a campaign person and it would therefore be perceived as political because he had endorsed my candidacy but he wasnt on the senate staff that triggered then a concern that maybe our visit was going to be perceived as political and the last thing that i want to do is have injured soldiers and the staff at these wonderful institutions having to sort through whether this is political or not or get caught in the crossfire between campaigns
1522715 so rather than go forward and potentially get caught up in what might have been considered a political controversy of some sort
1522716 what we decided was that we not make a visit and instead i would call some of the troops that were there so that essentially would be the extent of the story
1522717 it could be done in a way that would not create it would not be created or seen as a campaign stop
1522718 the point is that obama had no intention of bringing any cameras with him
1522719 it is time from the perspective of the latino community for a change
1522720 as you can imagine this is a very difficult time for our family
1522721 a loss for staten island powers was an asset to his community he did a lot of charity work he was someone we consider a friend
1522722 what it means for the race for congress in staten island and brooklyn is something we arent even thinking about today
1522723 my goal is to be the very best senator i can be and represent the greatest state in our country
1522724 anyone who voted for me has very little in common with the republican party
1522725 if you care about the issues i care about and the future that i outlined during my campaign then you really have to stay with us in the democratic party and vote for senator obama to be our next president
1522726 did you have a good visit to the capitol well stay interested okay
1522727 we talked about how happy we were that we missed her and were happy to have her back her verve her voice and her vote
1522728 spoke of how critical this campaign is how critical these issues are that we all share
1522729 this has come as quite a shock to both the powers family as well as to our own county committee
1522730 given the circumstances and in deference to the family and their loss i think that it would be inappropriate at this time for me to comment any further regarding other candidates
1522731 this new crisis may spur one of the experienced elected officials to run maybe one of them will be talked into it
1522732 how do they lose in a way that doesnt damage other candidates that are running for state offices
1522733 the process has to go on yet we have someone we have to say goodbye to
1522734 the federal government should not be in the public education business
1522735 web site says illegals should be able to stay and get a temporary pass and not do anything
1522736 with less than five months to make their case for change to voters in their districts the red to blue program will give these candidates the financial and structural edge to be even more competitive in november
1522737 democrats are able to compete in every region of the country
1522738 the truth of the matter is that many of these b list candidates have been running for months but had been rejected for admittance into the red to blue program on several occasions because and the dccc doubted their viability
1522739 lo que s podemos hacer y estamos en consulta en di logo en conversaci n con el gobierno de colombia es asegurar que el gobierno m o no va a pedir extradici n de ninguna persona si la ley de e u no permite una pena m nima de equis a os
1522740 el pr ximo paso que queremos dar en materia de extradici n es examinar con los norteamericanos como el mayor pa s requirente que en cualquier negociaci n que se lleve a cabo en los estados unidos con los narcotraficantes extraditados por lo menos les impongan una pena m nima severa
1522741 les sugiero que de los tres casos ya resueltos de los 15 paramilitares extraditados hace un par de meses la pena m nima acordada fue algo entre 17 y 18 a os puede ser que eso es buen indicador para el futuro pero depende de las conversaciones bilaterales
1522742 oficialmente no s nada nadie me ha notificado lo que s lo supe por la prensa
1522743 no es mi intenci n entorpecer ninguna la investigaci n le dice a iguar n por lo que me pongo a su plena disposici n lo nico que pido es que se cumplen los lineamientos del c digo con relaci n al debido proceso como usted siempre lo ha hecho
1522744 d las explicaciones satisfactorias que permitan dejar inc lume su conducta
1522745 no se preocupe por el caso en el alto tribunal que ya hablamos con un funcionario pr ximo a jubilarse
1522746 en el d a de hoy me he enterado que un fiscal de la unidad nacional antinarc ticos compuls copias a la unidad delegada ante la corte suprema de justicia para una posible investigaci n contra mi hermano guillermo le n valencia cossio actual director seccional de fiscal as de medell n
1522747 creo firmemente en la justicia colombiana y espero que mi hermano de las explicaciones satisfactorias que permitan dejar inc lume su conducta cualquiera sea el resultado acatar y respetar el fallo de los jueces
1522748 i think the memory of mark foley is a significant obstacle that the republican nominee will have to overcome
1522749 hes not going to be on the ballot this year people dont talk about him
1522750 i definitely think the district is in play and i think it could go either way
1522751 and i think thats what our campaign more than anybody else provides
1522752 this is a district that has republican and conservative values and were being represented by someone who doesnt share our values
1522753 national democrats had all but ignored mahoneys campaign before the scandal
1522754 the public financing of presidential elections as it exists today is broken and we face opponents whove become masters at gaming this broken system
1522755 aggressively pursue an agreement with the republican nominee to preserve a publicly financed general election
1522756 in his decision to break his promise and forgo our nations public financing system failed to demonstrate the kind of principled leadership that americans are looking for in our next president
1522757 we had hoped and expected that sen obama would stick with the public pledge he made to accept public financing and spending limits for the presidential general election
1522758 the people of missouri can smell a phony deal a mile away
1522759 frankly thats what john mccains gas tax is he knew it wasnt going to have any meaningful impact on peoples real pain our dependence on foreign oil
1522760 a promise he knew he would never have to deliver on
1522761 could mccain have come up with a more ill suited economic advisor than phil gramm
1522762 the speech fed the illusion that we could solve our problems if only people mystically come together
1522763 has grown accustomed to putting on this sort of saccharine show for the rock concert masses
1522764 the walls between races and tribes natives and immigrants christian and muslim and jew cannot stand these now are the walls we must tear down
1522765 voice of god and now he will be the voice of the house of representatives
1522766 my voice looks to communicate to whatever is meant to get across said zapata who said he is fluent in english spanish and french and knows enough german and czech
1522767 my voice has different tones depending on whats called for he added zapata was chosen he said after he and a host of other candidates auditioned for the job by reading official documents in the house chamber for house officials
1522768 hr 5235 a bill to establish the ronald reagan centennial commission
1522769 i just couldnt take any more of it i was tired of crawling home at midnight said hays who spent more than 40 years working for the house in various roles before retiring
1522770 we set up the deal so that it turned out that if ea was this evil empire that it wasnt going to last forever
1522771 you know i came out of sierra and at the time sierra was the caesar games and a couple other games that were really great
1522772 when things come up the ea guys are very honest about it theyre accountable about it and theyre responsive you cant ask for anything more than that
1522773 by the same token the companys doing pretty well and were really happy with what were doing
1522774 its not an easy decision and especially because i support a robust system of public financing of elections
1522775 but the public financing of presidential elections as it exists today is broken and we face opponents who have become masters at gaming this broken system
1522776 today has revealed himself to be just another typical politician who will do and say whatever is most expedient for
1522777 the true test of a candidate for president is whether he will stand on principle and keep his word to the american people has failed that test today and his reversal of his promise to participate in the public finance system undermines his call for a new type of politics is now the first presidential candidate since watergate to run a campaign entirely on private funds this decision will have far reaching and extraordinary consequences that will weaken and undermine the public financing system
1522778 they can give a good inkling of whether someone is liberal or conservative but theyre not good enough for a precise determination of what someones ideology is
1522779 obama is a liberal but hes not the most liberal
1522780 were trying to pick votes where some ideological differences are displayed and show how members of congress line up relative to one another
1522781 we dont try to establish a litmus test or ideological label
1522782 what were looking for is something that more closely represents how members might characterize their vote such as how often they vote with the president
1522783 they are not picking votes in an objective way to assess where a member is on an issue
1522784 it is true that when you look at some of the votes that ive taken in the senate that im on the democratic side of these votes
1522785 but part of the reason is because the way these issues are designed are to polarize theyre intentionally designed to polarize
1522786 american politics is a philosophical mess in that there is no philosophical coherence to political parties the parties are just groups of issue positions
1522787 theres pluses and minuses to each rating system if you look at a number of them i think you have a pretty good picture
1522788 we were told that he was going to make some approach to us to join the fold
1522789 man made global warming is the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the american people
1522790 people dont want their elected leaders wrapped in slick tv ads and carefully scripted appearances
1522791 what i had hoped when i started this race as an independent was that there would be an upwelling of support
1522792 i confess im not a very good politician in the sense that i absolutely hate raising money and i dont do it willingly
1522793 not exactly the kind of position that is likely to identify one as a moderate
1522794 his ability to portray himself as a moderate in the center of the electorate kept shrinking in part by the moves of his adversaries but also because of his own decisions
1522795 but were dealing with such a small number of voters
1522796 there is no other way to interpret this other than expletive you
1522797 none of the presidential candidates for either party is doing real well in my district its not a good idea to get close to any of them
1522798 the overriding distinction is that it puts principle over party
1522799 i hope that doesnt happen where we have to make a decision between a colleague and someone on the outside
1522800 what i see happening now is hardly the end of anything i think this is the beginning of something really really big thats going on in this country
1522801 ultimately its philosophy that wins its the belief and the convictions were motivated theyre motivated to maintain power were motivated to propose that we stick to the constitution and turn this country around that gives us energy
1522802 were asking dr paul supporters and any other republicans who want to come and celebrate republican traditions and limited government to join us there
1522803 the republican party needs to veer back and stay true to its traditions and remain a limited government party and maybe even become a limited government party once again
1522804 a lot of our supporters are very engaged in that and dr paul hes very supportive of spontaneous grass roots action
1522805 dr paul thinks they should go and have a very energetic yet respectful role in the convention where they try to influence the platform and try to be as involved as possible
1522806 uh op young bruce this is pat moynihan what can i do for you
1522807 sorry senator i just needed to make sure it was you and not russert
1522808 senator you probably dont remember me but im joe smith
1522809 i met that delightful young man who works for you the one who wrote your san francisco speech
1522810 it kills me that things i said and wrote sent a message to some of my friends in this room and people in this state that they cant count on me to be a champion for women a champion for all minnesotans in this campaign and in the senate
1522811 thats how the dfl does business and thats how we won the endorsement today
1522812 to have a massive turnover all at once is less than ideal
1522813 we wont be able to do things as quickly as we otherwise might
1522814 the fact is don is a very prominent republican campaign finance lawyer and he certainly is expert in the federal election campaign act and the fecs practices and procedures
1522815 is he a republican absolutely but then the commission is composed of three democrats and three republicans
1522816 every time you have a change of commissioners you have a little bit of a different take on issues a change in priorities
1522817 youll get a rule making docket that reflects the interests and experiences of those commissioners
1522818 is really an opportunity to transform the agency and i think thats a good thing its one of the real virtues of term limits
1522819 when we had three new commissioners come in 1998 every one was wanting to reinvent the wheel a little bit every new commissioner wants to leave their mark
1522820 so when you have a whole bunch coming on at once you have a lot of pulling in several different directions
1522821 might be looking at 200 to 300 votes awaiting enforcement action
1522822 we were told that he was going to make some approach to us to join the fold
1522823 unless i see something inherently helpful to our community im going to sit back and see what happens
1522824 i dont understand why third parties have to be intermediaries
1522825 just give him to me for a week and i will deliver the latino vote
1522826 fellow new yorkers it is time to follow sen clintons lead
1522827 bringing us together to work together so there is no democratic infighting because we need to work together to reverse the failed policies of the bush administration
1522828 we need to unite behind one candidate to put our strongest foot forward in electing a democrat to represent western new york families in congress
1522829 if senator obama and senator mccain can reject special interest cash why cant we all do the same
1522830 alice is the best candidate to win this primary win in november and will be on the ballot because voters decide elections not political insiders or bully tactics
1522831 mr powers should lead by example return the thousands of dollars he has taken from lobbyists pacs and strip club owners and support the only democrat who has created jobs balanced budgets and gotten things done for real people
1522832 as a political scientist i dont know how you tell people to drop out of a race before the race has even taken place you have primaries for a reason
1522833 all along people were saying how much it was hurting clinton how much it was hurting obama that the two of them were spending their money and hammering each other but in the end one could just as much make the argument that obama is a much stronger candidate for having defeated clinton
1522834 certainly it cannot be overlooked that jon powers has the support of all seven of the democratic county parties the working families party and a number of local unions
1522835 will be a powerful advocate for change in washington and will use his experience to get things done for northern virginia
1522836 a political outsider who is running a campaign based on his commitment to lower taxes and job creation
1522837 espouses the policies these women believe have taken the country in the wrong direction
1522838 we think that clintons exit definitely is a major opportunity that senator mccain has a major opportunity to pick up the support of a big chunk of these disaffected democrats
1522839 he is probably the strongest candidate the democrats could put up this election cycle
1522840 wont be any more of a problem than it is now
1522841 couldnt have come up with an ad for himself that helped any more than that
1522842 its early but there are troubling signs that hes not getting financial support from significant numbers of republicans
1522843 to compare a re election campaign for a sitting president in 2004 to a very competitive republican primary
1522844 we are working hard and we have every confidence that we will have the funds to run a winning campaign
1522845 its really a symptom of the fact he doesnt have the mechanism in place working the way it should to reach all those people
1522846 you know youre going to get hit so you kind of duck while you can
1522847 i havent been bombarded but ive had a couple of requests
1522848 in all likelihood he wont get all the bush donors but hell get most of them
1522849 i always considered myself a republican primarily because of a belief in smaller government and if you want a smaller government you dont want wars especially wars that can be avoided
1522850 i gave initially to hillary and i went to a fundraiser and met president clinton
1522851 but as the primary season went on i became very enthusiastic about obama and me and my wife have given him the maximum
1522852 napolitano would be a huge huge asset i think we would be the favorite at that point
1522853 its all a matter of perspective on whats safe and whats not safe
1522854 the bush campaign considered arizona safe when they were up by eight points
1522855 its very difficult for a democrat to win in arizona without independents and crossover republican women
1522856 so much of a long shot its not even worth talking about
1522857 make no mistake its our goal to delivery a victory bigger than in 2000 and 2004
1522858 im very excited its been a long year and a great year
1522859 it was clear we were a better fit for the district
1522860 she has said if senator obama should want her to be vice president and thinks it would be best for the ticket she will serve she will accept that but on the other hand if he chooses someone else she will work just as hard for the party in november
1522861 senator obama and senator clinton did have occasion to meet this evening
1522862 its the end of the primary process they wanted to talk about bringing these campaigns together in unity
1522863 a once in a generation leader who connects with the hopes and dreams of the american people and will deliver the long overdue change that our country desperately needs
1522864 she is not seeking the vice presidency and no one speaks for her but her
1522865 if you cant stand the heat get out of the kitchen
1522866 i always campaign straight up candidate to candidate we dont try to get on anyones coattails we will help sen mccain we think hes going to be a great candidate for us but well run our own campaign and well differentiate ourselves from
1522867 heather wilson made a pretty good case for why pearce couldnt get elected
1522868 one thing thats good about the udalls is they always run like theyre 10 points down
1522869 at the end of the day i think the people of new mexico are closer to tom udall
1522870 shes just so so good in debates and until last night shes always pulled it out in the end
1522871 there are not a lot of places to go from here in new mexico
1522872 but i dont think theres going to be an draft heather wilson movement
1522873 its hard to see a political path for her here
1522874 it was felt that the letter was being misconstrued as a demand on senator obama and weve decided to communicate our views informally
1522875 delegates are not bound to vote for the candidate they were elected to represent
1522876 i want you all to notice that their were several times when i could have yelled but i didnt
1522877 now that the votes have been cast and the primary season has come to its close i am pleased to play a part in ratifying the decision of the voters in my district and across the country
1522878 the ap story is incorrect senator clinton will not concede the nomination this evening
1522879 the former first lady will stop short of formally suspending or ending her race
1522880 she should be allowed to have time to press her case to superdelegates the official voting ends tonight she should have a day or two to present her case to superdelegates and then we see where we are
1522881 i think we all ought to wait and hear what sen clinton has to say tonight
1522882 to me theres one moral issue here winning in november
1522883 the polls show them both up there and i think its getting bad its getting nasty
1522884 theyve definitely taken the gloves off and theyre both telling the truth but theyre not telling the whole truth and its been very disappointing within the party
1522885 blank checks for all the waste that goes on in washington
1522886 he seems to be peeling off some potential wilson supporters
1522887 the endorsement will help but whether it can turn things around remains to be seen
1522888 weve certainly had our differences over the last sixteen months
1522889 but as someone whos shared a stage with her many times i can tell you that what gets hillary clinton up in the morning even in the face of tough odds is exactly what sent her and bill clinton to sign up for their first campaign in texas all those years ago what sent her to work at the childrens defense fund and made her fight for health care as first lady what led her to the united states senate and fueled her barrier breaking campaign for the presidency an unyielding desire to improve the lives of ordinary americans no matter how difficult the fight may be
1522890 i honor that service and i respect his many accomplishments even if he chooses to deny mine
1522891 this has been a long campaign and i will be making no decisions tonight
1522892 in the coming days i will be consulting with supporters and party leaders to determine how to move forward with the best interests of our party and our country guiding my way
1522893 it has been an honor to contest these primaries with him just as it has been an honor to call him a friend and i want to recognize him and his supporters for they have accomplished
1522894 if im elected president the era of the permanent campaign of the last sixteen years will end the era of reform and problem solving will begin
1522895 in just a few years in office sen obama has accumulated the most liberal voting record in the senate but the old tired big government policies he seeks to dust off and call new wont work in a world that has changed dramatically since they were last tried and failed
1522896 and i know very personally how terrible its costs are but i know too that the course sen obama advocates could draw us into a wider war with even greater sacrifices put peace further out of reach and americans back in harms way
1522897 i will be the democratic nominee for president of the united states
1522898 the question is where do we go from here and given how far weve come and where we need to go as a party its a question i dont take lightly this has been a long campaign and i will be making no decisions tonight
1522899 has made history in this campaign not just because shes a woman who has done what no woman has done before but because shes a leader who inspires millions of americans with her strength her courage and her commitment to the causes that brought us here tonight
1522900 i am a better candidate for having had the honor to compete with
1522901 this is our time our time to turn the page on the policies of the past
1522902 one of the reasons that i believe so strongly that she should be the vice presidential candidate if this goes the way i think this is going is because the constituencies have been very different they are polarized now
1522903 if she wanted a first ballot vote id stand with her
1522904 on the other hand campaigns are like anything else you get a feel for them and im one that believes we need unity in the party
1522905 the former first lady will stop short of formally suspending or ending her race
1522906 the ap story is incorrect senator clinton will not concede the nomination this evening
1522907 the tally was based on public declarations from delegates as well as from another 16 who have confirmed their intentions to the ap it also included 11 delegates obama was guaranteed as long as he gained 30 percent of the vote in south dakota and montana later in the day it takes 2 118 delegates to clinch the nomination
1522908 she should be allowed to have time to press her case to superdelegates the official voting ends tonight she should have a day or two to present her case to superdelegates and then we see where we are
1522909 i think we all ought to wait and hear what sen clinton has to say tonight
1522910 to me theres one moral issue here winning in november
1522911 the new organization capabilities in vmware lab manager 3 will help us better enforce role based access rights to system configurations in the lab according to our it policy says tony anastasio technology architect for cerner the leading u
1522912 we have development teams working on trading gateways for virtually every major futures exchange around the world
1522913 vmware lab manager 3 gives us much more flexibility in the way we deal with a global lab environment it simplifies administration supports multiple networks and lets us assign resource pools and manage user access rights for all of our teams from a central location vmware lab manager has quickly become the industry standard virtual lab automation solution used by software development and testing teams worldwide said raghu raghuram vice president of products and solutions vmware this new release expands the appeal of vmware lab manager to more groups of people at our customers by promoting effective self service combined with centralized it control
1522914 our policy from the beginning has been to show all our pictures as they come in and to try to involve the world along with us in exploring mars for a habitable zone
1522915 we really feel its time to let everybody know what were finding and get that window into our project
1522916 white house has been alerted by nasa about plans to make an announcement soon on major new phoenix lander discoveries concerning the potential for life on mars
1522917 on earth there are a large number of plants that concentrate perchlorate and grow in perchlorate at certain levels there are a variety of species of bacteria that utilise perchlorate as a substrate in their metabolism
1522918 perchlorates will tell us quite a bit about the history of water not just at the phoenix landing site but in other parts of mars as we continue our exploration
1522919 currently weve seen the perchlorates at the surface and a future line of research will be to look at where else they are on the planet and whether or not water and salt mobility was involved in that transport
1522920 i think that after the final primaries people are going to start making up their minds i think that is the natural progression that one would expect
1522921 i think that people will have to ask themselves those questions who would be the best president in terms of preparation and readiness and effectiveness and who would be the stronger candidate and i imagine that process will begin after the end of the last primaries
1522922 yes i will i will because i feel very strongly about this
1522923 i will consult with floridians and the voters in michigan because its really their voices that are being ignored and their votes that are being discounted and ill support whatever the elected officials and the voters in those two states want to do
1522924 one of the few senators of either party who oppose this bill because he thinks its too generous
1522925 voted against expanding the g i bill for the first time since world war ii to provide a free college education for veterans
1522926 republicans in congress have always promised to fund our troops fighting in iraq and afghanistan but when it came time to cast a vote to do so congressman
1522927 our troops stand up for us they need congressman feeney to stand up for them
1522928 our challenge from michigan is fatally flawed i mean we cannot do what we say we want to do based on the rules
1522929 can award how many delegates michigan gets do they get seated or not but they cant move the delegations around
1522930 does not have the jurisdiction to grant the key element of the relief requested taking 59 delegates won by other presidential candidates including uncommitted status and assigning them to senator obama
1522931 we continue to believe that our proposal is a fair resolution that follows the applicable rules
1522932 when the rules and bylaws committee itself decided not to follow its own newly adopted hard fought rules and granted a waiver to new hampshire it set the stage for the present situation
1522933 to penalize michigan would legitimize the selective enforcement of our party rules would fly in the face of the statements of both candidates and would jeopardize our chances of carrying michigan and winning the presidency
1522934 i just said im going to take my name off of something that i know is totally flawed
1522935 fairly reflect the will of the voters the 2 3 million voters
1522936 very importantly we think it is the position that recognizes the vote of 2 3 million people which just cannot be blithely swept aside as the obama campaign apparently has been willing to do month after month after month
1522937 fully expect and have every hope and every expectation that these issues will be resolved
1522938 thats a bridge to cross when we come to that particular stream
1522939 the reasonable position here is some fair compromise that allows the delegations to participate in november weve said repeatedly were open to a result that gives her some delegates which we think is a pretty major concession as hard as we fought for delegates
1522940 we seek a fair resolution we want delegations seated were willing to compromise and any compromise beyond a 50 50 split will cost sen obama but the bottom line is he is acting this weekend in the interest of party unity that is an important objective that is an important commitment and were going to need that to win in november
1522941 we both lived by these rules and pledged to abide by them
1522942 if anybody saw saturday night live maybe we should ask barack if hes comfortable and needs another pillow
1522943 the public seemed to have developed opinions about her that ran counter to the media coverage perhaps based on a pre existing negative disposition to her that unfolded over the course of the campaign
1522944 great asset when we go into november to make sure that we defeat the republicans that i can promise you
1522945 you voted even though some tried to tell you that your votes wouldnt count
1522946 you voted for the person you believe will be the stronger nominee and the strongest president
1522947 which candidate best represents the will of people who voted in this historic primary which candidate is best able to lead us to victory in november and which candidate is best able to lead our nation as our president in the face of unprecedented challenges at home and abroad
1522948 it was apparent to all of us that there was going to be no progress on those issues with the current makeup of congress and our current representative
1522949 i think when you get candidates who really end up being focused on one or two issues its not attractive to population thats going to be voting
1522950 didnt vote in mr loebsack last year they voted in a democrat
1522951 democrat lite will not get base out and it will not get swing voters out
1522952 i just find the economic issues facing the nation at this time vastly outweighing the social issues as a representative theres not a lot of impact i can have on social issues i dont see that i have a lot of impact in that matter if we dont get health care right i see this as our next big entitlement program
1522953 tremendous opportunity for the 2nd district to recapture this seat
1522954 people are looking for someone has international and domestic experience who has leadership who has integrity i think when it comes down to it theyre not going to want to put their sense of safety in someone they dont know i think thats the strength mr mccain will bring
1522955 i dont look at it as making history i think there are tremendously competent capable women that are within our district that would be willing to serve
1522956 im flattered that the democratic party feels me such a threat to rep loebsack that they would get involved in this primary campaign
1522957 the reduction should have been 50 percent in the first place and im asking that that be imposed
1522958 further punishment in the form of no michigan delegation or a reduced michigan delegation at the national convention will only aid the republicans in their effort to win michigan in november
1522959 florida needs to be represented at the convention were hoping that saturday brings a resolution so that we can move on ahead and focus on winning in november
1522960 we want our full delegation considering weve elected our delegates to be represented at the same time its really for the dnc and the campaigns to come to a satisfactory agreement between the three of them
1522961 were hoping that theres some fair resolution here that allows some participation in denver of the two states that would resolve in all likelihood in some delegate yield to sen clinton
1522962 and our expectation and our belief is that the dnc will vote on saturday to seat florida and michigan at 100 percent and thats what were focused on
1522963 if there is some other outcome we can deal with it then
1522964 tonight iowa in the fullness of spring with the help of those who stood up from portland to louisville we have returned to iowa with a majority of delegates elected by the american people and you have put us within reach of the democratic nomination for president of the united states of america
1522965 it really reflects the need for change that people see and the fiscal conservatism that the blue dogs so advocate and represent is what people want to see
1522966 the stars will never again realign as negatively for republicans as they did in 06
1522967 mary jo has been around a long time and shes got a lot of friends
1522968 as a mother of two daughters of about the same age as those in the press accounts i am appalled that those in power would abuse their authority in such a shameful way
1522969 marc dann should resign and he should do so quickly
1522970 sexual harassment and its cover up cant be tolerated anywhere and its about time he resigned
1522971 the democrats have been very very quick to just push him away from them
1522972 what theyre trying to do is create a big distance between him and the party and i think theyll probably be successful in doing that
1522973 obviously i dont control 100 percent of the way this campaign goes and ive gotta defend myself
1522974 i did work for bank one and i advocated for jobs and economic development
1522975 so if that makes me a lobbyist then im a lobbyist and if that makes me a janitor then im a janitor
1522976 i expect her to keep going after him as a former lobbyist
1522977 i dont know how hell do statewide but i know here he will be the best candidate for us
1522978 both campaign committees think this is a winnable district for them and for republicans there arent many open seats that they think they can win
1522979 i think they will invest heavily because stivers is a good candidate
1522980 democratic convention delegates to support seating the delegations from florida and michigan
1522981 the reason i am here tonight is because the democratic voters of america have made their choice and so have i there is one man who knows in his heart that its time to create one america not two and that man is
1522982 there is no question sen obama will outraise us this month
1522983 weve proven we can beat sen obama despite being outspent
1522984 turnout is up people are understanding where our candidates stand
1522985 thats all going to come to bear in the general election and thats going to help us come november
1522986 we would have liked to be able to focus on one candidate or another at this point
1522987 how can you complain about 165 000 new registered voters in north carolina
1522988 as far as i know no republican has expressed interest everyone recognizes the difficulties of running in massachusetts especially in a presidential year
1522989 shes had 10 months of incumbent like coverage in the press
1522990 its not a good time for a challenger to run
1522991 i considered that but the opportunity to represent all of the people of massachusetts is something i want and people are telling me they want
1522992 republicans in washington have obstructed change in our foreign and economic policies for too long and by electing bruce lunsford kentucky can reject that obstructionism and move the country forward
1522993 incredibly well organized and ready to head into the general campaign we look forward to his re election in november
1522994 the reason i am here tonight is because the democratic voters of america have made their choice and so have i there is one man who knows in his heart that its time to create one america not two and that man is
1522995 as a consequence i decided that i would try to give you something special
1522996 i decided that on my first full day of campaigning in michigan that i would not be fooling around that i was going to bring up one of the greatest leaders we have in the democratic party
1522997 we are a stronger party because hillary clinton is a democrat we are a stronger country because of her years of public service and we are going to have a stronger presidential nominee in the fall because of her work
1522998 obamas been having problems with white blue collar working class voters and they were precisely the people voting for edwards prior to his dropping out
1522999 kentucky will be the proof and id be willing to bet clinton will score another landslide there
1523000 we respect but as the voters of west virginia showed last night this thing is far from over
1523001 im going to wait until the whole thing plays out
1523002 edwards endorsement of a candidate he previously blasted as inexperienced hypocritical and lacking substance will not help obama with voters looking for real change
1523003 now is the time to unify around one candidate and make sure dale wins this race
1523004 i am confident he will represent our party well and keep this district in good hands
1523005 ive been encouraged ever since last thursday night when the onondaga county committee voted because the response has been so good
1523006 the war in iraq is a front in the war on terrorism and i would love to have that be over and end tomorrow but i do believe that the military experts will provide information and tell us when the job is done
1523007 technology needs to be encouraged but as the same time we need to look at the short term as well as the long term goals of energy policy to try to compete in the world market for oil try to keep our prices down and make sure we can reduce our dependence on foreign oil
1523008 given the fact that he is performing so poorly and this is his second run after his failed bid for the house in 2006 could this mean that dan maffei is a one trick pony
1523009 i dont really have very much faith in this poll
1523010 went through nearly half a dozen republican candidates to come up with a status quo politician
1523011 this campaign has never been focused on who the opponent is its more about what the issues are in the district and focusing on bringing jobs to the district and making sure that young people stay here and create the kind of economy that we need
1523012 stop tax breaks that reward companies for moving jobs overseas
1523013 were going to continue to rely on coal for a significant portion of our base power load and the way that we do that is by investing in new cleaner technology and shuttering or retrofitting older plants
1523014 you dont really have what you would like in the way of a coal option that would make a lot of sense
1523015 sure would like people who could be objective understanding both the economic necessities and environmental damage to come up with some approach that would enable us to retrieve the coal maybe there is a way to recover those mountaintops once they have been stripped of the coal you know i think weve got to look at this from a practical perspective
1523016 unless youre willing to talk about what youre going to replace those coal fired plants with and get by the unattainable concept that they could all be replaced with solar and wind you have a problem being for no more coal fired plants
1523017 caps on carbon and other greenhouse gas emissions and provid ing industries with tradable credits
1523018 we can find a way to use our coal resources without emitting excessive greenhouse gases
1523019 experience proves that the man who obstructs a war in which his nation is engaged no matter whether right or wrong occupied no enviable place in life or history better for him individually to advocate war pestilence and famine than to act as obstructionist to a war already begun
1523020 how can you countenance someone who was engaged in bombings which could have or did kill innocent people
1523021 clinton expected to do well in kentucky shes a valiant fighter but unless she can do the next to impossible and convince literally hundreds of super delegates to change their mind and re indorse her and unless she can get fl and mi delegates seated in violation of party rules in greater percentages than they even voted and notwithstanding the fact that neither candidate campaigned in either state then she cant win
1523022 s ober fair and thoroughly researched and all the more powerful and provocative because of it
1523023 was a tough assignment for a new lawmaker since he was essentially sponsoring legislation that would strip away long held privileges and perks from his colleagues
1523024 essentially lifted illinois a state with a deep history of illicit pay to play politics into the modern world when it came to ethics restrictions
1523025 this sets the standard for us and communicates to a public that is increasingly cynical about springfield and the general assembly that we in fact are willing to do the right thing
1523026 o nlookers faint at his obamas speeches with alarming frequency compared to other campaigns
1523027 a t some point he took off his arms and grew wings
1523028 by some yet undiscovered measure to be chosen by teachers unions
1523029 i think there should be ways for us to work with the nea with teachers unions to figure out a way to measure success
1523030 i want to work with teachers im not going to do it too you im going to do it with you
1523031 obama explained that if he took public financing it might be hard to compete with the outside 527 groups who will mercilessly smear him
1523032 w eve already seen that hes not going to stop the smears and attacks from his allies running so called 527 groups who will spend millions and millions of dollars in unlimited donations
1523033 everyone ive spoken to whos familiar with this including lobbyists and people who are engaged in opposition research say the number of times he voted present on a proportional basis was probably a little less than average
1523034 we arent talking about a present vote on whether to name a state office building after a deceased state official but rather about votes that reflect an officeholders core values
1523035 this is a fellow who i think shorthanded an answer that in fact was the wrong answer
1523036 mirrored the statements the rest of us have been talking about
1523037 ill concede you cannot meet with foreign leaders with terrorists rather without some conditions
1523038 this is a fellow who i think shorthanded an answer that in fact was the wrong answer
1523039 because it was going to help people in his district
1523040 mr rezko never spoke with nor sought a letter from senator obama in connection with that project
1523041 wrote letters to city and state officials supporting his political patron tony rezkos successful bid to get more than 14 million from taxpayers to build apartments for senior citizens
1523042 it was done in the interests of the people in the community who have benefited from the project
1523043 i dont know that anyone specifically asked him to write this letter nine years ago
1523044 there was a consensus in the community about the positive impact the project would make and obama supported it because it was going to help people in his district
1523045 mr rezko never spoke with nor sought a letter from senator obama in connection with that project
1523046 all of his opponents off the ballot on a technicality
1523047 he talks about honor and democracy but what honor is there in getting rid of every other candidate so you can run scot free why not let the people decide
1523048 collected nearly 1 600 petition signatures in just ten days and submitted them ahead of the december 18 deadline
1523049 palmer realized that obama had called her hand and she acknowledged that she had not properly acquired the necessary number of signatures
1523050 why say youre for a new tomorrow then do old style chicago politics to remove legitimate candidates
1523051 he talks about honor and democracy but what honor is there in getting rid of every other candidate so you can run scot free why not let the people decide
1523052 liberal supporters support military strikes within the territory of an american ally without that nations permission
1523053 obama apparently made a slip of the tongue in august of last year and advocated such incursions into pakistan
1523054 this proposal does not honor the 600 000 votes that were cast in michigans january primary those votes must be counted
1523055 good step toward a solution that unites democrats and ensures that our state will not face a mccain presidency
1523056 this proposal honors the result of the january 15th primary but also takes into consideration that obamas name was not on the ballot
1523057 shes going to make the decision when the time comes
1523058 it was a hard fought campaign but as bev went around the state and talked about issues like education and affordable health care and creating 21st century jobs it really resonated with voters and i think we saw the results of that tonight
1523059 when a family has a squabble they may disagree for a while and then the next day they come back together and work like a team and i think thats what democrats will do i think democrats will rally together and work together for november
1523060 this primary has allowed me to meet north carolinians and begin a longer conversation with them about what they feel needs to be done to fix washington im proud that they have chosen me to take on
1523061 my campaigns strategy has always been to run this race to ultimately defeat and im proud that we are one step closer while having kept the campaign clean and respectful of other democrats in the process
1523062 its about the future of the republican party in the 3rd district and if he wins its virtually the end of the party
1523063 his experience in baton rouge would allow him to make a swift transition in congress which is particularly important as this area continues to recover from disaster
1523064 i think having mccain at the top of the ticket helps sununu
1523065 that was pretty much the high point in the decade for republicans in new hampshire
1523066 the campaign has a timeline and strategy in place and we are following that according to plan
1523067 tonight we stand less than 200 delegates away from winning the democratic nomination for president of the united states
1523068 the question is not what kind of campaign theyll run its what kind of campaign we will run its what we will do to make this year different i didnt get into race thinking that i could avoid this kind of politics but i am running for president because this is the time to end it
1523069 well tonight weve come from behind weve broken the tie and thanks to you its full speed onto the white house
1523070 it seems it would be a little strange to have a nominee chosen by 48 states
1523071 were on the same glide path we were on before and hopefully there will be a soft landing for our nominee
1523072 this is going to be a fight to the end
1523073 senator clinton would do the party well to reassess her options
1523074 we are seeing democrats independents and even republicans that are interested and energized about the prospect of having their voice heard on a national stage
1523075 candidates campaigns are trying to capitalize on the new voters and suggest that their candidate is the real obama like candidate of change
1523076 he is running a campaign using the advantage of incumbency and trying to tie himself to
1523077 i was a bit surprised at the level of the lead
1523078 that is what we will continue to do and hopefully voters will do the same thing this time
1523079 i know the problems of health care and jobs and i know how to create solutions working across the aisle
1523080 if someone can drive andr carsons negative up myers might be able to get into this thing
1523081 our policy from the beginning has been to show all our pictures as they come in and to try to involve the world along with us in exploring mars for a habitable zone
1523082 we really feel its time to let everybody know what were finding and get that window into our project
1523083 white house has been alerted by nasa about plans to make an announcement soon on major new phoenix lander discoveries concerning the potential for life on mars
1523084 on earth there are a large number of plants that concentrate perchlorate and grow in perchlorate at certain levels there are a variety of species of bacteria that utilise perchlorate as a substrate in their metabolism
1523085 perchlorates will tell us quite a bit about the history of water not just at the phoenix landing site but in other parts of mars as we continue our exploration
1523086 currently weve seen the perchlorates at the surface and a future line of research will be to look at where else they are on the planet and whether or not water and salt mobility was involved in that transport
1523087 there is no indication that obamas problems with white working class democrats in the ohio and pennsylvania primaries have gone away
1523088 if the superdelegates are looking at electability these results could be a shot in the arm for sen clinton no one has won the white house since 1960 without carrying two of these three swing states
1523089 fully admitted his drug use both marijuana and cocaine he says it continued through college
1523090 this book is full of innuendos misstatements lies he says mr corsi says its 300 pages 600 footnotes and i stand by every statement in this book let me see if you stand by some of these statements doctor obama never revealed if or when he stopped using drugs thats a lie the truth is that he said in his own book dreams from my father that he stopped when he got into college
1523091 barack obama admitted using drugs in his autobiography but never revealed if or when he stopped
1523092 he fully admitted his drug use both marijuana and cocaine he says it continued through college
1523093 you said that barack obama supported a bill that allowed mothers to kill their babies even after they were born now were they gonna use knives guns or how were they gonna do that and do you actually believe that to be true
1523094 obama on the floor of the illinois state senate said that woman had an absolute right to abortion to kill the baby even if it survived that abortion
1523095 can i give you a couple other corsi comments just so that people can understand the person writing this book
1523096 how long ago was anybody asked hillary why she couldnt stop b j bill being satisfied shes a lesbo when did you say that
1523097 ad hominem attacks on me are a fairly low way of trying to get to the substance of what im saying
1523098 doctor i have looked through a good part of your book all i can tell you is you say you have 600 sources most of those sources are people who have right wing agendas who are against barack obama
1523099 i f youre holding yourself out here to be an expert on barack obama and say the kinds of things youve said you have to understand why some of us question not only your standing not only the accuracy of your book but also your history
1523100 its 300 pages 600 footnotes and i stand by every statement in this book
1523101 obama never revealed if or when he stopped using drugs
1523102 john effing commie kerry he married teresa then he became a jew
1523103 anybody asked hillary why she couldnt stop b j bill being satisfied shes a lesbo
1523104 the obama pelosi team needs don cazayoux to win this special election
1523105 see cazayoux will be a vote for their agenda so they fund his campaign
1523106 the tactic of the democratic party is to talk conservative during the election but to vote liberal in washington
1523107 we hear from people that they see through that stuff that they know this race is between don cazayoux and woody jenkins i dont think its really had much of an impact to attack us with these national figures who arent really in peoples minds here yet
1523108 cazayoux is trying to be all things to all people pro life pro gun
1523109 if you really believe those things you dont have a whole lot of reason to run as a democrat because as a party theyre not for any of those things
1523110 probably an additional factor in louisiana is woody jenkins has been around a long time this is the same thing we had to some degree with oberweis
1523111 you get some scar tissue if youre in politics and you make tough calls and tough decisions
1523112 you also get by the way some pretty strong support which he has thats why he won that primary very easily so theres an intensity about him
1523113 i think many more filers are electing to use the tax method even though they would have to include potentially large sums of money spent on non deductible state lobbying and grass roots lobbying
1523114 i heard people say that they were going to go back and count everything that needed to be counted
1523115 maybe what they found is that they were spending more money
1523116 they have a constitutional right not to have to take a tough vote
1523117 its major purpose is to influence the election for the democratic candidate for president
1523118 is not the election or defeat of a particular candidate but rather to raise public awareness of vital public policy issues affecting americas middle class
1523119 and just because the fec isnt doing its job doesnt mean a watchdog group like judicial watch is going to stop asking question or stop calling attention to the involvement of foreign nationals in our presidential campaign
1523120 ive always had politics around but ive always been focused on the business side
1523121 because wright was dismissive of sen obama and was disrespectful of sen obama
1523122 the top one is whos best to win the election
1523123 id like to have a democrat in the white house
1523124 vote for the team that makes sense and that team is none other than carson and obama
1523125 you know you can always go to the convention thats what credential fights are for
1523126 the elitist behavior of the democratic front runner and the liberal and extremist positions that he and his fellow democrats in congress have staked their claim to do not appear to be as salient as they once hoped
1523127 for the second time this cycle republicans were reminded that all politics is local
1523128 used false and deceptive special interest smears and funneled nearly a million dollars into a district that republicans held for more than three decades
1523129 won by focusing on the concerns of la 06 voters good paying jobs affordable health care and better education
1523130 proves once again that americans across our country want real solutions and reject republicans negative attacks
1523131 although i am a democrat ive always been able to work with republicans very well in getting things done
1523132 you do these things to help people and it was just a natural progression to go toward a political office where you can actually more substantially help these people
1523133 its as much about constituent services in a small rural area as anything
1523134 the elitist behavior of the democratic front runner and the liberal and extremist positions that he and his fellow democrats in congress have staked their claim to do not appear to be as salient as they once hoped
1523135 in its most vulgar and displeasing to look at form and its suicide as a lifestyle
1523136 you have chosen to be a liability to yourself your family your neighborhood and this country
1523137 it all comes back to the horror the soullessness of a trend in america that is the abandonment of parenting
1523138 drawing a line behind you you can free yourself of limitations and be at peace with the process of life move forward to new beginnings

1523155 for some people its second nature to get up in the morning and go to the computer apart from music i am rarely at a computer
1523156 and a lot of time i work with an engineer who does it all anyway
1523157 i wasnt asked to go in the studio to produce music because i as savvy with computers but i was asked to go in the studio because i was savvy with music and i had good ideas
1523158 i knew how to arrange music and how i wanted it to sound
1523159 the first time i went to the studio to do a remix for primal scream or happy mondays it was because they had heard me djing and wanted to inject my sound into their music
1523160 i was in clubs every weekend and that is the knowledge they wanted
1523161 they didnt care if i could use a computer or not
1523162 it seems that the people making it are more interested in the process than they are the end result
1523163 to a lot of people the software and computer side of it is more interesting than the end product which is why i find a lot of electronic music extremely boring and hardly listen to it
1523164 i love electronic music for dancing to because its functional
1523165 you have to think about people dancing to it i am not anti electronic music
1523166 if i didnt like it i wouldnt be playing it and i would have stopped years ago
1523167 i need music that is more visceral than soundscapes it has to get me in the guts
1523168 i dont worry about the next rung on the ladder and having to kiss ass or worry about offending people
1523169 if you want to get psychoanalytical about it when i was young i always wanted to dress up and look weird and i was bullied by people
1523170 when i was 13 with blue hair and tartan trousers i would put myself into the position of the person who was going to bully me
1523171 i would have a snappy comeback and i would diffuse the situation instead of getting my head kicked in
1523172 so from my early teenage years humour was a defense mechanism to avoid violence
1523173 now i use humour to avoid mental injury by not getting too sucked in
1523174 i take music seriously but i dont take the music business seriously
1523175 for some people its second nature to get up in the morning and go to the computer
1523176 and a lot of time i work with an engineer who does it all anyway
1523177 i wasnt asked to go in the studio to produce music because i as savvy with computers but i was asked to go in the studio because i was savvy with music and i had good ideas
1523178 for some people its second nature to get up in the morning and go to the computer

1523206 the result is a strong performance in a highly challenging environment it marks the reward for the hard work that has been invested by all of the lufthanseats and all of the groups companies such as swiss it is the result of careful precautions
1523207 the undoubtedly very good first half result should not allow us to lose sight of the major challenges that lie ahead our company has the great opportunity to emerge relatively stronger from the increasingly difficult market and competition situation that we find ourselves in we have laid the foundations and will not jeopardize our future we have shown in the past that we are prepared for these kinds of situations and are capable of reacting to them our financial strength and operating adaptability will grant us the opportunity to remain profitable and strong and to continue to make our company more attractive for our shareholders customers and employees

1523233 howard parnes of the national cancer institute told the washington post
1523234 in fact there are several ways in which screening can actually be harmful

1523236 trash counters strewn with open and empty glass jars piles of receipts thrown on the ground upturned couch cushions bits of marijuana on the edges of counters and an atm with its doors torn open and emptied an outdoor vegetable garden had plants uprooted along with marijuana plants removed by the agents
1523237 were used to the dea calling in help from various federal agencies and local law enforcement but i guess none of their usual buddies were available yesterday because from the picture below which appeared in the la times today it looks like they had to resort to calling in blackwater
1523238 are members of a disputed mercenary killer group now working with the dea a photo from the la times shows proof of one of two things either blackwater members are now working for the bush white houses drug enforcement agency or this semi illegitimate band of rogue federal cops have worse discipline than any of us ever imagined
1523239 so we need to look at how we can better serve our changing population
1523240 other task forces have looked at specific things primarily space issues do we need to build new schools and where
1523241 this is a more comprehensive look we see the changes that are happening and want to be up front we dont want to be faced with problems that hit us in the face we want to be proactive

1523252 my daughter may have some mistruths out there or half truths but she is not a murderer you all are sucking the life right out of me every day having to remind everybody that this is what its all about
1523253 she would complain about her mother and how she was trying to run her life but then a few days later shed say how much she loved her mother and father
1523254 on a day when major news organizations across the country are taking senator mccain to task for a steady stream of false negative attacks his campaign has launched yet another
1523255 comparing the dpj to the nazis is a verbal abuse that completely lacks common sense we demand a retraction of course
1523256 i only tried to raise a question about the absence of proper discussion in the upper house i was trying to explain that there have been many such cases in the past after parliamentary discussions were boycotted
1523257 there were similar cases before the second world war and thats what i used as an example
1523258 in the past germany invited tragedy by letting the nazis take power
1523259 heikki drove a good race and in his performance i think i saw a lot of myself from races in my youth such as last year
1523260 of course it will be interesting to see if he can maintain that level of performance as he matures as a racer into say his third season which would be next year
1523261 i have just dropped an e mail to my photo editor to get new pictures to go with the article i have just searched and replaced kubicas name on
1523262 by the way does anyone know how to spell heikkis surname
1523263 thats the problem with the electronic age these young guys dont research their subject but simply re hash the same idea in a knee jerk reaction to the last race
1523264 the traditional way is to write a separate story tipping each of the young guys for stardom before the season starts then just submit them when someone new wins a race
1523265 the only saving grace is that its been a few years since i received any stories about jenson button

1523267 without the support of the americans we would not have accomplished the mission because the british forces had done nothing there
1523268 i do not trust the british forces they did not want to lose any soldiers for the mission
1523269 the arrangement was not dissimilar to the agreement struck between the us military and sunni muslim insurgents in central iraq
1523270 the difference was that the british had effectively surrendered control of the city
1523271 the reason why uk forces were not deployed initially on the ground was we were simply not asked the reason we were not asked was because the iraqi prime minister nouri own credibility was on the line
1523272 the only reason the americans were involved was because they were with the iraqi units
1523273 suggestions that uk forces failed to get involved in the recent operation against militias in basra are inaccurate no secret deal or accommodation kept us out of the city
1523274 there was no structure in place in the city for units to go back in and start mentoring the iraqi troops
1523275 when the action was launched british forces provided a raft of military support including armor artillery airpower medical and logistic support
1523276 everybody just assumed that because this deal was cut nobody was going in cutting a deal with the bad guys is generally not a good idea
1523277 the only limit on our involvement was prime minister malikis rightful concern that the operation was seen by the people of basra to be iraqi led
1523278 it is nonsense to suggest that this hampered uk support to the operation
1523279 whether the larger claims are accurate or not none of this should reflect on the british soldiers whove risked much and suffered more with far less support from their government and folks back home than the americans
1523280 the development of these areas and others might change priorities and in this case hopefully it wont take a serious accident or death to prompt action
1523281 in planning the council reconstruction of firebrace street with a 20 year vision was extensive consideration given to increased use of bikes and gophers and therefore their parking
1523282 in living among an ageing population gophers and other low cost modes of transport such as motor scooters are and will further be more prominent within our community
1523283 it was a huge honour and a very big day
1523284 a lot of people turned up and i know a lot of them came from a long way away
1523285 you dont do anything for the club to get life membership
1523286 dont get me wrong it is an absolute honour to get it it is just something that i never thought i would get
1523287 all you want to do is make sure the club survives
1523288 it was a really good day i enjoyed it thoroughly
1523289 it was just as well i wasnt too fit or i might have made a mess of myself
1523290 sometimes with things like these when people make a fuss about you they can go over the top and it can be embarrassing
1523291 they just spoke about what life membership is about and didnt embarrass the hell out of me like they could have
1523292 the seniors and the reserves both played very good football and that carried on to sunday with the boys in very good spirits
1523293 there is nothing like a win you dont train to lose
1523294 when i go in for treatment they say how fit and well i look and i agree and say i think you have made a misdiagnosis
1523295 all i say to the specialists is to do their best but dont stuff up
1523296 it is increasingly hard to provide an acceptable work environment and a critical mass of staff at the smallest facilities such as charlton rainbow sea lake and stawell
1523297 we struggle to attract leading scientists and young people to work at small sites given that the department competes in a national and global market for skilled staff
1523298 the veil of words they hide behind in announcing these closures is shameful and highly disrespectful to the workers their families the farming community and broader community
1523299 to imply that the closures are beyond their control because they are not immune to change and the farming sector is being reshaped by climate change global commodity markets and demographic trends is a cop out
1523300 the state and federal labor governments can bang their drums and spin a tale that although these closures will lead to up to 70 job losses across the state there will be no loss in service
1523301 it looks like she lost control veered off the road and hit a tree
1523302 despite difficult trading conditions the company has high quality assets and as such we believe the administrators will be able to satisfactorily meet all employee entitlements
1523303 i would like to express my concern for the companys dedicated employees who have worked so hard over many years to ensure the businesss success
1523304 i am concerned for the well being of our employees and their families who are affected most by this announcement we also recognise the economic and social impact upon stawell and the surrounding region
1523305 there have been significant price increases of rubber and increased distribution costs as a result of fuel price rises
1523306 these trading conditions have impacted upon other australian tyre businesses for example goodyear announced the closure of its somerton based south pacific tyres factory which employs 600 workers
1523307 in the past six months management has explored a number of ways to keep the business running as a going concern unfortunately these options have not been successful
1523308 based on the information they received at the meeting and based on the information in those reports theyll decide whether they want to withdraw or let the complaints stand
1523309 the objections are based on the fact that its of an historical nature
1523310 one objector thought there had been enough buildings of an historical nature demolished in the past
1523311 a lack of toilet facilities when educating very young children has been suggested as a deterrent
1523312 if we have a facility that has deteriorated to the extent that no one cares such as the traffic school where does active transport fit into the bigger picture
1523313 we have a responsibility as a community to encourage recreational activity when statistics say at the current rate it is predicted that 65 per cent of young australians will be overweight or obese by 2020
1523314 does the council have a specific strategy that promotes active transport being of benefit to our health the environment economic sustainability and of great social importance
1523315 the onus of bike education for young people is currently a school and parent partnership
1523316 in talking to the schools vicroads and the department of education early childhood development it would seem the resources are available but it depends on the schools ability to be proactive in this area
1523317 unfortunately in rural and regional areas schools do not always have the ability to access these resources
1523318 to provide relief staff to allow training of specific bicycle educators is an unrealistic community expectation of the schools
1523319 without outside help poland could have trouble retaining auschwitz as a memorial site
1523320 although how long that will take is still unclear but a deal is not far off not at all
1523321 this is nothing but propaganda direct from south africa probably coming from someone like the press spokesman for thabo mbeki the south african president
1523322 south africa wants everyone to believe that a deal is imminent and is giving off the record briefings to that effect

1523324 robert mugabe is saying he wants morgan tsvangirai as prime minister with no power
1523325 but tsvangirai is talking about a transitional arrangement for two years only when an election will be held and whoever wins the election rules the country
1523326 he wants mugabe to be in a ceremonial role where he would just be kissing babies opening parliament meeting heads of state at the airport and dishing out medals
1523327 tsvangirai wants to be in charge of key ministries like defence home affairs justice and finance
1523328 but i am not hopeful mugabe is likely to accept that he has to be forced out mbeki has to tell him that the game is up

1523333 if these census results are confirmed they are incredibly exciting the kind of good news we rarely find
1523334 the gorillas are still under threat from ebola and hunting for bush meat we must not become complacent ebola can wipe out thousands in a short time

1523365 there is no emergency situation in novara there is no need for such a fascist edict there are other better ways to tackle the citys problems
1523366 one thing i will say though is that to compare the ordinance with fascism is absurd we are trying to solve issues but are being accused of fascism
1523367 i really dont see the need for troops on streets it will have a completely negative effect
1523368 i have already had people calling me after reading reports of troops on streets in italy and asking me is there some sort of civil war going on
1523369 its an image boosting operation that risks turning into a boomerang
1523370 it will make italy look like a country in the grip of an uncontrolled security emergency
1523371 paratroopers guarding the centres of the major tourist cities arent exactly a great calling card for a country at the height of the tourist season
1523372 we will have one soldier for every 10 municipalities doing nothing except going to the bar with a policeman its a joke and to cap it all its only a provisional measure

1523376 this team can play without me i believe in my coaches i believe in the club i dont think this team will play any differently having me here or not
1523377 i dont ever look forward to being away from the competition it is their decision i dont have the advantage of the appeal process so ive got to serve mine tonight
1523378 this is my 20 something year in the big leagues and i still dont understand what common sense they have when they make those decisions
1523379 if people know olivo thats the way he is im not saying hes wrong or right i managed him and know the way he is if olivo thought it was a purpose pitch he made the right decision
1523380 i thought i might get suspended but i wasnt sure for how long
1523381 five days is a long time i was surprised it was that for that long still everything is in the beginning stages im not an expert on it
1523382 he didnt really try to fight olivo really or anyone

1523398 the side effects bible the dietary solution to unwanted side effects of common medications

1523401 second of all theres not enough health education in the field
1523402 when i did a presentation at walgreens and rite aid they said well our pharmacists dont have time
1523403 its not like the old days where they can counsel patients
1523404 you have these millions of people on statin drugs i dont have to tell you how many millions they are all getting their coq10 depleted
1523405 and the major side effects from statin drugs are liver problems and also statin induced myopathy which is muscle pain and weakness other problems include fatigue and memory problems
1523406 the doctors and the pharmacists are not educated in drug induced nutrient depletion its not talked about
1523407 why arent people told this stuff why isnt your doctor or pharmacist telling you that your drug depletes zinc out of your body its because vitamins arent deemed important unless its very very well known doctors are clueless they think drugs and surgery can solve all of the problems that we have
1523408 ill show them a list of the potential depletion problems of their drug and theyll say oh magnesium depletion can cause muscle cramps and depression
1523409 and theyre reading all of the depletion problems and theyll say oh thats me
1523410 i see it in my practice on a daily basis oh doc im on lipitor or im on vasotec or wellbutrin or vioxx and i dont feel well and we feel that its not all drug induced deficiencies but in part its side effects seem to be related to nutrient deficiencies
1523411 hopefully therell be some education the book which i wrote did ok it wasnt a best seller like some of my other books
1523412 the train has left the station whatever analogy you want he needs to jump on the train and lets go or if we cant get past things that have happened i have to keep the train moving
1523413 the players they want it resolved even talk to brett about it he feels bad about it its time for them to talk about somebody else
1523414 best thing for this team is for us to part ways
1523415 coach mike mccarthy and i both agreed last night that me being out there is a distraction and will continue to be a distraction we all know the reason im here is because the commissioner roger goodell reinstated me so we have a lot of things to figure out its simple and complicated both at the same time
1523416 notwithstanding the game slips and the likely delay of a return to profitability for another year we remain cautiously optimistic that midway will perform better in 2009 than it is expected to perform in 2008

1523449 california deserves more from its legislators than pursuing flawed legislation state employees are facing pay cuts californias services are being scaled back and anxiety is rising in sacramento to find funds
1523450 rather than tackling real problems affecting californians they chose to waste time money and state resources it is shameful that legislators pursued personal agendas in spite of the facts
1523451 caregivers are not well served by court battles and legal fees rather they would have been far better off if state officials worked together with our industry to raise awareness about video game ratings and the parental controls available on all new game consoles both of which help ensure that the games children play are parent approved

1523497 i dont think they spent nearly enough time talking to developers when they were developing the ps3 its less friendly for developers its a hardware architectural problem i dont think they thought through the cell architecture the hardware is only as good as the software it enables
1523498 but anyways who buys hl2 and orange box for xbox 360 its a lot better on pc
1523499 the ps3 is a total disaster on so many levels i think its really clear that sony lost track of what customers and what developers wanted
1523500 id say even at this late date they should just cancel it and do a do over
1523501 investing in the cell investing in the spe gives you no long term benefits theres nothing there that youre going to apply to anything else youre not going to gain anything except a hatred of the architecture theyve created i dont think theyre going to make money off their box i dont think its a good solution
1523502 i dont think they spent nearly enough time talking to developers when they were developing the ps3 its less friendly for developers its a hardware architectural problem i dont think they thought through the cell architecture the hardware is only as good as the software it enables

1523525 it was the kind of thing where the cia said look this is not our charge were not here to carry forth a political mandate which is clearly what this was to solve a political problem in america and it was a cause of great grievance inside of the agency
1523526 one of the greatest lies in modern american political history
1523527 its on the record its in the book and people can read it for themselves
1523528 why dont they ask him to give us something we can use to help make our case
1523529 bush wanted to go to war in iraq from the very first days he was in office nothing was going to stop that
1523530 in the book youll see people who are involved and talking about the debate and it was quite a fierce debate at the highest levels of the government is habbush reliable whats he saying how can we check it
1523531 and a lot of people at the end of the day said it was hard for him to prove the negative that what he said was no weapons were actually not there thats hard to do
1523532 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammed atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operation link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade
1523533 a handwritten letter with habbushs name on it would be fashioned by cia and then hand carried by a cia agent to baghdad for dissemination
1523534 well the cia folks involved in the book and others talk about george tenet coming back from the white house with the assignment on white house stationery and turning to the cia operatives who are professionals and saying you may not like this but here is our next mission
1523535 and they carried it through step by step all the way to the finish
1523536 is really concrete proof that al qaeda was working with saddam
1523537 it is in my opinion true that the administration for whatever reason was determined to have a showdown with iraq that predated this whole wmd stuff
1523538 well you know a lot of them have been walking around with this lump in their chest for a couple of years five years now
1523539 and because theyre essentially free theyre not the original source they said look why hide now
1523540 id done this sort of thing for a while and the way it worked was there were off the record sources who played out the story and then i went to people actually involved

1523686 we should not be paying for iraqi projects while iraqi oil revenues continue to pile up in the bank including outrageous profits from 4 a gallon gas prices in the u s
1523687 we should require that u s taxpayers be reimbursed for the cost of large projects

1523710 the reason for that is it would bring in 168 different countries and their olympic foundation and all those revenues and that would be going towards the growth of the game
1523711 the majors are incredibly big as we know but we still capture the same audience that is already interested in the game
1523712 its for growing the game around the world and something we can all do together
1523713 the value for the players is that the more people that play around the world the more people will be watching theyll be paid back eventually
1523714 i find it wholesome to be alone the greater part of the time to be in company even with the best is soon wearisome and dissipating i love to be alone i never found the companion that was so companionable as solitude
1523715 ill tell you how the sun rose a ribbon at a time the steeples swam in amethyst the news like squirrels ran
1523716 why that is what we turned the guest bedroom into your room for is so you could sleep and basically live
1523717 we are carefully evaluating all aspects of our operations in the uk
1523718 our goal is to reduce our operating losses to 13m in fiscal year 2009 7m in fiscal year 2010 and to approach break even in 2011
1523719 we believe the long term growth potential in the uk is much greater th an in canada
1523720 i will say we are looking for another starting pitcher
1523721 there are millions of others who are trying to reach that position and have been trying for years and years
1523722 so why cant i be one of those who try
1523723 because they have been studying the earth and how it works and also how to manipulate all the 11th grade students in the world to elect them as the ruler
1523724 who was that dude from salt lake that was kind of rich oh yeah larry h something
1523725 yeah but no one knows who he is anymore because that rich girl carly is by far more wealthy than that guy she is all anyone can talk about i mean sheesh she owns half the city
1523726 glory be to allah who has taken his servant on a journey in the night from masjid al haram to masjid al aqsa whose precincts we have blessed so as to show him some of our signs for he sees and hears all things
1523727 and the person who brings the truth and he who supports it such are the people who do right
1523728 neither reason nor faith should be used for violence unfortunately both of them have been sometimes misused to perpetrate violence in any case these events cannot question either reason or faith
1523729 they are called to mutual respect thereby condemning derision of religious beliefs
1523730 generalization should be avoided when speaking of religions differences of confessions within christianity and islam and diversity of historical contexts are important factors to be considered
1523731 religious traditions cannot be judged on the basis of a single verse or a passage present in their respective holy books a holistic vision as well as an adequate hermeneutical method is necessary for a fair understanding of them
1523732 sorry my dear sister please dont take offense but in islam we are prohibited to shake the hand of a woman unless she is a close relative please understand
1523733 no problem youre welcome i just hope that you dont start reading in arabic now
1523734 we all face the same problems our aim is to use our common values to tackle the issues that we all face as members of this society issues such as divorce home foreclosure financial counseling drug abuse bankruptcy and unemployment you either have these problems or know someone who does we must work together on the basis of the common values our various religions share
1523735 surely we shall test you with something of fear and hunger some loss in goods lives and the fruits of your toil but give glad tidings to those who patiently persevere those who when misfortune strikes them say indeed we belong to god allah and to him is our return those are the ones upon whom are blessings and mercy from their lord and it is those who are rightly guided
1523736 whatever specialty you have we would welcome for anyone if you are good at organizing or writing or if you can volunteer your time we must get the word out to the public
1523737 o mankind we have created you from a single pair of a male and a female and made you into nations and tribes that you may know each other not that ye may despise each other verily the most honored of you in the sight of god is he who is most god conscious and god has full knowledge and is well acquainted with all things
1523738 para isso que servem os blogs tudo diferente agora n s temos que ser transparentes e honestos as pessoas est o falando sobre isso postando imagens n s n o podemos ignorar isso temos que lidar com isso de maneira direta
1523739 since 1979 more than 293 000 people have received direct assistance from the njsbdc in the form of free confidential one on one management consulting and affordable education
1523740 i work hard for those moments i like those moments its special today thats what i want to do try to help the team win
1523741 the most important thing to me is to stay healthy
1523742 my health is good i can do whatever i can to help the team win im very happy im back in the lineup
1523743 it changes the game hes one of the big superstars in the game i think moreso than his ability to hit the ball out of the ballpark he loosens us up with his charisma and character before and after the game hes a huge part of who we are
1523744 he didnt really have good command ill say that much and sometimes when you dont have command and you dont make quality pitches it hurts you sometimes
1523745 whereas the united states of america was founded on the ideals of individual rights including the individual right to practice ones religion of choice or no religion and that there would be no compulsion of religion nor state sanctioned religion nor a religious test for participation in the body politic includes a complete political and social structure encompassed by its religious law sharia that supercedes any civil law and that islam mandates that no secular or democratic institutions are to be superior to islamic law
1523746 i think a better possibility to enact an amendment to the constitution declaring america a nation with a judeo christian heritage without establishing any particular jewish sect orthodox conservative or or christian denomination variations of protestantism catholicism eastern orthodox etc as a state religion this would simultaneously deal with secular humanism war on christianity and radical islam
1523747 whereas the united states of america was founded on the ideals of individual rights including the individual right to practice ones religion of choice or no religion and that there would be no compulsion of religion nor state sanctioned religion nor a religious test for participation in the body politic
1523748 christianity is not a religion of peace because jesus didnt come to bring peace
1523749 do not think that i came to bring peace on the earth i did not come to bring peace but a sword for i came to set a man against his father and a daughter against her mother and a daughter in law against her mother in law and a mans enemies will be the members of his household he who loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me and he who loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me and he who does not take his cross and follow after me is not worthy of me he who has found his life will lose it and he who has lost his life for my sake will find it
1523750 i think a better possibility to enact an amendment to the constitution declaring america a nation with a judeo christian heritage
1523751 abraham of the old testament was the founding patriarch of a new monotheistic faith which included jews and later christians and muslims one of his two sons is historically tied to the founding of judaism the other to the founding of islam the children of abraham project which is an effort by individuals and interfaith organizations in the detroit metro area to educate jews christians and muslims as to their common ancestry and encourages them to work together for tolerance peace and civic betterment the process involves watching a play in which teenage actors some who helped write the play act out scenes from the biblical story this is interspersed with contemporary accounts of religious and ethnic prejudice based on personal recollections the play has allowed audiences to speak freely about their fears and prejudices and to walk in anothers shoes the hidden story of jesus what really struck me about this documentary was by taking jesus as an example it was possible to see how much most of the religions have in common i believe looking for what we have in common instead of looking at our differences will in fact help us to become more closely connected as a society and more accepting of our differences this is not a documentary for christians to be afraid of as i do not believe it would diminish your faith in anyway an interfaith view islamophobia racism and obama plus fox smear campaign preaches that it and it alone is the true religion
1523752 men never do evil so completely and cheerfully as when they do it from religious conviction
1523753 ok guys guess what we have no more threats you are now safe here are your rights back we will make it illegal to spy on you again no more tapping your phones no more illegal searches no more profiling no more internet spying
1523754 men never do evil so completely and cheerfully as when they do it from religious conviction
1523755 i do not admit that a great wrong has been done to the red indians of america or the black people of australia by the fact that a stronger race a higher grade race has come in and taken its place
1523756 his role in the destruction of the church in nyange parish and the consequent death of approximately 1500 tutsi refugees sheltering inside
1523757 christians not doing it in the name of christianity clause
1523758 pray for them that despise you and say all manner of evil against you
1523759 do unto others as you would have them do unto you
1523760 if someone slaps you on the left cheek turn your right cheek to him also
1523761 if someone takes your cloak give to him your tunic also
1523762 neither reason nor faith should be used for violence unfortunately both of them have been sometimes misused to perpetrate violence in any case these events cannot question either reason or faith

1523766 the current fine spell is providing time for water to flush out of river systems
1523767 but we wont see water levels drop off steeply because the ground is saturated and theres still a lot of surface water that needs to drain off the land it will be a very slow process and rivers will remain high over the next few days at least
1523768 for every element that would be converted to a on average 5 93 bytes are saved
1523769 why electricity is the only alternative fuel that can lead to energy independence
1523770 in short and simple terms we would be plunged into a depression that would make the great depression of the 1930s in which i spent my childhood look like boom times
1523771 industries would fail banks would collapse government revenues would dry up universities would have to close health care even as limited as it now is for roughly 75 million americans would virtually cease in short something like what the south suffered at the end of the civil war would plague the country
1523772 even at todays price as you know 14 airlines have gone out of business while others are hovering on the brink of bankruptcy and most have curtailed service and laid off personnel
1523773 at double or triple todays price none could fly unless nationalized a whole range of other industries would be quickly drawn into the quicksand ironically war would push america into a form of socialist economy
1523774 so the lights are on late in washingtons federal reserve sec and treasury department trying to figure out how socialism your tax dollars and credits can once again bail out these big time gamblers with our money reckless self enriching capitalists get on your knees and thank the rescuing washington socialists for without them you would surely be in chains
1523775 why not post the recent life lessons we have learned
1523776 many of these old time border patrol agents came to be my close friends and mentors
1523777 we would stop into each others office on a daily basis we communicated while on patrol and watched each others back like we were a part of the same agency
1523778 the number of federal employees protecting our border in toole county has increased tenfold
1523779 but the changes that have occurred are not without some negative consequences
1523780 our agency finds itself in direct competition with the federal government when it comes to recruiting qualified staff from the local job pool
1523781 its difficult all over but there are only so many people available in the local community
1523782 i think its fair to say that most of the sheriffs departments are understaffed along the hi line
1523783 if theyve got something happening up on the border at one of the farms or ranches a lot of times it will be the border patrol thats the first responder to that weve got a very good relationship
1523784 realize that local government entities have limited resources and expertise to prepare such grants in relatively short timelines
1523785 matoon is fortunate because she has some grant writing people in her department but some of the other counties dont have that capability
1523786 grant opportunities are welcome but local departments do not have the staffing or expertise to prepare such grants
1523787 its the reason the state searched for additional funding to procure contracted services to prepare the current operation stonegarden application
1523788 as time goes on its my hope that new personal relationships can be forged communications will improve and recruitment will not be as competitive
1523789 staffing shortfalls in our agency have a direct affect on our community at large while the federal officers are protecting the border our deputies are protecting their children and families throughout the county
1523790 my favorite song is im proud to be an american

1523820 theres some bloody dead fish you have to swallow to get into government to do the kinds of things you want to do and you have to balance up what really matters
1523821 lockwood smith has just stated the obvious which is if youre in opposition for a long time and you come into government some things you have to swallow that may not have been your programme in day one but you accept those
1523822 theres no great secret that when youve been in opposition for nine years the government of the day has a programme which is fairly entrenched some of it you obviously change and weve indicated there will be changes in the future to some things but others you keep
1523823 what has happened though is young labour activists in our view have been bugging the conversations of personal conversations at the national party conference and what im challenging helen clark to do today is to come out and say does she condone or condemn this sort of behaviour when she said put the hard hats on did she mean that she was going to run one of the dirtiest campaigns in new zealands political history

1523840 capturing additional municipal sales use tax revenue for goods and materials delivered to nichols hills residents by businesses located out side our city limits continues to be a focus for the risk management department the city will make direct contact with retailers and other vendors that deliver goods into our community but do not appear to be submitting sales use tax to nichols hills most retailers contacted will come into compliance but a small percentage may not be as receptive retailers known to be making deliveries into nichols hills but not submitting the sales tax collected may be audited at the request of the city nichols hills residents want the tax they pay going to support their own police fire and public works departments not to another city citizens can help get the sales tax they pay credited to nichols hills by giving retailers their address as nichols hills not okc when having goods delivered credit cards should also show nichols hills as the city address there is no significant difference between nichols hills tax rate 4 and oklahoma citys 3 875 sales on a 100 item would be 3 87 at the okc rate or 4 00 at the nichols hills rate thats only a 13 cent difference in sales tax paid and your city receives the 4 00 in sales tax revenue

1523844 it seemed to me to be like a product of extreme sexism and i kept thinking to myself god if this was just like kal penn or george clooney or any of the other obama surrogates or supporters there wouldnt be any question about it nobody would even talk about it
1523845 i was merely trying to express my delight at obamas commitment to his campaign in every aspect and his interest and his support in his surrogates and his staff and his fellows and how wonderful and refreshing that is and it was manipulated into such an unfortunate media frenzy of kind of a nonstory
1523846 its just silly because the way people are talking about it youd think it was a bertolucci movie or something

1523852 everyone longs to live a life of meaning and purpose to leave something of real worth behind when were gone all too often we feel that our day to day tasks make no difference in the great scheme of things the truth is exactly the opposite god has given each of us extraordinary power to create beauty and transform the world through our daily work and ordinary actions you have immense potential to develop your god given talents and contribute something that makes a difference in the world be it through construction or counseling doing peoples taxes carefully and ethically or raising and teaching children even if your contribution seems to go unnoticed by others you can rest assured that god sees and values your work 200 pomegranates and an audience of one draws on the story of obscure old testament figure huram of tyre an artist putting the finishing touches on solomons temple he honed his craft and contributed something of beauty and excellence though some of his most detailed and time consuming work was more than thirty feet off the ground where few people would notice its intricacies likewise we have the ability and opportunity to create something of worth be it for the lasting enjoyment of others or for gods eyes only we may not all be artistic in the traditional sense but we are nonetheless creators made in the image of god the creator and endowed with skills and talents that can honor god and impact our world every good mom is an artist molding her children as creations of god every ethical businessperson leaves a legacy of people seeing god through his or her careful work every after school teacher leaves an indelible mark on the young people whose parents are busy just making ends meet you too are an artist equipped with a palette of skills and strengths that can honor god and impact the world in amazing ways where will you make your mark

1524080 we need more jobs and economic development why dont we focus on clean energy and reopening factories and putting people back to work nobody is benefiting from jobs that are leaving the community
1524081 sen obama has said that expanding our nuclear power plants doesnt make sense for america he also says no to nuclear storage and reprocessing i couldnt disagree more i have proposed a plan to build additional nuclear plants that means new jobs and that means new energy if we want to enable the technologies of tomorrow like plug in electric cars we need electricity to plug into
1524082 now nuclear power alone is not enough drilling alone is not enough we need to do all this and more that is why i am calling for an all of the above approach
1524083 cheney met with renewable energy folks once and oil and gas executives 40 times mccain has taken a page out of the cheney playbook
1524084 barack obama is opposed to offshore drilling and is also opposed to admitting that he voted for the same corporate giveaways for big oil that hes campaigning against today
1524085 t boone pickens is about as conservative a guy as there is thats a serious republican oil man driller he says we cant drill our way out of the problem i think he knows more about it than john mccain
1524086 strongly encouraged by sen obamas speech on americas energy future foreign oil is killing our economy and putting our nation at risk
1524087 washingtons broken john mccain knows it were worse off than we were four years ago
1524088 only mccain has taken on big tobacco drug companies fought corruption in both parties

1524090 so many teenagers havent slept in a tent how can we expect them to appreciate nature if they havent experienced it

1524103 generally they will play outside after school for 30 minutes to an hour but they probably spend at least an hour and a half playing video games
1524104 i encourage them to be outside because i want them to be healthy and active
1524105 i think it is important for them to be imaginative and run play ball skate bike or just get moving
1524106 it is developmentally appropriate to have active learning where kids are encouraged to explore
1524107 how can we expect them to appreciate nature if they havent experienced it

1524111 if you leave here and walk home could you walk in an absolutely straight line
1524112 the recount demand is really about trying to express public dissatisfaction with ceo jerry yang and perhaps even more chairman roy bostock for their perceived failure to capitalize on the microsoft opportunity
1524113 this is important particularly because of the lack of transparency in the microsoft negotiations with both sides taking issue with the statements made by the other party
1524114 it must show that the inclusion of the three new board members is more than a symbolic gesture to pacify carl icahn
1524115 public relations has shifted from a traditional print oriented emphasis to that of a multi faceted marketing discipline p r used to mean writing media relations and special events now there are no limits it may be direct mail or a presentation to congress there isnt anything under the marketing umbrella we arent capable of doing we never say thats not our job if its part of the marketing mix its our job
1524116 at this point it seems to be more personal than professional
1524117 this is a case based on drug dealers who want to avoid going to jail
1524118 you have the gambino crime family reaching out to tampa florida
1524119 theyre old crimes but the defense he used the last time that he resigned from the mob doesnt work in this case theres no statute of limitations on murder
1524120 i choose to create more and more of who i truly am right now and so it is
1524121 your purpose is not only to know and experience who you really are but to create who you next will be
1524122 a vehicle pulled in put some piece of paper over their license plate proceeded to gas up she was witnessed doing this by some people who took down the plate number
1524123 every time someone lifts the gas nozzle theres an alert inside the station so we know when anyone is out here pumping we have visual contact all the time and then the cameras are rolling 24 hours a day
1524124 its like anything else you cant take it without paying for it
1524125 we were given no notice whatsoever national grid did send us a letter in the mail stating that if the landlord doesnt take care of the gas and electric by yesterday theyre going to be shutting down all the power
1524126 smoke detectors may not work if the batteries go dead cause the power is out so if a fire happens were screwed
1524127 i feel bad for the people were going to do what we can to get them placed and hopefully in the interim something will happen with phil neuman to get up to date on his utility bills
1524128 it is unfortunate that national grid had to do this we were there to work out the issues we again are saying that according to our records we do not owe them the money that they say that theyre owed and clearly if it was we would have taken care of it
1524129 you could build a building thats net zero energy efficient today but the utility savings are not sufficient to pay back that investment over the life cycle of the building
1524130 the building sector represents 40 of the nations primary energy consumption 72 of electricity and 55 of natural gas exceeding any other sector of the u s economy including transportation and industry
1524131 this study should teach us the grave import of the truth born of tragedy and suffering that the only role for nuclear weapons is for them to be abolished
1524132 the president of the united states elected this november will listen conscientiously to the majority for whom the top priority is human survival
1524133 i today here in hiroshima again pledge that our country will firmly maintain the three antinuclear principles and take the lead in international society to realize the abolition of nuclear weapons and lasting peace
1524134 i join you in commemorating the past and affirm my determination to work with you and all people to achieve a peaceful and secure world without nuclear weapons
1524135 an appropriate point of departure for a paradigm shift toward modeling the world on intercity relationships from military and dominance relationships he said
1524136 to preserve its security and existence trusting in the justice and faith of the peace loving peoples of the world
1524137 i hereby call on the japanese government to fiercely defend our constitution press all governments to adopt the hiroshima nagasaki protocol and play a leading role in the effort to abolish nuclear weapons
1524138 there were some people in the courtroom that were taken aback by it
1524139 those were the only words i heard him utter in the courtroom
1524140 he shook his head in response to questions from the judge some shakes of his appeared to be in the affirmative some of them appeared to be in the negative
1524141 at this point he provided essentially no biographical data about himself before 1993
1524142 in connection with a missing person report back in the early 1990s
1524143 our experience tells us hes more of a schemer than someone who has lost his memory
1524144 he loves his daughter kidnapping doesnt apply it was his own kid
1524145 just because hes reighs natural father it doesnt absolve him
1524146 we know that microbes can exist quite happily in oxidizing conditions
1524147 the story possibly could turn out to be the same for mars we dont know yet

1524150 no one hunting for life would be happy to see it in any sort of abundance

1524158 exactly what you would do if you had a nuclear weapon on a scud or a shahab 3 or other missile and you wanted to explode it over the united states

1524162 if loving you is wrong i dont wanna be right
1524163 mon that was a very brave thing to do its brilliant and unforgettable i loved it
1524164 im still the same player its just based on opportunities and youve just got to make the best of all your opportunities and try to catch everything coming your way
1524165 in san francisco it was more run run play action way down the field more five or seven step drops no three step drops
1524166 here you have three step drops five step drops and then seven step drops there are a lot of the similar routes we used to run in seattle when you are taking seven steps and things like that sometimes you arent getting as many reps you could be open but if pressure comes they have to dump it to the back they have to get rid of it or they have to force a bad pass
1524167 its going to take some time and day by day were going to learn and hes going to get comfortable with me im going to get comfortable with him
1524168 learn where he wants to throw the ball on certain coverages and things like that over time things will get better
1524169 we have some competition amongst the wide receiver positions we have a pecking order right now but it can change very quickly there are a lot of guys competing and it will probably come down to game situations and obviously the remainder of camp
1524170 we have a deep wide receiver corps a lot of experience and everybody wants to make that play theyre just waiting for their number to be called
1524171 im just trying to get that 3 4 stuff out of my system and get acclimated again with the 4 3 scheme its not that bad but ive been dealing with it the more reps you do getting back into the habit of it it becomes natural once again
1524172 probably to cause havoc penetrate the backfield and disrupt plays
1524173 i wasnt here last year but i can feel a sense of urgency with the guys just trying to get better than last year
1524174 he can cause a lot of bad plays for the offense
1524175 the coaches are doing a great job of putting players in the right positions to make plays we should be pretty good on defense this year i cant wait
1524176 the in stadium experience is critically important to the nfl our clubs and our fans and it will be a major focus this season
1524177 we are committed to improving the fan experience in every way we can from the time fans arrive in the parking lot to when they depart the stadium we want everyone to be able to come to our stadiums and enjoy the entire day
1524178 we have a bunch of them we have some free agents looking good some draft choices looking good we are a young football team but we have been pretty impressive thus far but you have to put it together in gameday and game situations i am looking forward to them playing some exhibition games and see how they do when the lights are on
1524179 he has done a good job we have some competition amongst the wide receiver positions we have a pecking order right now but it can change very quickly there are a lot of guys competing and it will probably come down to game situations and obviously the remainder of camp
1524180 it is like all hamstrings it will take a little bit of time to rest but champ recovers pretty quickly it wasnt a bad hamstring so that is good news
1524181 anytime tom sits out of practice it is not just another injury because it is tough to keep him out of practice he is obviously sore but it is healing better according to greek steve antonopulos hopefully it will keep getting better so he can get out there and practice i think he has the experience where he doesnt really need the preseason games and he is working hard in the weight room to make sure his conditioning level stays at a certain point hopefully in the next couple weeks we can get him back and he will be ready for the first regular season game right now the mri is negative so we are not going to do surgery just to do surgery hopefully rest will be enough but we will find out in the next couple of weeks when some of the pain subsides it is very painful like i said if tom is not out there then you know it is quite painful
1524182 he has been doing this for awhile as you know we had 17 ota days and he was very impressive the more reps a quarterback gets the better he feels when we put him in some game situations like we have been doing out here he gets to experience some of this before our preseason games he feels more comfortable with the system and more comfortable with himself he has been doing a good job and hopefully it shows up
1524183 it has been pretty good im adjusting to everything learning the scheme and trying to do what the coaches ask
1524184 it was kind of rough the first couple of days in otas but i have gotten used to it its not too bad
1524185 we have a lot of talent up front the coaches are doing a great job of putting players in the right positions to make plays we should be pretty good on defense this year i cant wait
1524186 i wasnt here last year but i can feel a sense of urgency with the guys just trying to get better than last year
1524187 the coaches i played for last year were great coaches but the coaches here are really putting guys in the right positions to make plays
1524188 i dont do numbers i dont set numbers for myself i just try to come out and help this defense get better and help my team win
1524189 probably to cause havoc penetrate the backfield and disrupt plays
1524190 those guys from what ive seen since ive been here they been working their butts off and getting better each day they have been coming along pretty well
1524191 marcus is a very explosive defensive lineman he can cause a lot of bad plays for the offense he can get in the backfield and disrupt plays and just cause a lot of negative plays
1524192 an outlook or world view involving an unfounded dread and dislike of muslims which results in practices of exclusion and discrimination

1524196 drew on images they associated with islam having inherited these conceptions from the orientalist artistic legacy of the united states as well as from impressions perhaps latent of islam understood from european history
1524197 muslims in the west and elsewhere know that now as has been the case since the era of the european imperialists ruled over most muslims what they think about christians has far fewer consequences than what westerners think about muslims
1524198 if you are skeptical about the notion of islamophobia get a piece of paper and brainstorm

1524202 bookscan records watchmen selling 10 000 copies in one week weve put more than 300 000 copies in print in the last two weeks thats a pretty amazing record for a 21 year old book
1524203 comic shop retailers have used watchmen for the last 20 years to introduce graphic novels to curious new readers and they know it creates repeat buyers
1524204 they sell a copy of watchmen to a consumer curious about all the fuss and that reader returns for a copy of v for vendetta by the same author we believe this book is significantly expanding the readership for graphic novels
1524205 i was lucky to get through it but it made me stronger and i hope wiser i had a lot of demons to fight maybe thats why this character is my favourite role so far

1524209 it wasnt too much excitement when he learned about the sudden safety shortage
1524210 it was like all right heres your chance so go out and get it
1524211 without the pressure im going to go out there and just go through the motions with the pressure its pushing me to be a better player
1524212 the team has welcomed me the coaches are a little bit strict but everything is for the best theyre pushing me and pushing me ultimately ill be better
1524213 im not worried about the other safeties right now im worried about me and my performance
1524214 ive got to get the defense down and come out and play im picking it up
1524215 the tempo the speed youve got all these fast guys out here youve got to move quick im still learning the position
1524216 he played a big part as soon as i got here
1524217 he got on me and was telling me everything what to do and how to do it about the tempo mostly he helps me a lot he teaches me through his experiences
1524218 im not really concerned about the lack of safeties and experience because the guys that we do have i know theyre going to work hard and go out there and compete
1524219 i think ahmad is going to do real good i have faith in him
1524220 will hill is a great kid hes coming in and working hard and i feel like i can trust him too its a very big uphill battle for him coming from high school to college because the transition is so fast i think he will handle it pretty good
1524221 weve got to start with getting two good guys out there
1524222 and then get a third and get a fourth and youd love to have a fifth we obviously lost some numbers weve got to be at least two deep with a spare which ideally id like to get to
1524223 will hill certainly has talent and skill which is what we hoped hed have hell definitely play a role in there for us black had a good spring and im encouraged by what he did we have to make sure we best now how to play him he can do some things fundamentally that are important on defense like tackle hes a good tackler

1524232 estoy totalmente segura porque hay cosas que se con certeza que nunca las escrib yo estoy tranquila porque confi en la corte que es mi juez natural pero me preocupa porque han intentado comprar a miembros de mi unidad legislativa a asesores para que declaren en mi contra he tenido conocimiento de reuniones del alto comisionado con desmovilizados de las farc para fabricar un expediente en mi contra
1524233 it doesnt say anything they are still pretending they are responding
1524234 it doesnt seem to be what we are looking for
1524235 at this point he provided essentially no biographical data about himself before 1993

1524240 unless we have from the north koreans a verification protocol that is robust the kind of protocol that was presented by the five parties to the north koreans then august 11th will come and go and there will be no change in the situation
1524241 i think that will be part of our discussions to reinforce that this is a tough fight
1524242 what should be noted today is whether you violate the federal law today tomorrow or 20 years ago the fbi and its law enforcement partners will pursue the matter to its logical conclusions
1524243 never accused john gotti of drugs or murder never happened
1524244 what you have is a bunch of people in law enforcement who are disgruntled about the fact that he did fight those cases successfully
1524245 know why hes dying hes gonna die because he refused to come in when i called he didnt do nothing else wrong
1524246 has led a life of violence including these three murders

1524251 it is a way for you to plan your return home
1524252 we understand the impact it has on them when we knock on their doors early in the morning and take them out of their homes
1524253 they dont want their children to go through the trauma of being arrested in the morning
1524254 noted by ice as a factor in your immigration records
1524255 for anyone to say no one will do it thats absolutely wrong
1524256 the investigation brings to light egregious violations of virtually every aspect of iowas child labor laws
1524257 it is my recommendation that the attorney generals office prosecute these violations to the fullest extent of the law
1524258 typically when we have child labor issues its an issue of one or two individuals
1524259 from our point of view with this investigation its a large scale violation of the law
1524260 i needed money for my family because i could not help them
1524261 they asked me how old i was and i told them the truth
1524262 my first response is it doesnt surprise me because of all that i have heard
1524263 therefore i am grateful that this was brought to the attention of the proper authority and my hope would be that some sanctions would be taken because i do think that these young children were not treated with respect and they should not have been there in the first place
1524264 this case highlights our increasing vulnerability to the theft of personal information
1524265 cases like these send a clear message to those who might be tempted to abuse our computer networks to steal information and harm law abiding people and businesses
1524266 if you do we will track you down wherever you are in the world we will arrest you and we will send you to jail
1524267 she wanted it really to be kept a secret for a long time

1524279 i never received direction from george tenet or anyone else in my chain of command to fabricate a document as outlined in mr suskinds book
1524280 permission to state the following on his behalf i never received any instruction from then chief ne rob richer or any other officer in my chain of command instructing me to fabricate such a letter further i have no knowledge to the origins of the letter and as to how it circulated in iraq
1524281 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1524282 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammed atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaida something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1524283 the notion that the white house directed anyone to forge a letter from habbush to saddam hussein is absurd
1524284 we know now that those estimates were wrong but they were the estimates we all relied on
1524285 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from cia ever involved in any such effort
1524286 it is well established that at my direction cia resisted efforts by some in the administration to paint a picture of iraqi al qaida connections that went beyond the evidence
1524287 the notion that i would suddenly reverse our stance and have created and planted false evidence that was contrary to our own beliefs is ridiculous
1524288 if they go in the other direction i think theyre probably going to have to start firing people
1524289 george said something like well marine ive got a job for you though you may not like it
1524290 when it was discussed with me i just thought it was incredible a box checking of all outstanding issues in one letter from one guy
1524291 there were many iraqi officials who said both publicly and privately that iraq had no wmd but our foreign intelligence colleagues and we assessed that these individuals were parroting the baath party line and trying to delay any coalition attack
1524292 the particular source that suskind cites offered no evidence to back up his assertion and acted in an evasive and unconvincing manner
1524293 after being told that habbush had said there were no wmd bush was frustrated
1524294 why dont they ask him to give us something we can use to help us make our case
1524295 it seemed to me to be like a product of extreme sexism and i kept thinking to myself god if this was just like kal penn or george clooney or any of the other obama surrogates or supporters there wouldnt be any question about it nobody would even talk about it
1524296 i was merely trying to express my delight at obamas commitment to his campaign in every aspect and his interest and his support in his surrogates and his staff and his fellows and how wonderful and refreshing that is and it was manipulated into such an unfortunate media frenzy of kind of a nonstory
1524297 its just silly because the way people are talking about it youd think it was a bertolucci movie or something
1524298 were just recently very recently engaged so you know were just taking it easy and no big plan yet but its a good time and were just enjoying our time to be young and engaged

1524300 what should be noted today is whether you violate the federal law today tomorrow or 20 years ago the fbi and its law enforcement partners will pursue the matter to its logical conclusions
1524301 never accused john gotti of drugs or murder never happened
1524302 what you have is a bunch of people in law enforcement who are disgruntled about the fact that he did fight those cases successfully

1524308 i wanted to apologise for an inappropriate comment that i made at the dinner
1524309 it was a tasteless remark that i now bitterly regret

1524318 under senator mccains plan the oil companies get billions more we dont pay any less at the pump and we stay in the same cycle of dependence on oil that got us into this crisis
1524319 the oil companies have placed their bet on senator mccain and if he wins they will continue to cash in while our families and our economy suffer and our future is put in jeopardy
1524320 they know theyre lying about what my energy plan is
1524321 instead of running ads about paris hilton and britney spears they should go talk to some energy experts and actually make a difference
1524322 senator obama has said that expanding our nuclear power plants doesnt make sense for america
1524323 if we want to enable the technologies of tomorrow like plug in electric cars we need electricity to plug into
1524324 i believe senator obama has just misunderstood and under appreciated this crisis it is going to need to be dealt with boldly and aggressively
1524325 he is obviously thrashing about trying to grab on to the idea and catch up to the idea for the week it is obviously belated it is obviously haphazard

1524339 the use of a single one size fits all value for the heterosexual infectivity of hiv 1 obscures important differences associated with transmission cofactors perhaps more importantly the particular value of 0001 i e one infection per 1000 contacts between infected and uninfected individuals that is commonly used seems to represent a lower bound as such this value substantially underestimates the infectivity of hiv 1 in many heterosexual contexts heterosexual infectivity can exceed 01 one transmission per 10 contacts for penile vaginal contact or even 03 one transmission per three contacts for penile anal contact claims in both the popular media and the peer reviewed literature that hiv is very difficult to transmit heterosexually are dangerous in any context where the possibility of hiv exposure exists
1524340 improved infectivity estimates especially more detailed estimates that quantify the amplifying effects of biological cofactors will help us to grasp the magnitude of the hiv epidemic accurately communicate the level of risk involved in heterosexual sex and identify the best possible intervention strategies for slowing the epidemics spread
1524341 infectivity studies are very difficult to conduct and that few studies exist as a result many of the studies producing the published estimates suffered from at least one potential bias therefore while our study documents the considerable heterogeneity of the heterosexual infectivity of hiv 1 and provides some explanations for this heterogeneity considerable uncertainty remains

1524365 and the major side effects from statin drugs are liver problems and also statin induced myopathy which is muscle pain and weakness other problems include fatigue and memory problems
1524366 the doctors and the pharmacists are not educated in drug induced nutrient depletion its not talked about
1524367 why arent people told this stuff why isnt your doctor or pharmacist telling you that your drug depletes zinc out of your body its because vitamins arent deemed important unless its very very well known doctors are clueless they think drugs and surgery can solve all of the problems that we have
1524368 ill show them a list of the potential depletion problems of their drug and theyll say oh magnesium depletion can cause muscle cramps and depression
1524369 and theyre reading all of the depletion problems and theyll say oh thats me
1524370 i see it in my practice on a daily basis oh doc im on lipitor or im on vasotec or wellbutrin or vioxx and i dont feel well and we feel that its not all drug induced deficiencies but in part its side effects seem to be related to nutrient deficiencies

1524394 la situaci n aqu est empeorando es incluso peor que la de irak si el gobierno estadounidense env a a m s soldados la violencia aumentar por ejemplo cuando vemos a un grupo de soldados estadounidenses caminando por aqu no nos hace sentir seguros nuestras fuerzas afganas son capaces de proveerle seguridad a afganist n el gobierno estadounidense deber a enfocarse en otras necesidades de los afganos no en las fuerzas armadas

1524397 esta postura significa que no existe ni la m s m nima esperanza de que haya cambios en la pol tica exterior de estados unidos en lo que respecta al conflicto rabe israel y esto significa que estamos ante una nica pol tica estadounidense y el pueblo palestino deber a depender de s mismo y del mundo rabe y musulm n para enfrentar esta pol tica estadounidense que est siendo adoptada tanto por el partido dem crata como por el republicano
1524398 a nadie le gusta la guerra reconozco las tremendas dificultades de afganist n pero tanto a mi pa s como al de ustedes le interesa que la primera misi n de la otan fuera de las fronteras de europa sea un xito debemos hacer esto por el pueblo de afganist n y por nuestra seguridad conjunta estados unidos no puede hacerlo solo

1524426 i wasnt really prepared for training camp so at this point i put myself in the best position to be ready before that instead of trying to go in the middle of training camp
1524427 in my heart i always felt like if you have a desire and youre seeking gods guidance on it then that desire will be honored i feel love for the game and i just see myself still playing
1524428 i think the biggest thing for me is the potential to have an impact its bigger than just going out and playing its more than that its on and off the court hopefully i have some things to share on the court with whoever i play with but more i see the impact a lot of nba guys have with the kids and i think its just a powerful platform

1524449 some people tell us that the movement the translation of certain types of research into commercial projects is still too difficult
1524450 so the question is is there anything we can do to help that be more successful

1524452 we are committed to improving our financial results and believe these proactive steps are necessary to manage through the current challenging environment
1524453 we remain very bullish on our growth prospects as the market for natural and organic products continues to grow and our company continues to evolve
1524454 however the challenging economic environment appears to be negatively impacting our sales
1524455 we would not want us to get into a predicament of getting sued

1524457 it only makes sense that attrition in the two kipp schools would be much higher than attrition in the district overall because students who leave the kipp schools are likely to move to a non kipp sfusd school while mobile students within sfusd still show up in the district statistics
1524458 a lot of kids are dealing with issues far beyond their control moms on drugs pops in the penitentiary and now the grandparents are on drugs
1524459 a lot of kids have very little parenting going on
1524460 they have to change the mind set of students to value education
1524461 right now the way the system is designed how can i say it the kids dont see the value and relevancy of what schools are in place to do for them
1524462 it is time to make the people who are supposed to be paying for school meals really pay for them
1524463 exclusively for the costs of services to children less than 18 years old
1524464 it sounds like paris hilton supports john mccains all of the above approach to americas energy crisis including both alternatives and drilling paris hilton might not be as big a celebrity as barack obama but she obviously has a better energy plan
1524465 everybody just assumed that because this deal was cut nobody was going in cutting a deal with the bad guys is generally not a good idea
1524466 the only limit on our involvement was prime minister malikis rightful concern that the operation was seen by the people of basra to be iraqi led
1524467 these protests have a political undertone they want the referendum to fail you can see they will go to any lengths but on sunday well have a democratic electoral day as we should
1524468 this suspension of the summit was decided due to these acts of violence provocation and intolerance promoted by bands of fascist conservative retrograde groups

1524471 solzhenitsyn was one of the most important people in the history of russia he wrote exactly what he thought and needed to be remembered
1524472 its a shame that not all young people understand how important he is
1524473 the young know he wrote important books about the camps and that he received the nobel prize but thats all we really know hes more important for the older generations
1524474 but recently in politics for russia its not clear what he has done
1524475 we will continue peaceful protests against the economic blockade and harassment of muslims by hindu extremists

1524481 there has been a slight increase in numbers of assaults per year during this period
1524482 it is hard to understand why anyone would assault or threaten ambulance officers when they are there to help
1524483 we do not want heroics from our staff when their safety and welfare is threatened
1524484 they challenge the polices ability as a whole to quickly respond to unfolding incidents and provide safety to the public without having to take overwhelming security precautions
1524485 to that end there can be nothing less than a zero tolerance approach to assaults of this nature
1524486 one of the biggest problems weve got is people crossing the road at night mingling with all of the traffic its dangerous i think closing it off is a good move
1524487 most of us are intolerant of the crime and something had to be done
1524488 its been a real effort to get everyone to this stage we just want to change the environment and behaviours that stop people from enjoying themselves
1524489 its all about making people welcome into hamilton and having a good time

1524493 the business of theology is to make sure that our questions to the scriptures of any religious tradition will be directed in such a way as to allow ourselves to be challenged and even shaken at the deepest levels of our existence by what the text says
1524494 american evangelicals are not exemplary for their thinking and they have not been so for several generations evangelicalism has little intellectual muscle
1524495 by an evangelical life of the mind i mean more the effort to think like a christian to think within a specifically christian framework across the whole spectrum of modern learning including economics and political science literary criticism and imaginative writing historical inquiry and philosophical studies linguistics and the history of science social theory and the arts
1524496 well to be perfectly academically honest we must push the limits of our understanding
1524497 in one baffling comment the report states for 20 of the parents to have made attendance area schools their first choice seems to the jury to be a strong endorsement for the idea of neighborhood schools

1524565 the one thing is if people arent producing out here on the field and executing things theyre being taught in the meetings or if situations come up and things arent happening fast enough then its anyones position no position is etched in granite it could be a one day thing it could be a two day thing who knows how long it could be its in terms of what we see on the field and what people are doing

1524583 we expect msft to cut its lowest priced sku to 199 its mid priced sku to 299 and its high end sku to 399 if we are correct it would position the xbox 360s low end sku as the lowest priced next gen console below nintendos wii for the 1st time its high end sku would be price comparable to sonys new 399 ps3 sku
1524584 when msft cut prices on the xbox 360 in aug 07 total unit sales increased 35 that month vs its prior 7 month average in the u s acc to npd though the release of madden nfl 08 in the same month likely had impact overall consoles have seen an average unit increase of 53 in the month of after a price cut
1524585 we believe any cut from msft aims to slow sonys momentum before first party ps3 releases in 2h08 such as littlebigplanet resistance 2 socom and others msft has a decent slate w gears of war 2 as well as short lived exclusivity for rock band 2 in late sept sony is unlikely to cut in response though in the unlikely event that ps3 sales significantly slow sony might have to reassess

1524628 o jogo perigoso fica este oba oba mas para n s jogadores isto n o existe temos que manter nossa postura de marca o forte e colocar qualidade quando tivermos a bola nos p s
1524629 esta hist ria de favorito para n s n o existe ali dentro que se decide
1524630 a gente tem conseguido jogar no limite e espero que siga assim o gr mio est em um bom momento e temos um grupo forte mas quando algum jogador sentir temos atletas de qualidade para suprir qualquer aus ncia
1524631 eu estava conversando com o andrade auxiliar t cnico e lembrando que essa n o foi a primeira nem a ltima vez que passamos por um momento de dificuldade e com uni o que vamos superar mais esse momento dif cil

1524634 o objetivo o t tulo claro que pensamos na libertadores tamb m um objetivo mas desde o come o o nosso foco o titulo e trabalhamos forte pensando nisso
1524635 n o estamos tranq ilos mas mais confiante estar entre os quatro um objetivo alcan ado manter o mais dif cil j vamos ter um confronto direto contra o vit ria depois vem botafogo coritiba internacional
1524636 o objetivo vencer o vit ria independente se terminar o turno na lideran a ou n o vencer e depois esperar o que vai acontece

1524640 i am very keen that there will be rules to ensure access for individuals with vision loss to all of the technology systems present and future that people use in their everyday lives
1524641 things like cellphones atm machines computer systems anything where there is an on screen display should be designed in a manner that would permit its use by an individual with limited eyesight
1524642 we believe any animal that can be trained to perform tasks directly relating to an individuals disability they are service animals

1524645 n o h um calend rio mais injusto que o que imposto s sele es

1524650 n o foi favoritismo n o acho que jogamos mal mesmo quem est nisso h sete anos uma equipe que resiste a sete anos de press o que chegou com favoritismo em 2004 esse time n o pode ser rotulado de n o suportar esse peso
1524651 seria injusto falar que sou favorito ou que outro favorito vai ser luta por luta e cada uma vou encarar como uma final como se aquele fosse meu principal advers rio
1524652 eles querem ganhar da gente querem bater o campe o mundial isso um combust vel extra todos os dias eu vejo isso como uma coisa positiva para mim
1524653 o trabalho de prepara o foi bem feito as jogadoras est o animadas e sabendo que chegou a hora de entrar com tudo para a arrancada para o t tulo chegou a hora da verdade
1524654 elas jogam em duas linhas de quatro sendo que a que fica atr s n o sai de forma nenhuma para o jogo na segunda todas ficam atr s da bola com duas jogadoras na frente principalmente a brigit prinz que foi eleita pela fifa como a segunda melhor jogadora do mundo
1524655 o time precisa estar bem montado taticamente mas quem faz a diferen a no futebol s o as jogadoras com a sua t cnica com a capacidade de improvisar e decidir e isso n s temos na sele o esse pode ser um grande trunfo
1524656 acho que temos caracter sticas parecidas sim o nilmar um jogador t cnico e eu n o fujo muito disso temos praticamente a mesma estatura o que diferencia que ele tem alguns anos de profiss o e eu estou no segundo ano espero chegar no n vel dele
1524657 vai ser mais um jogo dif cil certamente truncado os times do sul marcam muito t m uma marca o muito forte e uma obedi ncia t tica muito grande vai ser um jogo dif cil mas o fato de jogar em casa com o torcedor apoiando tem que fazer a diferen a

1524702 e chiaro che chi usa internet per le chiacchiere con gli amici in gruppi chiusi come quelli che si formano con la messaggistica tra buddies non sono editori ed chiaro che le aziende che fanno un business editoriale devono essere considerati editori a tutto tondo anche per le loro attivit online i blog secondo me non dovrebbero essere obbligati a trasformarsi in aziende editoriali come non dovrebbero esserlo quelli che partecipano a costruire wikipedia ma questo non significa che non abbiano obblighi e doveri oltre che diritti
1524703 secondo me osserva oggi de biase nel suo blog le persone che pubblicano online e lasciano che quello che scrivono sia letto da chiunque non dovrebbero essere considerati necessariamente editori ma non dovrebbero considerarsi totalmente irresponsabili per quello che scrivono secondo me lidea che una persona scriva online mettendoci la sua faccia parte integrante della credibilit dei blog e se lo fa assurdo che chi lo fa non se ne assuma la responsabilit aggiungo anche se questo meno certo dal punto di vista giuridico che dovrebbe sentirsi responsabile anche di ci che si scrive nei commenti ai suoi post perch i commenti sono parte del blog ed il blogger lunico a poter eliminare quelli che contengono elementi di illegalit penso conclude de biase che linfluenza dei blog crescer anche in relazione al senso di responsabilit che i blogger coltiveranno nei confronti di quello che avviene sui loro blog e che non occorra la legge sulleditoria per sostenere questa ipotesi

1524718 sapientia deriva da assaporare serve altro commento che non sia mettere in moto il pensiero il ragionamento critico come sapore delle cose
1524719 il perfettismo tendenzialmente riduce la morale a politica limperfettismo riduce la politica a morale
1524720 il giusnaturalismo perfettistico in quanto creda di aver messo certi diritti ma non erano sempre gli stessi al riparo di ogni possibile confutazione derivandoli direttamente dalla natura delluomo
1524721 gli utilitaristi tengono conto delle utilit di tutti gli individui ma non esitano a sacrificare le utilit di alcuni a profitto di quelle degli altri lindividualismo degli utilitaristi che sono perfettisti finisce presto
1524722 la tradizione non deve fossilizzare il vecchio ma formare un insieme di valori e di regole di condotta ampiamente seguite che per lo pi non sono una scelta deliberata di mezzi per fini specifici bens una selezione nel corso della quale i gruppi di maggior successo sostituiscono gli altri o sono imitati dagli altri spesso senza sapere a che debbono la loro superiorit f hayek the error of constructivism ai progetti rigidi di lungo periodo si sostituirebbe una sperimentazione flessibile che non assicurerebbe lottimo ma daltra parte ridurrebbe il rischio delle peggiori catastrofi imputabili alluomo
1524723 minacciato di degenerare nel nichilismo nulla vero nulla falso tutto relativo tutto tutto tutto nulla limperfettista popperiano crede nellesistenza di assoluti il vero il perfetto per non vuole illudersi che siano mai raggiungibili n che raggiunti per caso siano riconoscibili e accertabili
1524724 continua tuttora a farci discutere e forse sempre lo far anche perch nessuno di noi mediante lintrospezione o in altro modo sembra in grado di accertare se decidiamo come vogliamo o come vogliono innumerevoli cause ambientali e cause interne al nostro cervello nessuno sa davvero se avremmo potuto scegliere diversamente da come abbiamo scelto
1524725 well except for the fact that i must have internet explorer to watch windows media encoded arsenal preseason matches firefox wont cut it
1524726 but he will remain throughout the run of the series an executive producer and he will whenever cbs asks come back i dont think youve seen the last of gil grissom
1524727 im in a great place in terms of knowing that ill be more free to make choices and im responsible enough to not do it in a way that would hurt the show
1524728 i want it to work for the writers i want it to work for the cast and most importantly i want it to work for the audience
1524729 this will be a year of transition for the show
1524730 we always knew it was coming and im glad it didnt come until now
1524731 theres never going to be another william petersen and there will never be another jorja fox
1524732 but we are not out to just replace those actors were out to add new characters to the show and the show will change as a result but thats a good thing
1524733 as a man as a scientist as a teacher as a middle aged person who has been very successful at what hes done he wonders whats the point
1524734 its all of a sudden becoming more difficult for him to do his job
1524735 what had been a sort of fun job for him to do because he loved the solving of the riddle has become ever more taxing and difficult
1524736 i wouldnt want to say exactly what were going do i want people to watch certainly
1524737 but sara is involved its often darkest just before the dawn
1524738 my biggest problem with leaving the show at any point isnt leaving grissom im an actor its time to do other things
1524739 the hard part will be saying goodbye to the cast and crew so im going to stay as involved as im allowed to be throughout the remainder of this show until they turn off all the lights
1524740 im not saying what hes doing there overnight let me tell you itll be by far the most provocative lady heather episode weve ever done
1524741 if a story line creatively needs grissom then hes totally willing to come back and do it
1524742 this will be the most intimate that we have seen them
1524743 grissom will go to bed at lady heathers whether he will go to bed
1524744 we thought that if we ever lost warrick this was the way he would go warricks a local guy the only family he had was grissom and the team so this was not a guy who was going to leave las vegas or csi we knew where we were going with warrick long before gary went to the coachella music festival and that it would be truly classic battle to the death i think you will see that undersheriff mckeen will be one of the most worthy adversaries that the team has ever gone up against because he is so smart because he is so trained and he can think of all the angles
1524745 the premiere is the last time you will probably see our entire cast together our original cast and that means sara sidle as well
1524746 i was so excited to see it and heaths performance was ace as usual d i hope he does get an oscar for it x
1524747 a musician a songwriter a published author an award winning actor and presenter an illustrator a teacher the 2005 radio personality of the year a highly reccommended emcee and speaker and a handful of other talents that have barely scratched the surface
1524748 i hate the world because i have a small penis and was picked last for kickball during recess

1524754 while the temporary tax credit is certainly a positive for buyers who purchase a home before july 2009 the tax credit does not offset the elimination of the down payment assistance program which our industry so vitally needs
1524755 the end of dpa will probably pressure industry sales in the near term but over time our buyers and the market will adjust
1524756 we continue to believe that a return to more normal qualification standards is a very good thing long term even if it carries with it a little short term pain
1524757 our intention is to really put more value at that price point and offer some amazing proposition to companies
1524758 we expect to hold the price point and add more and more value at that price point
1524759 we want to have commercial relationships with lots of companies and it matters more that we have that than exactly how much dollar per user were getting
1524760 we can certainly hold that price point we can continue to put more capabilities there the cost of an additional application to us is tiny its hardly material there are certainly types of applications that we could add that would add cost and we would price appropriately but i dont expect the price to climb that wouldnt be my expectation
1524761 id like all the holes in the feature set to be filled but ill say generally were not in the model of trying to replicate the products that work really well for what they do

1524765 for example most insurance policies will state that they do not provide cover for working whether paid or voluntary

1524875 the masks they wore were specially designed by and issued to them by the united states olympic committee the u s o c s lead exercise physiologist randy wilber had advised u s olympians to wear the masks on the plane and as soon as they stepped foot in beijing
1524876 this is really a surprise because i didnt think it was going to be such a big deal
1524877 why we wore the masks is simple pollution when you train your whole life for something dot all your is and cross all your ts why wouldnt you be better safe than sorry

1524885 the hpv vaccination programme is not about being sexually active its not encouraging young people to be sexually active
1524886 it is a preventative vaccine so that when certain young people become sexually active and perhaps have more than one partner then its a way of acting as protection against cervical cancer
1524887 it does not mean that women do not go ahead and have cervical smears it just means its an extra form of protection

1524890 situaciones que se dan en simult neo con el denominador com n que es el desabastecimiento y que representan acciones de boicot
1524891 los grupos especializados de su futuro gobierno se est n reuniendo para eso
1524892 ejecuci n compulsiva de los recursos del estado en ciertos ministerios
1524893 las evidencias nos llevan a pensar que todas las ejecuciones presupuestarias pretenden un vaciamiento de los recursos de ciertas instituciones claves a fin de despojar al gobierno que asumir el 15 de agosto de una cobertura m nima para las acciones previstas
1524894 os eua por exemplo s o campe es da fraude acad mica com compra de t tulos universit rios at pela internet a su cia tem um ndice significativo de falsos doutores e na fran a e na it lia n o s o excepcionais casos de desvios em processos de constru o e manuten o escolar
1524895 essas tr s medidas s o o que chamamos do tri ngulo virtuoso do combate corrup o com regras claras e que sejam de conhecimento de todos os atores do processo educacional administradores capacitados para lidar com n meros e auditorias e que estejam submetidos ao controle e a san o dos governos e uma sociedade civil informada e fortalecida para fiscalizar conseguimos minimizar bastante o dano que a corrup o causa nos sistemas educacionais
1524896 precisamos pensar na educa o como parte de um projeto nacional de desenvolvimento neste sentido uma lei de responsabilidade educacional vem para garantir a execu o desse projeto e assegurar que as pol ticas p blicas tenham continuidade estando assim certificada a aprendizagem dos alunos
1524897 a san o para os maus gestores deveria ser a inelegibilidade ou seja aqueles que n o souberem cuidar dos recursos da educa o n o poderiam mais ser eleitos durante um per odo de quatro a oito anos
1524898 hoje investimos cerca de nove vezes menos que os eua sete vezes menos que a uni o europ ia e a metade dos vizinhos como a argentina disponibilizam para a educa o
1524899 a inten o da lei n o seria a de fazer uma ca a as bruxas na educa o brasileira mas sim criar mecanismos de responsabiliza o dos gestores que garantam a continuidade das pol ticas e a boa aplica o dos recursos mas para definir esses mecanismos ainda precisamos de muita discuss o

1524922 my philosophy is that its best to build a company with a view towards long term sustainable growth rather than with a view towards being bought i guess its true that the best way to sell your company is not to try
1524923 its easy to spend months analyzing a potential business idea trying to decide if there is a market whether there are potential competitors whether its even something people want but honestly youll never know until you just put something out there and in the process of building and releasing a product you will learn a lot
1524924 very few entrepreneurs can predict in advance what products and features will become popular and the majority of successful businesses today probably look very different to the original idea plan release something as quickly as you can listen to your users and iterate quickly

1524927 the report finds that although the major supermarket chains coles and woolworths do compete on price that competition is not as vigorous as it could be
1524928 the greatest savings will come to those who engage with the initiatives unit pricing will help consumers make significant savings if they use it to pursue the best value between brands and supermarkets
1524929 anyone who thinks grocery prices will be reduced after this inquiry mustnt understand the complexity of the retail market placing restrictions and additional compliance requirements on the retail market will only increase costs for retailers
1524930 these sites were almost empty of avatars so despite these really creative and innovative applications of virtual capabilities when i was there it appeared they were unable to attract second life residents
1524931 we will be looking at other things like wind and solar if that works here but this looked like a very economical type of renewable for us to get involved in and keep our rates as low as possible
1524932 to develop facilities to generate electricity from renewable energy sources
1524933 to purchase such renewable energy and associated renewable energy credits for resale to mppas members
1524934 one of the attractive things about this is its probably going to be very close to competitive
1524935 we think it may be slightly higher but given how much market prices have been increasing it might actually end up being a better deal nobody has a crystal ball on this but we think itll be the best deal we can get

1524941 the iraqi government now has tens of billions of dollars at its disposal to fund large scale reconstruction projects
1524942 it is inexcusable for u s taxpayers to continue to foot the bill for projects the iraqis are fully capable of funding themselves
1524943 it is time for the sovereign government of iraq using its revenues expenditures and surpluses to fully assume the responsibility to provide essential services and improve the quality of life for the iraqi people
1524944 first the relative shortage of trained budgetary procurement and other staff with the necessary technical skills as a factor limiting the iraqi governments ability to plan and execute its capital spending
1524945 third violence and sectarian strife remain major obstacles to developing iraqi government capacity
1524946 this substantial increase in revenues offers the iraqi government the potential to better finance its own security and economic needs

1524952 in addition suggestions that siddiqui has been in u s custody for five years are not accurate she was detained on july 17 2008 as alleged in the criminal complaint
1524953 obviously she was arrested in 2003 but we dont know at what stage she was handed over to the americans
1524954 it is a little ironic that while the government is trying to prove the military commissions process is legitimate in the hamdan trial that the next person they arrest immediately goes into the federal court system
1524955 in some ways using a criminal approach has become easier

1524977 it was the kind of thing where the cia said look this is not our charge were not here to carry forth a political mandate which is clearly what this was to solve a political problem in america and it was a cause of great grievance inside of the agency
1524978 one of the greatest lies in modern american political history

1524981 bush wanted to go to war in iraq from the very first days he was in office nothing was going to stop that
1524982 and a lot of people at the end of the day said it was hard for him to prove the negative that what he said was no weapons were actually not there thats hard to do
1524983 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammed atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operation link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade
1524984 a handwritten letter with habbushs name on it would be fashioned by cia and then hand carried by a cia agent to baghdad for dissemination

1525039 i believe that hirschfelds devotion to line comes from yet a more fundamental aesthetic his respect for absolute simplicity
1525040 any good cartoonist frustrated with the business aspect of the whole comic strip business can create his or her own alternate distribution system its not the syndicates job to make sure you get exposure that is yours
1525041 not generating the revenues that traditional newspaper sales provide but many of us believe they will eventually
1525042 never seen comic strips readership at such a high level if you include both newspaper and internet readership
1525043 if its a positive and we have requests we will certainly look to expand it

1525045 we have businesses here that do business around the world we want our kids to be competitive
1525046 i want our fans out there to know that we dont have a depth chart here
1525047 so anybody here in the media who writes about a depth chart and really kind of disrespects some of our players based on their depth chart is really not being very professional we dont really have a depth chart ive tried to tell you guys that
1525048 we have guys that work in groups for administrative reasons
1525049 what we are concerned about is technically getting done what we need to do to become a better football team to have the focus intensity and the mental energy to give the kind of effort to stay focused on what you need to do to do your job

1525054 without the support of the americans we would not have accomplished the mission because the british forces had done nothing there
1525055 i do not trust the british forces they did not want to lose any soldiers for the mission

1525057 a coalition force would make a pact with essentially their enemy and promise not to go into their area so as not to get attacked
1525058 maliki and the americans felt the british were morally impugned by the deal they had reached with the militia the british were accused of trying to find the line of least resistance in dealing with the shia militia
1525059 you can accuse the americans of many things such as hamfistedness but you cant accuse them of not addressing a situation when it arises while we had a strategy of evasion the americans just went in and addressed the problem

1525099 we have always had grave reservations about criminal offences other than very minor infringements being dealt with out of court

1525121 the preliminary testing thus far is showing that it is not a substance of concern
1525122 it was supposed to contain screws which it did but it also contained a note and an unknown substance
1525123 it was a very simple note and from what i heard it wasn t even that rational

1525132 in the persian gulf region the presence of american forces along with british and french units has become a semipermanent fact of life though the immediate mission of those forces is to enforce the no fly zones over northern and southern iraq they represent the long term commitment of the united states and its major allies to a region of vital importance indeed the united states has for decades sought to play a more permanent role in gulf regional security while the unresolved conflict with iraq provides the immediate justification the need for a substantial american force presence in the gulf transcends the issue of the regime of saddam hussein

1525204 although we clearly face more challenging macro economic conditions in fiscal 2009 were well positioned to deliver continued if somewhat less robust growth
1525205 our balance sheet is strong we have solid operating momentum in many of our key businesses and most importantly our assets are diversified both geographically and along business lines enabling us to better respond to the economic challenges we may face this year
1525206 an intentional hidden message or feature in an object such as a movie book cd dvd computer program or video game
1525207 umm think ive cut off the end of my thumb yeah
1525208 please please please take me back things will be different the next time
1525209 hello overnight glad you could make it sorry about the old cloak and dagger act
1525210 how long have you been with us now since you transferred to the office of national interaction three years isnt it
1525211 very funny but can you explain time itself the concept of time i mean
1525212 well one answer would be its what stops everything from happening at once
1525213 cute but i was hoping for something a bit more scientific involving magnetic fields or something
1525214 how time flies i can barely imagine the special randomness directorate without you coffee
1525215 well while theyre getting that ill make a start sorry if im teaching your grandmother to suck cocks from the beginning whats the driving force of a knowledge based economy
1525216 creativity without creativity london is sunk so the government asks itself what creates creativity
1525217 ok try this imagine i hit a cue ball six inches across a snooker table theres nothing to stop me walking around to the other side holding the cue in the opposite direction and hitting the white exactly six inches back across the table where it came from right a snooker ball can travel across the table one way as good as it can the other theres nothing to stop it going backwards as well as forwards
1525218 not education no most european countries have better education systems than the uk but so far londons done ok it turns out creativity comes not from education but from interaction throwing people and ideas together random noise
1525219 look at america a nation of immigrants complete melting pot la and ny the most result the worlds largest economy japan they make everyone live on top of each other scram them all together dropping the mean separation increases the number of interactions basic physics
1525220 so whats londons secret well some built in advantages spaghetti streets with mis numbered houses chaotic local government haphazard public transport dodgy post a thousand splintered tribes bumping grinding cross fertilising inventing
1525221 but we cant rest on our laurels india and china are coming up on the rails and fast and how are they doing it utter fucking random chaos thats how did you know that last year there were more misprints in the taipei phonebook than there were correct entries in londons
1525222 if were going to compete creatively in future we need to raise our game we need to manufacture randomness or something close to it
1525223 yes i mean no theoretically it can but in practice it doesnt i suppose its not entirely rational
1525224 its not entirely rational i grant you but it works and thats where we come in
1525225 as you know in essence the mission of the special randomness directorate is to out random the oppostion hush hush obviously wouldnt work if people knew we operate behind the scenes looking for patterns then destroying them creating new ones
1525226 srd are the random makers whole call centres deliberately dialling wrong numbers and leaving cryptic messages made to look like pure chance but actually designed to create connections between people who wouldnt otherwise meet
1525227 putting the spanish man in touch with the czech lady who accidentally texts the russian man who triggers a moscow coup attempt et cetera
1525228 or just calling in the middle of the night breathing into your answerphone and hanging up thats us
1525229 i mean its like this as i said if i hit the white ball a little way i can easily go round the other side of the table and hit it back
1525230 but what if i hit the white ball into a red so both balls move could i go round the table hit the red back into the white so they both end up exactly where they started
1525231 weve rooms full of people scribbling phone numbers on banknotes swapping the postcodes of temping agencies for those of escort agencies jumbling the bookings for restaurants in w1 our operatives sabotage street lights so they keep switching on and off until
1525232 um yeah but itd be harder youd need to get the power and the angle just right
1525233 right now weve got iodide planes making clouds look like dragons covert agents out scrambling train timetables making sure only undeserving people win the lottery growing root vegetables in genitalia shaped moulds then leaving them round supermarkets
1525234 exactly its possible but it would take a few goes to get it right now imagine what if i hit the white ball harder into maybe two reds so they all bounced off the cushions how would i hit the balls to get them all back to their starting positions
1525235 nowadays were doing more and more online stuff not just the old spam from random names which arent random at all of course social networking has massive potential the churn rate were achieving in peoples personal relationships is amazing more than anyone would have believed even five years ago
1525236 pretty much impossible youd need a team of people all with cues hitting all the balls at exactly the right moment
1525237 aha not impossible just very very unlikely scale it up what if there were a thousand balls on the table all whizzing around and smacking into each other whatd be my chances of hitting the balls back to the way they were just five seconds before essentially zero
1525238 because of us london has the edge were why other european cities are so clean so tidy but so dull its like the way animals propagate seeds london is a cherry ripe for eating we make sure we spit the pip as far as we can and no one even knows we exist
1525239 which brings us to you overnight your background in information warfare marked you out as a suitable candidate srds work is about creating not destroying nnonetheless ive already been impressed with your work so far
1525240 scale it further think when they put the blackcurrant in your snakebite at the intrepid fox
1525241 yeah now at first the shot of blackcurrant sits there in a purple puddle in the middle of the lager then the barman stirs it three times clockwise mixing it from a concentrated purple to a pink spread evenly throughout the glass
1525242 lets see leaving numbered biros about the place false wikinews entries
1525243 i especially liked the way you crashed the glastonbury ticket servers so no one could meet up with their friends and had to make new ones quite the artist and i see the mysterious graffiti youve been leaving round the city has already started to pay off
1525244 whats to stop him then stirring it three times counter clockwise drawing the pink colour back together into the purple and reversing the mixing
1525245 so chase cutting et cetera i wanted to be the one to break the news we want to offer you a promotion entropy fund manager backdated to february 29th theres just one concern
1525246 im afraid one of your recent reports contained an omaly the opposite of an anomaly something that looked deliberate a series of encounters between yourself and a certain young woman engineered to appear random when in fact they were anything but
1525247 nothing except the enormous probabilities against it its like a trillion trillion red and white balls bouncing off each other in a giant bucket and thats why time only goes in one direction processes like that dont go backwards its not impossible just vanishingly improbable
1525248 you know youre not allowed to aim for specific outcomes firstly its unprofessional secondly its against regulations and third as you of all people should be bloody aware it simply wont work as soon as you apply deliberate intent youre adding human intelligence to the mix you only end up subtracting randomness not increasing it so play the game
1525249 so what youre saying is mixing is one way and something that burns stays burnt
1525250 no one wants the boys from coincidence audit sniffing around least of all me so no more freelancing
1525251 ill lay it on the line if you ever try to engineer contact with her again your license to random will be revoked youll be expelled from the directorate and returned to life as a civilian trapped forever in a plain ordered world of cause and effect i know how much youd hate that and i dont want to lose a talented operator
1525252 so whats it to be overnight up or out choose wisely i hope your decision is easy
1525253 right then id best get emailing the nice people at typepad to tell them to cancel my account and never let me re open it because im a talentless hack who shouldnt be distracting people from this stuff which is really bloody good
1525254 one more biscuit for breakfast and that would have been gone

1525266 california deserves more from its legislators than pursuing flawed legislation
1525267 caregivers are not well served by court battles and legal fees rather they would have been far better off if state officials worked together with our industry to raise awareness about video game ratings and the parental controls available on all new game consoles both of which help ensure that the games children play are parent approved
1525268 it is unfortunate that the state is stubbornly pursuing an appeal that is likely to lead to even more court awarded fees
1525269 well im certain insert universitys presidents name here would not like that you didnt waive

1525272 looking to the future new directions in hiv aids research
1525273 we should not be paying for iraqi projects while iraqi oil revenues continue to pile up in the bank including outrageous profits from 4 a gallon gas prices in the u s
1525274 we should require that u s taxpayers be reimbursed for the cost of large projects
1525275 despite iraq earning billions of dollars in oil revenue in the past five years u s taxpayer money has been the overwhelming source of iraq reconstruction funds
1525276 it is time for the sovereign government of iraq using its revenues expenditures and surpluses to fully assume the responsibility to provide essential services and improve the quality of life for the iraqi people
1525277 the report shows iraqs budget surplus is likely to grow significantly over the course of 2008 but it is equally important to realize that spending in iraq is also increasing
1525278 were dealing with a country that can really finance its own reconstruction and relatively soon
1525279 is going to make a lot of american families very angry
1525280 the record gas prices they are paying have turned into an economic windfall for iraq but the iraqi government isnt spending the money on rebuilding
1525281 the train has left the station whatever analogy you want he needs to jump on the train and lets go or if we cant get past things that have happened i have to keep the train moving
1525282 the players they want it resolved even talk to brett about it he feels bad about it its time for them to talk about somebody else
1525283 mike and i both agreed last night that me being out there is a distraction and will continue to be a distraction we all know the reason im here is because the commissioner reinstated me so we have a lot of things to figure out its simple and complicated both at the same time
1525284 the problem is that theres been a lot of damage done and i cant forget it
1525285 and listening to him talk about that you respect his opinion and frankly i told him i said ill take responsibility because i have a voice in the building i never thought he truly was going to play i thought he was emotionally driven for other reasons
1525286 he has a lot going through his head and i think hes emotional
1525287 and just talking to him hes in a tough spot
1525288 thats not a good feeling but i dont view it that way
1525289 i can only trust the truth ive been part of a lot of conversations and i dont feel thats the case
1525290 i just know we were out at practice today and he wasnt there and im the starter
1525291 everything went kind of sour a few weeks or a month back but you never felt like it would get to the point or to the talks of him actually being traded
1525292 i felt once he stepped back in here he would be the quarterback him not being here today i guess management has a different route so at that point weve got to go out and do our job
1525293 the new organization capabilities in vmware lab manager 3 will help us better enforce role based access rights to system configurations in the lab according to our it policy says tony anastasio technology architect for cerner the leading u
1525294 we have development teams working on trading gateways for virtually every major futures exchange around the world

1525296 what we have seen over the past few days has been a mix of improper disclosures of partial information mixed with inaccurate information and then drawn into unfounded conclusions none of that serves the victims their families or the public
1525297 always moves aggressively to get to the bottom of the facts but that does not include mistreatment of anybody and i dont know of any case where thats happened
1525298 that doesnt mean that from time to time people dont make mistakes
1525299 the fbi had asked everybody to sign these nondisclosure things
1525300 i think im the only person at usamriid who didnt get polygraphed
1525301 one person said hed sit at his desk and weep
1525302 im pleased the residents agreed with the township board and repealed the prohibition this was an important issue for the future of the blue star corridor
1525303 were excited it passed because itll open up more opportunities for us for the people who really love our facility and want to have alcohol on a limited budget now they can have a cash bar
1525304 smoking hot its ac dc like we love them loud anthemic and hard
1525305 were not aware of any time when this number of feet have been found in our waters
1525306 in my mind this foot is part of the same story
1525307 if someone released a bunch of drifting feet in the strait of georgia some would go to the pacific and then some would come in the strait of juan de fuca and be found where this foot was found
1525308 because the feet have running shoes on them and running shoes consist of a spongy sole that contains air it makes the foot float
1525309 athletic shoes are very buoyant and tend to float with their soles even with the water so they would protect the flesh
1525310 if all body parts were equally protected youd expect to find heads and arms and hands so it may be that the shoes are preferentially choosing the feet to be found
1525311 but we stress that there were no tool marks on the feet
1525312 im happy to report weve had no such phenomenon on the east coast particularly in massachusetts
1525313 weve had nothing involving feet but we sometimes have severed limbs show up in bags and so forth on a beach
1525314 in fact one time we had a body with no arms no legs and no head but that was 30 years ago
1525315 itd be like flipping a coin six times and having it come up heads five of the six times
1525316 i am in conversations with two of the businesses but i cant relate that yet
1525317 we are hoping other businesses step forward our strategy is if everyone gives a little bit we accomplish great things
1525318 when they got close she hid her head behind the lifesaver like a little kid who hides behind a curtain and doesnt realize his toes are sticking out
1525319 this is a problem up and down the coast particularly on docks
1525320 she was so busy snapping pictures she forgot to bring the ladder up
1525321 hed just turn his nose up to the sun and just look at us like im here so what it was just the darndest thing
1525322 ive never seen anything so preposterous and ive been sailing for years and years
1525323 we respect the pm and appreciate his sincere initiative as well as his gesture to build new bridges with the indo canadian community
1525324 we do not want to cause any embarrassment to our good leader the right honorable stephen harper i hope you take our recommendation very seriously
1525325 and we will work with you to highlight this fact in the community
1525326 im not into politics i dont understand why they did this in our e mails though we were very clear
1525327 for their own reasons have chosen to make controversy out of this which is unfortunate
1525328 we felt it would be most appropriate for this expression to be made in a venue where the broader community could participate which is what the prime minster did
1525329 this was a single incident that affected about 350 non canadians of some 90 years ago were mindful that each of these are different and unique historical experiences
1525330 the one who said ow when hit with a marshmallow that her sister threw at her
1525331 i started counting and got up to 200 then somebody started playing a ukelele outside and i got distracted
1525332 oh thats nice but i would never have the patience for that
1525333 this is big sky country baby go big or go home
1525334 that lady would like me to do something so ill take a nap
1525335 i really dont know what were doing here lets go over there and sit by that tree by ourselves like we usually do
1525336 the subject of this report is the black footed ferret in this report i will be telling you about the black footed ferret
1525337 hey you on the cello do you realize this bag is named after you you need one
1525338 how did i not see davy crockett sleeping bag coming here
1525339 um personal things sewing like a recipe card apron and stuff you know
1525340 possibly the most surprising thing about the day was the discovery that i enjoyed housework
1525341 so for the rest of the day i cleaned my kitchen out every cupboard every shelf even pan was scoured every piece of china washed the curtains went into a tub to soak and the mats went into the sunshine
1525342 by the time i was feeling really tired and most things were back in place it looked quite different
1525343 tomorrow i thought the town and my shopping list bank food telephone the rest of the cleaning could wait till i expected company with an odd lifting of the spirits i realized that i did not need company i had never been so happy in my life
1525344 i showered and dressed in black spandex shorts and an oversized khaki t shirt
1525345 do you know what i mean did you have a book like that
1525346 well what kind of bike helmet are you going to get
1525347 well fine ill just wear a regular chicago bears football helmet then
1525348 whats with that crazy lady and the kid in the helmet
1525349 handmade sweaters and rag dolls and bolts of calico and liberty scarves
1525350 i am an arm chair traveler i love to travel in my imagination
1525351 yet the biggest change since 1973 is that we actually import more oil as a percentage and gas prices have gone up and exxon mobile profits have gone up why is that well it doesnt help when you put my cousin dick cheney in charge of energy policy
1525352 you know everybody has a black sheep in the family

1525360 apresentar sociedade uma s rie de medidas que v o fortalec lo expandi lo e qualific lo
1525361 so far as we know this is the single largest and most complex identity theft case ever charged in this country
1525362 it highlights the efforts of the justice department to fight this pernicious crime and shows that with the cooperation of our law enforcement partners around the world we can identify charge and apprehend even the most sophisticated international computer hackers
1525363 while technology has made our lives much easier it has also created new vulnerabilities
1525364 this case clearly shows how strokes on a keyboard with a criminal purpose can have costly results
1525365 they used sophisticated computer hacking techniques breaching security systems and installing programs that gathered enormous quantities of personal financial data which they then allegedly sold to others or used themselves
1525366 and in total they caused widespread loses by banks retailers and consumers
1525367 computer hacking and identity theft pose serious risks to our commercial personal and financial security
1525368 hackers who reach into our country from abroad will find no refuge from the reach of u s criminal justice
1525369 but the disease thrives on shame and shame thrives on silence and ive been silent long enough
1525370 if you could describe me in one word what would it be
1525371 according to the definition outlined in the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders dsm iv bipolar i disorder considered the most severe form of this mental illness is
1525372 this is legal what we just did is totally legal there isnt anything the police could do to get us for salvia
1525373 i need to go drop some shit off at value village
1525374 weve always had it in our cul de sac and i decided that this year is no different
1525375 we just knew this was an event that we had to have
1525376 typical national night out burgers and dogs and everyone getting together and having fun
1525377 just we dont have our houses to hang out in
1525378 ai perheenlis yst meille ei meille ole lapsia tulossa ai teille mit kaksoset
1525379 i can hardly name an area where choice is needed more
1525380 its no big secret that the client side of the it environment is one of the last bastions of proprietary technology disproportionately dominated by one vendor
1525381 we have long believed that helping to bring openness and choice to the client desktop is one of the next things to explode in this whole march for linux
1525382 the problem is for most organizations the time is not yet right for linux on the desktop
1525383 windows is not a huge cost when you get it on a new pc and the annual cost to get a supported version of linux with seven years of security fix support could end up costing you more than youre paying for windows windows has at least 10 years of security support and its free
1525384 and that does not even address access database apps or excel macros which may not run on linux or which may require significant migration costs of their own
1525385 for a greenfield environment with no windows apps linux is a viable choice as is apple mac
1525386 but for the typical environments windows apps are too pervasive and entrenched for a switch to make economic sense
1525387 a repeatable combination of core products services and unique knowledge that improves the economic performance and delivers ongoing value
1525388 i have loved being a part of the id family
1525389 as i move on to the next exciting stage of my professional life i leave knowing i am supported by such a wonderful group of colleagues and friends
1525390 buon pomeriggio cleo veniamo al dunque ho una riunione con i professori pi tardi
1525391 vorrei farle una proposta sono state settimane dure per noi nella scuola e marco pi di tutti ne ha pagato le conseguenze le pressioni su di lui sono state eccessive e ingiuste e visto il buon esito della volta scorsa avevo pensato che potremmo regalare uno stage di una settimana alle piccole colet e violet sa una ama ballare e laltra cantare hanno aiutato marco lo hanno fatto sorridere come non succedeva da troppo tempo ormai e potrebbe essere una ventata di freschezza per tutta la scuola visto il clima pesante che stiamo respirando
1525392 va bene per ti devi occupare di tutto faccio preparare la lettera da inviare ai genitori e i pass per le piccole mi raccomando cleo niente guai
1525393 ragazze preparatevi ad una settimana intensa tu violet che ami cantare trascorrerai tutto il tempo in sala prove con marco il saggio di fine stage prevede alcuni duetti con lui tu invece colet che ami ballare preparerai con la celentano le coreografie per accompagnare marco e tua sorella nelle esibizioni canore avrai un partner di tutto rispetto e ho visto in anteprima i passi sono speciali
1525394 la situazione ci sta scivolando di mano i nostri ragazzi sono furibondi la proposta di cleopatra non mi piaciuta per nulla senza contare che quel molliccio del preside lha pure avvallata
1525395 secondo me non stata una cattiva idea sar divertente vedere jurman linflessibile alle prese con due bamboccette

1525404 the city produced an athlete in the first modern olympiad of 1896
1525405 he was here he spoke to the team i had an opportunity to speak with him very impressed with him

1525410 everyone who uses his brain knows that socialism is a way out of the worldwide depression
1525411 it would at least ensure our getting enough to eat even if it deprived us of everything else indeed from one point of view socialism is such an elementary common sense that i am sometimes amazed that it has not established itself already
1525412 the average thinking person nowadays is merely not a socialist he is actively hostile to socialism socialism has about it something inherently distasteful something that drives away the very people who ought to be flocking it its support
1525413 is either a youthful snob bolshevik who in five years time will quite probably have made a wealthy marriage and been converted to roman catholicism or still more typically a prim little man with a white collar job usually a secret teetotaler and often with vegetarian leanings with a social position he has no intention of forfeiting one sometimes gets the impression that the mere words socialism and communism draw towards them with magnetic force every fruit juice drinker nudist sandal wearer sex maniac quaker nature cure quack pacifist and feminist in england
1525414 the perennial struggle of democratic contenders to appeal to ordinary americans seems very much of a piece with orwells sharp descriptions
1525415 clintons obvious tastes for earthly pleasures from big macs to more intimate diversions
1525416 if i had another face do you think id wear this one
1525417 mr president i made a bet i can get more than two words out of you
1525418 madame you are ugly in the morning i shall be sober

1525420 i promise gambling reforms to allow a casino on the reservation
1525421 i promise more social reforms and job opportunities for native americans
1525422 its not as if i have a live monkey which might jump at people mine is a battery operated interactive toy and the best i have ever had he says things like i want a banana and even once offered to tell me the sum of pi squared
1525423 i want something that goes from 0 to 200 in 4 seconds or less and my birthday is coming up you could surprise me
1525424 whats the last thing that goes through a flies mind when he hits a windscreen its arse
1525425 i think of my razor as a really high quality knife
1525426 its generally about as sharp as a knife can get
1525427 the choice was between a straight razor and a safety razor
1525428 how long did it take you to get the hang of it
1525429 it took about three weeks to stop cutting myself at least once every shave
1525430 strop your razor a dozen times first on the canvas side and then on the leather side i usually skip the canvas side unless my razor isnt honed enough shaving is best after a shower you want your face to be as wet as possible so dont use a towel soak your brush more on brushes below in hot water and then swirl it on your bar of soap for ten or so seconds now whip your brush in a bowl that contains a small amount of water whip for 30 to 90 seconds to create a lather apply lather to your face always shave first in a downward motion with the hair growth the chin and upper lip are the hardest parts after one pass downward you can re lather and shave perpendicular to the hair growth or shave against the hair growth two or three passes are generally required to get a close shave one with the grain one perpendicular and one against i generally only do two passes one with the grain one against after shaving splash warm water on your face to remove all of the soap residue then splash cold water on your face to close your pores then pat dry never wipe dry or youll dry out your skin too much you can then apply a facial lotion if you want
1525431 my bar of shaving soap which cost ninety nine cents at wal mart will probably last for dozens and dozens of shaves
1525432 i still shave about as much as i used to but if i go for several days and my facial hair gets long the razor has no problems cutting through it
1525433 but if i have an extra fifteen minutes its certainly more fun to use a straight razor
1525434 badger smells like wet dog for the first ten times
1525435 holy crap my boobs have already shot up a cup size
1525436 wow me too are you baptist church of god or baptist church of the lord
1525437 me too are you original baptist church of god or are you reformed baptist church of god

1525439 please god save my only grandson i beg of you bring him back
1525440 my name is emil cohen im 78 years old believe it or not im currently involved with a 28 year old girl and also on the side her 19 year old sister we engage in all manner of pleasure and in my entire life ive never felt better
1525441 i think youve come to the wrong place why are you telling me
1525442 bless me father for i have sinned and you know my attorney mr cohen
1525443 i have no choice but to excommunicate you for six months
1525444 saul go to the blackjack table and put it down all on one hand
1525445 im not in heaven im a bear in yellowstone park
1525446 look at the preacher he should be punished for what he is doing
1525447 begging your pardon but i thought you were going to punish him
1525448 why are you buying cat food when you hate cats so much
1525449 well if god gives you a cat ill let you keep it
1525450 i watched my child go out in the yard get on her knees and ask god for a cat and really pastor you wont believe this but i saw it with my own eyes a kitten suddenly came flying out of the blue sky with its paws spread out and landed right in front of her
1525451 in light of the unanimity of this panel and the strong language in the holding it is hard to imagine that mr capano will receive relief from the rehearing or the u s supreme court
1525452 im a terribly under developed and only half believable character
1525453 our intention is to really put more value at that price point and offer some amazing proposition to companies
1525454 we expect to hold the price point and add more and more value at that price point
1525455 we want to have commercial relationships with lots of companies and it matters more that we have that than exactly how much dollar per user were getting
1525456 we can certainly hold that price point we can continue to put more capabilities there the cost of an additional application to us is tiny its hardly material there are certainly types of applications that we could add that would add cost and we would price appropriately but i dont expect the price to climb that wouldnt be my expectation
1525457 id like all the holes in the feature set to be filled but ill say generally were not in the model of trying to replicate the products that work really well for what they do
1525458 real and imagined power to affect systems actions or events
1525459 i have to believe that a better informed world is more civilised more compassionate more ready to act and to help
1525460 it is incredible a less than a year old hippo has adopted a male tortoise about a century old and the tortoise seems to be very happy with being a mother
1525461 after it was swept away and lost its mother the hippo was traumatized it had to look for something to be a surrogate mother fortunately it landed on the tortoise and established a strong bond they swim eat and sleep together
1525462 the hippo follows the tortoise exactly the way it followed its mother if somebody approaches the tortoise the hippo becomes aggressive as if protecting its biological mother
1525463 the hippo is a young baby he was left at a very tender age and by nature hippos are social animals that like to stay with their mothers for four years
1525464 let us make man in our image according to our likeness let them have dominion over the fish of the sea over the birds of the air and over the cattle over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth
1525465 one hopes that this case is going to bring more attention to the issue of the disappeared
1525466 are unlikely to engage in judicial activism that would embarrass the army or intelligence
1525467 just as kevin took a bite of his hot dog his friend peter made a goofy face and it cracked kevin up
1525468 there are no cars in that spot why cant i park there
1525469 the air now is the best in at least 10 years
1525470 could it be possible that such measures would last longer or even be permanent
1525471 not only do foreign athletes need fresher air we need that too
1525472 most of these measures are long term ones and will remain after the games not all the temporary measures will be retained after the games but they may provide clues for our future work
1525473 beijing has made a lot of effort but these are temporary measures
1525474 this time the olympics have helped to identify the problems and the source of the bad polluters now i think we shouldnt let that go
1525475 were talking about the quality of life and the health of tens of millions of people its more important than the games
1525476 i want to be someone an injured marine can talk to
1525477 and i can tell them times will be rough and not always easy as an amputee but you can still make great things out of an unfortunate situation thats what i want to do
1525478 he didnt just choose to come he fought to come
1525479 we bled and sweated with this guy in iraq and he wants to be with us more than anything thats awesome
1525480 i can do stuff on a snowboard i dont think any other amputee can do
1525481 ill always have some pain and discomfort and ive accepted that
1525482 nobody wants me to be a liability and i dont want to be a liability
1525483 he doesnt want to be treated any different than any other marine everybody respects him for wanting to come back after all he gave

1525485 despite concerns of deterioration in its core market cisco reiterated its long term growth guidance giving jittery investors some comfort
1525486 a lot of people were worried that the number would have to come down
1525487 if anything it gives people confidence that off this low q1 number they are anticipating a sequential rise
1525488 while it is very difficult to predict when we may see a stronger spending environment by our customers and return to our 12 percent to 17 percent long term growth objectives our best estimate is that the current economic challenges remain with us for the next few quarters
1525489 during each economic slowdown cisco has always navigated through them very effectively gained wallet share and in my opinion market share
1525490 suppose a woman comes in and orders a hundred dollars worth of material you wrap it up and you give it to her she pays you with a 100 bill but as she goes out the door you realize shes given you two 100 bills now heres where the ethics come in should you or should you not tell your partner
1525491 well i guess that leaves more bleeping french toast for me
1525492 the change change change phrase as some advisers call it was coined by mr clinton after he told campaign officials that the old strategy of running like an incumbent front runner was not enough advisors said

1525509 hey harry have you ever suspected your wife of leading a double life
1525510 my first wife divorced me and my second wife wont
1525511 thats excellent in that case were getting down to business
1525512 u s presidential candidate barack obama talks about 16 months that we think would be the right timeframe for a withdrawal with the possibility of slight changes
1525513 the americans have found it difficult to agree on a concrete timetable for the exit because it seems like an admission of defeat to them but it isnt
1525514 that any pull out is based on continuing progress on the ground
1525515 its speculation its a mathematical model and may be the figures can change a bit but people who is needing treatment needs it now we are missing the opportunity of saving lives and reducing the transmission
1525516 most of our patients we initiate on antiretroviral therapy are very sick and some have close to death
1525517 sucessful treatment makes them excellent advocates for both treatment and prevention they would not want themselves or anyone else to be where they have been

1525524 expressive visual or physical conduct of a sexual or gender motivated nature
1525525 unreasonably interfering with an individuals work educational performance or status
1525526 under the language of temples policy a student who sets out to interfere with another students work educational performance or status would be subject to sanctions regardless of whether these motives and actions had their intended effect
1525527 t he policy punishes not only speech that actually causes disruption but also speech that merely intends to do so by its terms it covers speech which has the purpose or effect of interfering with educational performance or creating a hostile environment this ignores a previous decisions requirement that a school must reasonably believe that speech will cause actual material disruption before prohibiting it
1525528 t he policys use of hostile offensive and gender motivated is on its face sufficiently broad and subjective that they could conceivably be applied to cover any speech of a gender motivated nature the content of which offends someone

1525533 sixty two per cent of the people in need are on treatment in the region the highest proportion of any developing country
1525534 latin american and the caribbean are also suffering of the consequences of the hiv aids epidemic in the context of poverty and marginality
1525535 the source of some of the most dynamic responses to aids but also home to the greatest challenges
1525536 in the area of security cooperation the u s president and the iraqi prime minister agreed that improving conditions should allow for the agreements now under negotiation to include a general time horizon for meeting aspirational goals
1525537 the further reduction of u s combat forces from iraq
1525538 will this time horizon have a date even if its just a goal for when us combat troops will be out and the iraqi military would have control of their own security
1525539 this right now doesnt speak to timelines or timetables based on my understanding of where we are
1525540 well i think it sends a signal that there is one that eventually we do want to bring our troops back and that uh with where we are conditions are improving in iraq certainly when i was there week before last that was indicative and if those conditions continue to improve we would be in a position to start to bring our troops home
1525541 a non specific time scope to meet the goal of our goals
1525542 wait a minute chris the president has been saying exactly that all along i dont know what the headline is
1525543 there has been no attempt to try to link saddam to september 11
1525544 aids 2008 is taking place at an unique moment in the epidemic when there is widespread consensus on the urgency of ensuring access to hiv prevention treatment care and support by 2010 said pedro cahn co president of the aids 2008 and president of the international aids society in a press release
1525545 most countries still have a long way to go to meet the goal they set two years ago at the united nations general assembly the goal to scale up towards universal access to hiv prevention treatment care and support by 2010
1525546 stigma and discrimination around aids remain as strong as ever and in this context i join my voice with the secretary general and i call on all the countries to drop restrictions on entry to people simply because they are living with hiv
1525547 the aids movement has had a global impact on the health
1525548 there is an urgent need for programs for prevention treatment care and surveillance among msm
1525549 the nice thing of this conference is that it mixes everyone scientists leaders of community people infected with hiv etc etc
1525550 if we fix the price too low for the drugs given for treating hiv aids the pharmaceutical companies will have no interest in funding the development of new drugs
1525551 to promote scientific excellence and inquiry encourages individual and collective action and dialogue and fosters accountability
1525552 aids 2008 will provide a forum in which key scientific and practice based research best practice lessons learned and gaps in knowledge are addressed
1525553 know the miseries of women in her community first hand
1525554 muslim women are some of the worst victims of domestic violence and marital abuse
1525555 often women are never allowed to tell their side of the story
1525556 because of widespread illiteracy women are simply not aware of the rights that islam has provided them with
1525557 divorce for instance is a long drawn out process yet the practice of triple talaq where men can divorce their wives by pronouncing talaq at one go has ruined the lives of many women who have been left by their husbands sometimes for the flimsiest of reasons like putting extra salt in the food

1525617 permission to state the following on his behalf i never received any instruction from then chief ne rob richer or any other officer in my chain of command instructing me to fabricate such a letter further i have no knowledge to the origins of the letter and as to how it circulated in iraq
1525618 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1525619 it said that 9 11 ringleader had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaida something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1525620 the notion that the white house directed anyone to forge a letter from habbush to is absurd
1525621 we know now that those estimates were wrong but they were the estimates we all relied on
1525622 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from cia ever involved in any such effort
1525623 it is well established that at my direction cia resisted efforts by some in the administration to paint a picture of iraqi al qaida connections that went beyond the evidence
1525624 the notion that i would suddenly reverse our stance and have created and planted false evidence that was contrary to our own beliefs is ridiculous
1525625 if they go in the other direction i think theyre probably going to have to start firing people

1525629 the particular source that suskind cites offered no evidence to back up his assertion and acted in an evasive and unconvincing manner
1525630 after being told that habbush had said there were no wmd bush was frustrated
1525631 why dont they ask him to give us something we can use to help us make our case

1525855 in what is an all but unprecedented event gold has soared almost 50 straight up in the immediate aftermath of an fomc meeting at which the fed did what almost everybody expected them to do precisely nothing
1525856 but it was not the feds lack of action that galvanized financial markets it was the amazingly fatuous reasons they gave for their decision not to decide in the official press release then the stress really did make itself felt gold woke up with a vengeance in short everything that mr bernanke and crew have been desperately seeking to avoid for months blew up in their faces at once the signal could not have been clearer and it was heeded the fed is helpless
1525857 this is worse than any recession weve had since world war ii broad 75 said in an interview yesterday
1525858 signs of bubble like conditions are growing and increasing the odds of a major crack in oil prices
1525859 the students are developing great knowledge of recycling and being really mindful of what they could be sending into landfill

1525862 there are a number of things about this institution that to be honest with you make it unattractive to a potential purchaser
1525863 i either stop eating or stop using anything i can
1525864 never bet on the end of the world because it s only going to happen once and how are you going to collect
1525865 things are going to get worse before they get better
1525866 the market is still kind of in this downward trend here in the short term and is having troubling turning back up
1525867 at the moment a bottom for the housing market is not visible
1525868 stemming the decline in the u s housing market is necessary for market stabilization as this would help both households and financial institutions to recover
1525869 the metal may struggle to gain significantly until either oil or the dollar can provide support
1525870 however with fresh sizable writedowns being posted by the large investment banks we expect investors to remain cautious and risk averse as a result which should draw more safe haven investment demand from longer term players
1525871 the u s is on the brink of a mass crisis of surviving
1525872 the u s is on the track of drastic and painful changes
1525873 at first they have to learn to live within their means
1525874 we can in the future reach the moment when we will be able to stop discussing only the issues the u s side is interested in
1525875 we are not enemies with the u s and unfortunately we are still not friends but we are depending on each other less and less
1525876 if they did i think we should stand strong and indicate that is something that crosses a threshold crosses a red line for the united states of america

1525882 if you look at some of the big investment houses in the region their appetite for chinese is high
1525883 what you are going to see is a capital moving eastward from the middle east
1525884 while these increases have not for the most part been passed on at the retail level it is inevitable that they will be at some point
1525885 car dealers and other retailers cannot continue to absorb rising costs at the wholesale level and not pass some of these increases on to consumers
1525886 housing prices have already fallen 15 percent and they need to fall 10 percent more this bill isnt going to change that equation
1525887 all financials will make new lows not because of this weeks inflated rally but because we have not factored in the interplay of lower home prices a slower economy and we dont have proper marks on assets in our investment banks
1525888 hes the oldest celebrity in a world like super old is he ready to lead
1525889 im paris hilton and i approved this message and i think its totally hot
1525890 it sounds like paris hilton supports john mccain s all of the above approach to americas energy crisis including both alternatives and drilling paris hilton might not be as big a celebrity as barack obama but she obviously has a better energy plan
1525891 a complete waste of the money john mccains contributors have donated to his campaign
1525892 it is a complete waste of the countrys time and attention at the very moment when millions of people are losing their homes and their jobs

1525894 a smattering of house republicans are engaging in stunts on the house floor in a transparent political effort to manufacture headlines
1525895 for six years republicans controlled every branch of government and did nothing while america became more dependent on foreign sources of oil
1525896 democrats today are pro actively offering short term solutions to high costs at the pump as well as a long term strategy to break our dependence on foreign oil its a shame republicans are more interested in playing games than enacting real solutions
1525897 if you love wealth more than liberty the tranquility of servitude better than the animating contest of freedom depart from us in peace we ask not your counsel nor your arms crouch down and lick the hand that feeds you may your chains rest lightly upon you and may posterity forget that you were our countrymen
1525898 until u s leadership turns its attention and resources to the afghan theater and the region it will continue to play defense against a strengthening enemy

1525900 el gremio de ate hizo solicitud de pedido de audiencia que se le concedi y no se trasladaron a ushuaia por cuestiones clim ticos entonces se suspendi la audiencia y de ah hasta ac no me preguntes que pas por que un d a vinimos y estaban tocando con bombos y la gente sorprendida de lo que hab a pasado por lo que hoy vinimos
1525901 si pensaron que entrando a los gritos menospreci ndome y maltratandome como lo hicieron iban a lograr algo no me conocen en realidad no fue un duro choque entre quien le habla y el gremio es el lenguaje en que habla el gremio y le contestamos en el mismo tono eso fue todo los muchachos de ate tienen por rigor un lenguaje duro se caracterizan por eso a lo mejor lo hacen a modo de amedrentamiento y se equivocaron de persona
1525902 hay una audiencia pactada para el d a 11 de agosto y ayer la contestamos por despacho del gremio en r o grande
1525903 nos reunimos con el personal por que no entend amos bien si ya estaba pactada la reuni n con el gremio que hac a ac dentro el gremio generando un conflicto que no existe
1525904 hasta que llegamos el personal del ipra estaba trabajando y no acatando una medida de fuerza yo creo que esta medida no tiene el consenso del personal
1525905 creo que lo que les ocurri que cuando ellos llegaron nosotros est bamos reunidos con el personal y eso no les gust
1525906 ac hay una acci n pol tica que es muy concreta y no se trata de defender a los trabajadores por que as no se defiende a los trabajadores
1525907 si pero la gente de ate tambi n dice que no los recibimos y tenemos a los empleados de rehenes y la gente de ate es as miente miente que algo quedar
1525908 our economy has demonstrated remarkable resilience president bush said at a morning news conference even as he acknowledged that growth had been slower than we would have liked
1525909 intensified the surge in energy costs has also trimmed consumer and business spending hurting growth and making it less likely policy makers will boost interest rates to stem even bigger price increases
1525910 a 9 fall in the price of oil in the afternoon saw widespread profit taking
1525911 oil fell as worries about the u s economy heightened concerns about oil demand
1525912 in short our plan is not a plan to survive it is a plan to win
1525913 there is little public policy makers can or should do to compensate for untenable financial decisions
1525914 considering several options including extending the duration of our facilities for primary dealers beyond year end
1525915 demonstrate our resolve and might against enemies who in recent weeks have threatened iran with harsh language
1525916 chinas economic performance clearly is no flash in the pan
1525917 its growth this decade has averaged more than 10 percent a year and is still going strong in the first half of 2008 because its success in recent decades has not been export led but driven by domestic demand its rapid growth can continue well into the 21st century unfettered by world market limitation
1525918 they definitely came up weaker than our expectations and weve been pretty bearish on our outlook for retail for some time
1525919 in the market in general there have been a lot of store closings
1525920 oil and some other commodities are down on the back of the dollar said mike wittner head of oil research at societe generale in london
1525921 also general pessimism about the economy has caused the market to refocus on the demand outlook bush drops opposition to housing bill
1525922 additional powers to manage the resolution or wind down of large nondepository financial institutions such as larger hedge funds so as to limit the impact of a failure on the broader financial system
1525923 the tools to intervene to mitigate systemic risk in advance of a crisis
1525924 we thought it was important to focus on customers who have relationships with the bank and in geographies where wachovia has branches
1525925 based on that weve decided to discontinue doing business through our wholesale mortgage channel as of july 25
1525926 given continued home price declines managements higher loss estimates recent ratings agency downgrades on the companys mortgage backed securities and the companys decision to stop new mortgage originations we do not believe that there is any value left for common shareholders
1525927 the overall decline in contract signings suggests we are not out of the woods by any means
1525928 there is a significant chance probably better than 50 percent that the proposed new treasury authority would not be used before it expired at the end of december 2009 the nonpartisan agency which provides economic and budget analysis for lawmakers said in a report today
1525929 the demands of the housing downturn and will likely approve this week his request to help the government sponsored enterprises cut the government sponsored behemoths down to size and let the market take care of them
1525930 central to the speed with which we emerge from this housing correction
1525931 we will be taking price increases on the vast majority of the protein products in this calendar year
1525932 price increases vary a lot by type of products but the increases will be as low as zero and some products we will decrease on and other increases will be in excess of 20 per cent
1525933 im quite confident that we will get the sort of program we need this week to deal with this situation
1525934 let me say that ive been gratified by the support in congress
1525935 unemployment rates took the largest jump in over twenty years home prices declined at the fastest rate in decades and consumer confidence is at one of its all time low points measures to avoid the worst recession in 30 years
1525936 regularly refers to us as an empire opposes our initiatives in the americas and seeks out our adversaries as friends and allies assistant u s secretary for western hemisphere affairs thomas shannon said july 17 in testimony to a congressional committee
1525937 we will work with russia to deepen strategic coordination and upgrade the partnership to new heights
1525938 we have met with the others and worked together on what the elements of the verification protocol should be
1525939 verification is essential and we really shouldnt think of the declaration without verification so we are working on that and we hope to make some progress on that very soon
1525940 i think that until they give up their nuclear weapons programs completely and verifiably i think that we keep them in the same category
1525941 irans a different story theyre missing an opportunity for a very generous incentives package and that additional sanctions could be on the way
1525942 that this will become law and become law very soon senator christopher dodd a connecticut democrat who is chairman of the senate banking committee expects a vote on the measure next week
1525943 with increased upside risks to inflation and inflation expectations members believed that the next change in the stance of policy could well be an increase in the funds rate
1525944 indeed one member thought that policy should be firmed at this meeting however in the view of most members the outlook for both economic activity and price pressures remained very uncertain and thus the timing and magnitude of future policy actions was quite unclear
1525945 we have two oilmen in the white house the logical follow up from that is 3 a gallon gasoline it is no accident it is a cause and effect a cause and effect
1525946 they dont necessarily pay penalties but the penalty is that they have fewer retirement savings
1525947 the first us shot at iran would set the united states vital interests in the world on fire
1525948 tel aviv and the us fleet in the persian gulf would be the targets that would be set on fire in irans crushing response
1525949 oh freddie mac looks like well have to increase the money supply again paw
1525950 too big for the federal government to allow to fail
1525951 mitigate the spillover effects of a failure such as risks to the payments system problems stemming from depositor illiquidity and a substantial reduction in credit availability
1525952 if it is wished that my relation to the bank should be continued it may be well to send me the usual retainers
1525953 i dont think we get strengthening in the housing market until late 2011 or 2012
1525954 i think were somewhere between halfway and two thirds of the way through the correction
1525955 this just means much less credit availability for mortgage borrowers said paul colonna who manages more than 100 billion as chief investment officer for fixed income at ge asset management in stamford connecticut
1525956 they were teed up to be saviors of the mortgage crisis but now theyve got their own capital issues us housing woes deepen
1525957 i think the epicenter of the whole thing has been and continues to be housing prices
1525958 were going to be in a period of slow growth for a while
1525959 i think its going to be months that were working our way through this period
1525960 we are in the strongest possible position to demonstrate that if iran does not act then it is time to go back to that sanctions track
1525961 iran has a clear choice to make suspend its nuclear program and accept our offer of negotiations or face growing isolation and the collective response not just of one nation but of all nations around the world
1525962 its for 40 days around 150 000 to 200 000 bpd
1525963 a few other oil fields have also been discovered and the public will be informed soon
1525964 the economy has continued to expand but at a subdued pace
1525965 advanced at a modest pace so far this year generally holding up somewhat better than might have been expected given the array of forces weighing on household finances and attitudes
1525966 seems likely to move temporarily higher in the near term
1525967 those who are trenched in more risky business who are feeling more heavy losses may be at more risk
1525968 those who are trenched in more risky business who are feeling more heavy losses may be at more risk
1525969 in short our plan is not a plan to survive it is a plan to win
1525970 oil prices will go higher for different reasons that everyone knows but one of the reasons is the threat of military attacks on our nuclear program
1525971 the market took the dollar weaker on the back of the bad news coming out of the financial markets said win thin a currency strategist at brown brothers harriman amp co
1525972 the problem with writing off 1 trillion from the finance industrys cumulative balance sheet is that if not matched by capital raising it necessitates a sale of assets a reduction in lending or both that in turn begins to affect economic growth
1525973 most areas of the country are seeing at least some increase in foreclosure activity
1525974 forty eight of 50 states and 95 out of the nations 100 largest metro areas experienced year over year increases in foreclosure activity
1525975 rising foreclosures are putting downward pressure on prices increasing the possibility that homeowners will go upside down on their mortgages
1525976 that will cause more losses in mortgage portfolios and less willingness from investors to securitize mortgages and therefore fewer mortgages
1525977 washington mutual this week reported a 3 3 billion second quarter loss and increased loan loss provisions 69 percent to 5 9 billion as borrowers fell behind on their mortgages daimlers gotthe shakes
1525978 overall economic conditions have not improved and we had to reassess our performance
1525979 optiver traders amassed large trading positions then conducted trades in such a way to bully and hammer the markets
1525980 these charges go to the heart of the cftcs core mission of detecting and rooting out illegal manipulation of the markets
1525981 demand in western europe has deteriorated sharply and there are no signs of recovery in the remainder of the year
1525982 managing a simultaneous increase in costs and a slowdown in demand will be extremely challenging
1525983 i have taken upward of 25 phone calls a day from creditors
1525984 when you have 25 people grinding on you day after day it takes a toll
1525985 reforms in the oversight of these firms must recognize the distinctive features of investment banking bernanke said today in remarks prepared for testimony before the house financial services committee
1525986 to induce a migration of risk taking activities to less regulated or off shore institutions
1525987 we really cannot replace irans production its not feasible to replace it
1525988 however bullion remains fairly well supported near the 920 and 930 marks at the moment as participants factor in a small ecb rate hike and little in the way of a fed response to inflationary pressures in the near term
1525989 people are looking for any source of funds to pay their daily expenses
1525990 its a sign of the overall condition of the economy that people are having trouble making their payments
1525991 now youre lucky if you can get a quote good for 15 days
1525992 were going to continue to see declines for the rest of the year
1525993 investors are selling gold against the crude said frank mcghee the head dealer at integrated brokerage services llc in chicago
1525994 youve taken away the oil inflation premium were ultimately blaming the short term moves on oil because its impacting everything wall street shrinks from competing with fannie mae freddie mac
1525995 kicks herself every day for not using a fannie mae or freddie mac mortgage when she refinanced her terre haute indiana home three years ago
1525996 it got drunk and now its got a hangover the question is how long will it sober up and not try to do all these fancy financial instruments
1525997 elevated or increasing price pressures during june and july amid slower economic growth
1525998 a weakening or softening in their economies and consumer spending was
1525999 im very optimistic that were going to get what we need from congress paulson said on the cbs news
1526000 we would like to see san diego become a foreclosure sanctuary
1526001 supports our notion that the fed is firmly stuck on the horns
1526002 there are going to be builders who argue that the lender forced me into insolvency by not acting in good faith
1526003 things are a little different this time because of the economy
1526004 i think that shows that people are somewhat leery of short maturities which have been pretty soft over the last week
1526005 but if the government undertakes to control and to raise wages and cannot do it if the government undertakes to care for all who may be in want and cannot do it if the government undertakes to support all unemployed workers and cannot do it if the government undertakes to lend interest free money to all borrowers and cannot do it if
1526006 the iran premium has come into the market over the last two days said adam sieminski deutsche banks chief energy economist in washington
1526007 nothing has changed except the perception about whether there will be a deal between the u s and iran the possibility of a conflict is of tremendous concern to the market
1526008 if the market growth remains at the same level in the second half of the year sales in russia will exceed sales in germany
1526009 they do have a depth of capital and they should be able to continue paying claims
1526010 i feel horrible that ive lost my own money and that so many people who saw the skills i have and trusted in us have now been hurt
1526011 i dont think the iranians are too confused either about the capability and the power of the united states to do exactly that
1526012 we aim not only to make the financial system better able to withstand future shocks but also to mitigate moral hazard and the problem of too big to fail by reducing the range of circumstances in which systemic stability concerns might prompt government intervention
1526013 but you should really wonder whether you want peoples ability to pay for housing and college dependent on the motives of people in washington
1526014 you have to look at companies with the greatest exposure to the highest risk assets which include construction loans and exotic mortgages
1526015 the final nail in the coffin for any depository institution would be a funding crisis where it is unable to gather deposits at reasonable cost or wholesale funding markets are cut off
1526016 if they ever got into financial difficulty it would be highly likely that the federal government would step in to honor their obligations
1526017 we have been producing gold since last december and one of the mines that started production has a reserve of 13 million ounces of gold
1526018 once this mine is fully operational it wont be only one of the biggest in africa but rather one of the biggest worldwide
1526019 the consequences are horrendous with the dollar no longer the sole currency with which to trade oil its credibility as the benchmark has weakened gravely and thrown all world currencies into a tailspin
1526020 iran has already noted that israel will pay a direct price for such an attack
1526021 is that when one side initiates such an operation in the middle east it will not be possible to control the repercussions which could influence the region for many years afterwards
1526022 bushs administration seeks war it does not act in accordance with our logic and with that of most european states and the nations of the world
1526023 today our primary focus is supporting fannie mae and freddie mac in their current form as they carry out their important mission paulson said in a statement in washington
1526024 there are any number of reasons for people to be concerned about the world and investors are responding by purchasing large amounts of gold and silver
1526025 today our primary focus is supporting fannie mae and freddie mac in their current form as they carry out their important mission paulson said in a statement

1526046 so lets get our head round this palestinians committed to the destruction of israel fled from other palestinians committed to the destruction of israel into israel which is providing them with sanctuary and medical treatment while the president of their putative state who bases his claim against israel on its alleged refusal to admit palestinian refugees refused to allow actual palestinian refugees fleeing palestinian violence access to that same putative state while israel agonises over whether to grant them permanent asylum

1526081 cuando se traten otros temas estas comisiones de trabajo ir n mutando en funci n de la especificidad del asunto
1526082 expresaron su m xima predisposici n a trabajar en este tipo de encuentros y en la b squeda de consensos
1526083 las reuniones de las comisiones fueron programadas para los pr ximos tres martes 12 19 y 26 de agosto y el plenario de cierre ser el viernes 29
1526084 la finalidad de los tems que lo integran contemplan obras realmente prioritarias y necesarias para ushuaia tolhuin y r o grande
1526085 estamos hablando de una producci n mensual de 20 millones de pesos lo que significar a un giro sumamente importante para toda la provincia adem s de asegurar la ocupaci n del 40 por ciento de la mano de obra
1526086 vemos con mucho optimismo y con mucha energ a el hecho de que se vaya a encarar un programa de obras significativo y fundamental para la provincia
1526087 tambi n significa la utilizaci n de los recursos humanos de la construcci n y la uocra adhiere a estas iniciativas ya que beneficia a muchos de sus asociados
1526088 aparte de sindicatos haya un componente y un actor protag nico que son los l deres y dirigentes territoriales
1526089 uno de los temas de inter s general que se mencion como un gran problema de la sociedad en su conjunto es el tema habitacional
1526090 podamos arribar a conclusiones que empiecen a resolver una demanda de ya m s de 20 a os
1526091 por supuesto que como central hay otros temas m s que no se han podido discutir
1526092 a futuro merecen ser tratados como la calidad del trabajo la problem tica del empleo en negro c mo se dinamiza la econom a para abordar la posibilidad de crear m s y mejor actividades productivas que vayan dando m s puestos laborales
1526093 no pudimos todav a abordar la problem tica habitacional porque a n no tenemos los elementos necesarios para hacer una evaluaci n y no est previsto en este plan de obras el tema de viviendas
1526094 en la segunda reuni n de trabajo est previsto debatir sobre este tema en particular con las autoridades del ipv y los municipios para ver si se puede al margen de esta propuesta en particular que es la que se va a incluir en el presupuesto provincial 2009 para ver si se puede avanzar en un plan de obras que contemple la problem tica habitacional
1526095 hoy nos encontramos obligados a determinar la representaci n que la ley 321 establece
1526096 existe la posibilidad de que los municipios participen en los debates a modo de observadores con voz pero sin voto
1526097 con el objeto de tener la mayor apertura posible en el funcionamiento del consejo se va a convocar a los intendentes a medida de que se vaya requiriendo en funci n de los resultados que arrojen las comisiones t cnicas en particular la 2 que es la de soluciones habitacionales

1526100 i see on wbir behind the reporter a sign that says
1526101 i showed it to the team because i thought that it was meaningful because it was two years since hes had his hands on that ball in a competitive situation
1526102 but this cartilage is slowing him down a little bit and hes disappointed about it
1526103 he moved on and ultimately we have to move on too
1526104 i was working more on mechanics and keeping my endurance up not focusing on improving the starts itll be good to do a regular session for now

1526106 if you are the son of god tell these stones to become bread
1526107 this is my son in whom i am well pleased
1526108 jesus because you are the son of god as you heard your father say at the time of your baptism then you know that you have the power and authority of god himself arent you hungry and isnt eating a legitimate activity we both know this is a wilderness and there is no food here but dont you think it would be all right to make stones into bread after all you are the son of god and have power to command the stones to become bread it would be so simple and then you could eat so jesus why dont you go ahead and prove yourself as son make some bread it would be ridiculous for the son of god to go hungry when he could do something about it wouldnt it
1526109 arent you the son of god who can do all things now i understand that you believe in the bible and its authority and you will not do anything contrary to scripture but let me ask you about a scripture
1526110 you see i also believe in gods word and tremble
1526111 this would be such a great feat jesus it would give you instant popularity among the people then you would certainly be known as the messiah besides isnt there a rabbinical tradition that says that when the king messiah reveals himself he will come and stand on the roof of the holy place and jesus you really have nothing to worry about isnt this the holy city where god dwells his presence is so thick in this place i know he would never forget you
1526112 so jesus i urge you jump be popular receive the acclamation from people be the popular messiah rather than the suffering messiah say goodbye to this path of humiliation this suffering servant idea forget about everything and jump
1526113 i am not going to study or anything god will take care of me
1526114 god will take care of me as i indulge in every vice
1526115 god you are supposed to provide for me now do it
1526116 all this i will give you if you will bow down and worship me
1526117 at this point he provided essentially no biographical data about himself before 1993
1526118 in connection with a missing person report back in the early 1990s
1526119 our experience tells us hes more of a schemer than someone who has lost his memory
1526120 he loves his daughter kidnapping doesnt apply it was his own kid
1526121 just because hes reighs natural father it doesnt absolve him
1526122 that this cant be a crime because heavenly father is the one that tells jeffs when a girl is ready to get married and that he is only following the word of heavenly father
1526123 in certain areas of australia were still processing some of the imagery and still driving some of the areas
1526124 if you look at the imagery we have processed at the time weve launched its extremely broad covering all the way to a lot of outback areas such as the nullarbor and alice springs
1526125 thats the sort of feedback weve had on day one people wanting more imagery in australia on google street view rather than wanting to remove images
1526126 her job was to carry out recruitment brainwash new recruits and then push them to carry out criminal activities
1526127 three billion dollars are needed over three years for infrastructure and the equivalent amount for investment projects
1526128 a year ago we were not able to talk about such projects as we were worried about security issues we have succeeded in that area and now we will succeed in construction

1526131 it the army is not allowed to use arms at all
1526132 the military welcomed the news but the proof is always in the actions and not just the words so well take a wait and see approach

1526134 the derailleurs talk to each other and automatically adjust so the chain doesnt rub they also calibrate themselves so you dont have to play with cable tension to maintain shift quality as cables stretch and the chain and cogs wear

1526139 im six weeks old today time to get serious no more messing around like im a three week old
1526140 my work is done here this guy has become a person in his own right
1526141 many grandparents work hard to pass on their familys history and traditions these grandparents often are the glue that holds their families together they help grandchildren understand that theyre part of something greater than themselves
1526142 about their own childhood and their grandchildrens parents early years
1526143 grandparents enjoy seeing the cycle of life continue they are thrilled to see physical and personality traits in their grandchildren that theyve seen in themselves their children and their own parents or siblings
1526144 the software can certainly be a boon to working parents
1526145 im not daddy silly daddy is the man hes much bigger than me see the man is daddy and the lady is mommy understand
1526146 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
1526147 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
1526148 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
1526149 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
1526150 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
1526151 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
1526152 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
1526153 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
1526154 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
1526155 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
1526156 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
1526157 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
1526158 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
1526159 almost anything is okay to sing to a child as long as its catchy
1526160 i hope that my thoughts on emoting free you to be goofy because babies love broad humor and most of all they love you no matter how silly or you are
1526161 if you master even a quarter of the classics here i guarantee years worth of coos and giggles and snuggles and repetitions of that magic word that proves you really have done your job well again
1526162 if youre clueless and you know it clap your hands
1526163 the link between television violence and increased aggression in children is stronger than the relationships between asbestos and throat cancer condom use and hiv and workplace second hand smoke and lung cancer
1526164 children who are persistently exposed to violent images learn aggressive behaviors become desensitized to violence and develop an exaggerated fear of becoming victims
1526165 televised violence is often sanitized and glamorized violence is often perpetrated by attractive remorseless and ultimately unpunished characters
1526166 parents tend to be more concerned with sex on television than with violence but violent portrayals may pose more of a risk
1526167 someday my prince will come only then will i live happily ever after
1526168 theres no way i can spare a day going to a conference ive got too much going on right now
1526169 the red icon on your iphone or ipod touch always reminds you and others when you show it to them that you were rich enough to afford this its a work of art with no hidden function at all

1526172 theres a place here called the marina they all look like you here
1526173 has no one made a basic physical analysis of a gas mixture surrounding a spherical body
1526174 i know for a fact that up in northern california car pool lanes dont have the double double triple triple yellow yellow white lines
1526175 in fact they treat them as just a lane that you can get in and out of i think that is one of the number one reasons they car pool lanes in los angeles are not effective right now is the exit and entrances to these car pool lanes
1526176 the new organization capabilities in vmware lab manager 3 will help us better enforce role based access rights to system configurations in the lab according to our it policy says tony anastasio technology architect for cerner the leading u

1526179 the performers are wearing diapers during rehearsals so they dont have to take bathroom breaks
1526180 they gave us the really long ones that youd use at night
1526181 ugh how hot and suffocating we just chucked them and used the toilet when we wanted to anyway
1526182 this pie dish is too big and i dont have nearly enough dough
1526183 its a faucet i cant turn off i can try and ignore it but i cant ever turn it off and i gotta keep going cause i still dont have the crown someone else just won best male hip hop artist at the bet awards why not me huh that tells me im not going hard enough that tells me ive done something wrong
1526184 at this point he provided essentially no biographical data about himself before 1993
1526185 in connection with a missing person report back in the early 1990s
1526186 our experience tells us hes more of a schemer than someone who has lost his memory
1526187 he loves his daughter kidnapping doesnt apply it was his own kid
1526188 just because hes reighs natural father it doesnt absolve him
1526189 the city attorneys office will review these cases to fully understand how adjustable rate mortgages with an introductory period of three years or less were presented to individual borrowers who in most cases would not be able to afford future payments
1526190 the information will be helpful in holding the lender accountable
1526191 i just dont think no parent should really have a gun inside the house especially if they left them alone
1526192 i seen the first police car come up and i was like wow what happened its terrible
1526193 this here is really pitiful children shouldnt even have access to the pistol my prayers go out to the family
1526194 cease certain harmful activities and the making of terroristic threats

1526200 criminals will no longer fear being executed in maryland no matter how heinous their crime
1526201 there is no question now about the innocence or guilt in this case
1526202 three separate baltimore city juries 12 members each men and women black and white have sentenced this man to death
1526203 consequently the defense never raised important facts like that hunt was high on pcp when the shooting occurred which might well have countered the prosecutors case that the murder was premeditated and thus death eligible
1526204 there will always be an error rate because this isnt a system thats run by infallible human beings and its impossible in the long run to run a system like this without making serious mistakes
1526205 when all of these canvases are put together they really bring home the message that all water is connected and all people of all the countries of the world are connected and thats why we need to protect it
1526206 languis drifts along in a dreamy uncharted land where beautiful songs and traditional instrumentation go hand in hand with futurist laptop experimentalism
1526207 he lurched towards him and headbutted him once in the face
1526208 the defendant then punched mr whitehead about eight times to the face
1526209 mr whitehead required medical attention for cuts and bruises to the face and a laceration of the tongue caused when he bit into it during the incident
1526210 he wants to accept responsibility for his friends injuries and accepts that alcohol has a negative influence on him and his done so on many occasions
1526211 he deeply regrets this offence and is totally ashamed of his behaviour

1526217 i am happy with the theme even though i wasnt exactly glad about the options offered
1526218 if i could choose something else it would probably have been the 80s
1526219 homecoming dance is an enjoyable and fun experience that all high school students should participate in
1526220 it offers a great buffet and terrific music for all the students to dance and listen to
1526221 bullying can cause the victim to be increasingly detached from society
1526222 it can cause a person to become despondent and depressed which in turn can lead to suicidal thoughts
1526223 because now whatever humiliating thing is being said about the student is there for anyone to see
1526224 whose job is to help new students and assist anyone who is a victim of bullying
1526225 it surprises me how many students do nothing about it
1526226 there is no clear pattern because there are socio cultural and economical components that need to be considered
1526227 i was the first person in my family to be there in 90 years
1526228 the russian language is a beautiful language when its spoken well
1526229 but you go to these little villages and theres still ox carts pulling people around
1526230 the beach was one of the most beautiful beaches i had ever seen in my life
1526231 i suggest everybody go to brazil it was the happiest country i have ever been to
1526232 its always good to change your routine because thats what vacations are not looking at your watch
1526233 when you go through those areas you cant help but be drawn into the history especially of the slaves
1526234 avid kids are in many of the same classes together
1526235 help students succeed in high school and adapt more easily to a new school a new system and start thinking about what they want to do after high school
1526236 so that they can accomplish everything they should during their time at beach high
1526237 get the kids exposed to cultural activities and guest speakers from different facets of society
1526238 i would like to get the kids in the museum and excited about what it has to offer
1526239 hey america im paris hilton and im a celebrity too

1526241 but then that wrinkly white haired guy used me in his campaign ad which i guess means im running for president so thanks for the endorsement white haired dude and i want america to know that im like totally ready to lead watch above
1526242 ive been asked again and again for my response to the now infamous mccain celebrity ad
1526243 on a day when major news organizations across the country are taking senator mccain to task for a steady stream of false negative attacks his campaign has launched yet another
1526244 hey america im paris hilton and im a celebrity too
1526245 he puesto 300 mil d lares y he sido el nico candidato que ha dicho cuanta plata puso los dem s no se acuerdan
1526246 muchas de las prohibiciones a las contribuciones estimulan la creatividad de los partidos pol ticos en la campa a electoral para la jefatura de la ciudad de buenos aires la nueva y reci n estrenada ley de financiamiento pol tico exig a que los aportes sean de personas no de empresas y que ninguno supere los 20 000 pesos en este contexto el candidato y actual jefe de la ciudad de buenos aires an bal ibarra recibi 70 000 u s de una empresa fraccionados de la siguiente manera 20 000 del mismo presidente de la empresa 20 000 del vice presidente otros 20 000 de uno de los directos de la empresa y finalmente 10 000 de un asistente del presidente
1526247 the value of this law is not so much that police will seize your guns
1526248 it gives police a system to investigate a person who poses a threat if the police never confiscate a persons guns they can at least look into the persons behavior and perhaps prevent a tragedy by intervening
1526249 state police and 53 police departments have seized more than 1 700 guns opponents of that gun seizure law expressed fears in 1999 that police would abuse the law today the laws backers say the record shows that hasnt been the case
1526250 smiths criminal record and reputation for passing out hate literature
1526251 may use these measures of social protection to deal with anyone classified as a danger to society either for a specific crime that has been committed or when even if exonerated of a particular crime the person is still reckoned to pose a threat to society

1526255 our reported revenue growth in the quarter and first half of the year was materially impacted by reduced revenue associated with the apple iphone
1526256 syncopation is pervasive right off the bat not only is it inherent in the ostinato figure but it is also picked up by the way the rest of the ensemble enters in measure 3 with a vacuum cleaner like zooming into the g chord from the f below verse

1526262 you use technology so much you start to understand it you start to trust it people have seen very few failed attempts at technology
1526263 a momentous economic slowdown is now under way we believe the deterioration in spain is just in the beginning stages the bulk of the pain will be suffered in 2009
1526264 the probability of a crisis scenario similar to the early 1990s is increasing if the erm exchange rate mechanism scenario were to become reality the main concern would not be earnings but capital
1526265 we estimate that a non performing loan ratio of 10pc to 15pc for developers loans would fully erase earnings in 2009 and would represent between 20pc to 30pc of the current tangible capital base of banco popular sabadell and banesto
1526266 the economic situation is worse than we all predicted we thought it would happen slowly but instead it has hit fast
1526267 what was the state supposed to do stop people building houses that wouldnt be reasonable tell the banks who they can lend money too we couldnt do that either we warned that building 800 000 homes a year was not sustainable and that granting mortgages for 40 years was folly but there are certain things the government cannot prohibit

1526295 el sistema electoral boliviano se caracteriza por un sistema mixto parecido al alem n con circunscripciones electorales uninominales y plurinominales dando preferencia al primero
1526296 las reformas que tuvieron lugar en bolivia en 1994 pueden resumirse en la adopci n del sistema mixto que mezcla la l gica del first past de post con la l gica proporcional
1526297 el sistema pol tico alem n ha demostrado que funciona como una aut ntica obra de tecnolog a germana resulta interesante indagar sobre el mismo ya que puede brindarnos mecanismos e instrumentos valiosos para asimilar o bien comparar fundamentalmente si tenemos presente el debate que se avecina sobre las reformas del sistema argentino

1526399 we get to do all sorts of stuff here and play with the toys
1526400 we work in the farmhouse as it would have been worked on a summers day in 1890
1526401 children have a first hand experience how we really would have lived in this house and used the resources and technology of this house
1526402 the farm is indeed the centerpiece and it brings it all together in a hands on way for the children and of course to them the work is play because they enjoy doing what they seldom have an opportunity to do anymore
1526403 it is a little more interesting than history class its just cool different
1526404 we dont register people to vote ourselves but we do talk to them about why theyre registered and how theyre getting their news and who they want to vote for and why to try and get into details about where theyre getting their news from and how they make their decisions
1526405 i voted today because i think there are a lot of important issues and positions that need to be decided especially the attorney general 23rd district representative and 9th congressional district
1526406 voting is part of the privilege of being an american citizen
1526407 voting is an important part of the democratic process stephen webber grew up next door to me hes a wonderful human being and i hope he wins
1526408 i want things to start being different than they have been
1526409 the governors race is interesting because there are a lot of differences in the candidates i say its important to get out and express your opinion it makes you think and stay in tune with whats going on in society and the world
1526410 voting is a privilege and i hope everybody takes advantage of it if you dont play you cant complain
1526411 we need to do a little revising on how we do elections i must have gotten 20 calls yesterday it made me so disgusted i probably wouldnt have voted if i werent so determined to vote
1526412 i wanted to make sure i voted for governor i know the guy i want to vote for kenny hulshof and i want him to win
1526413 its early but im most concerned with who gets into the governors office because we need a democratic governor and we could use a democratic attorney general too
1526414 id like to see jay nixon and sean spence win i went to a meet the candidate with sean spence and i was impressed with some of his ideas and im just ready for a change of governors
1526415 jay nixon has said hes going to eliminate telemarketer calls so now he should eliminate people calling running for office i just feel like the democratic philosophy is better for the state and matt blunt did a lousy job as governor
1526416 its our right and duty to vote im interested in all races im interested in candidates that are pro life i really want to see hulshof get governor
1526417 mostly the 9th congressional district and the governors race those were the two on the republican side that got the most attention and were the most contested they interested me the most i voted for olivo because i felt luetkemeyer and onder were too negative for me i originally i was going to vote for one of them but i heard too many negative ads so i switched at the last minute
1526418 ive been paying attention to negative ads with one candidate in particular making them and i wanted to cast a vote specifically not in support of that candidate the negative campaigning thing is something that transcends party lines if a candidate cant make his case based on positions he holds and has to resort to attacking his opponent he doesnt have a firm enough faith in himself or his own positions to merit my vote
1526419 theres a bunch of good candidates i like mary still and judy baker and jeff harris theres a lot of candidates with good integrity this year we know four or five personally and theyre good people
1526420 ive been listening to republican stuff mostly but i voted democratic they just make more noise i voted for spence because he was the best candidate
1526421 im here to make sure hulshof becomes governor he holds a lot of the same values that i hold and its time somebody talks straight and doesnt just talk things that are politically correct
1526422 i feel its very important to vote in every election and im concerned with womens and childrens issues and i think that democrats represent those
1526423 i support judy baker jay nixon and jeff harris hes a local boy and hell do a good job for the state if he wins
1526424 my husband is very political and i always vote we live in a very democratic neighborhood and were republicans so we come down to support our party and have signs in our yard
1526425 i think we have a crisis for our state in health care economy and education you have to make a decision in the primary for the best long term future i think its best to have a variety of opinions and discussion with a multi party approach that facilitates the discussion
1526426 there was way too much campaigning i wish they didnt spend so much money on campaigning i think its a waste of time but it must work
1526427 i am republican and business oriented but i am in favor of a womans right to choose and my party has let me down there before
1526428 its time to balance out the last seven or eight years with the republicans in the white house congress and the state it filters down so im going to vote for the democrats of my choice and hopefully we do effect some change if all we do is move a little bit its going to trickle down and create incremental change on a federal state and local level
1526429 the elections for congress and the attorney general are important to me because they affect the day to day there are good candidates running for both
1526430 i vote every chance i can i mean i think its a rare right that not everybody has
1526431 i know sean spence pretty well i think hed be a great representative
1526432 i came out to vote for governor im interested in that more than any other because we have such a horrible governor
1526433 special interest groups are controlling their campaigns not politicians you see it at the gas pumps you see it with the housing prices and predatory lending and there not being any kind of regulation to stop that from happening and thats one of the reasons im voting democrat is you know that was also true with republicans being in control for six years and then the bush administration
1526434 im torn between mary still and sean spence i went with mary still just because of the experience youve got to hand it to spence hes run a good campaign i felt kind of bad about that one
1526435 i think kenny hulshof is a yes man didnt want any more of that sarah steelmans not popular with the other politicians
1526436 my neighbors running for the 25th district mary still im just voting for her
1526437 most of the time i just take the sample ballot and go on the internet and start researching
1526438 these are the people who make the policies we have to live by they affect me in all sorts of ways
1526439 probably for me it was a little more personality driven than issues at the primary level it seems like a lot of the candidates have similar platforms
1526440 we have to spend money for the state to operate therefore we have to be taxed but spend my money wisely
1526441 its been kind of a mediocre year for me i dont like any of them
1526442 i dont think medicaid should be cut there are a lot of people who cant afford insurance especially senior citizens
1526443 im a democrat because i feel that they are more for the common person
1526444 i know a lot about what jeff harris has done as a representative and i think hes the most qualified
1526445 i support jay nixon because i feel hes done well for the state as attorney general i think hes got a lot of strength going into the race for governor
1526446 i think judy bakers stance on education is outstanding shes dedicated and she has a lot of stamina to work through this i also like her opportunities for veterans
1526447 tom schauwecker has done a great job with a difficult job
1526448 stephen webber seems to balance republican strong military with social needs education and welfare more than anyone his age is a better cross section of all generations
1526449 the governors race is most important we need a big change jay nixon is going to be good for the state he knows the things he stand for
1526450 the billionaire tax breaks that the county assessor has given to all of our largest developers that prompted our voting
1526451 i guess my biggest reason to come out was to vote for stephen webber hes local hes 25 i think he represents the future for politics and hed be a good representative
1526452 i always vote i dont think ive missed but one election in all the times ive been qualified to vote and that was because i was out of town i think one major issue is the divisiveness in this country between parties and candidates that has made people and issues secondary
1526453 i dont want all those calls anyway now how can that be any good
1526454 i think jeff harris listens to his constituents and is a concerned politician and representative
1526455 a strong woman candidate running against three men i thought she deserved a shot
1526456 has a lot of integrity and cares about the average citizen not just the special interest groups
1526457 basically i just it was kinda simple i voted for the person the current public administrator didnt endorse it will be different i hope
1526458 i always vote thats my duty i need to vote even if i vote wrong
1526459 the pendulum of politics swings back and forth all the time its too far in one direction right now
1526460 personally im looking for people interested in alternative fuel and our economy i really feel badly for people living on the margins who have to deal with these gas prices
1526461 all the negative phone calls are bad strategy because they dont say who they were from and they backfired it made me look more closely at the candidates the calls attacked i voted for those people after the closer inspection
1526462 i felt offended by the volume of robo calls i got and the money sloshing around during this campaign
1526463 as an independent i wanted to cross vote i felt i was forced to vote for people im not interested in and not able to vote for people i was interested in
1526464 i just have never liked that i can just choose one ballot it limits my choice
1526465 i met judy baker and i liked her and she said something i agreed with she wants to help front people money for putting up solar cells
1526466 the economy and the war that we shouldnt be in brought me out to vote today
1526467 i suppose most of the local issues like gas prices and things like that made me vote they have an effect on everyday life unlike other issues in politicians campaigns they hit close to home
1526468 i always come out to vote its a hoppin election cycle and ill be interested in all the returns
1526469 insurance and education are important to me i think that everyone should have insurance and that the state should put more money towards education
1526470 i vote because its the thing to do on election day its kind of like a rule i vote so that the country wont go to hell in a hand basket but i dont think that everything is as bad as people say it is things are always bad in an election year it will be better after the election no matter who wins
1526471 i thought when the blunt administration chose to take 190 000 people off medicaid coverage that it was awful they need to get it restored
1526472 its really been a low turnout im sorry to see so few people here its your local officials who are really going to make a difference
1526473 i think we need to become fiscally responsible in boone county we need to take a hard look at bringing in businesses with higher paying jobs were in fiscally challenging times and we need to make this community more attractive to outsiders when i moved to columbia i kept hearing were recession proof with mu and our proximity to jefferson city i think thats a bit of an arrogant statement i think that people have closed their eyes from reality no one is safe from a recession
1526474 i felt strongly about the county assessor i had good experience with the incumbent there was some confusion on why the land we bought at two different times was assessed the way it was he seemed to be the only person in town who knew the answer he knows his job very well
1526475 i am just a patriotic american i never miss an election there is a big election coming up in november with the governors and congressional race a lot of people think that is the only election that matters but its a big deal to get that election down to a candidate you care about
1526476 i always vote there is not a specific race or issue i am a little disappointed with the republican candidates this election and always disappointed with the democrats
1526477 ive come out to vote every election it is my duty as a citizen people who complain and dont vote dont have a right to complain i have not missed an election in 15 years
1526478 the governors race is important to me i wanted to vote for kenny hulshof
1526479 weve got someone who always votes as a write in donald duck
1526480 ive been up here since june 1 doing some voluntary workouts and stuff with some of the quarterbacks and receivers but its nice to finally be out here with all the coaches and the rest of the guys on the team
1526481 the challenge for him is going to be learning the mental aspect of the game the system and all the other little mental things quarterbacks need to have
1526482 theres definitely still a little bit of nerves going on
1526483 i just need to improve and keep all those negative things out of my head
1526484 i look at him like hes my little brother out here
1526485 hes been rooming with me since the start of summer and im going to put a lot of my time and effort into him but its up to him to take it to the next level
1526486 if you just walked out here and watched practice you wouldnt know he was just a freshman out here for the first time and a lot of that is due to how hard hes worked over the summer
1526487 now all hes got left to do is get used to the speed of practice and learn how to be a division i quarterback
1526488 if youre a quarterback at this level just about everybody has the physical skills
1526489 the thing that sets the great ones apart is the mental aspect of the game i think if i can know the system and be smarter than the guy starting across from me good things are going to happen

1526495 our mobile medical teams will be available to provide basic medical care at several communities while they are here
1526496 we will be visiting eight different sites in and around port moresby the 13 days we are here including working with png medical staff to evaluate and screen patients for surgery at the port moresby general hospital on august 4 and 5
1526497 this is the first time during a pacific partnership mission that we will have the dental care set up to make the most out of an existing facility
1526498 while we will have dental care available in the community we will also have core dental resources concentrated at the dental school allowing us to see more patients and maximize training opportunities as we work hand in hand with students
1526499 we want to identify potential patients early on through our hospital and our medical specialists
1526500 messages have gone out through our specialists and they have been screening and recruiting patients
1526501 the pacific partnership team is a unique team formed from organizations with very different skills and capabilities but unified in purpose to conduct a very important mission

1526506 uk pension schemes of ftse 100 companies enjoyed a brief period of surplus until early in 2008 some companies chose to spend their surpluses on various forms of de risking activity including buy out purchasing financial swaps and reducing their exposure to equities
1526507 events of the last year demonstrate the importance of assessing and managing pension risks and being prepared to take opportunities when they present themselves
1526508 good regulation should drive competition and boost our productivity but too many new rules can stifle enterprise and blunt our competitive edge
1526509 if the uk is to remain a respected place to do business we must not expect business simply to absorb the costs of a stream of new government initiatives
1526510 the introduction of a regulatory budget for every department will focus new regulations on the real priorities and act as a powerful incentive for departments to cut or streamline existing burdens

1526526 you need to diversify your earnings stream by going overseas
1526527 we cant depend only on malaysia for our growth the foreign market is a must
1526528 these are volatile markets itll be very difficult to achieve that target
1526529 if malaysia is on a weaker growth path then the other asian countries could beef up
1526530 its a good diversification strategy it could possibly bring it close to its rm1 5 billion target
1526531 we wont simply venture into a country without a good reason
1526532 long term growth story looks quite decent looking at the very young population and the housing requirements
1526533 the overheating could slow the pace of development for the next two years or so
1526534 great just great where the heck is he going to get all the electricity from no new nukes no new coal fired plants certainly no new oil fired plants im pretty sure were not all going to drive to west texas each night and plug into boone pickens windmills im near detroit maybe a 1500 mile long cord from my place to west texas
1526535 as a californian who pays attention i can point out 2 more limits on charging cars which do apply at night much of our peak power comes from natural gas which has had price shocks of its own in the last decade and that gas comes in by pipelines which run near capacity the local storage rises during the night and falls during the day and the inability to keep up with supply needs over a multi day period was on factor in the blackouts price spikes
1526536 what will really happen is that people will drive to and from work then plug their cars in the second they get back to their homes putting a massive load on the grid between 5 pm and 7 pm good night california
1526537 in california or the northeast no way not even at night theres serious lack of transmission capacity in the summer months in both regions california especially has been short of transmission capacity for years
1526538 we conclude that the impact on water resources from a widespread shift to grid based transportation would be substantial enough to warrant consideration for relevant public policy decision making
1526539 it is harrowing to hear a child saying that if it was madeleine it was a disgrace that it was not passed on
1526540 we need to know what happened with this this is exactly the sort of primary information that we need to know if it was followed up properly by the police if that hasnt been done that is exactly the kind of information that the private investigators are going to follow up
1526541 one can not ignore the fascinating and glorious heritage of almost three millennia of iran for that heritage has formed the land and people of today so much so that even modern economic development by foreigners can hardly succeed without a knowledge by them of the mores and temper of those to be served by that development
1526542 situated in the center of the three great empires of the time constantinople china and india the sassanian empire was to be for four centuries the point where the human mind exchanged ideas
1526543 an examination of the religious history of iran reveals the fact that the iranians on the whole have not followed orthodox islamic tenets and that in fact for over two centuries many of them gave their lives to fight islam by sword tongue and pen
1526544 they championed the cause of the house of ali for nationalistic reasons
1526545 class differences lack of social and economic security and feudalistic wars in the country had the life of the people and particularly that of the great majority of the working classes so chaotic and unsure that people wished only for security and equal justice to be able to make even a substandard living and continue their unbearable lives
1526546 dubbing of foreign films into the farsi language in tehran has improved to such an extent that the films distributors have discontinued having their films dubbed in italy as was the practice in previous years
1526547 film importers in common with all others dealing in so called luxury goods were faced with the greatest difficulty not only in obtaining a permit to purchase exchange but in finding the exchange itself so that few orders could be placed abroad
1526548 nevertheless in spite of the lack of new films interest in the cinema on the part of persians did not wane and a attendance throughout the country increased steadily
1526549 between march 22 1940 and march 21 1941 approximately 60 percent of the films shown in iran were from the united states 18 percent from germany 12 percent from the soviet union and 5 percent from france
1526550 between august 15 and november 1 1948 the commission of theatres granted 93 new permits for showing full length films
1526551 in 1946 1965 523 reels of feature films produced abroad were imported by iran
1526552 the persians have been ever the artists of the near east and world music painting and architecture all have been enriched by persian contributions

1526572 no one should be in possession of firearms unless they possess a current firearms licence and the firearms are registered
1526573 penalties of up to 14 years jail can apply for those who contravene these laws
1526574 it is not the responsibility of police to provide safe keeping for firearms while owners renew their licences there are a number of firearms dealers who can assist in safe storage renewals and disposals of firearms
1526575 i suppose its understandable that rosi is seeking compassion from the court but he didnt show heidi any compassion when she was brutally murdered
1526576 australian consulate staff in bali keep me well informed and telephone and email whenever anyone associated with heidis murder faces court mr murphy said
1526577 we believe the most accurate prices are the median prices and in dubbo the median across all houses is 238 000
1526578 but the worst reflection on dubbo was the land prices
1526579 it was quoted at 180 000 but we have a recent release of residential land from council which is selling for 90 000
1526580 dubbo is renowned for being the most affordable regional city in nsw but these figures dont really reflect that
1526581 while i can understand the research was well intentioned i think it is better to use the accurate figures
1526582 the unit prices were around the mark but the house and land prices were a bit off
1526583 if you use dubbo in comparison to armidale our median price is 28 000 less than theirs but according to the figures our prices are 50 000 dearer
1526584 it sure makes dubbo a less appealing place to purchase as far as people looking to move to a regional area are concerned
1526585 you can certainly get a three bedroom house for 200 around dubbo but the median price would be closer to 225
1526586 as for a four bedroom place the quote of 250 is probably
1526587 with families wanting to cut their travel to reduce petrol costs tourist destinations further from metropolitan areas could suffer particularly in areas already struggling with the effects of drought
1526588 there has been lots said anecdotally about the impact petrol prices are having on the tourism industry but nobody expected the traditional australian family holiday to have changed so much
1526589 the decision by families to slash their spending by up to 500 and to holiday closer to home means an urgent campaign is needed to boost local tourism
1526590 fuel prices the price but more importantly the difference in price
1526591 we say any variation from three to five cents is fair a difference of 14 cents is a rip off and fuel companies wonder why we dont like them
1526592 there was concern about the number of trucks on the roads
1526593 on the newell highway there is one truck a minute and that is going to double by the year 2020 were very keen on the inland rail route a 1500m train takes 100 trucks off the road
1526594 particularly in the country where we dont get a fair go
1526595 this is something john does through ben furney flour mills as a donation to the event
1526596 we sell flight legs to raise money and it really adds another dimension to the trip

1526603 people get a chance to catch up and spend some quality time with people they may not have had a lot to do with since the last trip

1526605 this is a working truck so it wont lie or hide about the condition of the roads
1526606 im really keen to show him and even more keen to get a result
1526607 its not so much because of those of us who as consumers rely on the products they move around the country but these men and women who are trying to survive making a living
1526608 and the laws that are increasingly being imposed upon them let alone fuel costs and many many other challenges theyve got are such that i think its time for the nation to pay real attention
1526609 when we see the regulations in black and white and have met with the users well decide whether or not the coalition will support the new laws which have caused nothing but angst among the industry
1526610 ja ik heb een gezegde eens over tijd altijd over tijd atuurlijk gaat dit niet altijd op maar je ziet het wel heel veel

1526617 i do understand your reluctance and somewhat distrustful attitude because there are plenty of people in real estate industry who do not perform up to professional standards on the other hand there are many full times professional who work diligently every day to earn every dollar for their services along with many satisfied customers who are glad they employed a real estate agent to help them with what for most is the single most important investment of their lives
1526618 you can negotiate with any agent 6 is usually just a starting point
1526619 that might cover one year at ut and they wont negotiate on tuition good point though interview several realtors before you decide to put your home on the market find out what your are getting for 6 half of that commission goes to the buyers agent and that person splits it with their office
1526620 put an add on craigslist and sell the house its possible and i know lots of people who do it
1526621 my question to you is would you be happy to reduce your salary for the job you perform this is what you are asking the realtor to do when they also have to pay for all of their expenses taxes and give a portion their commission to their broker
1526622 most agents are not worth 6 a few agents are worth 8

1526657 it is the dark inaccessible part of our personality what little we know of it we have learnt from our study of the dream work and of the construction of neurotic symptoms and most of this is of a negative character and can be described only as a contrast to the ego
1526658 contains everything that is inherited that is present at birth that is laid down in the constitution above all therefore the instincts which originate from the somatic organization and which find a first psychical expression here in the id in forms unknown to us
1526659 the ego is not sharply separated from the id its lower portion merges into it but the repressed merges into the id as well and is merely a part of it the repressed is only cut off sharply from the ego by the resistances of repression it can communicate with the ego through the id
1526660 the ego is that part of the id which has been modified by the direct influence of the external world the ego represents what may be called reason and common sense in contrast to the id which contains the passions in its relation to the id it is like a man on horseback who has to hold in check the superior strength of the horse with this difference that the rider tries to do so with his own strength while the ego uses borrowed forces

1526879 gt villepique hits the nail on the head with his review
1526880 sedaris irresistibly funny travel essays reminiscences and diary entries hit with an almost physical wallop with a sharpshooters eye for detail he writes about his experiences in a way that inspires a shock of recognition it may take sedaris more practice to talk pretty but he writes gorgeous
1526881 asked by the agent which team i supported i took my cue from her red turtleneck and told her that i was for state definitely state state all the way it was an answer i would regret for years to come

1526885 nicholas sparks does a great job of building his characters drawing the reader into the story to the point of not being able to put the book down
1526886 the characters are not very complex the plot is predictable
1526887 but you know what sparks does it rather well he is an expert in the art of romantic fiction after all
1526888 perish in your rage certainly allah knows what is in the breasts all the secrets
1526889 fight those who do not believe in allah and the last day and who forbid not what allah and his messenger have forbidden who do not practice the religion of truth being of those who have been given the book until they pay the poll tax out of hand and are humbled
1526890 i have been ordered to fight the people till they say none has the right to be worshipped but allah

1526893 heaven the essentiality of being where everything achieves its full authenticity is already close to us in friendship
1526894 few things are as healing and life giving as is friendship between woman and man man and woman
1526895 a man needs something which is more than friendship and yet is not love as it is generally understood this something nevertheless a woman only can give
1526896 few things are likelier to kill a friendship quicker than a careful and strictly adhered to theory of what qualities are needed in friend
1526897 i do not wish to treat friendships daintily but with the roughest courage when they are real they are not glass threads or frostwork but the solidest things we know
1526898 authentic friendship is notoriously different and inescapably risky true friendships are not relationships we control but adventures we enter into
1526899 it is more important who they are as people and only then it is important who they are as dancers

1526901 in this kingdom the distinctions and barriers between male and female were to be broken down to actualize the potential of any love in this case a male and female love of friendship can be to participate in the building of a kingdom of love spiritual friendships shared by men and women can be eschatological signs
1526902 friendship forms friendship is a much underestimated aspect of spirituality its every bit as significant as prayer and fasting like the sacramental use of water and bread and wine friendship takes what is common in human experience and turns it into something holy

1526933 i think justin over the last two years has made tremendous strides

1526935 that were focused and loosey goosey at the same time you dont want them to be anybody but who they are but you need them to understand the differences between when you have a chance to really express your personality and when you have to transition into purely a focused work mode

1526938 we know hes an athlete we know he can make all the plays but its just about him being consistent even if he messes up at the line he has the make up speed to get back in place
1526939 if youre uptight and stiff all the time youre not going to be able to play and have fun and do things that youre accustomed to doing as long as we can have fun and still take care of the things we need to do the main focus of all of us is to do that

1526954 the ministry of foreign affairs shall work in coordination with arab and islamic groups and others at the united nations to draft an international pact for respecting religions their symbols and leaders and prohibit insulting them in any way
1526955 some consider buddhism qadianism and bahaism as religions can we make it obligatory for muslims to respect these faiths and avoid criticising them
1526956 the idea is to ask representatives of all monotheistic religions to sit together with their brothers in faith and sincerity to all religions as we all believe in the same god
1526957 my provision has been placed under the shadow of my spear and abasement and humility have been placed on the one who disobeys my command

1526980 it is reported on the authority of sab b jaththama that the prophet of allah may peace be upon him when asked about the women and children of the polytheists being killed during the night raid said they are from them
1526981 clearly our lives aint sacred to muslims until we submit to islam
1526982 the recompense of those who wage war against all h and his messenger and do mischief in the land is only that they shall be killed or crucified or their hands and their feet be cut off on the opposite sides or be exiled from the land
1526983 wage war mentioned here means oppose and contradict blocking roads and spreading fear in the fairways

1526997 altmire continues to hold news conferences and issue statements purporting to support utilization of more coal however he has failed to match his actions with his rhetoric it has become a regular event for altmire to pay lip service to a popular issue only to refuse to act on it he continues be in lock step with his washington d c leaders who oppose coal to liquid technology and refuse to schedule a vote on the house floor to move this technology forward to commercial use
1526998 the discharge petition process is obviously not the normal route to getting an important issue to the house floor for up or down vote however jasons chosen speaker of the house nancy pelosi has left few options since she continues to manipulate the voting schedule to prevent energy legislation from being considered with altmires support she has even cancelled committee meetings to avoid votes to open new areas to exploration altmire should sign the discharge petitions to bring this and other energy legislation to the house floor its long overdue that altmire stand up for the best interests of his district and not san francisco

1527004 thanks for this eye opener i got dragged into that kind of discussion on a post on my own blog youre right matthew both tp and wp are different platforms and buy that they also cater to different audiences debating which tool is the ultimate blogging tool is almost like debating which car is the ultimate car neither proponent can win such a discussion i have a typepad blog myself but i have to admit that when i helped a friend set up his blog i did choose wp simply because wp was better suited for what he wanted to achieve i became a big fan of typepad the moment i signed up and started to blog i started a wordpress blog at the same time just for comparison in the end i chose typepad because it suited me better not because it was better per se

1527009 theres a weird squeamishness about blatantly sexual women in the indie rock world everyones dream girls are these birdlike little creatures whose bodies disappear into their cool vintage outfits who are calm and inscrutable and spend their time sewing felt owls onto their bags or reading n 1 instead of indulging their vanity or dancing or screaming into a microphone about guys who fucked them over

1527015 cause really this script is only one guys version of events
1527016 or maybe you show up but what you dont realize is that you got me pregnant and i spent a varying number of years raising a half time lord child without you
1527017 or maybe you find a way to pull me back through the void but you sort of collapse time to do it and no one remembers i was here for so long in the first place
1527018 oh thats a good one tell me more about that one
1527019 or maybe just maybe i find a guy here who i happen to love and hes absolutely nothing like you
1527020 it seems pretty silly when you think of how much gas we use to follow a bike race or to get from each race to the next so offsetting our emissions just makes sense
1527021 some have questioned my authenticity but i am not a fake i have recently returned from a 14 month deployment in iraq and am now on reservist status the purpose of this video is to express my frustration like many soldiers about the discrepancies between my experience in iraq and the perception that the everaga citizen holds more than ever citizens must understand the situation in iraq peace

1527033 its no big secret that the client side of the it environment is one of the last bastions of proprietary technology disproportionately dominated by one vendor
1527034 we have long believed that helping to bring openness and choice to the client desktop is one of the next things to explode in this whole march for linux
1527035 the problem is for most organizations the time is not yet right for linux on the desktop
1527036 windows is not a huge cost when you get it on a new pc and the annual cost to get a supported version of linux with seven years of security fix support could end up costing you more than youre paying for windows windows has at least 10 years of security support and its free
1527037 and that does not even address access database apps or excel macros which may not run on linux or which may require significant migration costs of their own
1527038 for a greenfield environment with no windows apps linux is a viable choice as is apple mac
1527039 but for the typical environments windows apps are too pervasive and entrenched for a switch to make economic sense

1527095 i want to see big intensity see kids willing to step up and not be afraid to step into the blocks to be reckless and not be afraid to lower their shoulder and make the big play
1527096 now you kind of look forward to seeing who can hit and block
1527097 in shorts everyone looks as expected you dont have the contact aspect you dont take any hits and youre mainly running drills and getting to know assignments
1527098 mentally they will need to get tougher and physically make big plays
1527099 well see how they adjust to plays and the mental aspect of the game the game of football is constantly moving how quickly you can move in and out of different plays is big
1527100 after our first scrimmage well have good taste of what they can do
1527101 some kids will move up and down the ladder right now theyre just all fighting to make the starting lineup a lot of positions are available
1527102 its very important that the team is mentally and physically tough they should go the extra mile im looking for tough kids to give us four quarters of football were getting better everyday and were making sure you continue to see progress

1527107 kant aminteste de un imperativ categoric ce vizeaza un scop in sine
1527108 umanitate ne apare ca fiind o entitate ce este plasata in persoana noastra si asupra careia noi ar trebui sa veghem ca la un bun de pret datorita caracteristicilor sale
1527109 ca nu pot dispune de omul din persoana mea sa l mutilez sa l degradez sau sa l ucid

1527126 its time for the iranians to give a serious answer
1527127 one western official who had seen the letter said it added absolutely nothing
1527128 one official described it as more obfuscation and delay to the package
1527129 iran is ready to provide a clear response to your proposal at the earliest possibility while simultaneously expecting to receive your clear response to our questions and ambiguities as well
1527130 such mutual clarification can pave the way for a speedy and transparent negotiating process with bright prospect
1527131 ten years it goes back to our mantra of ten years technology thats associated with the playstation has to have future proof qualities to it i think that were seeing graphically ps3 games starting to create some distance and some of the other competitors are going to feel that theyre getting long in the tooth looking quite dated because they havent created that ten year vision from a horsepower standpoint

1527143 what you saw in the congress this week was the war dance of the handmaidens of the oil companies
1527144 we are spending all of this time on a parliamentary tactic when nothing less is at stake than the planet the air we breathe our children breathe
1527145 to my touch the arms are now firm and dont give in the way they did when we first defrosted her
1527146 the defendant reached across and grabbed the constables crotch squeezing his genitals causing considerable pain
1527147 o actiune este interventia deliberata sau non interventia unei fiinte umane n cauzele naturale
1527148 actioneaza doar conform maximei care ar trebui sa devina n acelasi timp o lege universala si actioneaza astfel nc t sa tratezi umanitatea ca si cum ar fi propria ta persoana sau orice alta persoana niciodata ca si mijloace ci ntotdeauna ca un scop n sine
1527149 epicur se deosebeste de cirenaici si prin faptul ca acestia sustin ca durerile corporale sunt mai rele dec t cele psihice iata de ce raufacatorii sunt supusi la pedepse corporale epicur n schimb sustine ca suferintele sufletesti sunt mai dureroase oricum carnea ndura numai loviturile prezentului mintea nsa pe acelea ale trecutului prezentului si viitorului tot n felul acesta sustine el placerile sufletesti sunt mai mari ca dovada ca placerea este scopul vietii el evoca faptul ca orice vietate de ndata ce se naste mbratiseaza placerea si respinge durerea acest lucru l face de la natura fara sa rationeze
1527150 daca exista un scop al actiunilor noastre pe care l urmarim pentru el nsusi ori pe celelalte numai n vederea acestuia este evident ca acest scop trebuie sa fie binele si anume binele suprem
1527151 atunci c nd am discutat problema daca o conceptie morala trebuie sa fie preocupata n ultima instanta de fericirea umana nu am presupus ca acesta ar fi un alt mod de a ntreba daca nu cumva toate conceptiile morale sunt o forma sau alta de utilitarism
1527152 prin principiul utilitatii ntelegem acel principiu care aproba sau dezaproba orice actiune n conformitate cu traditia si care apare sa o aiba cresterea sau diminuarea fericirii partii al carei interes este afectat ceea ce este similar cu alte cuvinte cu ceea ce promoveaza sau se opune fericirii
1527153 prin utilitate se ntelege acea proprietate a oricarui obiect indiferent daca tinde sa produca beneficiu avantaj placere bine sau fericire sau a preveni nt mplarea unei nenorociri dureri rau sau nefericire partii al carei interes este n discutie
1527154 prin principiul ascetismului nteleg acel principiu care similar principiului utilitatii aproba sau dezaproba orice actiune n conformitate cu tendinta pe care se pare a o avea de a creste sau diminua fericirea partii al carui interes se afla n discutie dar ntr o maniera inversa aproba actiunile n masura n care determina diminuarea fericirii si le dezaproba n cazul n care marcheaza cresterea acesteia
1527155 prin principiul simpatiei sau al antipatiei ntelegem principiul care aproba sau dezaproba anumite actiuni nu n temeiul ca ele ar tinde sa creasca fericirea nici chiar daca ele tind sa diminueze fericirea partii al carei interes este n discutie ci datorita faptului ca o persoana se simte dispusa de a le proba sau dezaproba
1527156 ele pot fi numite sanctiunea fizica politica morala si religioasa
1527157 sa faci altora asa cum vrei sa ti se faca tie
1527158 numai daca putem compara fericirea ce vizeaza oameni diferiti si rezultate diferite si sa adunam totul ntr un fel de fericire generala numai atunci putem face ca lucrurile sa functioneze
1527159 dincolo de orice subzista dificultatea ca multe lucruri pe care oamenii le includ efectiv n continutul vietii fericite sunt lucruri care implica esentialmente alte valori cum ar fi integritatea morala integrity de pilda sau spontaneitatea spontaneity sau libertatea sau dragostea sau exprimarea de tip aristic
1527160 a continuat sa sustina ca fericirea este singurul tel al existentei umane dar conceptia sa despre ceea ce contribuie la atingerea ei s a ndepartat foarte mult de tezele mentorilor sai caci ceea ce el pretuia cel mai mult nu era nici rationalitatea nici satisfactia ci diversitatea mobilitatea si bogatia vietii

1527168 whats that doesnt that mean in popular language that god is disproved but the devil is not
1527169 to be a good philosopher it is necessary to be dry clear without illusions
1527170 my opinion is my opinion someone else has no casual right to it
1527171 so here we are in a realm of having newer and newer chemicals and as new studies come out we realize that weve introduced new levels of danger new complexities and a whole host of effects that the epa isnt even looking for
1527172 until we get the golfers themselves to engage on this issue we cannot expect the right thing to happen
1527173 an adult male with a large body weight might not be that susceptible for youths and women of child bearing age exposure to chemical in even very small amounts at the wrong time can do awful things
1527174 you would be playing on an organic course the maintenance equipment would be charged by solar power recycled water would be used for irrigation and used efficiently and sparingly thered be a greater variety of wildlife habitats
1527175 virtually guarantee the safety of the groundwater 100 was not possible and that was the standard required to approve the club
1527176 our mantra is we strive for excellent playability but that doesnt necessarily mean visual perfection
1527177 when i started it was the fungal diseases that were the most problematic with our cultural practices and the organic fungicides that we use the disease severity is a lot less than it was we also think not proven total anecdotal that there is some natural selection going on we think the grasses are starting to adapt its survival of the fittest disease resistant grasses occurring naturally
1527178 unless golfers begin to have a change or perception and begin to accept those blemishes and has that same mentality as when he goes to st andrews or hoylake and accepts those conditions and finds them charming and has a great round of golf then you can do it the professionals and the tours and golfs hierarchy have to embrace that too the guys who are driving the bus

1527184 ontarios proposed ban on the sale and cosmetic use of pesticides will be the toughest such legislation in north america once it becomes law next year supporters said tuesday
1527185 plus the most important article weve ever published page 196
1527186 remember that every electric golf cart in ontario runs on coal since that is the marginal source of electricity generation
1527187 golf in america will face a crisis over water there simply wont be enough to go around for golf courses to continue to do what they have been doing
1527188 as water management becomes scarcer as organic management practices increase as environmentalism and environmental legislation start to bite more than they have as the economy struggles and as we come to appreciate the aesthetics of golf courses in all their many natural beautiful hues the way the game looks will change and the way it plays will change too with firmer and faster turf demanding a return to shot making creativity the bump and run
1527189 opponents of golf believe its an unnatural environment and that we use too much water fertilizer pesticides and fossil fuels to maintain plant material in an unnatural state
1527190 were going to keep developing better grasses that require less water pesticide fertilizer thats the trend
1527191 in the uk the problems are minor they have the right climate they dont have the problems we have with weed with insects with disease and they dont even have to irrigate their fairways
1527192 well youd rather not have any if you had a choice but your not going to have a golf course if you dont use some
1527193 the american golfer is not yet ready for that change
1527194 well youd rather not have any if you had a choice but your not going to have a golf course if you dont use some
1527195 no there are community workshops too but they can get really contentious with people screaming at each other i much prefer the prison ones
1527196 sylvia graves general secretary of friends united meeting made it clear in responding to questions on thursday morning that at this point in history she sees fums role as being in carrying out overseas mission work
1527197 friends united meeting commits itself through the power of the holy spirit to energize and equip friends to gather people into fellowships where jesus christ is known loved and obeyed as teacher and lord
1527198 i find it fascinating to compare rick warren with james dobson in this story
1527199 this is neither a prescription for a desirable future nor a lament for lost values it is simply an observation about where we are currently headed on the basis of a candid examination of various social trends but the importance of the analysis is that it highlights the radically changing nature of war in such a context
1527200 for gods sake lets also not wait until we have all our theories about cross cultural relationships worked out to perfection take some risks sometimes
1527201 nowadays i have no hesitation in saying that the strongest single bond that unites me with the society of friends is our ecclesiology our conception of the nature of the church of christ
1527202 to develop our knowledge of and insights into the origins and development of the tradition or movement we have committed to
1527203 what would have happened if women had gotten the vote in 1848
1527204 what if the us allowed same sex marriage the first time a couple asked for a marriage license a couple of decades ago
1527205 every yearly meeting that had only one affiliation to a larger body fgc fum efi had their census numbers drop in the last two decades
1527206 i would say this has been an essential role of quakers in history
1527207 are you jealous for me i wish that all the lords people were prophets that the lord would put his spirit on them
1527208 isnt that something the white man is telling me i can be an indian
1527209 snap peas that still had some snap and asparagus that was crisp
1527210 the word of god is a discerner of the thoughts and intents
1527211 spirit who teaches us all things that pertain unto godliness
1527212 we see the ruling as a validation of the stand we have taken these are properties our parishioners have paid for and maintained over the years
1527213 obviously because theyre describing a black shoe this does not match with any of the running shoes that we have found so far
1527214 this would presumably indicate that the foot belongs to a new missing person
1527215 i dont rule that out being part of the ones they found in canada
1527216 once it hits the straits of juan de fuca and it had an outgoing tide if it was carrying it out to the open water and it hit a strong west wind it could kick it out
1527217 so i dont rule it out we find things on beaches all the time that come from all over the world so who knows
1527218 well be consulting with oceanographers yet again to see if that is a possibility and we will be comparing the information obtained from the sherrifs department with our list of missing persons to see if we can make a possible link
1527219 theres a couple of things that come to mind immediately
1527220 in the last couple of years weve had these tsunamis where thousands of people have died you cant help but think is it related to the tsunamis

1527224 in the toxic avenger parts ii iv he toxie has gotten married and had children
1527225 now hell have to deal with his wifes menopause his erectile dysfunction which is a constant erection and his rebellious kid
1527226 how does it feel to be bargaining with the devil for that matter how does it feel to be the devil with whom the downtrodden must bargain
1527227 i observe with profound regret the religious struggles which come into many biographies as if almost essential to the formation of the hero i ought to speak of these to say that any man has an advantage not to be estimated who is born as i was into a family where the religion is simple and rational who is trained in the theory of such a religion so that he never knows for an hour what these religious or irreligious struggles are i always knew god loved me and i was always grateful to him for the world he placed me in i always liked to tell him so and was always glad to receive his suggestions to me i can remember perfectly that when i was coming to manhood the half philosophical novels of the time had a deal to say about the young men and maidens who were facing the problem of life i had no idea whatever what the problem of life was to live with all my might seemed to me easy to learn where there was so much to learn seemed pleasant and almost of course to lend a hand if one had a chance natural and if one did this why he enjoyed life because he could not help it and without proving to himself that he ought to enjoy it a child who is early taught that he is gods child that he may live and move and have his being in god and that he has therefore infinite strength at hand for the conquering of any difficulty will take life more easily and probably will make more of it than one who is told that he is born the child of wrath and wholly incapable of good
1527228 whose soul is of this sky blue tint whose affinities are rather with flowers and birds and all enchanting innocencies than with dark human passions who can think no ill of man or god and in whom religious gladness being in possession from the outset needs no deliverance from any antecedent burden
1527229 i keep hitting my head with a hammer and cant figure out how to stop
1527230 get you drunk and if they dont get you drunk theyll get you high
1527231 how sweet the sound that saved and set me free
1527232 no one shall be persecuted or investigated because of his religion
1527233 we desire therefore in this case not to judge least we be judged neither to condemn least we be condemned but rather let every man stand and fall to his own master
1527234 the power of this world can neither attack us neither excuse us for if god justify who can condemn and if god condemn there is none can justify
1527235 if any of these said persons come in love unto us we cannot in conscience lay violent hands upon them but give them free egress and regress unto our town
1527236 for we are bound by the law of god and man to do good unto all men and evil to no man
1527237 you can not do this you cant burn other peoples property even if you are aggrieved
1527238 i had a part to play in what this became
1527239 we cant pretend we were holier than others lets own up lets face it lets address it
1527240 the covering of girls women so as not to provoke lust in boys men
1527241 it is not often that something wholly new comes to our world we can probably say that something absolutely new never happens the newest form always bears some marks of the old out of which it sprung
1527242 the new like the new moon is born in the arms of the old we have a new word for the breaking in of the new out of the existent old we call it a mutation a mutation is a unique and unpredictable variation in the process of life it is the unexpected appearance of a new type in an old order it is a leap and not a mere dull recurrence of the past something emerges that was not here before something that is not just the sum of the preceding events
1527243 behold i am doing a new thing do you not perceive it
1527244 but you need to get maddy diagnosed so you can help her
1527245 given her increased appetite and energy along with the extreme weight loss she may have some kind of intestinal parasite
1527246 my parents were helping to keep those devastated children alive by importing food and milk and feeding them on a regular basis it was worthy work and i dont fault it but there was a personal cost
1527247 i grew up in a quaker family and for me being quaker was a political calling rather than a religious one
1527248 lisa samson is an artisan of hope here is a book filled with beauty and also with truth in a world that is starved for both
1527249 the blackrobes want us to give up the dream to have only one wife to stop killing our enemies if we obey them we will no longer be hurons and soon our enemies will know our weakness and wipe us from the earth
1527250 is everyone ready to end this part of the meeting and go on to the next
1527251 whether our shared quaker language more accurately reflects what we think our cultural character is supposed to be or what it actually is
1527252 skip the money and jewelry go straight for the pantry
1527253 we dont know how many pandas died in the wild but the habitat loss is very bad
1527254 the statistics from this study confirm what has widely been known not only is a degree critical to getting a job but it is also key to advancing in ones career
1527255 and given the current economic climate a degree might be needed just to keep your job
1527256 the message is loud and clear that in todays competitive job market if you dont have the right education others will pass you by
1527257 we found that 22 of people who started college but didnt finish have been denied a job raise or a promotion what is shocking is that workers are telling us that not having a degree is becoming a significant roadblock in their careers
1527258 its been an unusual spirit of co operation but i think its going to deliver the goods for cleaner air
1527259 its not every day you get a letter from the chemical producers and the sierra club co signed
1527260 the fact that were working in this pressure cooker that anybody can basically torpedo this process by pulling out of it is whats keeping us together
1527261 we all want an alternative to what the federal government originally proposed i think theres a consensus that there are some real fundamental flaws in it
1527262 so we all know that we can only come up with that alternative if we all keep working together
1527263 in some areas we see very high ambient air emissions and in other areas we see less
1527264 so you may manage areas differently depending on how big a problem you have environmentally
1527265 at the end of the day well have to achieve agreement and it remains to be seen whether the government will find this an acceptable attractive alternative to what theyve already proposed
1527266 personal history altered state pennsylvania blackness and the art of being foreign
1527267 this is a very partisan issue before us its very serious and im taking it seriously ive got my papers in order
1527268 hes very humble and he was just as worried about his own rear end as his buddy that was hurt as well
1527269 bob has a crack in the left side of his hip
1527270 the impact that they had the way the doctor described it was that it was like pulling every muscle in his body in one shot
1527271 then he couldnt get a signal again and what he proceeded to do was start texting once he had a contact from search and rescue
1527272 the plane crashed at 7 15 a m and they didnt finally triangulate him until 4 30
1527273 he had very little battery power left and when we were looking at his phone and reading the text messages that went back and forth right smack in the middle was two marketing texts that came in from telus
1527274 i believe this is the first time someone has resorted to texting
1527275 it is good and good to remind people that when a signal is too weak for voice communication you may still be able to communicate by text
1527276 i think they were pulling something like this in an effort to bury the story and bury the issue and not just that but make it impossible for anyone else to respond
1527277 politics as usual when this government promised to stop practising politics as usual
1527278 the timing of the release shows this was not an independent investigation because an independent watchdog would not choose friday at 6 p m to release a report
1527279 the department has nothing further to add after the ministers statement and making the report and summary of actions public
1527280 this is not my preferred method to roll anything out
1527281 but when things start leaking and then the stories say that we are hiding something which we are not only not hiding but scrambling to get out there its a bit unfair its a bit crazy
1527282 maybe your blogger fan base would like to mull on this one
1527283 reacted as if id dropped radio active waste on their toes
1527284 i also want to take this time to extend an olive branch to police chief keith mccaskill so we can sit at a table and talk about how we are going to reduce not only crime but the killing sprees that seem to be enjoyed by the winnipeg police service
1527285 it looks like the winnipeg police service is acting like the top dog or the no 1 gang in the city of winnipeg
1527286 it is unacceptable for the police to have killed our youth
1527287 there are a lot of monday morning quarterbacks out there that are willing to look in hindsight and find fault
1527288 you really have split seconds to make decisions with aggressive armed individuals
1527289 god has no hands but our hands to do his work today
1527290 when i went to the captain i was scarce half a quaker but by their lies and false reports against me they have made me almost a whole quaker or at least i hope to be one
1527291 no i am under a scruple of conscience on the account of the fighting
1527292 he that denies to fight in time of engagement i will put my sword through his guts
1527293 the sword of the lord is over him and if he will have a sacrifice proffer it to him
1527294 the captain is gone let us return to the others
1527295 their testimony against fighting came to them through god working in their hearts
1527296 theres been a concentrated effort over the past 20 years to improve our knowledge and expertise working with elephants and bulls
1527297 we really didnt get a good effort by a lot of different institutions to breed elephants in a co operative manner until the last 15 or 20 years
1527298 theres nothing like being up close to them to realize the size and beauty and intelligence
1527299 theyre under more and more pressure due to habitat loss
1527300 its important to use asian elephants for education and conservation so that people have an appreciation for elephants in the wild and these elephants can act more or less as ambassadors for their species
1527301 great dinner darling of course thats just my opinion and does not reflect the view of friends or western yearly meeting
1527302 hi my name is xxx anything i say is just my opinion and does not reflect the view of friends or western yearly meeting
1527303 in scripture god has always chosen a community to bear witness to gods love and light and work in the world
1527304 were jammin jammin and i hope you like jammin too
1527305 but i have lived and i do live in a spiritual kingdom now
1527306 i was directed to his own perfect example he never separated himself from his people in all their opposition and enmity toward him he did not disown the church of his birthright though it disowned him
1527307 and now as i write this after years of reflection and observation of the effect of promulgating opinions and doctrines not essential in themselves especially on the mission of christ in that prepared body i am confirmed in the belief that it tends to unprofitable discussion and controversy and often to alienation of love for one another had love of god abounded in the heart it would have been seen that obedience to him in all things was the plan of salvation ordained by him from the foundation of the world and we should then have remained a united people of great influence in gathering the nations to the peaceable kingdom of him who was ushered into the world with the anthem
1527308 united people of great influence in gathering the nations to the peaceable kingdom
1527309 from the top of this hill the lord let me see in what places he had a great people to be gathered here the lord opened unto me and
1527310 a series of events recently had me thinking again on why it is that so many young adult friends seem to drift away i have many lines of thought on this phenomenon currently i am pondering how it is that few of my year in qlsp are actively involved with friends
1527311 thursday night after bollings presentation the few young adult friends present at this event gathered together along with a few other yafs who had come over from north carolina yearly meeting conservative which is holding its annual sessions in nearby greensboro

1527315 hey what are you doing your scope is set up go for saturn
1527316 the bible says such and such about whatnot as plain as anything
1527317 its a lot of money but i would argue pretty strenuously the cost of doing nothing is a lot higher
1527318 were waiting for the spirit to guide us and to speak up a bit
1527319 lillian thought she was joining a movement but she was joining a bureaucracy and that bureaucracy tends to quash the passion of the many christ centered and enthusiastic persons therein
1527320 what if the real issue is not the authority of the text but rather the authority of god
1527321 oh no it is not the scriptures and told them it was the holy spirit by which opinions religions and judgments were to be tried for it the holy spirit led into all truth
1527322 look dan i believe jesus is the savior not christianity
1527323 o then i heard a voice which said there is one even christ jesus that can speak to thy condition and when i heard it my heart did leap for joy
1527324 stop counting conversions instead count conversations because conversation implies a real relationship and if we make our goal to establish relationships i know that conversions will happen
1527325 bring all into the worship of god and this is the word of the lord god to you all and a charge to you all in the presence of the living god be patterns be examples in all countries places islands nations wherever you come that your carriage and life may preach among all sorts of people and to them then you will come to walk cheerfully over the world answering that of god in every one whereby in them you may be a blessing and make the witness of god in them to bless you
1527326 behave for all the world other low temperature protestant churches
1527327 that bureaucracy that tends to quash the passion of the many christ centered and enthusiastic persons therein
1527328 i had this experience of my partner after death and he spoke to me and woke me up out of my sleep
1527329 it freaked me out because i really didnt believe in that stuff my faith in god had disappeared when my partner died
1527330 it seemed like more make believe on top of the christian make believe
1527331 i was rejecting one i didnt want to bring in another
1527332 it seems that now in most liberal meetings at least you can always find a few members that identify as pagan

1527336 why are you leading me here you have blessed my work with hospice and i want to stay there why dear lord
1527337 because i want you to grow fully in my love
1527338 what would it be like instead to just start in your street your area gather together a group of people who want to try the radical simple quaker way of living with god reappropriation of the founding charism
1527339 oh and what can you tell us about this dude
1527340 and i say to thee that thou art peter and upon this rock i will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it
1527341 every great cause begins as a movement becomes a business and eventually degenerates into a racket
1527342 all these things that we call familiar are just miracles clothed in the commonplace youll see it if you try in the next strangers eyes god walks around in muddy boots sometimes rags and thats the truth you cant always tell but sometimes you just know
1527343 a dangerous form of information and the perils of instant gratification how many times did i hit my mac want to crawl inside and take the whole thing back
1527344 cocaine makes your face break out im a pretty boy

1527350 the group purpose is to experiment with new design concepts it focuses on food fascination and the power of food to create situations and relationships what characterises arabeschi di latte is a principle of daily sense of happiness pursued through various strategies of participation and alternative functional models that respond to basic and pleasure needs of the social life
1527351 these results when combined with current census and economic data expose a discrepancy between christians who believe they are doing enough and the reality that christians are just scratching the surface in our communities
1527352 would support their church if it occasionally cancelled traditional services in order to donate that time to help the poor in their community
1527353 its also telling the truth which republicans only do by accident
1527354 its also telling the truth which republicans only do by accident
1527355 omg its so hot 91 at 8 p m but why
1527356 the map is the most precise depiction yet of the limits and the future dividing lines that could be drawn across the arctic region
1527357 the results have huge implications for policy making as the rush to carve up the polar region continues
1527358 there has been a lot written about this coming conflict but it is largely based on rather poor geographic information
1527359 we wanted to give a clear visual guide to what the situation really is
1527360 the soviet system meant there was no system for treating people nicely
1527361 all companies are focusing on the russian market in all leisure sectors not just coffee its a country that costa has to be in
1527362 in europe real incomes are not going up due to rising prices but in russia its different
1527363 because the domestic economy is growing like crazy incomes are still going up like crazy
1527364 if i see a new place which i want to go into i do worry what the service will be like
1527365 you pick a place to eat where you know the service will be good
1527366 we were unbelievably frustrated two years ago because we would get these people in and we would just want them to smile and they wouldnt even know why
1527367 the customer five years ago in russia would have been only too happy if within five minutes walk there was a place to have a coffee latte
1527368 in russia the moment you give somebody a title they stop working
1527369 now we give people more money and more responsibility but not a new title
1527370 the citys inspiring its multicultural its diverse and best of all costs are low you only have to sell things every once in a while to get by
1527371 youre poor but youre so free because youve got no responsibilities youre free from the pressures of life
1527372 you have no money but you have so much freedom and time and if doing something creative is what you want to do time is what you need
1527373 you cant put a price on the value of exchanging ideas
1527374 you can meet writers musicians or designers at a cafe and it makes your day youll discover something new or just listen no one cares about money its all secondary
1527375 but i fell in love with the theatre scene and whole way of life its a real buzz
1527376 it may seem rather surprising at first that about half the citys population has come and gone in the last 15 years
1527377 but its due to large numbers who moved to new suburbs just outside berlin after the wall fell and a high number of people especially students and young people who moved in since 1990
1527378 its hard to keep up with everything going on for artists in berlin
1527379 there are loads of gigs loads of readings the english literature scene is thriving
1527380 its significantly less stress filled than for example london rents food and beer are cheap if youre engaged in creating art living costs are extremely important
1527381 if i lived in london i wouldnt be able to spend as much time on my artistic activities in berlin its easier to find the time to write because you dont have to worry about money
1527382 you can manage with even less than 200 euros a month
1527383 a friend has done it for years he finds wood on the streets from construction sites and in trash containers its incredible hes living off the land even in a big city
1527384 buying pre made software is just a short term solution to a long term problem if youre going to get involved with bh
1527385 the tomtom gps is working i consult that six times a day
1527386 the tomtom gps from my car is rather confused to find itself in the middle of the pacific
1527387 i would very much want to make it energy efficient self sufficient
1527388 its hard to tell from the reader comments its a self selecting sample
1527389 but something i set out to do is draw people to the web site in hopes that theyll stick around long enough to get the environmental messages
1527390 i did have to work up to this kind of thing it was incremental i didnt go from an office job to rowing across an ocean
1527391 my first thought was that is the best idea ive ever had of course my second thought was that was without a doubt the worst idea ive ever had
1527392 the number of incidents suggests that these organizations do not have an effective data access control framework
1527393 if you click on the link you get a window that shows the progress of an automatic download of a so called new version of adobe flash which is supposedly required to watch the video you end up with a file labeled adobe flash its a fake on your machine a technique that is currently very popular
1527394 a spammer or phisher could abuse this vulnerability to gain thousands of followers and attempt social engineering attacks
1527395 stateless computing isnt about having no state its kind of a misnomer its about where that state is stored since the emergence of the pc in the early 80s we have stored the state on the physical computer and that has presented a myriad of challenges that has driven it costs through the roof
1527396 stateless computing isnt about having no state its kind of a misnomer its about where that state is stored
1527397 the key to this is the version the idea is to put everything you view whether its an application or library you put it into this file system so therefore you never have this problem of an it industry created problem of the software stack
1527398 if you placed every little thing that you had a config file everything into a version name space and then you were able to build your applications against that and all the dependencies for applications were referable in this file system there would be no need to ever build a stack because every application would inherently know what its dependents were and would all be retrievable through this global file system
1527399 the final guide we have this year is to think of them in an e10 context that doesnt mean it wont change but this fall they wont be able to blow each others heads off
1527400 worship is here considered in its deepest sense as the response of man to the eternal and when we look at the many degrees and forms of this response and the graded character of human religion its slow ascent from primitive levels and tendency to carry with it the relics of the past we need not be surprised that even within the christian family there is much diversity in the expressive worship which is yet directed towards a single revelation of the divine
1527401 what is new about this retrieval is that it is a quest for something old and its modus operandi is not a technique but a turning back epistrophe
1527402 habit tends to routine and spiritual red tape the vice of the institutionalist attention is apt to care for nothing but the experience of the moment and ignor the need of a stable practice independent of personal fluctuations the vice of the individualist habit is a ritualist attention is a pietist but it is the beautiful combination of order and spontaneity docility and freedom living humbly and therefore fully and freely within the agreed pattern of the cultus and not in defiance of it which is the mark of genuine spiritual maturity and indeed the fine flower of a worshipping life
1527403 it was surrounded by a number of small ritual observances which can easily be dismissed as formal or superstitious but were really directed like the small external pieties of the good catholic to the sanctifying of all the common events of everyday life by a constant and humble remembrance of the claims of the eternal god and his law
1527404 in our day christian disciplines and practices must act as antidotes to the attempt to shape our personhood through consumerism technology and the myriads to pasnopticanlike institutions of the corporation state
1527405 the bent and stress of their ministry was conversion to god regeneration and holiness not schemes of doctrines and verbal creeds or new forms of worship but a leaving off in religion the superfluous and reducing the ceremonious and formal part and pressing earnestly the substantial the necessary and profitable part as all upon a serious reflection must and do acknowledge
1527406 the significance or meaning of the doctrine of the real presence can be paraphrased or summarized theologically but it cannot be fully understood except when it is connected with the ritual practices of the community that holds the doctrine
1527407 it points past all signs and symbols to the invisible holy trusts the immanent presence with men of the invisible holy and perpetually reminds us of the awe and humility the pause the hush the deliberate break with succession with which man should approach the great experience of communion with teh living god not hurrying into the exercise of these things so soon as teh bell rings as other christians do

1527410 the commander in chief and those under him authorized a systematic regime of torture the only question that remains to be answered is whether those who ordered the use of torture will be held to account
1527411 the ranking members of the senate and house intelligence committees were briefed dozens of times about the cias interrogation and detention program over the past seven years so any member who has held one of those posts including speaker pelosi would find it very hard at this point to point the finger at the white house without also implicating themselves

1527508 in the end however my impression is that boultons witness so far is incomplete in that it fails to point the way ahead it isnt only a matter of smashing false idols it must also include a call of repentence and turning to the living god judging from this talk only not having read much of his other stuff i fear that boulton is simply substituting a different idol for the one hes just smashed

1527636 it would be from my personal experience i found myself at the end of universal good but this is not to deny the validity of those who find themselves predisposed to the universal sin and guilt in my own view to claim that universal sin exists is to claim that all are good any way i cannot step out of my mind cure vantage point it is the glue of my unity the concept that man himself is all sinful is to me unacceptable for it is not sin if every man is inherently involved in it that sin is also meaningless for all sin lead to personal transcendence and therefore is inherently good for if sin leads one to transcendence then it served a purpose not wholly evil
1527637 all good actions come from an attempt to repent from a universal sin and banishment from god that man sins consistently and repeatedly it is in throwing himself into a gods arms that he absolves himself of his flaw this flaw is the result of original fall of man himself from god

1527958 everythings terrible anyhow everybody thinks so the most advanced people and i know ive been everywhere and seen everything and done everything god im sophisticated
1527959 the fact that he had one a mistress was insisted upon wherever he was known
1527960 making a short deft movement tom buchanan broke her nose with his open hand
1527961 what realism knew when to stop cut the pages but what do you want what do you expect
1527962 safer on a plane where any divergence from a code would be thought impossible
1527963 so my first impression that he was a person of the undefined consequence had gradually faded and he had become simply the proprietor of an elaborate road house next door
1527964 trying to forget something very sad that had happened to me long ago
1527965 there are only the pursued the pursuing the busy and the tired
1527966 unlike gatsby and tom buchanan i had no girl whose disembodied face floated along the dark cornices and blinding signs and so i drew up the girl beside me tightening my arms
1527967 americans while occasionally willing to be serfs have always been obstinate about being peasantry
1527968 he had passed visibly through two states and was entering upon a third after his embarrassment and his unreasoning joy he was consumed with wonder at her daisy presence he had been full of the idea so long dreamed it right through to the end waited with his teeth set so to speak at an inconceivable pitch of intensity now in the reaction he was running down like an overwound clock
1527969 id like to get one of those pink clouds and put you in it and push you around
1527970 there must have been moments even that afternoon when daisy tumbled short of his dreams not through her own fault but because of the colossal vitality of his illusion it had gone beyond everything
1527971 gatsby knew that when he kissed this girl and forever wed his unutterable visions to her perishable breath his mind would never romp again like the mind of god so he waited listening for a moment longer to the tuning fork that had been struck upon a star then he kissed her at his lips touch she blossomed for him like a flower and the incarnation was complete
1527972 the immediate contingency overtook him tom pulled him back from the edge of the theoretical abyss
1527973 there is no confusion like the confusion of a simple mind and as we drove away tom was feeling the hot whips of panic his wife and his mistress until an hour ago secure and inviolate were slipping precipitately from his control
1527974 breathless intensity ripe mystery romances lavender following of the grail luxury of star shine kissed her dark shining hair
1527975 theyre a rotten crowd youre worth the whole damn bunch put together
1527976 im thirty im five years too old to lie to myself and call it honor
1527977 i couldnt forgive him tom or like him but i saw that what he had done was to him entirely justified it was all very careless and confused they were careless people tom and daisy they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness or whatever it was that kept them together
1527978 why should i change what has worked for me for years just because somebody bigger comes in
1527979 i installed the 2 0 firmware on the edge iphone on friday
1527980 i have noticed that every once in a while the phone will re boot itself when i click one of the new application icons it has happened with more than one application so i dont know if the applications are coded wrong or if the 2 0 firmware has bugs
1527981 lo and behold the darn bug fixes appear to have worked
1527982 i havent had any application crash since updating the firmware crashes were pretty consistent prior to updating
1527983 weve seen an explosion of retail growth and traffic in our city
1527984 but weve had the same number of dispatchers working for us

1527986 if i can help someone know what happened to a loved one then that would be a step toward healing
1527987 were just very different people the same things that im very attracted to in her are the same things that made a relationship with her difficult shes very emotionally volatile very passionate which is great but at the same time that can present a challenge in a relationship were good friends shes definitely a sweetheart but i just think we werent very compatible i still wish her the best and i think shes going to be very successful with her acting career

1527990 hay un contrabando donde se esta tratando de imponer a la sociedad democr tica venezolana decisiones que ya fueron rechazadas
1527991 yo le propondr a presidenta que esta parlamento designe una comisi n especial donde est n todos los factores pol ticos para que haga una revisi n de estas leyes nosotros nos comprometemos a que todos estos aspectos sean favorables a los sectores populares pero no pueden permitir que un capricho de insistir en una reforma que fue absolutamente rechazada por el pa s se trate de imponer por la v a de atajos jur dicos que son construidos desde el ejecutivo sin que ni siquiera se haya hecho ninguna consulta
1527992 somos ocho parlamentarios los diputados de podemos por qu esa posici n siempre de negar ante el pa s una realidad y lo que qued demostrado es que aqu se pueden decir cosas mayoritariamente pero la sociedad tambi n las puede aceptar
1527993 aqu hay cosas que uno por encima puede ver yo tengo ah el tiempo que lleva la sesi n tratando de revisar este peque o paquete de 26 leyes que es cuando formalmente ha legado a nuestras manos yo me imagino que los diputados que han intervenido tienen una capacidad de an lisis que yo se las admiro pero yo no la tengo para poder analizar en este corto tiempo un problema que es tan profundo debatir y discutir
1527994 el problema es que nosotros podamos explicarle al pa s que esta asamblea nacional que habilit al presidente para que aprobara un conjunto de leyes entre gallos y media noche el ultimo d a puso unos t tulos de las leyes en las p ginas web del gobierno o poder judicial para que el pa s empezara a asimilar lo que ven a detr s de ella de eso se trata este debate compa eros
1527995 s ser aplastada la propuesta del diputado ismael garc a
1527996 nosotros en este debate no estamos planteando de ninguna manera la revisi n de las 66 leyes aprobadas 40 anteriores y 26 ltimas no est planteada aqu la revisi n esas leyes desde el mismo momento que salieron en gaceta oficial est n vigentes y son leyes de la rep blica
1527997 farmers have lost the art of thinking the experts come along the vet would make his sales pitch the fertiliser company the drench company would make theirs do what youre told and youll get good results and the majority of farmers went down that path not understanding why
1527998 habl con el presidente y dijo que esa diputada no ha solicitado ninguna autorizaci n esta se ora diputada est descaradamente violando el parlamento interior mal poniendo el parlamento del mercosur
1527999 lo que indica que la semana pasada adriana pe a no ten a ninguna autorizaci n
1528000 es hoy cuando est solicitando la autorizaci n lo que quiere decir que lo que se alo la semana pasada esta haciendo violaci n del reglamento el reglamento establece un qu rum reglamentario y debe haber un acta de votaci n
1528001 ella no viene en funciones de diputada mucho menos en funciones del mercosur viene como una persona normal a ver el proceso se va a reunir con sus amigos de la oposici n leopoldo l pez y oscar p rez pero no la asumimos como una misi n oficial del mercosur
1528002 what i dont get is these people come in and buy up property yet they tell me that my house is an eyesore when theyre the ones who just moved in here does that make sense to you
1528003 we never had any money but mom and dad were always adding on to the house
1528004 now two points one they know theyre lying about what my energy plan is but the other thing is theyre making fun of a step that every expert says would absolutely reduce our oil consumption by 3 to 4 percent its like these guys take pride in being ignorant
1528005 maybe theres something about returning to the same place year after year
1528006 im open to all three right now and thats where my mindset is
1528007 were all anxious to get to one i know i am and then again im not
1528008 its early in camp theres a lot of work to get done i want to know if we do have to go to another if we get to a second quarterback or a third something like that what is he capable of doing so this is a valuable time for us this is not just trying to find out whos no 1 this is also trying to find out who gives us a chance our very best chance to win
1528009 there is a sense of familiarity with the offense and im trying to grow from that
1528010 what i really try to do is get better and better every day my job is to be ready
1528011 its evident that hes been in it because with the limited reps hes had so far if it was all new to him this year he wouldnt be where hes at
1528012 so he is further ahead that is one of the reasons too we felt early in training camp in fairness to the other two guys we needed to get them up to speed because j t does have a year under his belt
1528013 weve only been here a week so its still early but thats an important decision i dont want to sell us short its going to happen on the field its going to happen in fairness and three guys are competing for it
1528014 its not going to be 100 percent fair with reps practice snaps but were doing the best we can
1528015 theres a pretty big difference between all three of them with their personalities
1528016 its probably why they get along as a group pretty well if two of them were like j t there might be some in house duking
1528017 and if there were two of them like alex or shaun its just not enough competition its a good complement for one another kind of like opposites attract
1528018 im been studying fullback tight end slot wide receiver i can do all those things i can line up in the backfield the wing or the slot im fired up because im in the rotation a lot more i expect a lot out of myself this season
1528019 just because our offense wasnt productive last year doesnt mean that we cant see who a good player is
1528020 hes a good character guy the kind of guy that you want to sign early and keep him around
1528021 id like to know what the 31 other teams are doing with it it would help me
1528022 obviously the whole premise of the thing is to make sure people quit stealing signals as we saw last year what occurred last year with the new england patriots is not right so this will eliminate all that and stay focused on the game and the way it should be played with integrity and sportsmanship
1528023 i dont want to talk numbers nothing im just going to go out there try to stay healthy try to play hard and just give it all i have you know

1528104 today freddie mac and the nations other major mortgage finance company fannie mae are in such perilous condition that the federal government has readied a taxpayer financed bailout that could cost billions though the current housing crisis would have undoubtedly caused problems at both companies freddie mac insiders say mr syron heightened those perils by ignoring repeated recommendations
1528105 mr syron received a memo stating that the firms underwriting standards were becoming shoddier and that the company was becoming exposed to losses according to mr andrukonis and two others familiar with the document
1528106 mr andrukonis was not the only cautionary voice at freddie mac at the time according to many executives mr syron was also warned that the firm needed to expand its capital cushion but instead that safety net shrank mr syron was told to slow the firms mortgage purchases instead they accelerated
1528107 but frankly if i had perfect foresight i would never have taken this job in the first place
1528108 mr syron has collected more than 38 million in compensation since 2003
1528109 stock prices at both companies freddie mac amp fannie mae have fallen by more than 60 percent since february destroying more than 80 billion of shareholder value
1528110 mr syron and the fannie mae chief executive daniel h mudd defended their choices saying in interviews that they did not anticipate that the housing market would decline so quickly and that they were buffeted by conflicting pressures
1528111 sure its hard to deal with the pressures of congress and shareholders and regulators
1528112 mr syron joined freddie mac as chief executive and chairman in 2003 after the company revealed it had manipulated earnings by almost 5 billion he came to freddie mac after serving as chairman of the thermo electron corporation a scientific instruments firm and of the american stock exchange
1528113 mr mudd was promoted to chief executive of fannie mae the following year after that company was also accused of accounting errors totaling 6 3 billion his compensation has totaled more than 42 million
1528114 by the time both men took over the firms had perfected the art of making money by capitalizing on the perception they were implicitly backed by the government that belief allowed fannie and freddie to borrow at relatively low rates and use those funds to buy mortgages as investments the companies also collected fees in exchange for guaranteeing that borrowers would repay other home loans
1528115 by the end of 2007 the firms held mortgages worth more than 1 4 trillion combined and guaranteed payments on loans worth 3 5 trillion more
1528116 both firms had sophisticated systems to hedge against risks but they remained exposed to one unlikely but potentially catastrophic possibility a wide scale decline in national home prices the only real protection against such a downfall was purchasing only the safest loans
1528117 however the companies were constantly under pressure to buy riskier mortgages
1528118 mr syron and mr mudd eventually yielded to those pressures effectively wagering that if things got too bad the government would bail them out
1528119 everybody understood that at some level the company was putting taxpayers at risk
1528120 for years the companies collected rich profits but some executives grew increasingly concerned
1528121 mr andrukonis wrote his memo in 2004 at the time he also briefed the risk oversight committee of the board of directors but did not share his memo with them he said a member of that committee declined to return phone calls
1528122 in 2007 as home prices were falling and defaults rising in some areas people at both firms urged their chief executives to scale back on mortgage purchases fannie mae shrunk its mortgage portfolio slightly
1528123 mr syrons freddie mac however increased its portfolio by 17 billion
1528124 that same year the companies posted combined losses of 5 2 billion this year they have announced losses of 2 4 billion and analysts say they may lose an additional 24 billion or more
1528125 last month after weeks of rumors and bad news investors began dumping the companies shares driving their stock prices down almost 60 percent apiece the selling did not subside until mr paulson unveiled a rescue plan with powers to inject billions of taxpayer dollars into the companies
1528126 the law signed by president bush last week also gives the government sweeping new regulatory control over the firms
1528127 hey america im paris hilton and im a celebrity too only im not from the olden days and im not promising change like that other guy

1528145 heck we didnt know how to act because it wasnt 104 degrees it was nice guys had a lot of energy ive learned that if the weather is hot im hot if its cold im cold
1528146 we have some guys that are really playing well im really proud of those guys in the two deep that are challenging each other so thats very encouraging
1528147 competition is healthy in everything thats what makes the world go round i would like to think if i was the only person standing there that i would do the best i could do every second that im doing it i think to a true competitor it doesnt make any difference

1528159 the only way john mccain and republicans figure theyre going to win this election is if they make you scared of me
1528160 theres no doubt in my mind that what senator obama is trying to suggest that hes a victim of something
1528161 were not going to run a campaign like he did in the primary every time somebody brings up a challenge to who you are and what you believe youre a racist thats not going to happen in this campaign
1528162 john mccain and the republicans they dont have any new ideas thats why theyre spending all their time talking about me i mean you havent heard a positive thing out of that campaign in in a month all they do is try to run me down and you know you know this in your own life but since they dont have any new ideas the only strategy theyve got in this election is to try to scare you about me theyre going to try to say that im a risky guy theyre going to try to say well you know hes got a funny name and he doesnt look like all the presidents on the dollar bills and the five dollar bills and and theyre going to send out nasty emails and you know the latest one theyve got me in an ad with paris hilton you know never met the woman but but you know what theyre gonna try to argue is that somehow im too risky
1528163 apparently obama is by falsely accusing john mccain and republicans of trying to
1528164 doesnt look like all the presidents on the dollar bills and the five dollar bills
1528165 im so overexposed im making paris hilton look like a recluse
1528166 beware of b hussein obama hes too risky because hes not white

1528278 the discharge petition process is obviously not the normal route to getting an important issue to the house floor for up or down vote however jasons chosen speaker of the house nancy pelosi has left few options since she continues to manipulate the voting schedule to prevent energy legislation from being considered with altmires support she has even cancelled committee meetings to avoid votes to open new areas to exploration altmire should sign the discharge petitions to bring this and other energy legislation to the house floor its long overdue that altmire stand up for the best interests of his district and not san francisco
1528279 through the first six months of 2008 we issued 11 8 billion in term ffelp asset backed securities including 7 1 billion in the second quarter the all in cost of this issuance in the quarter was 140 basis points over libor since the close of the quarter we securitized an additional 1 6 billion at an all in cost of 85 basis points over libor
1528280 we will take advantage of the funding program provided by the department and this will allow us to reduce our reliance on our asset backed financing facility and ultimately replace it with a smaller and significantly less costly facility in the future
1528281 consistent with our announcement in the first quarter that we were tightening our private lending standards including ceasing non traditional lending completely private education loan originations declined 24 to 891 million in the quarter
1528282 i think the pricing ranges that you are referring to libor say 800bp or so are approximately right
1528283 demand for liquidity to fund our business is going to be limited to our private credit portfolios which we would expect to originate about 7 billion in total this year
1528284 in terms of application flows that we are seeing in to our centers today historically july is one of our busiest months and its been much lighter than expected principally because of the increase in loan limits that took place in the schools needing to update their software and their financial aid management systems to accommodate that higher loan level increase so weve seen a number of schools who have been late in terms of processing applications
1528285 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammed atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operation link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade

1528311 our long term goal should be to alter our lifestyle accordingly beginning in infancy or early childhood
1528312 instituting a low saturated fat low cholesterol diet in infancy 7 months is perfectly safe without adverse effects
1528313 our review of the literature convinces us that more aggressive and earlier intervention will probably prevent considerably more than 30 of coronary heart disease
1528314 studies show that fatty streak lesions in the arteries that are a precursor to atherosclerosis and heart disease begin in childhood and advanced lesions are not uncommon by age 30 why not nip things in the bud
1528315 the weapons for those wars education and behavior modification are the same as those needed for a war on coronary heart disease
1528316 a concerted national effort might dramatically reduce morbidity and mortality due to three major chronic diseases it would take generations to achieve and it would require an all out commitment of money and manpower to reeducate and modify the behavior of a nation is that impossible no we have already shown that even a frankly addictive behavior like cigarette smoking can be overcome eventually
1528317 when we first prescribed highly active antiretroviral therapy for hiv in 1995 we were concerned about how these drugs changed lipid levels in patients and whether they would increase atherosclerosis and ultimately lead to serious heart disease
1528318 while some studies have found an association between these antiretroviral treatments and increased risk of cardiovascular disease we believe our findings should reassure clinicians that using antiretroviral therapy over time does not appear to put patients at greater risk for coronary atherosclerosis and may in fact be more beneficial than we had initially thought
1528319 this was not surprising since these are the major risk factors for atherosclerosis in the general population
1528320 the purpose of our study however was to investigate whether long term haart usage was a major risk factor
1528321 these results could be due in part to lower lipid values of hiv infected men prior to beginning antiretroviral therapy and high use of lipid lowering drugs the key is that controlling risk factors for atherosclerosis should be a priority
1528322 what remains to be determined is whether use of the newest antiretroviral therapies confers an even better outcome and whether lipid lowering therapies will further improve cardiovascular risk in the hiv infected population our future research will address these questions
1528323 there is no doubt that the technique has potential in the industry for recycling nonmetallic materials of pcbs
1528324 at first we had no idea what it was it could have been in our solar system or at the edge of the universe
1528325 we think that in the recent past the galaxy ic 2497 hosted an enormously bright quasar
1528326 because of the vast scale of the galaxy and the voorwerp light from that past still lights up the nearby voorwerp even though the quasar shut down sometime in the past 100 000 years and the galaxys black hole itself has gone quiet
1528327 from the point of view of the voorwerp the galaxy looks as bright as it would have before the black hole turned off its this light echo that has been frozen in time for us to observe
1528328 its rather like examining the scene of a crime where although we cant see them we know the culprit must be lurking somewhere nearby in the shadows
1528329 the strange hannys voorwerp looks like it could be the nearest example of a luminous quasar
1528330 ic 2497 is so close that if the quasar was still shining today on a good night you could probably see it with a small telescope
1528331 the nearest active quasar called 3c 273 is 1 7 billion light years further away
1528332 this discovery really shows how citizen science has come of age in the internet world
1528333 hannys attentiveness alerted us not only to a peculiar object but to a window into the cosmic past which might have eluded us for a long time otherwise trying to understand the processes operating here has proven to be a fascinating challenge involving a whole range of astrophysical techniques and instruments around the world and beyond this has also been some of the most rewarding astronomy ive done in years
1528334 when we launched galaxy zoo we were overwhelmed as was the internet portal initially with the outpouring of public interest and volunteer input
1528335 its amazing to think that this object has been sitting in the archives for decades and that amateur volunteers can help by spotting things like this online
1528336 it was a fantastic present to find out on my 25th birthday that we will get observational time on the hubble space telescope to follow up this discovery
1528337 epidemiologic observations of sex differences in the onset and course of schizophrenia prompted exploration of estrogens role in schizophrenia
1528338 estrogens neuroprotective and psychoprotective actions may be mediated by a variety of routes ranging from rapid actions including antioxidant effects and enhancement of cerebral blood flow and cerebral glucose utilization to slower genomic mechanisms which may include permanent modification of neural circuits
1528339 the lack of effect for negative symptoms is consistent with literature reporting that negative symptoms are less responsive to treatment than other symptoms of schizophrenia it is possible that longer term treatment is required for negative symptoms to respond to treatment alternatively brain regions implicated in negative symptoms may be less responsive to gonadal hormone effects
1528340 estrogen treatment is a promising new area for future treatment of schizophrenia and potentially for other severe mental illnesses
1528341 it raises some real concerns with the tactics of the nra if theyve got one person maybe they have more if theyve done this dirty trick what else have they done
1528342 if theyre open meetings it may be underhanded and sneaky it may not be illegal
1528343 to have somebody that i consider a friend have been with dozens of times shared meals with treated as a friend to have her be an employee a subcontracted spy for the nra is just mind boggling its so venal
1528344 in the battle of ideas with the gun lobby were at a constant disadvantage because were honest
1528345 i feel flattered that the nra would feel that they would have to infiltrate ceasefire of pa obviously theyre hearing our footsteps
1528346 frankly i think its a waste of their money we dont deal in state secrets
1528347 he either backed away and fell or the tiger jumped on him
1528348 she dragged him to what she would have thought of as safety
1528349 while there is no doubt a 300 pound animal with two inch canines caused his injuries there is no doubt he would not have survived if this was an aggressive attack
1528350 the tigers managed to get him by the throat and neck area and drag him into the water
1528351 this is what dakoda would have wanted what his family wanted
1528352 the map is the most precise depiction yet of the limits and the future dividing lines that could be drawn across the arctic region
1528353 the results have huge implications for policy making as the rush to carve up the polar region continues
1528354 there has been a lot written about this coming conflict but it is largely based on rather poor geographic information
1528355 we wanted to give a clear visual guide to what the situation really is
1528356 does anyone out there think john mccain is too computer illiterate to be president anyone have a hard time relating to him and his having to rely on his wife for all the assistance he can get
1528357 omg ru kidding mai preznit must haz teh l33t sk1llz 1
1528358 if he dont know how to do the google he aint getting anywhere near my tubes smileyface wink smileyface
1528359 im voting for mccain because i know he never uses the computer to visit pron sites
1528360 at least we dont have to worry about him losing the social security trust fund in an online poker game or sending it all to some spammer in nigeria
1528361 our integration of arrays of nanowires that perform separate functions and are made of heterogeneous substances and doing this in a way that can be reproduced on a large scale in a controlled way is a first
1528362 our main objective is a route toward integrated nanowire arrays that we can produce on any substrate even paper and to reproduce them uniformly on a large scale
1528363 to do that over the past two years our group has developed methods of printing nanowire arrays after first growing the nanowires on a donor substrate we transfer them to any desired substrate including paper or plastic
1528364 nanowires grow sticking out in random directions they look like a bad hair day
1528365 is like combing the hair to make it stand up straight
1528366 to fabricate the integrated circuitry we had to position the two kinds of materials at precise locations on the receiver substrate
1528367 the pattern for the device was on a photoresist layer coated on the substrate first we printed the cadmium selenide nanowires onto the substrate then removed the photoresist with acetone leaving the cadmium selenide nanowires exactly where we wanted them we repeated the process for the germanium silicon nanowires
1528368 in the future we can foresee using a variety of different optical sensors to create nanoscale devices sensitive to multiple colors in high resolution
1528369 and thats just the beginning we contemplate printing nanowire sensor circuitry photosensors chemical sensors biosensors not on silicon but on paper or plastic tape this could be used easily and with instant results where spills have occurred or to test air quality or to test for disease organisms almost any use for a sensor that you can imagine
1528370 i think the venture industry is somewhat challenged and can have an adverse effect on entrepreneurs by forcing the business into the venture model
1528371 having been in the venture capital industry ive seen too many horror stories with this company i wanted to be sure to follow my convictions
1528372 consideramos que eso sin duda afecta esas celebraciones pero fundamentalmente afecta a sucre que se merec a una celebraci n y una sesi n de honor del congreso nacional

1528381 qu me pruebe el gobierno primeramente que yo soy un paramilitar que yo soy el culpable de los muertos en qu momento yo he complotado en el pa s para tener un compromiso con la derecha
1528382 para m este gobierno es reformista es un gobierno que ha traicionado la agenda de octubre yo m s bien dijera que est de acuerdo con algunos puntos de la derecha por eso es que l evo morales respeta a la propiedad y no ha habido una verdadera nacionalizaci n

1528386 es bueno que la ciudadan a y en especial las personas con discapacidad conozcan la realidad de que fueron utilizados y manipulados por la oposici n con la intenci n de parar el referendo revocatorio del pr ximo 10 de agosto

1528390 picture this woman who is very tiny and ask yourself how she engaged in armed conflict with six military men
1528391 despite being shot siddiqui struggled with the officers when they tried to subdue her she struck and kicked them while shouting in english that she wanted to kill americans
1528392 what a mockery that after five years in detention aafia is suddenly discovered in afghanistan
1528393 aafia was tortured for five years until one day us authorities announce that they have found her in afghanistan which shows how they abused their power and tortured an innocent woman without committing any crime
1528394 shes very traumatized very fragile she doesnt know where her children are
1528395 i have lost all hope and am not keen on taking the fight to the supreme court i have lost strength but i know i must accept what god has in store for me
1528396 i have to be a mother now and i am not running away from it my baby despite its ailment is now the joy i look forward to
1528397 it may take some time by which my pregnancy would have progressed and i wonder if it would then be prudent to go for abortion

1528406 the whole exercise of exemption is based on certain conditions which did not exist before like the 123 agreement and the iaea safeguards agreement is it realistic to expect that the nsg would grant the exemption without reference to any of these documents would such references be considered conditional or not
1528407 the whole exercise of the deal is based on certain conditions that india put forward in the joint statement of 2005 how can the nsg not take note of those conditions if india takes the position that no conditions will be acceptable a situation may arise when india will have to walk away from the deal at that stage hopefully india has its own understanding as to what unconditional exemption means a certain flexibility in this position is essential to carry the deal through

1528410 they really went right down the middle to straddle that fence as best they could
1528411 the only thing you can expect from the fed for the next five months is open mouth policy talk up the dangers of inflation but no action
1528412 although talking tough is all they can really do at this point if it quells some of the inflation jitters in the marketplace consumers could ultimately benefit through lower mortgage rates and lower inflation would deliver some real returns to savers pocketbooks
1528413 not really giving us any positive indication at this point
1528414 flouting the world court ruling would be yet another blight on americas already tarnished international reputation
1528415 should play its part in ensuring that the united states abides by the commitments undertaken when it signed and ratified the vienna convention and the u n charter
1528416 mexico has a big yard down there full of filth and murders and gangs and drug cartels and theyre not mentioning anything about that
1528417 i dont want sympathy or pity id rather have your anger
1528418 dont feel sorry for me im where im at because i made an adolescent choice thats it
1528419 i just think under cloak and dagger theyre trying to reach out and grab something
1528420 i believe instead of playing this game he should reach out to his creator he needs to spend his time praying to his creator for mercy and forgiveness
1528421 the role itself the villain the contravida and wenn i cant say no to wenn and the role
1528422 lagi lang ako bida o nanay ng bida na inaapi so gusto kong ibahin totally different so hindi pa ako masyadong makaporma but definitely the look and the character is there here im bad bad the main villain
1528423 madami mahirap kasi tapos first time ko pa first time kong mag fantasy first time kong mag contravida role so kapa ako every taping panganay ang tawag ko every taping nanganganay mahirap hindi ko alam kung paano i attack
1528424 ayaw ko naman ng caricature gusto ko ako pa din iyong jaclyn jose na serious ayaw ko naman iyong nakakatuwa o iyong mukhang bruha o ma identify sa iba nating friends na identified to doing that type of role meaning iyong mga contravidas natin

1528429 i told the people of north cotabato with the restrained armed forces we might have to defend ourselves i know we will be losing lives shedding blood we will have to make sacrifices
1528430 pag na tro kami diyan bahala na kayo sa sarili ninyo we are not going to sacrifice the lives of the soldiers to defend you
1528431 a lot of homes have been burned down livestock were taken and crops harvested by the rebels and yet the armed forces has maintained what they call active defensive stance
1528432 esperons statement is giving credence on what is happening on the ground
1528433 it looks like its exaggerated to do some drama maybe to get the people awake
1528434 would you believe pi ol that the military will not do a thing to protect the civilians

1528437 that is the position of the milf but we have processes the supreme court will make that ruling
1528438 refrain from acts that would defeat the object and purpose of the agreement

1528440 despite tabloid speculation mary kate olsen had nothing whatsoever to do with the drugs found in heath ledgers home or his body and she does not know where he obtained them
1528441 regarding the governments investigation at ms olsens request we have provided the government with relevant information including facts in the chronology of events surrounding mr ledgers death and the fact that ms olsen does not know the source of the drugs mr ledger consumed
1528442 we dont know the source of the information being quoted in the media regarding the governments inquiry but these descriptions are incomplete and inaccurate
1528443 yo can i take it back to where it all started
1528444 it was hard for me to perform the first song because when i see 100 000 people singing along theres only one person i could think of whos missing tonight
1528445 this performance is for my mama the woman who drove me to chicago at the age of 3 and said baby
1528446 thats the beauty i think of writing vague but powerful lyrics that someone like a movie director can interpret it in his own way and obviously someone creative is able to take the metaphors and apply them to whatever he needs in his own life
1528447 the main theme of the video is the human element of forgiveness and someone doing you wrong you feeling resentment and you being able to see through that in the next situation that might be similar and not take your rage or resentment out on the next person and basically keep spreading the disease of that through life
1528448 the one thing that i wasnt keen on here was metallica plugging into a modern war or a current event that might be construed as some sort of political statement on our part
1528449 there are so many celebrities that soapbox their opinions and people believe its more valid because theyre popular
1528450 metallica has never plugged into any current event visually but this one is kind of a hotbed people have very high opinions about this war and were trying to cut through all of that the politics and the religion tend to separate people and what were trying to do is bring it together with the common thread of resentment and forgiveness
1528451 its a story about human beings who dont know each other in a particularly tense situation
1528452 it could be a contemporary war setting but its really about forgiveness and redemption and understanding what goes on in peoples minds we really feel that this was such a beautiful and epic way to treat the song in something that was really radically different than the specificity of the lyrics
1528453 due to the huge success of dance my summer will be taken up by travels to south africa australia and canada to work on local versions of the show
1528454 i will step back from my day to day producing work on american idol and will be devoting my time to a new venture with simon fuller
1528455 ive worked with nigel for over 10 years and he is the best producer i have ever worked with
1528456 we are a great team and have shared phenomenal success under our stewardship 19 has grown into a formidable force and we are now looking at developing a number of shows through a new joint venture
1528457 the girl said that she misses her mother very much and when she asked her uncle merrill jessop about where her mother is living he has told her it was none of her business so she has just gotten to the point that she had stopped asking
1528458 be a good mother and have as many children as the heavenly father wants her to have
1528459 this decline is not surprising given the state of the economy
1528460 however the b to b event business remains relatively strong up 2 4 and both custom publishing and digital continue to grow at 20 so as we look at the industry holistically although its a tough year b to b is resilient
1528461 may be to the u s economy what an inconvenient truth was to the environment
1528462 eu vou desempenhar o papel de uma vil definitivamente uma vil

1528464 the average pay differential between the public and private sector was between 17 percent and 21 percent
1528465 in addition public sector workers appear to benefit much more from a warm glow belief that in their job they can help others and that their job is useful to society
1528466 in competitive labour markets people would be willing to work for less to feel so good about themselves and their jobs
1528467 so the fact that public sector workers actually get paid 20 percent more is evidence of how out of line wage setting has been in the public sector
1528468 some job factors like stress may be worse in the public sector but others like the work not being physically demanding and not being viewed by the worker as boring are better than for private sector workers
1528469 we would never have used the air pistol if they werent so threatening
1528470 whether or not he managed to hit anyone i dont know but he certainly did use the pistol
1528471 its still at an inquiry stage at the moment were still working on the robbery
1528472 i dont want other people to think its okay to do what this gentleman has done
1528473 we encourage a practice of compliance and for people in that situation just to get the offenders out of the shop as soon as possible without any damage or harm to anyone
1528474 women would throw him kisses and hed come up to the window and press his lips on it he interacted with the people
1528475 its a story of turning around the zoo and turning around the life of a very lonely animal

1528477 the project will bring new technology and a large project to the state
1528478 hopefully by august end we will start the pilot project
1528479 we really dont know how the system works we need to get used to it we have to sort out glitches if there are any in the beginning

1528486 we are now officially calling for a full public inquiry into the winnipeg police services given the recent increase in complaints and incidents in deadly and violent actions against our people
1528487 we will also be seeking public support to demand accountability of the winnipeg police services
1528488 the recent killings of our youth will no longer be tolerated
1528489 the wild sheep of north america are divided into two species which are known as thinhorn sheep and bighorn sheep
1528490 two species are found in north america the bighorn sheep and the dall sheep the dall sheep is found in alaska and northwestern canada it is usually white all over although gray individuals are found occasionally
1528491 well they sure came out in primaries and caucuses this year
1528492 well they did but they were so bothered by bush in 2004 but they failed to elect john kerry
1528493 the youth vote never turns out until they do and even then it wasnt enough
1528494 mccain gained 20 and obama lost 16 among voters ages 18 29
1528495 i used to give a f now i give a f less what do i think of success it sucks

1528504 it was the second floor and it was really crazy we were like oh hi but she was so sweet she was very nervous
1528505 we dont expect it so for us its so cool to be nominated
1528506 its really really special for us its america and its our first american award and thats so huge
1528507 i think the jonas brothers are really successful in america
1528508 its so crazy i mean i still cant believe it
1528509 last year we were nominated at the mtv europe music awards they won one and it was the biggest thing we had and now it is the video music awards
1528510 i think we are the most nervous band in the world we are together nervous
1528511 we are right now in the studio in europe and we are producing our third record so i think there are some surprises
1528512 ive always have my laptop with me and a pen
1528513 i think it would be so cool to meet rihanna
1528514 its a song that weve been performing all summer long
1528515 itll be different because were doing it at an awards show in front of all the celebrities you grew up watching but at the same time were doing our thing
1528516 i think the jonas brothers are really sexy in america
1528517 we just heard that and all we can say is thank you
1528518 i mean this is a first year for a lot of things for us
1528519 got the news today the doctor said i had to stay a little bit longer and ill be fine
1528520 weve been looking into scheduling when we can do that because weve been busy with touring but we would love to the success from the first one we did not expect that at all and the possibility of a second movie would be great
1528521 a lot of the disney people have talked about a sequel and ive heard rumors about scripts and stuff i would really like a love interest
1528522 itll only affect ross if ross allows it to affect him
1528523 had i gone out and entertained the article it would have blew the article out of proportion wherever they got their facts or information from let that be what it is you got your story out thank you very much i bow to it and keep it moving now if you wanna entertain it then youre gonna open up more worms you probably dont want opened up so all ross has to do is keep focusing on his music
1528524 the whole purpose of konvict music was to grab ex convicts felons
1528525 people head in that direction and steer them in the opposite direction just focus on my past and try to contradict whatever it is i might have said or lived and dont focus on the positive things ive done in society in general if you have an article at least balance it out let the people know the good things ive done the schools ive built the kids i feed in africa dont just say he wasnt locked up for three years i dont care if i was locked up for one day its that experience that allowed me to become that person who i am to make a better society for who is listening
1528526 people know what type of dude ross is right now
1528527 they know how thorough of a dude he is now he doesnt have to prove himself to anybody thats what an insecure person would do
1528528 when i heard about it i honestly thought to myself some of them correction officers are some of the most crooked individuals whether he did that or not its all what you take from it
1528529 its a lot of crooked cops out there they manipulate the system
1528530 so im just being real when i heard about it either way if he did it if he didnt do it it could still be crooked from it thats what it all comes down to so thats ludacris two cents on the whole rick ross situation to be real with you man if thats how you want to manipulate the system thats how you do it you get in the system there you have it
1528531 its a song that weve been performing all summer long

1528567 the veterans looked a lot better than the rookies as far as effort and technique although i saw some young guys show some athleticism and eagerness to learn and try to do what a coach says thats encouraging
1528568 it could have been as hot today but i dont really know it didnt seem as hot i dont know if it was nervous energy or what but we handled today a lot better as far as overall energy of the team i thought i saw a lot of nice plays some guys that i thought have stood out to this point are our quarterbacks they are throwing the ball really well in my opinion
1528569 everybody probably wants to ask about a j green but a j relatively early in practice got a little bit of a hip flexor strain
1528570 its nothing serious but it was enough to keep him out of yesterday and today
1528571 you know im going to check into this whole vampire thing
1528572 did i do this wrong is this a rule i didnt know about
1528573 whatever goes as long as youre not bothering anyone else just do what you want to do
1528574 ill be on vacation from 08 05 08 through 08 09 08
1528575 there is a six or seven week delay on new orders you dont want to keep customers waiting if you can get it down to five to six weeks that would be acceptable beyond that people will say they are not going to want the car anymore
1528576 at the moment its the hot car and we could do with some more of them because the corporate team is doing a good job of selling them
1528577 such mutual clarification can pave the way for a speedy and transparent negotiating process with a bright prospect
1528578 the republic of iran is ready to provide a clear response to your proposal at the earliest possibility while simultaneously expecting to receive your clear response to our questions and ambiguities as well
1528579 the second phase of negotiations can commence as early as possible if there is such willingness
1528580 our offer is clear and their response is not clear
1528581 the iranian government needs to respond in a very clear way to the generous offer from the international community
1528582 its a stalling tactic reiterating that they have goodwill but not answering the exam question
1528583 to be fair to the iranians they do this kind of thing rather well
1528584 i dont see any reason to believe that the russians and the chinese are any more willing today to support really tougher sanctions against iran
1528585 the exceptional character which written and oral legend nowadays assigns to the year 1937 is seen in the creation of fabricated charges and tortures but this is untrue wrong throughout the years and decades interrogations under article 58 were almost never undertaken to elicit the truth but were simply an exercise in an inevitably filthy procedure someone who had been free only a little while before who was sometimes proud and always unprepared was to be bend and pushed through a narrow pipe where his sides would be torn by iron hooks and where he could not breathe so that he would finally pray to get to the other end and at the other end he would be shoved out an already processed native of the archipelago already in the promised land the fool would keep on resisting he even thought there was a way back out of the pipe

1528594 itll only affect ross if ross allows it to affect him
1528595 had i gone out and entertained the article it would have blew the article out of proportion wherever they got their facts or information from let that be what it is you got your story out thank you very much i bow to it and keep it moving now if you wanna entertain it then youre gonna open up more worms you probably dont want opened up so all ross has to do is keep focusing on his music
1528596 the whole purpose of konvict music was to grab ex convicts felons
1528597 people head in that direction and steer them in the opposite direction just focus on my past and try to contradict whatever it is i might have said or lived and dont focus on the positive things ive done in society in general if you have an article at least balance it out let the people know the good things ive done the schools ive built the kids i feed in africa dont just say he wasnt locked up for three years i dont care if i was locked up for one day its that experience that allowed me to become that person who i am to make a better society for who is listening
1528598 people know what type of dude ross is right now
1528599 they know how thorough of a dude he is now he doesnt have to prove himself to anybody thats what an insecure person would do
1528600 when i heard about it i honestly thought to myself some of them correction officers are some of the most crooked individuals whether he did that or not its all what you take from it
1528601 its a lot of crooked cops out there they manipulate the system
1528602 so im just being real when i heard about it either way if he did it if he didnt do it it could still be crooked from it thats what it all comes down to so thats ludacris two cents on the whole rick ross situation to be real with you man if thats how you want to manipulate the system thats how you do it you get in the system there you have it

1528607 doctrine is not an affair of the tongue but of the life is not apprehended by the intellect and memory merely like other branches of learning but is received only when it possesses the whole soul and finds its seat and habitation in the inmost recesses of the heart but it must be transfused into the breast and pass into the conduct and so transform us into itself as not to prove unfruitful

1528615 bobby bright is in line with the values of this southern alabama district and is well known for creating jobs lowering crime and revitalizing montgomery as mayor
1528616 ive always said that the pace of withdrawal would be dictated by the safety and security of our troops and the need to maintain stability that assessment has not changed
1528617 and when i go to iraq and have a chance to talk to some of the commanders on the ground im sure ill have more information and will continue to refine my policies
1528618 since announcing his campaign in 2007 the central premise of s candidacy was his commitment to begin withdrawing american troops from iraq immediately
1528619 today reversed that position proving once again that his words do not matter he has now adopted john mccain s position that we cannot risk the progress we have made in iraq by beginning to withdraw our troops immediately without concern for conditions on the ground
1528620 obamas iraq problem undermines the central premise of his candidacy and shows him to be a typical politician
1528621 as careful getting out as we were careless getting in
1528622 obama will immediately begin to remove our troops from iraq he will remove one to two combat brigades each month and have all of our combat brigades out of iraq within 16 months obama will make it clear that we will not build any permanent bases in iraq he will keep some troops in iraq to protect our embassy and diplomats if al qaeda attempts to build a base within iraq he will keep troops in iraq or elsewhere in the region to carry out targeted strikes on al qaeda
1528623 he offered a withdrawal plan well over a year ago its essential to his candidacy and a rock solid commitment it will be 16 months at the most where you can withdraw combat troops
1528624 i think its hard to project four years from now and i think it would be irresponsible we dont know what contingency will be out there
1528625 i will drastically reduce our presence there to the mission of protecting our embassy protecting our civilians and making sure that were carrying out counterterrorism activities there i believe that we should have all our troops out by 2013 but i dont want to make promises not knowing what the situations going to be three or four years out
1528626 as soon as i take office i will call in the joint chiefs of staff we will initiate a phased withdrawal we will be as careful getting out as we were careless getting in we will give ample time for them to stand up to negotiate the kinds of agreements that will arrive at the political accommodations that are needed
1528627 now i will always listen to our commanders on the ground with respect to tactics once ive given them a new mission that we are going to proceed deliberately in an orderly fashion out of iraq and we are going to have our combat troops out we will not have permanent bases there once ive provided that mission if they come to me and want to adjust tactics then i will certainly take their recommendations into consideration but ultimately the buck stops with me as the commander in chief
1528628 of course i would factor in the possibilities of genocide and i factored it in when i said that i would begin a phased withdrawal what we have talked about is a very deliberate and prudent approach to the withdrawal one to two brigades per month at that pace it would take about 16 months assuming that george bush is not going to lower troop levels before the next president takes office we are talking about potentially two years away at that point we will have been in iraq seven years if we cannot get the iraqis to stand up in seven years were not going to get them to stand up in 14 or 28 or 56 years
1528629 my first day in office i will bring the joint chiefs of staff in and i will give them a new mission and that is to end this war responsibly deliberately but decisively and i have seen no information that contradicts the notion that we can bring our troops out safely at a pace of one to two brigades per month and again that pace translates into having our combat troops out in 16 months time
1528630 flip flopping away flip flopping a way hes but a moment of irritation as he keeps flip flopping away
1528631 the staten island republican party consistently insisted they were not for him not because he wasnt qualified not because he wasnt good looking not because he was inarticulate not because he didnt have a grasp of all the issues but because he lived on the brooklyn side of the district and because he happened to be a registered conservative
1528632 now i think everything has been thrown into disarray im not sure where we end up
1528633 i think there was a lot of disappointment among democrats here that the parties werent able to attract a more high profile challenger to chambliss
1528634 theres a possibility that it could change but i think it would still be considered a longshot
1528635 is it the truth is it fair to all concerned will it build goodwill and better friendships will it be beneficial to all concerned
1528636 we just dont have people in nome who represent the department of housing and urban development
1528637 its not only an offense to me its a threat to every person in my state
1528638 i have no way to explain this to my people
1528639 that is really an absolute shame that we are going to lose 18 months of hard work after we almost have complete agreement on the rest of the bill
1528640 tonight we can join together to spread the good news that change is coming to washington
1528641 our campaign has a time line and a strategy in place and we are following it according to plan not based on what our opponent whom we have beaten before is or isnt doing
1528642 the only poll that matters is the one held on election day
1528643 when independent candidate ralph nader and libertarian party candidate bob barr who are both in the process of trying to add their names to state ballots are included in the survey obamas margin over mccain grows to 10 percentage points 46 percent to 36 percent
1528644 effective immediately my campaign is suspended as i appeal to my party to make a firm commitment to our core principles
1528645 develop a sincere process for challenging local state and national republican elected officials on votes that sidestep or otherwise betray our core guiding principles
1528646 heres an office that theres just a long list of disparaging comments form john adams on about and yet i think that it has become an office where the ongoing responsibility has really become significant
1528647 the office has gone from being something of a nothing office to one that is sometimes described as imperial
1528648 with cheney for the first time you have the question has it gone too far
1528649 carter gave mondale certain resources that allowed him to become a player
1528650 before mondale vice presidents had to get cleared into the white house to see the president
1528651 the fact that he cares so much about the issues and the growth of the vice presidency makes plausible to me what once upon a time would not have seemed very plausible
1528652 gore is clearly presidential he covers the vulnerability of inexperience hes been in the situation room more than anyone on either side and he fits within the change theme in terms of his record
1528653 it seems to me that if the election is perceived as being close that then youre more likely to make a conservative pick why take on a problem if you dont have to
1528654 clearly theres been some damage what the polls are showing is that the kind of coalition a democrat needs to win just is not forming
1528655 really been unable to get on track where hes got a consistent message with regards to what he stands for thats credible and a line of attack on the incumbent
1528656 again and again in this race frankens on the defensive
1528657 shes not going to be well funded but the fact that she would run in and of itself tells you that al franken is facing some difficulties
1528658 i dont know that id say that he has stumbled but there have been off message problems for the campaign
1528659 i dont know that he necessarily created them but nonetheless they got there
1528660 i think weve moved on and i think the voters have really moved on too were in two wars in a recession and everywhere we go every corner of the state we have exactly the same conversations minnesotans want to know what you are going to do in washington to make their lives better
1528661 we were on that statement within hours and spent the week talking about it
1528662 weve expected that this would be a close race all along but overall i think minnesotans have responded very positively to sen colemans 30 year record of getting things done
1528663 doing well with a group of party activists in march in a church basement is a lot different than all minnesotans voting on election day
1528664 we dont take pac money from oil companies from insurance from drug companies so weve got to balance that money out somewhere and i tend to think that the joneses in wisconsin have more minnesotan values than halliburton
1528665 coleman frankly at this point is in a pretty strong position so i think the strategy for coleman is not to let the republican convention hurt him
1528666 i think that bodes very badly for the democrats in the fact that you have an unpopular president you even have a more unpopular congress and you have a senator whos in lockstep with this president i dont see how al franken could possibly win because he should be leading in the polls now not trailing me and im not even a candidate
1528667 theyve had a very good couple of weeks the question is can they keep building on that to the next three months but theyve had consistent focus on energy energy feeds into the economy those are key issues
1528668 without change we could face a catastrophic election this fall
1528669 the message was different today in the direction that were going on energy
1528670 and at the moment turnover of a senate seat seems more possible in nh than in any other state
1528671 we expect to pick up a whole bunch of seats
1528672 polls better than a traditional democrat does in very republican leaning red states
1528673 a hundred days is a lifetime in politics a lot can happen and we feel good about where our races are at this point
1528674 i do think that the big story is that we continue to be on offense and the republicans have not been able to take advantage of going after some of our members who might naturally have been on their radar screen
1528675 a very strong showing by senate democrats this november would bring the party at or very close to a 60 seat majority that could theoretically override a veto from republican john mccain
1528676 this is the first time we have brought together all of the major business organizations in one place to have a discussion with us about working together and issues that affect their members
1528677 sort of like minority leader bringing all the labor unions in town together
1528678 we know that the white house and the republican leadership would prefer the business community not work with us but the reality is its the democrats putting forward the agenda that is beneficial to their members
1528679 part of this for us is to indicate to them that if they are willing to step up and work in a positive way on issues rather than just make decisions based on what a republican president wants we can really get things done
1528680 nobody ignored the fact that sometimes the politics havent been aligned
1528681 i viewed it as a continuation of conversations that our group has had with these same senators
1528682 they wanted to know how the senate majority can work better with each of our trade associations the industries we represent what it is we may have liked better about working with the republican majority and what it is that has frustrated us about democrats
1528683 extol the virtues of biotechnology on one day and then turn around the next day and attack and lambaste the drug industry
1528684 its a fairly normal thing for a new majority to do and that is to remember that politics is ultimately about addition and not subtraction
1528685 the law of the possible and the first law of business is
1528686 ever since the control of congress changed in 1994 members have been looking for and discovering new vehicles for helping out their team
1528687 since 94 theyve realized that satisfaction with their job in congress depends a lot on whether they are in the majority or in the minority and they realized that the control of a chamber can flip in one way or another they care about the election of their colleagues more than they have in the past
1528688 i would like people to judge me on my record and the content of my character and not the color of my skin
1528689 josh segall is working very hard to put together the political and financial support necessary to run a competitive campaign and this is certainly a race we are watching as it develops
1528690 if african american voters come out in numbers that overcome our previous voting models then that could certainly make a democrat competitive
1528691 incumbents are tough to beat during even the toughest of years
1528692 after hinting earlier this month that he might refine his iraq strategy after visiting the country and listening to commanders mr obama appears to have decided that sticking to his arbitrary 16 month timetable is more important than adjusting to the dramatic changes in iraq
1528693 to say youre going to get out on a certain schedule regardless of what the iraqis do regardless of what our enemies do regardless of what is happening on the ground is the height of absurdity
1528694 you can about guarantee that hes going to take the position that satisfies the far left of his party
1528695 is to help democrats retain the majority and expand the majority in november and beyond
1528696 theres no doubt that senior members like dingell judiciary chairman
1528697 the host committee looks forward to the ongoing support of private businesses and individuals as it looks to stage an extraordinary convention in denver at the end of august
1528698 we have been hard at work for over a year now and we have incredible plans in place to showcase our nominee our party and this city come august but funding is essential to fully execute all of those great plans
1528699 to deliver what denver and the nation are expecting a flawless event to help put on the path to victory in november
1528700 shes got a formidable base in savannah but she hasnt gotten a whole lot of traction district wide
1528701 some indication that thomas doesnt have the entire black community locked up
1528702 he doesnt vote in lockstep with liberal leaders if he did hed be in trouble on election day
1528703 ms thomas 56 is closer to what ms pelosi would probably prefer from the 12th district
1528704 unfortunately since i have only been here since 9 30 this morning we are unable to announce a calendar
1528705 but be assured that it is going to be brisk and ambitious
1528706 we are going to do our best to get it done right and to get it done fast
1528707 we anticipate having 210 million available to us from september 4 on to election day
1528708 in the end this election is about delivering for louisiana and the people of this state know that she has not only fought but won her fights and delivered for the state
1528709 by every standard you can measure she looks extremely strong right now
1528710 this is probably not the year that voters want to hear about clout and seniority in washington because they dont feel that washington is meeting the needs of people
1528711 im telling them if you have an r in front of your name you better run scared
1528712 i dont want to slip below the four seat loss thats kind of where weve set our absolute worst goal is to be down to 45 seats
1528713 after eight years of incompetence neglect and failure we need change
1528714 after eight years when our constitution has been dishonored and disrespected we need changes
1528715 but im ever more grateful for everything hes done in the last 40 years for this country
1528716 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
1528717 i feel your determination after two terms of the bush cheney administration to change the direction of our country
1528718 even our dogs and cats have learned that elections matter
1528719 this election matters more than ever because america needs change more than ever
1528720 this election isnt about changing the past its about changing the future its telling that half of the 2000 democratic ticket endorsed
1528721 i think a handful of party insiders got nervous and decided to put a ringer in the race
1528722 we didnt really feel like anyone had stepped forward who could run a competitive statewide race
1528723 that was part of jims motivation for getting into the race
1528724 jim has proven that he can run a strong statewide race and quite frankly the other candidates have had some good experiences but have not proven that they are electable
1528725 i dont have to raise the money that they do
1528726 i am resolute that the greater good is in a hard fought return to the statehouse rather than a longshot run for congress
1528727 one of the worst decisions in the history of this country
1528728 make it clear to the world that this government does not torture and that we adhere to the international convention of torture whether it be here at home or abroad
1528729 weve sent a message to the world that the united states is not like the terrorists
1528730 i am just going to do a job and go work for you
1528731 it is so amazing to me that i am going to call that my workplace
1528732 turnout was very low as most voters were unaware of the election or expected edwards to win handily when edwards was campaigning at a barbecue festival in landover roughly a week ago most voters knew of her but not that a special election was coming up
1528733 maybe im not powerful enough because lets remember george bush our president said he talked to god before invading iraq gods never spoken to me once never and so i will tell you now i am not going to run but if between now and 5 oclock if god comes and speaks to me like he did the president and tells me i should run well then maybe at 5 oclock tomorrow larry dont call me a liar just understand god sent me to file
1528734 this was an agonizing decision for me because everywhere i walked down the streets of minnesota today i get run jesse run and it feels the same way as it did in 98 when i ran with little chance and won the governorship
1528735 nothing is off limits today in the world of politics
1528736 all you minnesotans take a good hard look at all three of us and you decide if you were in a dark alley which one of the three of us would you want with you
1528737 the flamboyant former professional wrestler said he would not run unless god tells him to
1528738 are we looking at a single event or some kind of a campaign
1528739 there are a lot of standards that are being used but theres not a national standard
1528740 what were concerned about is these homemade explosives this whole new breed where we dont have even our canines trained to detect them
1528741 weve gotten direct feedback from major law enforcement agencies that theyve changes their protective measures for special events based on the information weve been able to provide them on tripwire
1528742 i really believe that will prevent the next terrorist attack hopefully prevent the next terrorist attack
1528743 recruiting people here is much different than it is in europe and other places
1528744 theyve got to recruit a suicide bomber theyve got to infiltrate theyve got to gather the materials theyve got to identify a target theyve got to surveil that target and the logistics that are associated with that target
1528745 and i think that we as the nation have been very successful in disrupting that
1528746 gt easily winning a third term even though his scotland golf trip with the disgraced superlobbyist was then much fresher news
1528747 senate foreign relations committee was i believe intended to be the senates brake on foreign policy
1528748 im surprised at how many friends that one little thing we did brought
1528749 i want my daughters and all our daughters to have no limits on their dreams no obstacles to their achievement no opportunities beyond their reach
1528750 if the bill comes back to the house for final approval i intend to fully support it
1528751 the question is whether or not doctors are being believed locally
1528752 which interest group do you dislike more doctors or insurance companies
1528753 the presumption of that california congressman is that the doctors will be seen as more sympathetic
1528754 now im running for congress because i know if we stay and fight together we can make upstate new york great again
1528755 we have a mountain to climb we have four months to make this happen but fortunately what we have with dale sweetland is he has a proven record of public service when you meet dale sweetland you would ask yourself why cant all of our candidates give me this feel of honor and integrity and hard work
1528756 were setting up events and just getting dale sweetland in front of the people
1528757 we dont have some washington firm doing all our filing data for us so we dont have all of our final numbers just yet
1528758 were going to see some positive activity out of washington
1528759 we feel republican voters will be making an extraordinary mistake if they pass up the opportunity to send a man of barry flemings stature and character to congress
1528760 a realization that its a very important position and we need someone not only that talks conservative but has acted conservatively and gets things done
1528761 suzanne kosmas is a well respected member of the community whose local leadership shows she has what she needs
1528762 the scotland trip is five years old i didnt know the trip was paid for by abramoff
1528763 when i found out jack abramoff had lied to me i wrote a letter to the house ethics committee i did the right thing and turned myself in
1528764 this race shouldnt be competitive but it is feeney has high negatives brought on by his own misdeeds most notably his association with abramoff
1528765 this race is still leaning republican but its much more in play
1528766 a hero to me and to hundreds of thousands and millions of others in the armed forces
1528767 he hasnt been there and ordered the bombs to fall
1528768 he was just always personally involved in the goings on of the squadron he didnt hide in his office
1528769 he gave the old crowd a chance to perform but when they didnt he fired them
1528770 even if the republican proposal were enacted it would take years even decades to conduct exploration and begin drilling and even then the republican plan wouldnt lower gas prices
1528771 instead of proposing legislation that will just add more to the 68 million unused acres and do nothing to reduce gas prices republicans should join democrats to find solutions that work
1528772 we can walk and chew gum at the same time
1528773 republicans are offering more of the same failed policies that got us in this mess in the first place
1528774 theyve done everything in their power to block democratic efforts to reduce gas prices and americas dependence on foreign oil
1528775 the white house has been aided and assisted by house republicans every step of the way
1528776 when people feel like theyre working a double shift every day to pay the bills and then they look up at washington and see nothing happening its all the more frustrating
1528777 part of why were doing that it to make sure were hearing from those who are struggling but also to say its not just that were fighting the corruption in washington that people are so sick and tired of but were actually for something too which is a culture of service really restoring the greatest generations sense of service to country and service to community
1528778 for the last 20 years so much of the great work has been done by our non profits and our houses of worship
1528779 and i think we need to capture that spirit of service that still exists and bring it back into the public sector and bring it back into washington
1528780 what would you like me to do for you in washington
1528781 we view enactment of this bill as a crucial first step toward our recovery and so were doing everything we can to get it passed
1528782 hes obviously well respected across party lines and in both sides of the capitol hes been doing a bang up job for us were very pleased
1528783 appreciate you voting to give billions of tax breaks to the oil companies
1528784 i dont think riding in a fighter plane and getting shot down is a qualification to be president
1528785 i come from a border state my dear friends i know these issues
1528786 we must assert our values and reconcile our principles as a nation of immigrants and a nation of laws that is a priority i will pursue from my very first day
1528787 it will be my top priority yesterday today and tomorrow
1528788 we have to secure our borders but we also must proceed with a temporary worker program that is verifiable and truly temporary we must also understand that 12 million people are here and they are here illegally and they are gods children
1528789 we will resolve the immigration issue in america and we will secure our borders
1528790 one place where senator mccain used to offer change was on immigration he was a champion of comprehensive reform and i admired him for it but when he was running for his partys nomination he walked away from that commitment and hes said he wouldnt even support his own legislation if it came up for a vote
1528791 it will be one of my priorities on my first day because this is an issue that we have demagogued theres been a lot of politics around it but we havent been serious about solving the problem and i want to solve the problem
1528792 theres something else less endearing and i hope less enduring that our campaign has left behind our substantial campaign debt
1528793 i am asking once again for your help ridding our campaign of debt so we can keep fighting together
1528794 the court decision made it crystal clear that all aspects of the amendment are invalid and unenforceable
1528795 in 2002 and 2004 what i concluded was that the millionaires amendment made very little difference if any in pretty much all elections
1528796 such a concept is wholly foreign to the first amendment congress is not allowed to tinker with peoples speech rights because it thinks some people are speaking too much or others not enough
1528797 when i spend my own money to finance my campaigns i am beholden only to the voters and my own conscience
1528798 the law allowed special interest campaign contributors to plow even more of their money into campaigns against people like me candidates who refuse their money and the influence it buys
1528799 23 billion in waste fraud and abuse in iraq by private war contractors
1528800 unfortunately for allen the wheel didnt stay swung on the war
1528801 i dont doubt allen will surpass 5 million in this race and collins is going to get 7 million
1528802 due to voters having started to tune into the race
1528803 i think its a mistake to grab onto the poll and say that it shows movement
1528804 definitely national trends and every state and race has quirks
1528805 shes playing in a political landscape that can rapidly dissolve beneath her
1528806 where he is not that well known in the state especially in the 2nd district
1528807 even the campaign itself promises to be different when he speaks about a fifty state strategy
1528808 i am very interested in running for governor of my state
1528809 i came to the house to serve a period of time and in part to seek for higher office
1528810 there are going to be new people who are going to be part of the process and they will also be there for 2010 governors race
1528811 and frankly a chunk of those people are going to vote for me
1528812 both of us ran against veteran members of congressional black caucus
1528813 his candidacy even then was about the right things s story is a story of someone who faced a huge setback at around the age of 40 and managed to come back no one could have imagined that eight years later would be the democratic nominee for the president of the united states
1528814 i have gotten in a position to be a strong candidate for governor of my state
1528815 if senator shelby were to chose not to run again i would be asked to and be expected to reconsider my race for governor
1528816 it was an important coming out moment for the bike industry in terms of political sophistication
1528817 never in my memory has a biking event with a presidential candidate happened
1528818 its time that the entire country learned from whats happening right here in portland with mass transit and bicycle lanes and funding alternative means of transportation
1528819 i think more and more people are at least starting to listen so at least well have more opportunities to make the case
1528820 bringing 19th century solutions to 21st century problems if you dont like it ride a bike if you dont like the prices at the pump ride a bike stay tuned for the next big idea by the democrats improving fuel efficiency by riding a horse and buggy
1528821 in the last 30 days theres been more progress than in the last 30 years
1528822 were going to go back to the future with the big picture
1528823 were basically reaching out to the staten island gop and saying you guys really need to come on board you need to come on board with us so we can ensure victory
1528824 time is running out unless the staten island gop gets behind paul atanasio immediately we have no shot of keeping this seat
1528825 its flabbergasting thats the only word i can think of it is as if they seem intent on serving this seat up to democrats on a silver platter with chocolate mints around the edge
1528826 make no mistake about it were in trouble the republican party is in trouble nationally at the state level and at the local county levels
1528827 were now talking about the safety and security of the people of the city of new york and unless we have a strong advocate in the republican party in congress working hard to ensure for the safety and security of new york city residents we are going to lose
1528828 this staen island district listens to the fevered low brow rightwing lying on new yorks talk radio and they love the racist drivel they hear
1528829 its not merely a matter of the district and really if you are gonna tell me about me you really oughta learn how to spell before declaiming that you know how staten islanders think
1528830 he ny talk radio will energetically engage on behalf of the gop and elect another low brow liar in their mold such as they had with fossella the vagabond lover
1528831 the anger that should have been directed at the politicians who blundered into that war instead was all too often directed at the returning veterans
1528832 i think that what this congress has done last year and this year demonstrates that aint gonna happen this time if we have anything to say about it
1528833 its a very concrete form of social spending thats going to influence an important group of people
1528834 and if they can position republicans as the ones who are not going to really deliver to people in the service or veterans i think that could potentially impact voters in different states
1528835 right now this has really really been tough because yes the democratic party has fulfilled its promises on va health care and stuff like that but a lot of veterans still support the military and what they are doing and support the war
1528836 its really been a tough vote for a lot of guys and gals
1528837 most veterans support public officials who favor a strong defense who support fighting men and women while theyre fighting and respect veterans when they come home
1528838 and the republican party has always had a pretty good record on that
1528839 were taking a second look at that because of the entitlement problem that congress is facing
1528840 you know the first thing they always tell us is how are you going to pay for it its the first statement out of their mouth and obviously to come up with 40 billion in savings for mandatory money is going to be kind of a trick
1528841 as it exists today is broken and we face opponents who have become masters at gaming this broken system
1528842 points in super bowl good for patriots not so good for giants
1528843 super bowl points good for patriots not so good for giants
1528844 great fundraising month for mccain finishes behind obama but just barely
1528845 we have a lot of different combinations to get to 270
1528846 the good news from our perspective is that there are a lot more bush states on here than there are kerry states
1528847 i hope all of you will join me throughout this campaign in strongly speaking out against this fearmongering no matter who youll be voting for
1528848 this is wedge politics at its worst and weve got to reject it loudly clearly and unequivocally
1528849 the burden is on us is to make sure people know what his record is
1528850 in places like florida the more people see him and hear him the better obama does
1528851 im convinced that in the end he will outdo kerry in florida where he got 74 percent
1528852 he had to hit a home run and i believe he did
1528853 mccain goes into this election better situated in the jewish community than the two presidents bush or bob dole in 1996 because hes seen as more moderate and less associated with the religious right but that will change
1528854 you cant sell a man in my community who supports the privatization of social security or who wants to overturn roe v wade
1528855 sen obamas in very good shape and hell get in better shape once people know theres this whole nasty campaign out there against him said sen
1528856 with the rank and file jews he will be very popular the jewish leadership is different she said because they want to become more familiar with obama
1528857 as the entire jewish community comes to know him they will see very strong redeeming values in him
1528858 the federal government should not be in the public education business
1528859 this year chaffetz a resident of the county trounced cannon there with 63 percent
1528860 congress has a job to do as the appropriating arm of government
1528861 bad bills with good titles and inevitably the bad bill bleeds through again
1528862 bringing a sense of urgency for change to the u s congress
1528863 signaled they wanted change in 2006 but it wasnt enough
1528864 sorry congresswoman but we deserve much better than yall boy
1528865 weve never had anyone go as far as he has
1528866 when i supported jesse jackson and shirley chisholm i never thought about them in any terms of becoming president
1528867 he said this is the result of everyone in this room and this caucus
1528868 you could feel the historic aspect of his candidacy today and even more so the fact that were having this experience with him its incredible
1528869 unlike a meeting with 2004 nominee john kerry and 2000 nominee al gore we are talking about somebody who has experienced everything that we have experienced in trying to get elected
1528870 he wants to make sure that the campaign is going to tap into and utilize
1528871 his background is in voter education and voter registration so he understands the need to lash up with african american congresspersons and hispanic congresspersons
1528872 what was then is then and what is now is now
1528873 but once in awhile cases went to court and involved eviction proceedings in those cases the judge sets the date by which a tenant must be out of a unit if they have not paid their bill
1528874 mark had no control over what a judge decided and would certainly never intentionally have someone evicted on christmas eve
1528875 mark begich has a lot of baggage were going to be bringing that out
1528876 he is not the unflawed candidate that chuck schumer thought he was getting
1528877 ted ran right up to the chairman and yelled at him right to his face you sob you promised me a vote
1528878 im going to go to every one of your states and im going to tell them what youve done this was wrong
1528879 im sure the senator from washington is going to enjoy my visits to washington because im going to visit there often
1528880 well thats not the best question to ask a presidential candidate
1528881 im trying to galvanize people nationwide and thats how you do it you dont do it by running for a senate seat
1528882 i say well dont you think barbara and george herbert walker bush share some responsibility they created him they gave birth to him
1528883 in most states a vote for ralph nader has historically been a vote for the republican party
1528884 in what country would someone get 18 percent of the vote and receive nothing
1528885 hes gone off on his own and we see that as a dead end for progressive politics
1528886 nothing to show for it at the end of the day
1528887 im the only person that shows up significantly in the polls
1528888 on issue after issue theyll stand with corporate power not with the people
1528889 giant corporations are tearing the heart and soul out of our country
1528890 no doubt he would regain the respect and admiration he would deserve for years of tirelessly fighting for the common man in america
1528891 democrats are resilient and will find a way to make hagan competitive
1528892 the bush administration has been right on some issues tax cuts for everyone across the board thats an issue that resonates with north carolinians because we believe we pay too much in taxes
1528893 senator dole isnt looking to see what the presidents doing shes looking to see what legislation is best for the state of north carolina
1528894 i dont think a washington record is what the countrys looking for right now
1528895 when i look at those results i know something is going on
1528896 the first place that i look when i see these discrepancies i look for the percentage of republicans democrats and independents in the sample we know that the best predictor of how someone is going to vote is their party id
1528897 both the l a times bloomberg and the newsweek polls have too large percentage of democrats and a too small percentage of republicans
1528898 if you do the math and apply the proper percentages to the l a times bloomberg and the newsweek findings you find that their results change dramatically
1528899 embedded in the operations of polling are subtle differences that result in skews and they can be either republican skews or democratic skews
1528900 the problem here is that unlike race age and gender party id is fluid and even extreme swings might reflect actual changes in the mood of the electorate
1528901 the new organization capabilities in vmware lab manager 3 will help us better enforce role based access rights to system configurations in the lab according to our it policy says tony anastasio technology architect for cerner the leading u

1528904 perhaps the reality is that paris has a more substantive energy plan than barack obama
1528905 after i read what the minneapolis mayor was saying i said we should go on the record saying that fares should cover a larger portion of the transit services
1528906 our philosophy is that we should all pay for the transit system but the riders should pay for riding it
1528907 so if i want to keep my arteries nice and clean so the blood flows through do i want more broccoli or ice cream
1528908 i even hear them talking about extras or the foods you should eat sparingly
1528909 i guarantee you that my contract will be like no other
1528910 it will be a ground breaking record contract for sure without a doubt theres so much money to be made right now in mixed martial arts and its all about the fighters trying to make that money its going to be a long term deal where i put my heart and soul into the company and help build them thats something im interested in doing theyre going to bring me on not just as a fighter but also doing some of the back work also
1528911 hes already been talking smack saying if he sees me hes going to kick my ass but right on if he keeps thinking that hell get his face caved in sooner or later i know frank shamrock is another person whos been opening up his mouth he beat me the last time we fought and i think that would be a great revenge fight where i kick his ass and finally shut him up as time goes well see who affliction signs besides me i dont know i might even go up to heavyweight if the bigger pay days are there
1528912 mr trump works fast and gets busy in a lot of the things he does and hes going to give me the best deal possible
1528913 i know they want to make some money and i know they got over 100 000 pay per view buys on their first show and with me its guaranteed to be over 500 000 pay per view buys just by the number of fans that are going to follow me no matter where i go so theyre going to get there moneys worth just in pay per view no matter what
1528914 he not only was a nice guy and very different from the way he is in the ring he was really talented really smart and yes i think he likes me a lot and i like him a lot that doesnt mean he signed a contract with affliction but i think tito would love to deal with us
1528915 they have the right to match the offer so ill be getting a deal that no other fighter has ever gotten its going to be some ground breaking news for sure
1528916 im going to a company thats going to take care of me a company thats going to respect me a company thats going to put me in the forefront and make me the ambassador that ive always been i think mr trump respects me at that value to get it my hearts not with the ufc anymore because of how bad they treated me they dont respect me and they dont see me as a businessman all they think is that im a punk fighter thats going to fold and ive already proven that im not going to fold to anything by not resigning with them
1528917 we talked a little bit about trump getting involved in mma when i was on the show
1528918 i know he did a couple things with wwe and a few boxing events and after the show he said one day i may be interested in getting into your business and i want to sign you and thats pretty much where it was until he signed with affliction and once he signed with affliction i got a personal call from him saying he was going to come to my last fight in the ufc and support me and after my fight was over he walked up to me and said tito you may have lost tonight but you won in my eyes no matter what i just signed with affliction and we want to sign you next he sees the power that i have and hes going to respect me for it
1528919 we want to get out of our group thats the mentality that we need to have going in after that anything can happen and we just hope to play our game we have a talented group and the rest will take care of itself
1528920 i know a lot of people arent giving us much of a chance to get out of the group
1528921 and we know that but people have been wrong about american teams in the past and weve been able to prove people wrong i think we can surprise a lot of people in this tournament

1528925 i wouldnt necessarily make the conclusion that just because he had access to a lyophilizer and used a lyophilizer that that provides a smoking gun that he must be using this for sinister purposes
1528926 i think the public and the survivors of the anthrax attacks are entitled to see the evidence before the grand jury
1528927 and if there was a draft indictment and they were ready to indict mr ivins they ought to see that as well
1528928 the in stadium experience is critically important to the nfl our clubs and our fans and it will be a major focus this season

1528930 all area roads have been closed but there have been no formal evacuations as of 6 p m
1528931 people sometimes treat others as objects to satisfy their own needs rather than as persons to be loved and cherished how easy it is to be deceived by the many voices in our society that advocate a permissive approach to sexuality without regard for modesty self respect or the moral values that bring quality to human relationships this is worship of a false god instead of bringing life it brings death
1528932 maybe immodestly dressed older women think that theyre beyond the age of posing a temptation and maybe they are
1528933 if our blessed mother would wear such clothing if she lived in this day and age or to ask herself if our blessed mother would be pleased with her wearing the article of clothing in question
1528934 the good of our soul is more important than that of our body and we have to prefer the spiritual welfare of our neighbor to our bodily comforts if a certain kind of dress constitutes a grave and proximate occasion of sin and endangers the salvation of your soul and others it is your duty to give it up o christian mothers if you knew what a future of anxieties and perils of ill guarded shame you prepare for your sons and daughters imprudently getting them accustomed to live scantily dressed and making them lose the sense of modesty you would be ashamed of yourselves and you would dread the harm you are making of yourselves the harm which you are causing these children whom heaven has entrusted to you to be brought up as christians

1528937 sounds like paris is taking the all of the above energy approach that john mccain has advocated both alternatives and drilling
1528938 perhaps the reality is that paris has a more substantive energy plan than barack obama
1528939 i dont know what happened here last year but i have good expectations for what should happen this year and i cant wait to be a part of it

1528951 how do you mow your lawn with all those signs
1528952 i pull them all out and stack them up before starting the mower
1528953 so what is the purpose of all these bible signs
1528954 so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void
1528955 i make these signs and give them out to anyone who will display them publicly
1528956 it shall accomplish that which i please and it shall prosper in the thing whereto i sent it
1528957 so people driving by at 55 miles an hour will be impacted by god speaking to them out of this bible verse
1528958 what if they dont believe the verses or what if theyre thinking about sex with their girlfriend will it still work
1528959 it is gods word it shall not return unto him void
1528960 why do you keep telling us to write in our bibles and mark them up
1528961 well i want this group to get used to using their bibles as a tool where they can keep coming back and pick up where they last left off why do you think there is something wrong with it

1528969 you get your 12 or greater return paid up front immediately the day after you make your investment trade no waiting as with other investments and you can take that money and use it right away for your personal expenses or use it to reinvest and make even more money
1528970 the state is a human community that successfully claims the monopoly of the legitimate use of force within a given territory

1528972 the means of defense against foreign danger historically have become the instruments of tyranny at home
1528973 we need a jeffersonian revolution if it doesnt happen our democracy will continue to weaken and things will get worse right now we have a two party electoral dictatorship with each party looking for the highest corporate bidder
1528974 a people that values its privileges above its principles soon loses both
1528975 a democracy will continue to exist up until the time that voters discover they can vote themselves generous gifts from the public treasury
1528976 we are not blind we are men and women with eyes and brains and we dont have to be driven hither and thither by the blind workings of the market or of history or of progress or of any other abstraction
1528977 this country with its institutions belongs to the people who inhabit it whenever they shall grow weary of the existing government they can exercise their constitutional right of amending it or their revolutionary right to dismember it or overthrow it
1528978 a cynical mercenary demagogic press will produce in time a people as base as itself
1528979 the minute you read something that you cant understand you can almost be sure that it was drawn up by a lawyer
1528980 laws control the lesser man right conduct controls the greater one
1528981 one of the greatest delusions in the world is the hope that the evils in this world are to be cured by legislation
1528982 naturally the common people dont want war neither in russia nor in england nor in america nor in germany that is understood but after all it is the leaders of the country who determine policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a parliament or a communist dictatorship voice or no voice the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders that is easy all you have to do is to tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger it works the same in any country
1528983 preventive war was an invention of hitler frankly i would not even listen to anyone seriously that came and talked about such a thing
1528984 the purpose of the law is not to prevent a future offense but to punish the one actually committed
1528985 ultimately we need to restore the understanding that in a democracy the rights of citizens to govern themselves are more important than the rights of corporations to make money
1528986 it does not require a majority to prevail but rather an irate tireless minority keen to set brush fires in peoples minds
1528987 when people who are honestly mistaken learn the truth they will either cease being mistaken or cease being honest
1528988 during times of universal deceit telling the truth becomes a revolutionary act
1528989 america will never be destroyed from the outside if we falter and lose our freedoms it will be because we destroyed ourselves
1528990 the things that will destroy america are prosperity at any price peace at any price safety first instead of duty first the love of soft living and the get rich quick theory of life
1528991 democracy is two wolves and a lamb voting on what to have for lunch liberty is a well armed lamb contesting the vote

1529001 we are at the parting of the ways we have not one or two or three but many established and formidable monopolies in the united states we have not one or two but many fields of endeavor into which it is difficult if not impossible for the independent man to enter we have restricted credit we have restricted opportunity we have controlled development and we have come to be one of the worst ruled one of the most completely controlled and dominated governments in the civilized world no longer a government by free opinion no longer a government by conviction and the vote of the majority but a government by the opinion and the duress of small groups of dominant men
1529002 facts do not cease to exist because they are ignored
1529003 i believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies if the american people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency first by inflation then by deflation the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered the issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people to whom it properly belongs
1529004 banking was conceived in iniquity and was born in sin the bankers own the earth take it away from them but leave them the power to create money and with the flick of the pen they will create enough deposits to buy it back again however take it away from them and all the great fortunes like mine will disappear and they ought to disappear for this would be a happier and better world to live in but if you wish to remain the slaves of bankers and pay the cost of your own slavery let them continue to create money and control credit
1529005 it was not accidental it was a carefully contrived occurrence the international bankers sought to bring about a condition of despair here so that they might emerge as rulers of us all

1529014 any intelligent fool can make things bigger more complex and more violent it takes a touch of genius and a lot of courage to move in the opposite direction
1529015 in the beginning of change the patriot is a scarce man and brave and hated and scorned when his cause succeeds the timid join him for it then costs nothing to be a patriot

1529019 web 2 0 in short rather than worrying about what it is or how it is defined i tried to look at what impact it has on users i believe that web 2 0 affects users in 3 ways personal expression it gives users a greater ability to express their personalities to others efficient connections it makes meeting new like minded people more efficient information discovery it changes how people discover information none of these dynamics are new or unique to web 2 0 they represent some of the core motivators of most humans all web 2 0 has done is make achieving these human objectives online easier

1529064 important fyi the surfire2008 website is still in testing please hold off on posting till this afternoon
1529065 heres what weve got from personal experience last night dan priano butch amp patti kronlund martine mark sullivan martine and mike watched the fire from billy posts house at post ranch inn weve set up our communication center here
1529066 he mike dietrich further said that with the fire having breached the presumably dolan ridge containment line the nacimiento fergusson rd is the new southern containment line
1529067 fire has jumped the southern containment lines threatening the community of lucia attempting to hold a secondary dozer line with limited resources
1529068 conduct firing operations to check fire spread along hwy 1 and on dolan ridge
1529069 a new oes strike team just arrived to inform us they would be starting backfires in this area they hope to burn to the road throughout this immediate area tonight and tomorrow before a change in the weather causes bigger problems
1529070 mescal ridge this ridge running e to w extends from the w side of bottchers gap in nwq sec 24t18s r1e to the junction of sierra and bixby creeks in sec 17 about 1 m from the pacific bixby mountain 2920 ft and bonifacio hill 2290 ft are its highest points
1529071 adults have the ability to make decisions about their personal safety
1529072 he that would live in peace and at ease must not speak all he knows nor judge all he sees
1529073 the first phase gave residents an option to sign a waiver and stay when the fire got more intense the sheriffs office upgraded the evacuation to say that anyone who stayed was subject to arrest
1529074 there are strike teams on the premises tonight were under the protection of an office of emergency services crew from santa maria the excitement is underway in hot springs cyn right now im recharging my camera battery before going back up to the bridge ill keep you posted
1529075 we think the most interesting thing is the extent to which the burn out fire appears to have spread to the southeast but as it is still within the original big box containment lines that may well be part of the plan
1529076 since only a few hours ago residents were being told the evacuation would remain in place for at least another 72 hours were guessing it took something more than just good news from the fire lines to create this sudden dramatic change in policy
1529077 i am not going to be sitting at the bar at fernwood fifteen years from now talking about watching this fire before everything i owned burned up
1529078 with the successful progress on the fire the monterey county sheriff will lift all voluntary evacuations and road closures at 6 pm tomorrow evening july 25 2008

1529238 common sense is not very common in washington d c why arent we using all the resources that we americans can bring to the table we need to use our american ingenuity to solve these problems we will get it done if theres a vote on this floor
1529239 the only way were ever going to bring her to heel and allow a vote is for us to continue to put pressure on her and so its 25 members we had in congress today led by tom price and mike pence its members all over the country doing their townhall meetings doing their rotary clubs theyre all talking about it and were going to keep talking about it until we get our vote

1529243 the team has backed me the whole off season i appreciate that theres been a great dialogue between myself and mike and quarterbacks coach tom clements its been good i feel like ive at least been included in the information not have to figure it out from different parties but back in march they told me i was going to be the guy and they stuck to that
1529244 i felt once he stepped back here in green bay that he would be the quarterback but with him not being here today i guess management has a different route so at that point weve just got to go out and do our job

1529263 we havent started the season well at all its disappointing that we havent reached any sort of level we havent reached the right level so far this season
1529264 i think everyone who is involved with the club is extremely disappointed at what has happened so far
1529265 its a reasonable excuse to use that the effects of last season are still with the players but i dont think it is a relevant one
1529266 it seems fairly ridiculous that you can reach a european final and then get knocked out at the first game of the next season but thats the way it has happened
1529267 if it had been last season and you lose out in the first game because it is a new team that has been put together then fine you would have said to yourself that it was something you could have expected
1529268 but we have been a year into it now and we are a reasonably experienced team and we never really handled either game particularly well
1529269 so you really cant make a living as a stampin up demonstrator they should stop telling people that you can

1529280 estudiamos las expresiones faciales de los organgutanes cuando estaban jugando
1529281 nos interesaba saber si los orangutanes son capaces de copiar estas expresiones
1529282 y descubrimos que no s lo est presente esta conducta de mimetismo sino la velocidad con la que son capaces de copiarse unos a otros sugiere que estas expresiones son involuntarias
1529283 creemos que estas expresiones son la base de la risa humana ya que ocurren cuando los animales est n jugando o cuando alguien les hace cosquillas
1529284 esto sugiere que esta conducta de mimetismo no es voluntaria dice la especialista o sea que entre los animales la risa tambi n es contagiosa
1529285 los animales producen estas expresiones cuando est n en una situaci n positiva por ejemplo cuando est n jugando lo cual revela que el contexto social tambi n es muy importante para ellos
1529286 y vimos que estas conducta de mimetismo ocurre m s a menudo entre orangutanes j venes y adolescentes que entre los infantes

1529390 as long as men can go topless women should have a same and equal right
1529391 otherwise men should also be forced to wear something that hides their chests
1529392 women should go topless and rally publicly in great numbers on august 23 to protest that despicable treatment and exercise their rights

1529421 as opportunities for education increase they are proving harder to cash in
1529422 problem is that the labour market cannot keep pace with social expectations of work rewards and status
1529423 the globalization of labour markets cannot resolve the opportunity trap based on the assumptions that as low skilled low waged jobs migrate to newly industrializing nations high skilled high waged jobs will migrate in the other direction
1529424 more and more effort time and money is being spent doing what is necessary rather than for any intrinsic purpose rather than opportunities extending our freedom and fulfilling our dreams they are making people increasingly self centred stressed and unfulfilled if the diploma disease signifies a shift in the purpose of education employability is a shift in the meaning of life
1529425 problem is that the labour market cannot keep pace with social expectations of work rewards and status
1529426 we are adopting the rollback millage rate for both the unincorporated and incorporated sections of the county
1529427 the county is able to accomplish this given the conservative approach chairman kevin little and the board of commissioners took towards county expenditures over the past several years
1529428 we are excited about our new spanish language program at the primary school
1529429 not only will our students develop listening and speaking skills but they will also begin to develop an international perspective so necessary for cultural and economic productivity in the 21st century
1529430 the children are very lucky to have spanish at such a young age
1529431 there is an abundance of research that supports the fact that peak acquisition of a foreign language occurs between birth and 10 years of age yet most foreign language programs begin much later in a childs school career
1529432 research also indicates that the benefits of early foreign language program go far beyond language acquisition
1529433 these benefits include the development of students creativity memory and listening skills in addition students who learn a foreign language at an early age usually make greater progress in the acquisition of english reading and writing skills as well
1529434 you have to repeat things many time before they can remember
1529435 but they will learn about the spanish language countries that speak spanish and their cultures
1529436 this is definitely dr rays vision and i am so glad we can host this program
1529437 at this time foreign language education is viewed not as a choice but as a necessity for all americans
1529438 with international events filling our newspapers and television broadcasts it becomes clear that the future of our children rests on the ability to solve world wide problems

1529440 she said he had claimed to work for the fbi and he would put on a holster and leave for work supposedly for the fbi each morning
1529441 as a department manager henderson had the authority to approve returns he would get the code from an item and take it to the return desk and sign the authorization for the return without the goods having to be produced

1529454 just as the berlin wall once fell when the east germans came together and demanded their freedom we too will give those living in closed societies the technology to take down the great firewall that separates them from the rest of the world
1529455 more and more people in closed societies are becoming aware of the power of our technologies and the power of information as more and more of them are empowered by information freedom no firewall no berlin wall and no iron curtain will be able to hold them back its simply a matter of time

1529465 is that ok as in not as good as the hofbr u or ok i was able to suppress my gag reflex
1529466 i think it is important to lend a vision of optimism without denying realism the goal is not to engage in positive thinking all the time as it does not necessarily motivate patients to make changes negative emotions and experiences are part of the human condition it is hard to experience happiness if we dont have healthy negative emotions at the same time patients may be conditioned by their medical experience to think they can only be coping with non happiness and not think about what makes them happy

1529526 i know that im endangering my life and am even liable to lose my father but i hope that hell understand this and that god will give him and my family the patience and willingness to open their eyes to jesus and to christianity maybe one day ill be able to return to palestine and to ramallah together with jesus in the kingdom of god
1529527 as a child i grew up in a very religious family on the principle of hatred of israelis the first time i encountered them was at about the age of 10 when soldiers entered our home and arrested my father until then i had never been separated from him we didnt know anything about the circumstances of his arrest his membership in hamas was a secret matter and we certainly didnt think he was one of its founders i didnt understand anything about politics or religion i only knew that the israeli army had arrested my father repeatedly and for me he was everything a good loving man who would do anything for me he took care of us bought us gifts gave of himself whereas the soldiers entered our house and took him away from me in high school i studied sharia islamic law in 1996 when i was only 18 i was arrested by the israel defense forces because i was the head of the islamic society in my high school its a kind of youth movement of the organization and my process of awakening began
1529528 until then i knew hamas through my father who lived a very modest and loving life
1529529 nobody knows them and how they operate as well as i do for example i remember how the family of saleh talahmeh a member of the military arm of hamas who was assassinated by israel was forced to beg for financial assistance because they were left with nothing after his death the hamas leadership abandoned them as well as the families of other shaheeds martyrs while the senior members of the organization abroad wasted tens of thousand of dollars a month only on security for themselves
1529530 even some of the current leaders of hamas were involved in the past in the security arm in the prisons so that he is among those responsible for these acts they were suspicious of prisoners who spent too much time in the bathroom even if it was only an upset stomach they suspected that the prisoner was transferring information or alternatively having sexual relations with other men a homosexual the gays were immediately suspected of collaboration then i understood that not everyone in hamas is like my father hes a nice friendly man but i discovered how evil his colleagues are after my release i lost the faith i had in those who ostensibly represented islam
1529531 youll see this interview will open many peoples eyes it will shake islam from the roots and im not exaggerating what other case do you know where a son of a hamas leader who was raised on the tenets of extremist islam comes out against it although i was never a terrorist i was a part of them surrounded by them all the time
1529532 i feel that christianity has several aspects its not only a religion but a faith i now see god through jesus and can tell about him for days on end whereas the muslims wont be able to say anything about god i consider islam a big lie the people who supposedly represent the religion admired mohammed more than god killed innocent people in the name of islam beat their wives and dont have any idea what god is i have no doubt that theyll go to hell i have a message for them there is only one way to paradise the way of jesus who sacrificed himself on the cross for all of us
1529533 only those christians with whom i met and spent time knew about my decision for years i helped my father the hamas leader and he didnt know that i had converted only that i had christian friends
1529534 you have to understand i was never one of them although i helped my father and accompanied him i was always opposed to the use of terror hamas members didnt like me i didnt come to pray in the mosques i hung around with strangers they didnt like my leather jacket or even my jeans they considered it going astray but i helped my father and conducted his affairs because hes my father not because hes a leader in hamas im not a hamas activist who converted to christianity thats not the story i wanted to help my father understand that harming innocent people is forbidden and through him perhaps to change other peoples thinking
1529535 when i was with my father i in effect pushed a moderate hamas leader into making logical decisions such as stopping the attacks and establishing two states alongside one another
1529536 but within hamas there were other leaders mainly from the gaza strip and damascus who thought they had to continue with suicide attacks as an effective means of achieving their aims the problem was that they were stronger than my father in terms of their status in the organization what helped stop the attacks in the final analysis was israels attacks against the hamas leaders
1529537 he had no connection to the military arm but they always consulted him about strategic decisions the hamas leadership did not make decisions only according to the opinion of the organization leaders in syria or gaza however you have to remember that the hamas leadership in damascus was in control of the organizations money therefore it had the most influence on organization policy they were also the only ones who were not restricted in contacting one another as opposed to the leaderships in the west bank and gaza so that they also served as go betweens among all the groups in hamas and incidentally although they now claim that the revolution in gaza was not planned i can tell you from clear knowledge that a year earlier in the summer of 2006 they spoke among themselves to the effect that if the tension with fatah continued they intended to take control of the strip
1529538 i like his voice but dont always understand the words
1529539 i respect israel and admire it as a country im opposed to a policy of killing civilians or using them as a means to an end and i understand that israel has a right to defend itself the palestinians if they dont have an enemy to fight will fight each other in about 20 years from now youll remember what im telling you the conflict will be among various groups within hamas theyre already beginning to quarrel over control of the money
1529540 you jews should be aware you will never but never have peace with hamas islam as the ideology that guides them will not allow them to achieve a peace agreement with the jews they believe that tradition says that the prophet mohammed fought against the jews and that therefore they must continue to fight them to the death they have to take revenge against anyone who did not agree to accept the prophet mohammed like the jews who are seen in the koran as monkeys and the sons of pigs they speak in terms of historical rights that were taken from them in the view of hamas peace with israel contradicts sharia and the koran and the jews have no right to remain in palestine
1529541 more than that an entire society sanctifies death and the suicide terrorists in palestinian culture a suicide terrorist becomes a hero a martyr sheikhs tell their students about the heroism of the shaheeds and that causes the young people to imitate the suicide bombers in order to achieve glory ill give you an example i once met a young man named dia tawil he was a quiet boy an outstanding student not a muslim extremist and not radical in his ideas against the israelis i never heard extreme statements from him he didnt even come from a religious family his father was a communist and his sister was a journalist who didnt wear a head covering but bilal barghouti one of the heads of the military arm of hamas in the west bank didnt need more than a few months to convince him to become a suicide terrorist
1529542 do you know that hamas was the first to use the weapon of suicide bombers against civilian targets
1529543 they are blind and ignorant its true there are good and bad people everywhere but hamas supporters dont understand that they are led by a wicked and cruel group that brainwashes the children and gets them to believe that if they carry out a suicide attack theyll get to paradise but no suicide bomber will find himself there and no virgins are waiting for them after they have carried out an attack they have to understand that islam was created by people and not by god
1529544 in my eyes there were all cruel ugly inside but i think that mahmoud zahar one of the leaders of hamas in gaza is one of the worst
1529545 people with an open mind i liked to walk around among the buildings the restaurants the people to feel the night life i have many friends there whom i would like to see and i dont know whether ill be able to do that at all i mainly miss my mother my brothers and sisters but i know that it will be very difficult for me to return to ramallah soon
1529546 i hope that ill succeed one day in becoming a writer in order to write about my personal story and about the middle east conflict but at the moment at least my ambitions are only to find work a place to live i have no money i have no apartment i was about to become one of those homeless people but people from the church are helping me im dependent on them
1529547 i left behind a great deal of property in ramallah in order to achieve true freedom i wanted to get to quiet surroundings that would help me to open the eyes of the muslims and reveal the truth to them about their religion and about christianity to take them out of the darkness and the prison of islam in that way theyll have an opportunity to correct their mistakes to become better people and to bring a chance for peace in the middle east i dont give islam a chance to survive for more than 25 years in the past they scared people and in that way they prevented anti religious publicity but today in the modern age they wont be able to hide the truth any longer
1529548 i hope that someday god will give the opportunity to meet the right one she will have to be a believing christian and if shes a jew who converted even better
1529549 many people will hate me for this interview but im telling them that i love all of them even those who hate me

1529584 our own expectation is that we will be german champions titles are expected at bayern
1529585 bayern munich are the favorites schalke and bremen could try to exert some pressure on them from behind
1529586 the title goes through bayern munich because they have the best personnel by far after that probably comes schalke and bremen while im very excited about wolfsburg who have invested a lot in new arrivals
1529587 bayern munich because they have the best squad schalke and werder will try to make life hard for them
1529588 bayern munich have by a wide distance the best squad six national team players sit on the bench there bremen hamburg wolfsburg and schalke will be on their tail
1529589 bayern munich because they have the strongest squad professional management and the best prerequisites
1529590 bayern are always the favorites they have the most options and the best squad im really thankful that j rgen klinsmann introduced to the public training methods that we bundesliga coaches have been using for years its that old song if 12 sandbags in mainz are knocked over no ones interested with the national team or at bayern a single grain would suffice
1529591 the usual suspects will be playing for the championship bayern munich schalke 04 and werder bremen maybe a surprise team as well but bayern are the clear favorites they have the best quality squad
1529592 bayern are considering both the quality and quantity of their players the best positioned
1529593 bayern munich will be champions we want to affirm our pre season position and reach an international competition once again
1529594 my tip is bayern munich they havent lost any key personnel and strengthened their squad there isnt another team in the bundesliga with access to such a high quality balanced squad
1529595 i think that bayern as usual will get the title
1529596 bayern munich are always favorites in the bundesliga but schalke have progressed well over the years and are always playing near the top we want to do that again this year
1529597 bayern are once more the class of the league but all the teams who were at the top last season have a shot again at the title
1529598 lukas still has a two year contract here it doesnt even come into question i will make a large effort so that lukas feels comfortable at bayern m nchen

1529601 how dentons manages to pick the best pieces of 70s rock the unironic radio kind not the hipster approved cars kind and combine it with original modern flourishes and not sound like a quartet of douche bags is anyones guess we think though its got something to do with smart songwriting unexpected breaks and song dynamics and knowing how to avoid overdoing it

1529620 but i already have wifi on my current tariff why should i pay an extra 10 just because the tariff is called business
1529621 can i speak to someone who can explain what the 10 extra charge is really for please it cant be for the wifi because thats standard with the iphone
1529622 in that case could you please give me the name and email address of the head of your customer service department i will email the question through
1529623 the bolt on charge is for using the iphone on a business tariff
1529624 why would you need to charge me 10 extra for using the iphone on a business tariff when you dont on my current non business account at the same tariff
1529625 because you can choose from a wider range of tariffs when you sign up as a business customer
1529626 im struggling to understand the logic here on a 24 month contract you are going to charge me an additional 240 in total so that you can sell me a wider range of packages when i sign up that seems like an advantage to you but not to me im not sure why i should be paying any extra for that
1529627 ok please could you just tell me what additional value i get for the extra 10 monthly charge i will be expected to pay if i move to a business tariff
1529628 so why are you charging a bolt on for something which has no value for customers
1529629 we dont have to justify the 10 charge to you
1529630 ive spent a great deal of time recently studying this issue ive read what the people on the one side of the issue say and ive read what the people on the other side say ive read the scholars and the theologians and all sorts of others on this subject but then in the end i decided to get back to the bible and just take it for what it really says
1529631 when we hear people say they are just going to tell us what the bible means it is not true

1529635 for apple it matters most that they patch the client libraries since there are so few osx recursive servers in use
1529636 the bottom line is that despite this update it appears that the client libraries still arent patched
1529637 so apple might have fixed some of the more important parts for servers but is far from done yet as all the clients linked against a dns client library still need to get the workaround for the protocol weakness

1529678 we were very proud of the fact that bill gates in his last days working full time at microsoft and before dedicating more time to philanthropy took the time and effort to mention pnmsoft
1529679 gates chose his words very carefully as he spoke about the contributions and financial impact that pnmsoft has made within the business world pnmsofts sequence is intuitive bpm software based on a graphical flowchart based platform and developed primarily for business users this bpm software suite leverages windows workflow foundation and focuses on human workflow and systems integration it interacts with people through outlook windows sharepoint and in other ways
1529680 the sequence bpm software has powerful options to enable users the maximum flexibility in taking an existing business process and converting it from a manual flow to an automated flow as users gain proficiency in this bpm software they are guided by day to day forms task lists automated integration into systems emails and more sequence has many predefined wizards that help users to enable and reuse elements within the bpm software a key factor in making customer applications easy to deploy
1529681 it allowed swifttrade a leading company involved with financial services to grow from 27 to 65 offices within one year
1529682 without an effective and easy bpm software package that would not have been possible a global telecom a world leader in customer management solutions used pnmsofts bpm software suite to respond quicker to new customer projects in the teleco industry and as a result increase the value of each project tnuva one of europes largest food corporations was wasting a great deal of money in setting up new customer accounts and running promotions sequence bpm software allowed their dairy division to rapidly identify production problems speed handling time for quality assurance issues and enhance customer service processes we have so many more examples stock exchange that speeds up the process of filling to an ipo defense and homeland security organizations that practices better decision management processes and operations room tasks prioritization a world leading engineering company using sequence bpm software for project management and compliance the list goes on and on from our experience our bpm software has proven its return on investment roi again and again its always about revenue acceleration cost reduction and organization governance
1529683 bpm software from pnmsoft offers users a highly flexible and convenient approach into business process management software it incorporates a set of integrated bpm software modules that are 100 percent web based which make it perfect for software as a service saas and which require minimal or no coding or programming this enables everyone in an organization to apply bpm software in their daily tasks and contribute towards greater corporate efficiency
1529684 i have selected to describe pnmsoft a microsoft company partner in israel they have a business process management solution called sequence and they connect to microsoft biztalk server if you have workflows that relate to transactions or analysis you get rich visualization on the information and they get much of their information from oracle applications which work with hr purchasing and finance
1529685 we have a huge amount of innovation relating to workflow and business intelligence
1529686 the data that you want to perform business intelligence on comes from many sources it comes from erp internal external sources it comes from things that were done bottoms up in an excel type analysis being able to pull that all together into a horizontal platform that is very simple to use and yet has all of this data it makes a very big difference microsoft has had a lot of customers take pnmsoft sequence into their oracle environment
1529687 they have done a great job on fast deployment so after 3 months working with a global telco company they were able to connect up over 30 processes inside this company being used by over 15 000 employees and these processes without the connection to the erp from this workflow environment could not have been done without sequence it could not have been done by workflow alone or by erp alone it was by bringing these processes together that they could be made digital and simple for this large number of employees pnmsoft sequence is a great example of how bpm can work
1529688 my lifes work really is about software and working with incredible people

1529719 this has always been your campaign and theres no one i want to hear from more than you

1529731 the most recent national survey of adult oral health 2004 06 australias dental generations indicates that while more australian adults are going to the dentist now than 17 years ago approximately 48 of people are not attending the dentist regularly
1529732 regular dental check ups and the maintenance of good oral hygiene would result in an expense that is a fraction of the yearly cost of most peoples visits to the hairdresser with more and more research showing the intrinsic link between oral health and overall health a regular dental check up can prove to be an investment in good health
1529733 a stronger trade performance will generate significant dividends for our community research shows that export focussed industries create higher paying and higher skilled jobs with better working conditions
1529734 everyone around the table today acknowledged that if we want to reap the benefits of trade and ensure our economy is sustainable in the long run the commonwealth and the states and territories need to work together to enhance our trade performance
1529735 the rudd governments trade policy is being pursued through the prism of international competitiveness but progress will be limited without cooperation and input from the states and territories that is why all the australian governments agreed in march this year that we needed to establish a ministerial council on international trade no other coag group can address these issues
1529736 the purpose of this meeting is to develop a coordinated approach to trade policy reflecting both a whole of government and a whole of governments perspective
1529737 a key focus of the coag meeting will be how the commonwealth states and territories can work more closely together to improve australias trade and investment performance
1529738 reflecting the changing nature of international trade the states and territories can play a key role in addressing the behind the border issues such as regulations standards and conformance that can impact on our trading performance
1529739 export focussed industries create higher paying and higher skilled jobs with better working conditions for our communities all levels of government must therefore work together to improve our trade performance
1529740 an important role for the council will be to provide input from a trade perspective into the work of other areas of government on issues like infrastructure skills and climate change these all go towards the competitiveness of export industries and allow them to take advantage of improved market access
1529741 this meeting will provide the opportunity to begin working more closely together on export and investment promotion activities including in the lead up to the shanghai expo in 2010
1529742 i have asked the alrc to develop options for ensuring a consistent approach across government to the protection of commonwealth information
1529743 we are committed to open and accountable government and want to ensure that commonwealth information is only protected where there is a legitimate reason for doing so
1529744 where there are legitimate reasons for protecting commonwealth information such as information relating to national security we need to ensure that our laws provide sufficient protection against unauthorised disclosure
1529745 removing barriers to the sharing of information has been identified as an important step to achieving a whole of government approach to national security
1529746 equally we need strong secrecy laws in place to ensure that sensitive commonwealth information remains protected from unauthorised disclosure if it is passed to other agencies
1529747 i want to urge other communities to take part in the meetings reviewing drought policy goes beyond considering the economic and productivity challenges involved
1529748 the social panel is a vital part of the three stage review of drought policy we need to know how it is affecting individuals and communities
1529749 we face a likely future of longer deeper and more frequent droughts its essential that we get the policy settings right people who cant make the forums can still contribute to the review through written submissions they close this friday
1529750 the publication provides easy to read information on primary industries and the natural resources on which they rely
1529751 it provides a snapshot of the key features for each of our agriculture and food industries including their size location and contribution to the economy and how they are tackling pressures like climate change and a challenging trade environment
1529752 australia is one of the worlds largest agricultural export nations in terms of wheat beef dairy products wine and wool more than two thirds of agricultural production is exported generating 27 8 billion in 2006 07
1529753 at a glance reinforces that our agriculture fisheries and forestry industries have the opportunity to become the most productive and efficient in the world ensuring a prosperous future for australia
1529754 while the final decisions on whether agriculture will be included will not be made until 2013 the paper indicates that forestry may be able to opt in to the carbon trading scheme when it starts
1529755 there are many measurement issues we need to address before we include agriculture and we want to hear what farmers and their industry organisations have to say about resolving those issues
1529756 the department of agriculture fisheries and forestry consultations will focus solely on the aspects of the green paper that relate to agriculture and forestry i encourage those working in agriculture or forestry industries to attend these regional forums and contribute to the governments decision making process
1529757 i believe that our action plan combined with the broader reforms that are already in train to further strengthen competition policy such as the amendments to the misuse of market power provision and the criminalisation of serious cartel conduct will ensure that the grocery market remains competitive
1529758 the accc has conducted a substantial amount of work to ensure only
1529759 the introduction of unit pricing combined with grocerychoice will empower consumers to find the best deals at the supermarket
1529760 i would like to thank the accc for delivering this comprehensive and wide ranging report into the grocery sector
1529761 i think in their culture the issue of mental illness is kind of frowned upon

1529766 be careful carelessness cannot be afforded for luthien hunts you beware his eye beware those that would claim to be your friends who do not know you
1529767 we have to get out of the water the ships being hit by cannons
1529768 i know weve been caught up with luthien managed to wrangle a ship maybe more
1529769 and that might be a little difficult if they keep doing that
1529770 we need to get the ship out of this reef
1529771 so theyve done there what we need to do here we need to get our troops out of iraq and put them on the streets of america to protect us from the scourge of illegal immigrants who are running rampant across america killing our police for sport raping murdering like a scythe across america while the liberal psychos are telling us they come here to work
1529772 y ou turn on the cable news theyre covering again a missing child not a missing country but a missing child we hear about the rape of a woman but not about the rape of the statue of liberty the statue of liberty is crying shes been raped and disheveled raped and disheveled by illegal aliens
1529773 things are so bad in europe that the italians have put soldiers military on their streets now you have to understand what it means by things are so bad the illegal immigrants mainly muslims and africans are out of control
1529774 so theyve done there what we need to do here we need to get our troops out of iraq and put them on the streets of america to protect us from the scourge of illegal immigrants who are running rampant across america killing our police for sport raping murdering like a scythe across america while the liberal psychos are telling us they come here to work
1529775 t he local comic books that nobody buys anymore called newspapers
1529776 no truth no reality no stories you turn on the cable news theyre covering again a missing child not a missing country but a missing child we hear about the rape of a woman but not about the rape of the statue of liberty the statue of liberty is crying shes been raped and disheveled raped and disheveled by illegal aliens and our politicians do nothing except give themselves big fat checks and big fat jobs
1529777 were getting refugees now who have never used a telephone a toothbrush or toilet paper youre telling me theyre going to assimilate they will never assimilate they come here and they bring their destitute ways to this country and they never assimilate

1529800 de ce excel pe langa programul meu de contabilitate foarte bun
1529801 last week we carried out nine search and seizure warrants at several residential properties and business premises across perth
1529802 as a result of these warrants several people were questioned and one man was arrested and charged with import offences
1529803 stopping the smuggling of performance and image enhancing drugs at the border and investigating and prosecuting those involved continues to be a high priority for customs
1529804 the crc program was established under the hawke government in 1990 over that time it has been extraordinarily successful with the australian government committing nearly 3 billion to establish 168 crcs crcs have also produced over 4 650 industry ready postgraduates including over 2 460 graduates with phds
1529805 however over recent years the focus and emphasis of the program has shifted
1529806 the previous government cut public interest research out of the program we committed to filling that void and this report lays out the options for reviving the crc program
1529807 this review has provided a timely opportunity for all stakeholders to assess the focus of the program it has given everyone a chance to think about how we can improve crcs to ensure they deliver the best possible outcomes for researchers industry and the entire australian community
1529808 we need to make a greater effort to bring researchers and innovative companies together it is vital to a healthy innovation system but an area in which australia has been falling further behind our competitors over recent years
1529809 breaking down barriers and drawing upon different skills perspectives and experiences lies at the heart of the crc philosophy
1529810 the group has worked diligently to produce a thoughtful and intellectually rigorous report in particular i know professor okanes commitment and enthusiasm has been instrumental in driving the review process

1529813 this has other personal numbers that could give them access to credit or debit cards that have already been issued and are active
1529814 the defendants then used these cards to withdraw tens of thousands of dollars at a time from atms
1529815 there are ties between all three districts and ties internationally that go all the way to the ukraine and latvia
1529816 the 41 million credit and debit numbers were used internationally
1529817 identity theft can involve a single criminal stealing the personal financial information of a single victim or as it did here it can involve a group of criminals stealing the credit card numbers of millions of people many of whom may not even learn that they were victims for months or years
1529818 identity theft victims suffer well beyond the immediate financial costs they suffer lost confidence in their privacy and security as well as the emotional strain and the time it can take to repair damaged financial lives and credit histories in many cases the effects of these crimes can be felt for years after they are committed
1529819 we have been working with countries around the world to identify and address technical vulnerabilities in computer networks and to ensure that laws and procedures are adequate to deal with these kinds of crime
1529820 and we have been working closely with our international partners to crack specific cases when they take us beyond our borders

1529827 as it stands right now we arent to sure on the direction of travel of either vehicle speed was likely a factor but that has not been confirmed
1529828 the fire had been contained by the activation of a single sprinkler head wfr crews quickly suppressed any remaining fire and ventilated residual smoke from the building the fire appears to have started on an exterior skylight and is being treated as suspicious
1529829 he used to own a restaurant in north vancouver called the vault on lower lonsdale
1529830 it was a very trendy place i used to frequent it quite a bit and got to know him quite well
1529831 he was a successful restaurateur back in the late 80s and early 90s i dont know things fell apart somehow somewhere something took a wrong turn
1529832 i was a little surprised i saw him about a year ago here and he looked pretty rough i thought maybe he had a stroke or something i didnt talk to him very much then i read this
1529833 he was a good guy happy joyful sort of guy it was a pub restaurant he owned and i dont really remember him having any alcohol type problems but times change and things happened
1529834 there was no cooperation from him or a friend of his now we are pursuing the line of questions again in light of his death hopefully that will change their attitude with respect to their cooperation
1529835 im here to audition for the next john mccain tv commercial
1529836 grandpappy told my pappy back in my day son a man had to answer for the wicked that hed done take all the rope in texas find a tall oak tree round up all of them bad boys hang them high in the street for all the people to see
1529837 i hear he might go to the minnesota vikings hes the oldest player in football but he loves to play like tony
1529838 no thanks she sang on my record so i think shes kind of getting back at me because she was doing harmonies and backgrounds
1529839 on a day when major news organizations across the country are taking senator mccain to task for a steady stream of false negative attacks his campaign has launched yet another or as some might say oops he did it again our dependence on foreign oil is one of the greatest challenges we face in this election the american people have a real choice between obamas plan to provide tax rebates to american families while creating a renewable energy economy in america that frees us from our dependence on foreign oil and senator mccains plan to continue the same failed energy policies by handing out nearly 4 billion in tax breaks to oil companies while investing almost nothing in the new energy sources that represent our future
1529840 i went up to her and told her that i was concerned because it was very dark i asked her to leave or i would call her a cab i was uncomfortable with her being there sitting on the roadside
1529841 its reflective of the fact that more investigative work needs to be done
1529842 there were no reported ejections or arrests made as a result of the event
1529843 this appeared to be successful in moving individuals away from the local nightclubs during the bar flush there were a few infractions over the course of the weekend however we are pleased with the overall turnaround and the cooperation of those drivers
1529844 this individual became irate and threatened hotel staff while demanding cash back officers located the suspect in the parking lot and when they attempted to arrest him he became combative and attempted to swallow several baggies believed to contain cocaine during the arrest the suspect attempted to bite an officer twice
1529845 extending terms to four years might suit some communities but im not sure it would suit kelowna kelowna is a changing community going through lots of development the demand for infrastructure is never ending
1529846 i believe a three year term is a good balance it gives us the best of both worlds
1529847 having been a new councillor last year knowing it takes a year to really get up to speed my personal opinion is that a four year term makes more sense there is just so much to learn in the first year then there is just about one year to do the work and then in the third year its like election fever kicks in and everyone goes into election mode
1529848 im happy with whatever is decided its certainly a good topic to discuss there is a financial benefit for a community to have elections every four years instead of three but thats also longer for people to commit their time
1529849 its being totally rebuilt the reason its brown now is because were not irrigating it
1529850 its going to be completely rebuilt and reconfigured as a result of the bridge approach
1529851 with a natural grass field it takes time before you can put people on it we usually like to allow a full season of growing before putting people on it so the field probably wont open until the spring of 2010

1529853 my understanding is he works takes the paperwork and tries to get people to invest in his properties without putting money down
1529854 the mccain campaign distributed tire pressure gauges outside the event here in response to mr obamas statement last week that americans could reduce gasoline use substantially if they kept car tires at optimum pressure
1529855 republicans meanwhile ridiculed mr obama for suggesting last week that motorists keep their tires inflated as a way to reduce energy use
1529856 you can improve your gas mileage by around 3 3 percent by keeping your tires inflated to the proper pressure under inflated tires can lower gas mileage by 0 4 percent for every 1 psi drop in pressure of all four tires
1529857 but if youve got under inflated tires said dan zielinski of the rubber manufacturing association who pointed us to data from nhtsa and californias aaa and federal data you could save yourself about 200 by pumping up your wheels is that a bad idea and if everyone did it thatd be 2 8 billion gallons of gas nothing to sneeze at and its free
1529858 both governors appealed to those with the real power to make change average citizens to drive slower keep engines tuned and tires properly inflated to buy hybrids and lower overall consumption
1529859 its a bit of everything to do with house really its all about the 4 4 beat ive got this ep coming out in october ive got a new single coming in august from this guy david aussi which is quite melodic french tech house and then ive got some electro coming out if i like it i sign it
1529860 it has to keep me interested otherwise i just get bored a lot of these proggy tracks that just go on and on with the minimal tracks if theyre done well if theyre good with a good groove they can work im just looking for a bit of melody and funk
1529861 because i was born in 1980 its as simple as that i wanted to get the label going and i was thinking what can i call it what can i call it and i wanted something that would stick in your head and when it comes to looking in a directory its up there at the top

1529866 while everyone agrees that the hispanic population has grown they cannot expand by taking african american seats
1529867 senator obama you are a guttless coward you want everybody to think i am a r cist but you dont have the conviction to outright say it so you use your namby pamby way of doing it i again call you a guttless coward and i cannot believe any one would want a low class person of your character to lead this country we deserve better oh and if i thought you had the courage and fortitude to look me in the eye i would say it to your smug little face you jackass i would pop you right in the face you son of a b tchin liar
1529868 obama will say and do anything to get elected and he will get in there and not know what the hell he is doing
1529869 race card has been played so many times it is now dog earred

1529886 abbiamo mediato per ottenere lo scambio dei prigionieri e per il loro rilasciamento unilaterale tra cui quello di ingrid betancourt di queste operazioni abbiamo informato i presidenti della camera violante casini e bertinotti e i sottosegretari agli esteri con delega allamerica latina dopo l11 settembre le farc sono considerate dallopinione diffusa come dei gruppi di narcotrafficanti terroristi per noi sono unorganizzazione politico militare che esiste da pi di 40 anni ci non significa che condividiamo o sosteniamo acriticamente quello che fanno essere identificati oggi come complici di una rete del terrore inverosimile e denuncia unazione di disinformazione di el tiempo

1529891 at the moment all our video content is on tape
1529892 once we digitise it we can then repurpose it quickly for web and mobile properties weve already implemented the project in some regions
1529893 we havent taken a structured template approach to rolling out new websites
1529894 weve left it up to the producers like endemol and fremantle media so the sites reflect their individual production qualities
1529895 weve been able to use the vanilla concept to reduce the time taken to build test and deploy new sites to three to four weeks
1529896 weve also put some constraints on the design team so that we dont have to change the xhtml too much each time too many changes would blow the concept out of the water
1529897 if someone builds a great ruby on rails application in their garage we want to be able to use it

1529910 i have noticed that every once in a while the phone will re boot itself when i click one of the new application icons it has happened with more than one application so i dont know if the applications are coded wrong or if the 2 0 firmware has bugs
1529911 lo and behold the darn bug fixes appear to have worked
1529912 i havent had any application crash since updating the firmware crashes were pretty consistent prior to updating

1529927 someone has to be either male or female and it cant be changed
1529928 the difference between emo and goth emos hate themselves goths hate everyone emos want to kill themselves goths want to kill everyone

1529932 category but a quick check of some of the other brands there shows this is very much a unique format
1529933 the pulp magazine writers the best of them worked for markets that did not write for critics or attempt to satisfy timid advertisers not having to answer to anyone other than their readers they wrote about human beings on the edges of the unknown in those new lands the future would explore they wrote for what we would become not for what we had already been

1529939 akil bomani is a member of the chicago writers and artists collective and a correspondent to revolution newspaper
1529940 in the george orwell book 1984 it was the ministry of truth that was responsible for going through libraries and removing all references to unpersons and rewriting the historical accounts to line up with the new facts akil disagreed with the cult of personality and that was intolerable
1529941 stirring controversy wherever they spoke on the airwaves in house meetings and at a full panel discussion at cal state dominguez hills the rc4 kicked off their visit here bringing straight to the people the compelling vision of the communist revolution developed by bob avakian
1529942 bringing straight to the people the compelling vision of the communist revolution developed
1529943 the rcp had very little political influence and connection if any to the african american communities it was trying to reach we entered the communities as outsiders attempting to proselytize the inhabitants to become followers
1529944 but reading preaching from a pulpit of bones inspired me to do something that religion in general denounces think critically so i expanded my research i delved deeper into marxism and perused the bible further for myself to deconstruct all of the paradigms it had for so long instilled into me and so many others
1529945 in the george orwell book 1984 it was the ministry of truth that was responsible for going through libraries and removing all references to unpersons and rewriting the historical accounts to line up with the new facts akil disagreed with the cult of personality and that was intolerable
1529946 ive actually been learning some interesting things from this site so dont take this the wrong way
1529947 isnt what happened to akil and his involvement with the rcp on a smaller level not much different than trotsky being airbrushed out of old photos and even more extreme other old bolsheviks getting bullets in the back of the head
1529948 this is my stop this is where i get off
1529949 a thought experiment what would have happened to akil in stalins russia if he stepped out of line would that have been any different in the alternate universe where bob avakian was running the show in the u s stirring the hornets nest i know but it seems like an obvious point to me
1529950 if you are not with us you are sinister and irredeemable
1529951 it is worth noting that it is the kasama project that has consistently held to the principles and methods once upheld by the rcp and ba
1529952 the method of the communists around the kasama project stands in sharp contrast to the approach of the rcp today

1529956 that fateful summer 8 15 the roar of a b 229 breaks the morning calm a parachute opens in the blue sky then suddenly a flash an enormous blast silence hell on earth
1529957 the eyes of young girls watching the parachute melted their faces became giant charred blisters the skin of people seeking help dangled from their fingernails their hair stood on end their clothes were ripped to shreds people trapped in houses toppled by the blast were burned alive others died when their eyes and internal organs burst from their bodies hiroshima was a hell where those who somehow survived envied the dead
1529958 sap is contributing the most to our current growth by incorporating livelink within their tools
1529959 were almost a partner by stealth and our customer base is growing as a result
1529960 we believe well be the first vendor in the ecm space to be pushing 1 billion in revenues
1529961 the work were doing with sap and in the channel is what is going to take us towards achieving that mark
1529962 after parole i returned to the newsroom as state news editor of the evening sun then baltimore county bureau chief after the morning and evening staffs combined
1529963 in the late 1990s when mangement decided that technology might be worth coverning regularly i started and edited a standalone weekly tech section called plugged in which was great fun for five years and generated enthusiastic readership but unfortunately not many ads
1529964 but given our location in one of the nations most important research corridors our top management was committed to making health and science a franchise beat
1529965 whatever the ups and downs of the businesss all downs lately i had a great career in newspaper journalism theres no other occupation in the world where you can do all these things investigate so many subjects get paid to satisfy your curiosity and see your work in print so quickly
1529966 in particular writing a weekly technology column allowed me to pursue an avocation hobby that was great fun and something i probably would have done anyway
1529967 the other great opportunity was creating and editing two weekly sections
1529968 whats so awful to contemplate is that this whole framework is dissolving before us
1529969 for many years my column made its home in on the front of the business section of the sun
1529970 heres what makes me even angrier even with this falloff in advertising many newspapers can still generate a positive cash flow but so many of them have been swallowed up in leveraged buyouts that theyre saddled with debt that they never would have incurred in their independent days theyre not typical failed companies who borrowed too heavily to finance new plants or ill fated expansion plans theyre creatures of a insane investment climate its hard to see how theyll survive or in what form but i have confidence that if anyone can do it and if theyre given half a chance the folks at the sun will figure out a way
1529971 alice the patients sats are in the 80s and i cant make them come up
