8410001 es l gico que cuando el gol no aparece se apunte a los delanteros como responsables pero nosotros tuvimos una chance clara cada uno en tres partidos s lo contra defensa falta m s juego

8410011 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8410012 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8410013 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8410014 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8410015 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8410035 i started thinking as i was coming over here why is it that joe biden is the first in his family ever to go to a university why is it that my wife who is sitting out there in the audience is the first in her family to ever go to college is it because our fathers and mothers were not bright
8410036 those people who could sing and play and recite and write poetry those people who could make wonderful beautiful things with their hands those people who could dream dreams see visions why didnt they get it was it because they were weak those people who could work eight hours underground and then come up and play football weak
8410037 those same people who read poetry and wrote poetry and taught me how to sing verse is it because they didnt work hard my ancestors who worked in the coal mines of northeast pennsylvania and would come up after 12 hours and play football for four hours

8410116 since multimedia often transcends linguistic barriers we thought it apt to help translate a multimedia player into local languages we chose vlc because it is undoubtedly the most popular open source media player available
8410117 at translate org za we believe that people express themselves best in their own language and people should be encouraged to create multimedia such as podcasts and sound bytes in their native languages
8410118 our way of empowering local languages is to help make popular software in these languages available
8410119 we also make it easier for volunteers by providing a simple web based translation system called pootle which is hosted at pootle locamotion org which makes it easy for anyone to help translate software
8410120 weve split the vlc language file into more workable chunks to make the number of source words more manageable
8410121 organisations such as ours can freely use open source software as a catalyst for creating language communities
8410122 anyone who wants to help translate vlc into their language can make use of our translation system

8410134 even in these times when all the talk is of putting history behind us the easiest way to tell the difference between the irish and the english is to utter the word
8410135 i was myself assaulted and received death threats the depth of hatred that still exists in ireland is matched only by unawareness in non catholic english circles of what cromwell did in ireland i am reminded of gk chestertons remark that the tragedy of the english conquest of ireland in the 17th century is that the irish can never forget it and the english can never remember it
8410136 it was in accordance with the laws of war but it went far beyond what any general had done in england
8410137 this was ethnic cleansing on a scale undreamt of by slobodan milosevic
8410138 reverence for cromwell was one of the few socialist traditions that survived the transition from old to new labour

8410140 until the executive shows that it can deal with the matters already devolved
8410141 it is increasingly a manifestation of republican frustration at the failure of sinn f in to deliver what it promised to its own movement
8410142 nationalists and republicans will once again be disappointed by the attitude being displayed by the sdlp
8410143 any commitments that were given by the government to sinn f in are a matter for the government but the dup made the situation perfectly clear before we left st andrews that we had not agreed to any dates for the transfer of powers
8410144 i say again that until the executive shows that it can deal with the matters already devolved it should not be taking on more especially a portfolio as contentious as justice
8410145 i was outside the family home when the raid began and i was inside immediately afterwards speaking with the family who are close friends of mine the reality of the ruc psni was here for all to see in broad daylight and the residents of this estate remain justifiably suspicious of the force
8410146 most accounts agree that it was south ossetian separatists who committed the first act of escalation when they blew up a georgian military vehicle on august 1 wounding five georgian peacekeeping troops georgia responded in kind killing six south ossetian militiamen
8410147 capt ivanov and eduard kokoity the pro moscow president of south ossetia say they held a meeting that day between marat kulakhmetov commander of the russian peacekeeping forces and temur yakobashvili the georgian minister for re integration whose job is to deal with the breakaway regions
8410148 i would like to address those who are now shooting at georgian policemen i want to say with full responsibility that several hours ago i reached a very difficult decision not to respond with fire this was no use however and the fighting escalated
8410149 georgian president sakashvilis biggest lie was his attempt to airbrush the fact that he created the crisis by launching an artillery barrage on the south ossetian capital which killed scores of civilians and 15 russian peacekeepers it was absurd to think russia would not retaliate so the next lie was to claim russias leaders had prepared a trap in fact they were taken by surprise as much as the ossetians nevertheless russia should pull back completely now it should also have restrained south ossetian militias from running amok against georgian villages

8410152 clintons deputy national policy director jake sullivan outlined several irish policies that would be undertaken in a clinton white house come 2009 he said clinton would immediately appoint an american special envoy on ireland who would maintain an office in the white house and report directly to the president clinton would also firmly focus on economic development in northern ireland sullivan said and have her secretary of commerce and other government agencies get involved in developing strategies for ireland

8410154 after a few minutes of talking about inching forward towards the peace process haas finally snapped
8410155 yet there were indications that no 10 had more room for manoeuvre than it realised in july 2005 the ira had finally agreed to decommission all its weapons at the last minute adams called no 10 to demand that some of the weapons not be destroyed so that the ira could arm itself against possible attacks from dissident members unless this was allowed he threatened decommissioning would not proceed the blair government conceded but wanted to check with dublin irish justice minister michael mcdowell refused to acquiesce in the backsliding despite enormous pressure powell told adams of the problem and adams gave way decommissioning took place as planned

8410157 605 000 long term immigrants arriving in the year to mid 2007 the eu projections show that the wave of migration to britain boosting both the workforce and fertility rates is out of step with many other european countries where deaths are expected to overtake births after 2015
8410158 trends differ for the four countries of the uk the population of england is projected to increase by 8 per cent by 2016 that of northern ireland by 7 per cent big year that and wales by 5 per cent the projected increase for scotland where fertility and life expectancy levels are assumed to remain lower than in the rest of the uk is 3 per cent across the united kingdom northern ireland recorded the highest rate of growth with a one per cent population rise last year to 1 8 million people the population of england rose by 0 6 per cent to 51 1 million scotland and wales rose by 0 5 per cent
8410159 the uk population reached 60 5 million this year and the new official figures suggest it will rise to 65 million by 2016 and 71 million by 2031

8410163 this is not a game this is not fun what weve seen tonight is actually attempted murder please stop it now before someone is killed
8410164 discussions on the devolution of policing and justice have progressed well in the preparation for government committee the governments have requested the parties to continue these discussions so as to agree the necessary administrative arrangements to create a new policing and justice department it is our view i e the view of the two governments that the implementation of the agreement published today should be sufficient to build the community confidence necessary for the assembly to request the devolution of criminal justice and policing from the british government by may 2008
8410165 there is no definitive date for the devolution of policing and justice powers we remain of the unshakable view that those powers can only be transferred whenever there is the required community confidence

8410168 this charge of fiddling while rome burns was a problem which heaney discusses in his essay the interesting case of nero chekhovs cognac and a knocker where he recalls how he and david hammond felt unable to record a tape of songs against the immediate backdrop of explosions in belfast
8410169 we aimed to challenge sectarian divisions in the north of ireland to put
8410170 davy is in that well worn phrase a man of many parts but the whole is greater than the sum of the parts and the uniqueness of david hammond is his midas touch the way he can discern art and poetry in the commonplace and above all the way in which he effortlessly explores i would almost say creates a common ground on which irishmen and women of every tradition and disposition no matter how cantankerous or self regarding we may be in other areas can meet each other and re discover a vital part of ourselves in all of this his wife eileen has played a quiet but essential part their home in belfast has for years been a magnet for cultural waifs and strays of every description an embassy of song its warmth and hospitality a standing rebuke to the image of the dour wee north that is most prevalent among people who have never crossed the border
8410171 the singers house by seamus heaney to david hammond people here used to believe that drowned souls lived in seals at spring tides they might change shape they loved music and swam in for a singer who might stand at the end of summer in the mouth of a whitewashed turf shed his shoulder to the jamb his song a rowboat far out in evening when i came here first you were always singing a hint of the clip of the pick in your winnowing climb and attack raise it again man we still believe what we hear
8410172 its very clear we need to deliver any agreements that weve had with the dup and the two governments the devolution of policing and justice has to happen we in our party have worked for years and are very committed to the process under way but we need to start seeing results
8410173 the oireachtas could ratify lisbon subject to a number of opt outs if necessary for example the charter of fundamental rights the solidarity clause transfer of certain matters to qualified majority voting and the inclusion of new competences such as energy security climate change and tourism
8410174 mep mary lou mcdonald has said if the irish government secures a better deal for ireland at european level only then is there an argument for a new referendum those of us on the no side want specific new additional points in the treaty and we want specific cast iron legal views on taxation she said
8410175 a succession of anti family anti life and other anti christian decisions by brussels has made it more difficult for committed christians to maintain their instinctive support for europe in the lisbon referendum
8410176 concerns were expressed regarding abortion despite the specific assurances in terms of irelands legal arrangements in this regard
8410177 the overwhelming feeling expressed in more than 90 messages posted about the topic was that finding a northern ireland anthem could benefit the team
8410178 i heard poots spouting some rubbish about how northern ireland fans wouldnt stand for a change how dare he speak for all fans why not ask them first
8410179 for those who think it will diminish their britishness watch how hard sinn fein fight against this and ask yourselves why
8410180 mr poots is more and more increasingly out of touch with grassroots unionism i resent the fact that he would label anyone that disagrees with him as a lesser unionist
8410181 me being proud of being northern irish and wanting us to use a northern irish anthem doesnt make me any less british than you or devalue my unionism and not all northern ireland fans are unionists anyway you fool
8410182 poots reaction was totally predictable its just a stupid im more british than you points scoring exercise
8410183 its a small step in raising this important issue and it deserves discussion at all levels no matter the outcome
8410184 good on you basil dup sinn fein axis not in favour what a surprise
8410185 this would be a very positive step in my eyes the one and only chant i hate hearing at windsor is the old no surrender as it offends many of our own players i am pro union but that is neither here nor there and has nothing to do with supporting all 11 players wearing our green shirt

8410209 the defeat is very bitter in portugal there were two disputed decisions against us and tonight we were denied a clear goal we should actually be in the champions league but instead it is basel
8410210 it is fantastic for fc basel we are enormously happy we worked enormously hard for this goal it is worthwhile if one works so intensively and so consistently
8410211 i would like to thank the fans for their fantastic support we have them to thank for this

8410213 dump all your old ideas about whats happening in northern ireland
8410214 asking the right questions and getting together the right answers
8410215 even in these times when all the talk is of putting history behind us the easiest way to tell the difference between the irish and the english is to utter the word
8410216 i was myself assaulted and received death threats the depth of hatred that still exists in ireland is matched only by unawareness in non catholic english circles of what cromwell did in ireland i am reminded of gk chestertons remark that the tragedy of the english conquest of ireland in the 17th century is that the irish can never forget it and the english can never remember it
8410217 it was in accordance with the laws of war but it went far beyond what any general had done in england
8410218 this was ethnic cleansing on a scale undreamt of by slobodan milosevic
8410219 reverence for cromwell was one of the few socialist traditions that survived the transition from old to new labour
8410220 he was on the right side in the civil war and because of him the right side won he changed the course of english history and changed it for the better
8410221 until the executive shows that it can deal with the matters already devolved
8410222 it is increasingly a manifestation of republican frustration at the failure of sinn f in to deliver what it promised to its own movement
8410223 nationalists and republicans will once again be disappointed by the attitude being displayed by the sdlp
8410224 any commitments that were given by the government to sinn f in are a matter for the government but the dup made the situation perfectly clear before we left st andrews that we had not agreed to any dates for the transfer of powers
8410225 i say again that until the executive shows that it can deal with the matters already devolved it should not be taking on more especially a portfolio as contentious as justice
8410226 i was outside the family home when the raid began and i was inside immediately afterwards speaking with the family who are close friends of mine the reality of the ruc psni was here for all to see in broad daylight and the residents of this estate remain justifiably suspicious of the force
8410227 most accounts agree that it was south ossetian separatists who committed the first act of escalation when they blew up a georgian military vehicle on august 1 wounding five georgian peacekeeping troops georgia responded in kind killing six south ossetian militiamen
8410228 capt ivanov and eduard kokoity the pro moscow president of south ossetia say they held a meeting that day between marat kulakhmetov commander of the russian peacekeeping forces and temur yakobashvili the georgian minister for re integration whose job is to deal with the breakaway regions
8410229 i would like to address those who are now shooting at georgian policemen i want to say with full responsibility that several hours ago i reached a very difficult decision not to respond with fire this was no use however and the fighting escalated
8410230 georgian president sakashvilis biggest lie was his attempt to airbrush the fact that he created the crisis by launching an artillery barrage on the south ossetian capital which killed scores of civilians and 15 russian peacekeepers it was absurd to think russia would not retaliate so the next lie was to claim russias leaders had prepared a trap in fact they were taken by surprise as much as the ossetians nevertheless russia should pull back completely now it should also have restrained south ossetian militias from running amok against georgian villages

8410232 if we are forced to conclude that change will not be forthcoming from the executive then we will have no option but to pull out our ministers and seek to put pressure where responsibility ultimately lies which is on the british government in london
8410233 clintons deputy national policy director jake sullivan outlined several irish policies that would be undertaken in a clinton white house come 2009 he said clinton would immediately appoint an american special envoy on ireland who would maintain an office in the white house and report directly to the president clinton would also firmly focus on economic development in northern ireland sullivan said and have her secretary of commerce and other government agencies get involved in developing strategies for ireland
8410234 in the observer alan ruddock begins his account with the morning of september 11 the day of the terrorist attack on the world trade centre in new york as the us special envoy to ireland richard haas was preparing for a meeting with sinn fein leader gerry adams
8410235 after a few minutes of talking about inching forward towards the peace process haas finally snapped
8410236 yet there were indications that no 10 had more room for manoeuvre than it realised in july 2005 the ira had finally agreed to decommission all its weapons at the last minute adams called no 10 to demand that some of the weapons not be destroyed so that the ira could arm itself against possible attacks from dissident members unless this was allowed he threatened decommissioning would not proceed the blair government conceded but wanted to check with dublin irish justice minister michael mcdowell refused to acquiesce in the backsliding despite enormous pressure powell told adams of the problem and adams gave way decommissioning took place as planned

8410238 605 000 long term immigrants arriving in the year to mid 2007 the eu projections show that the wave of migration to britain boosting both the workforce and fertility rates is out of step with many other european countries where deaths are expected to overtake births after 2015
8410239 trends differ for the four countries of the uk the population of england is projected to increase by 8 per cent by 2016 that of northern ireland by 7 per cent big year that and wales by 5 per cent the projected increase for scotland where fertility and life expectancy levels are assumed to remain lower than in the rest of the uk is 3 per cent across the united kingdom northern ireland recorded the highest rate of growth with a one per cent population rise last year to 1 8 million people the population of england rose by 0 6 per cent to 51 1 million scotland and wales rose by 0 5 per cent
8410240 the uk population reached 60 5 million this year and the new official figures suggest it will rise to 65 million by 2016 and 71 million by 2031
8410241 the cardinal has not made clear why religion should get a free pass
8410242 at least one blast bomb as well as bottles stones and petrol bombs have been thrown at police investigating a security alert in the tullygally and drumbeg areas of craigavon
8410243 i would appeal to everyone involved in the trouble to stop it now before someone is either injured or killed
8410244 this is not a game this is not fun what weve seen tonight is actually attempted murder please stop it now before someone is killed
8410245 discussions on the devolution of policing and justice have progressed well in the preparation for government committee the governments have requested the parties to continue these discussions so as to agree the necessary administrative arrangements to create a new policing and justice department it is our view i e the view of the two governments that the implementation of the agreement published today should be sufficient to build the community confidence necessary for the assembly to request the devolution of criminal justice and policing from the british government by may 2008
8410246 there is no definitive date for the devolution of policing and justice powers we remain of the unshakable view that those powers can only be transferred whenever there is the required community confidence

8410249 this charge of fiddling while rome burns was a problem which heaney discusses in his essay the interesting case of nero chekhovs cognac and a knocker where he recalls how he and david hammond felt unable to record a tape of songs against the immediate backdrop of explosions in belfast
8410250 we aimed to challenge sectarian divisions in the north of ireland to put
8410251 davy is in that well worn phrase a man of many parts but the whole is greater than the sum of the parts and the uniqueness of david hammond is his midas touch the way he can discern art and poetry in the commonplace and above all the way in which he effortlessly explores i would almost say creates a common ground on which irishmen and women of every tradition and disposition no matter how cantankerous or self regarding we may be in other areas can meet each other and re discover a vital part of ourselves in all of this his wife eileen has played a quiet but essential part their home in belfast has for years been a magnet for cultural waifs and strays of every description an embassy of song its warmth and hospitality a standing rebuke to the image of the dour wee north that is most prevalent among people who have never crossed the border
8410252 the singers house by seamus heaney to david hammond people here used to believe that drowned souls lived in seals at spring tides they might change shape they loved music and swam in for a singer who might stand at the end of summer in the mouth of a whitewashed turf shed his shoulder to the jamb his song a rowboat far out in evening when i came here first you were always singing a hint of the clip of the pick in your winnowing climb and attack raise it again man we still believe what we hear
8410253 its very clear we need to deliver any agreements that weve had with the dup and the two governments the devolution of policing and justice has to happen we in our party have worked for years and are very committed to the process under way but we need to start seeing results
8410254 the oireachtas could ratify lisbon subject to a number of opt outs if necessary for example the charter of fundamental rights the solidarity clause transfer of certain matters to qualified majority voting and the inclusion of new competences such as energy security climate change and tourism
8410255 mep mary lou mcdonald has said if the irish government secures a better deal for ireland at european level only then is there an argument for a new referendum those of us on the no side want specific new additional points in the treaty and we want specific cast iron legal views on taxation she said
8410256 a succession of anti family anti life and other anti christian decisions by brussels has made it more difficult for committed christians to maintain their instinctive support for europe in the lisbon referendum
8410257 concerns were expressed regarding abortion despite the specific assurances in terms of irelands legal arrangements in this regard
8410258 the overwhelming feeling expressed in more than 90 messages posted about the topic was that finding a northern ireland anthem could benefit the team
8410259 i heard poots spouting some rubbish about how northern ireland fans wouldnt stand for a change how dare he speak for all fans why not ask them first
8410260 for those who think it will diminish their britishness watch how hard sinn fein fight against this and ask yourselves why
8410261 mr poots is more and more increasingly out of touch with grassroots unionism i resent the fact that he would label anyone that disagrees with him as a lesser unionist
8410262 me being proud of being northern irish and wanting us to use a northern irish anthem doesnt make me any less british than you or devalue my unionism and not all northern ireland fans are unionists anyway you fool
8410263 poots reaction was totally predictable its just a stupid im more british than you points scoring exercise
8410264 its a small step in raising this important issue and it deserves discussion at all levels no matter the outcome
8410265 good on you basil dup sinn fein axis not in favour what a surprise
8410266 this would be a very positive step in my eyes the one and only chant i hate hearing at windsor is the old no surrender as it offends many of our own players i am pro union but that is neither here nor there and has nothing to do with supporting all 11 players wearing our green shirt
8410267 todos en su ultima versi n con crack si hace falta
8410268 en la poca del break del 83 al 87 m s o menos la gente hablaba de break ni siquiera de rap o de hip hop s lo se hablaba de break yo realmente a parte de o rlo en las canciones fue cuando habl con los negros de la base de torrej n ya me enter qu era el hip hop
8410269 en nuevos ministerios antes del break lo que hab a era skate todos los s bados de repente se vio como cada vez eran menos los que iban con patines y cada vez m s con zapatillas empez la gente a bailar hasta que lleg un momento en que toda la parte de arriba y de abajo estaba llena de gente haciendo break ven an hasta padres con hijos para verlo
8410270 lo que se viv a all era un ambiente de mucha uni n un rollo muy sano adem s hab a muchos gitanos que eran los que mejor bailaban otra cosa que se empez a palpar en nuevos ministerios aunque no se sab a muy bien porque era el rollo de autoafirmaci n pero de una manera muy sana la chuler a ya empezaba a surgir no eras nadie pero cuando ibas all ya eras alguien pertenec as a un grupo algo muy unido al hip hop
8410271 para m siempre ha sido un rollo muy relacionado con la m sica m s que las movidas de los barrios era la m sica lo m s l gico es que hubiese acabado siendo un dj o productor m s que un rapper
8410272 en torrej n hasta el 88 nadie hablaba de graffiti de hecho yo la primera vez que o hablar de graffiti fue con la pel cula style wars el primero en pintar en torrej n fue lozano de la blue posse l hizo la primera pintada de torrej n

8410278 el problema de este primer auge es que la gente los mismos artistas de hip hop no estaban preparados psicol gicamente para estar dentro del hip hop fue un poco por parte de los medios y las compa as que no sab an de hip hop que obligaron a crear un movimiento
8410279 muchos proyectos e historias se empiezan a gestar desde ese momento el resurgir del que se habla ahora no ha sido en base a una compa a sino gracias a la gente del hip hop el primer disco fue hecho por gente que de alguna manera particip en aquella poca paco por jungle kings y los dem s porque vivimos aquella poca y ten amos la esperanza de sacar trabajos alg n d a tardamos 4 o 5 a os pero al final lo hemos llegado a hacer la gente lo est haciendo porque quiere no porque sea una moda que evidentemente dentro de poco se convertir en una moda si es que no estamos realmente en ello

8410296 fuelwatch has a lot going for it and it didnt justify some of the criticisms that were appearing about it
8410297 so we just wanted to set the record straight about what evidence wed received
8410298 it was just an attempt to get the facts straight it was just an attempt to inform people
8410299 i invite people to read the report and they will see that its not based on the evidence we heard and i think theyll also understand that the attempt to breathe new life into fuelwatch has not revived the corpse that fuelwatch is
8410300 at the end of the day we are obliged to serve the best interests of the australian people and we could not let it pass through the senate knowing that australians would be paying higher prices for their petrol and that is something that we are not willing to countenance

8410308 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
8410309 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
8410310 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
8410311 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
8410312 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
8410313 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones
8410314 the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe
8410315 industries no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe
8410316 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
8410317 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature
8410318 they criticize themselves constantly interrupt themselves continually in their own course come back to the apparently accomplished in order to begin it afresh deride with unmerciful thoroughness the inadequacies weaknesses and paltrinesses of their first attempts seem to throw down their adversary only in order that he may draw new strength from the earth and rise again more gigantic before them recoil even and anon from the indefinite prodigiousness of their own aims
8410319 i call on the whole of society to oppose corruption and crime and support the governments efforts to make its administration more efficient
8410320 the fact that these problems exist in bulgaria does not mean that they do not exist in the other member states as well
8410321 men make their own history but they do not make it as they please they do not make it under self selected circumstances but under circumstances existing already given and transmitted from the past
8410322 hegel remarks somewhere that all great world historic facts and personages appear so to speak twice he forgot to add the first time as tragedy the second time as farce

8410331 eigentlich wollten wir diese woche unsere wohnung in aller ruhe einrichten
8410332 als ich von ihrem schicksal las da dachte ich das kann einfach nicht sein
8410333 es sind ja leider auch dinge verbrannt die nicht zu ersetzen sind aber so kann man wenigstens ein bisschen helfen
8410334 heute mittag haben wir geschirr bei einem lteren ehepaar abgeholt die haben uns gleich zum essen ihren garten eingeladen war richtig nett
8410335 um den ungl cklichen start in berlin wieder in positivere bahnen zu lenken

8410339 mich r hrt eigentlich jeder fall von dem ich lese aber hier kann man schnell und konkret hilfe leisten
8410340 bei diesem schlechten start in berlin ist es gut dass den beiden vermittelt wird dass sie trotzdem mit offenen armen empfangen werden
8410341 wir sind so ger hrt von den menschlichen reaktionen die wir in den vergangenen tagen bekommen haben daf r wollen wir uns ganz herzlich bedanken
8410342 this is the second time and it is a record for the history of the festival we have five american films in competition
8410343 the assassination of jesse james by the coward robert ford
8410344 it was an honor to receive this last year and it remains an honor to accept this this year
8410345 we will see 21 films and i hope and i have a lot of confidence in marco that we will see 21 films that will give us the state of art of what is cinema today
8410346 we started writing the movie as kind of an exercise thinking of what kind of parts these actors might play what kind of story they might inhabit
8410347 it could have been a dog movie or an outer space movie we just kind of landed on a spy movie
8410348 every american who was trying to do the right thing
8410349 john mccain is my friend weve traveled the world together its a friendship that goes beyond politics and the personal courage and heroism demonstrated by john still amazes me
8410350 but i profoundly i profoundly disagree with the direction john wants to take this country from afghanistan to iraq from amtrak to veterans
8410351 barack obama is ready to lead america and to restore american leadership in the world
8410352 clearly the job of the next president is to rebuild the american dream and to restore american leadership in the world
8410353 everything i learned in my eight years as president and in the work i have done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8410354 with eyes firmly fixed on the future and in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and our country lets declare together with one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8410355 right now in nashville theyre assembling different scenarios if it touched down in texas where you would send teams if it touched down in alabama or if it touched down in florida which teams you would assemble and where you would move them
8410356 mother nature doesnt really give us any advance warning so we have to be prepared to have a plan
8410357 it could be that we send a small number of people out somewhere else but it also could be that they relocated a large number of people to this area in which case we would have a whole different plan
8410358 so its really really important that we have very experienced folks going down there to give some relief to the local red cross workers and provide them with the time so they can go ahead and deal with their own situations
8410359 our volunteers their bags are packed theyre ready to go their families are taken care of
8410360 lets hope we do not see any direct confrontation in that
8410361 its not a common practice to deliver humanitarian aid using battleships
8410362 we deplore russias excessive use of military force in georgia and its continued occupation of parts of georgia
8410363 down the road we will be looking at what may be required to rebuild the georgian military right now the mission of the united states military is to provide humanitarian assistance
8410364 i think we shouldnt be too complacent or too scared in a situation like this
8410365 to give up and surrender and say to the russians its your backyard youve won or to put men on the ground to protect georgias sovereignty and the east west oil and gas pipeline from the caspian and central asia
8410366 where were these concerns about excessive force from the west when israel destroyed lebanon and killed 1000 civilians
8410367 one done task is a lot better than a hundred of half done ones
8410368 this is a country that invented hot rods and rock n roll
8410369 its really affected the tone and tenor of the site
8410370 the problem is that the relationship in identity between an avatar and the real person behind it is quite tenuous
8410371 no specific members are appointed but leaders in the community emerge
8410372 i think making someone wear something of a scarlet letter is a good way of doing things
8410373 this is such a nascent area when it comes to the law
8410374 if a certain world allows you to be a thief is it a crime or just an aspect of the game should real world law apply
8410375 we didnt have him in team work tuesday but he did fine and hasnt experienced any problems
8410376 so far so good hell get a little more work today
8410377 weve been telling you guys that hes been doing a lot of things and we have a pretty extensive workout before we let guys get back on the field
8410378 they go through a routine on the side and do some individual work and its like a decathlon so when we clear guys to come back i usually dont worry about how theyre going to be
8410379 its still to be determined from what we do and a lot of that will be based on the medical report on jim and peyton
8410380 so those guys gray and lorenzen are both going to play well see how they do and then well determine whether we keep four three or two
8410381 but hey you know what they say when you assume
8410382 the trade situation has already been presented the game doesnt really matter
8410383 i know jeff was visiting getting more looks at it
8410384 it was good to see him back on the field dressed and ready to go
8410385 hopefully hell be back all next week i think hell be fine because we know how hard he works
8410386 this was why god put the ticket in his hands
8410387 roofing is slow and when its slow and this is what i turn to scrapping mostly cans a little copper
8410388 i get my copper legitimately when im working or something you take a week before you get your money for your copper now
8410389 the state of tennessee wanted to target the business owners to stop the thieves
8410390 any kind of metal from a business then he has to have the business name a card if its any air conditioning product any hc metal from that they will not receive a check it will go to the business that is bringing the metal in
8410391 what is the property where did it come from and are you the rightful owner there is certainly legitimate scrap that comes off what we call the peddler that they may do some work to earn that metal
8410392 it makes it hard to cash in on that money when you need it really bad at that time
8410393 the first thinking through doing describes how thought mind and action body are deeply integrated and how they co produce learning and reasoning
8410394 tangible computing is of interest precisely because it is not purely physical it is a physical realization of a symbolic reality
8410395 pursuit of digital verisimilitude some excerpts from the paper about it
8410396 it may seem a platitude but it is worth repeating that
8410397 the main problem is that these systems do not have the discriminative power to do that
8410398 it is based i think on a mythical view of ai
8410399 we have to say where we want to draw the line and what we want to do and then get an international agreement
8410400 i have a moral responsibility to make sure that these weapons are introduced responsibly and ethically and reduce risks to non combatants
8410401 with a robot i can be sure that a robot will never harbour the intention to hurt a non combatant
8410402 ultimately they will be able to perform better than humans
8410403 i hope an autonomous system could realise that man was clearly incapacitated effectively a prisoner of war and should not have been killed
8410404 one of the fundamental abilities i want to give these systems is to refuse an order and explain why
8410405 we cannot make them that generally intelligent they will be more like dogs used for specialised situations
8410406 for those situations we have very clear cut guidance from the geneva convention the hague and elsewhere about what is ethical
8410407 i am so glad this is over justice has been served
8410408 often imitated copied pasted and stolen from but never duplicated
8410409 one generation one generation is all it took and the circumstances of my life and family were profoundly transformed
8410410 i think they have a similar vision for america you know deval patrick has a vision for massachusetts that were helping with in the legislature and barack obama has a similar vision for america
8410411 rising stars arent always the best thing for us if you look at whats been happening recently deval patrick was an inexperienced newcomer to politics and in the short time that hes been the governor of massachusetts weve had taxes going sky high deficits going sky high and im afraid that obamas going to do the same thing
8410412 what he spoke about last night was a renewal of civic engagement of getting away from more of the same we desperately need change in this country
8410413 in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory
8410414 no matter where we stood at the beginning of this campaign democrats stand together today
8410415 we believe passionately in barack obamas message of changing the direction of our country
8410416 were not little kids to be told what to do in a half hour
8410417 a lot of white workers and quite frankly a lot of union members believe hes the wrong race
8410418 the journey will be difficult the road will be long
8410419 indoctrinate white children with feelings of guilt over slavery in order to justify flooding britain with masses of third world immigrants
8410420 just be about slavery it is about the contribution that black and asian people have made throughout history
8410421 in addition we will soon be producing a definitive history of the arab muslim slave trade which dwarfed the european slave trade upon which the anti white government wishes to focus
8410422 we hear endlessly about the atlantic slave trade and whites are told to feel guilty about that but the truth is that the muslim slave trade was far bigger ran for far longer and was much more important than the european slave trade
8410423 isnt it strange how when non whites enslave each other and europeans no one says a word but when whites enslave others it is reason for a 200 year later fake guilt trip this is absurd nonsense and we reject it utterly
8410424 slavery was an evil which was abolished by the british government who then sought to suppress it elsewhere in the world
8410425 muslim slavery took place in west asia north africa east africa and certain parts of europe such as sicily iberia and england by the barbary pirates
8410426 in the early days of the first large islamic state during the 8th and 9th centuries most of the slaves were eastern europeans called saqaliba people from surrounding mediterranean areas peoples from the caucasus mountain regions such as georgia and armenia as well as black africans
8410427 yet i dont see the government trying to make muslims feel guilty for these actions
8410428 it is to wage war by sea land and air with all our might and with all the strength that god can give us to wage war against a monstrous tyranny never surpassed in the dark lamentable catalogue of human crime that is our policy
8410429 i want something fresh for the summer like a combination of lemon and mint i dont want anything too heavy
8410430 rest assured the final decision on this issue will not be based on science alone
8410431 allowing people to smoke a plant now and again if they need to
8410432 commercializing and industrializing said plant so that anyone who wants to take it needs a prescription and insurance that covers 300 a gram medications
8410433 too much a wuss to go out and find a new dealer
8410434 rest assured the final decision on this issue will not be based on science alone

8410440 where the masculine ideal of as recently as 2000 was a buff 6 footer with six pack abs the man of the moment is an urchin a wraith or an underfed runt
8410441 the fashion industry would be casting models who look like this healthy woman
8410442 hey youre getting fat you better lay off the twinkies
8410443 well i cant look like that so theres no use trying
8410444 i look fat in this swimsuit im skipping that part of gym
8410445 the parking lot of which is a regular meeting place for narcotic transactions according to trooper tirella
8410446 hes been given the opportunity and much more than hundreds of other people that come before this court with a drug problem
8410447 youve had the opportunity to get rehab since july 2 i dont think that max is serious about going to rehab if he is he wouldve gone three months ago
8410448 it has been the highest honor to coach for the united states
8410449 i wouldnt trade it for a minute the experiences i have had through usa softball and more importantly the relationships i have made with athletes and staff are wonderful
8410450 its been a tremendous ride and blessing to be a part of all of this but i am ready to settle down and begin my life at home and allow someone else this honor
8410451 oh no fuck public service im not going to make any money whos going to be interested in that let alone pay for it
8410452 the price of self destiny is never cheap and in certain situations it is unthinkable but to achieve the marvelous it is precisely the unthinkable that must be thought
8410453 breaking the rules sublime beats ridiculous energy you know how we do
8410454 the people behind me are crucial to the future of this country
8410455 why do we need 60 democrats why is reid the first senate majority leader to say we need 60 votes rather than a majority to get things done
8410456 in 2005 when republicans had a majority they stopped democratic filibusters why cant you do the same now
8410457 they have a story line but i want us to all shout loud and clear so the press can hear it we are united behind obama
8410458 its unacceptable that in every major issue of our time we are going backwards not forwards
8410459 theyre not relying on his celebrity factor or the coolness of obama they have invested real resources into getting out the youth vote
8410460 thats your representative you folks must really be proud of her
8410461 es realmente preocupante que una ley tan importante como sta que regula la expansi n de la frontera agr cola sobre nuestros ltimos bosques nativos a n no cuente con su reglamentaci n esperamos que la misma sea firmada por el ejecutivo de manera urgente
8410462 espera que sea una herramienta clave para realizar los procesos de ordenamiento territorial de bosques nativos que cada jurisdicci n deber realizar antes de fin de a o
8410463 su reglamentaci n es esperada con gran expectativa en los gobiernos provinciales el sector productivo forestal y agropecuario as como por organismos t cnicos y ambientales ya que el proceso de ordenamiento territorial que realizar cada provincia significar un cambio trascendental en la gesti n del recurso forestal nativo en todo el pa s
8410464 si bien la moratoria a los desmontes que la ley establece est en vigencia la demora en la reglamentaci n pone en peligro la aplicaci n plena de la ley no podemos permitir que por cuestiones burocr ticas se ponga en riesgo la aplicaci n de la ley de bosques que tantos argentinos apoyamos y que evitar que sigamos perdiendo nuestros ltimos bosques nativos

8410496 debbie and i have informally discussed continuing this for our students as weekend trips or potentially as a course
8410497 we both think it would be fun to do this with student groups
8410498 exciting things can happen when women are challenged physically emotionally and intellectually in an expedition like this
8410499 i see this as a natural extension of our programs emphasi
8410500 what if those heavy things cracked their little brittle bones to the marrow
8410501 i took it to school i took it to the kitchen table and if i took a walk it was strapped on
8410502 the current teaching of the catholic church on human life and abortion is the same teaching as it was 2 000 years ago
8410503 from the beginning the catholic church has respected the dignity of all human life from the moment of conception to natural death
8410504 since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion
8410505 a gifted public servant of strong convictions and many professional skills regrettably knowledge of catholic history and teaching does not seem to be one of them
8410506 it rained every day but i got the job done now i feel very confident in trying to win this event
8410507 my goal is to win and try to forget about everything else and what it all means
8410508 it gives some of the younger soldiers and some of our younger officers an idea of how to better prepare ourselves for a counter insurgency fight which is more low intensity
8410509 its more getting to know the populace its more preparing for that sort of scenario as opposed to what you traditionally think of when you look at like a war movie where its all of a sudden everythings going crazy
8410510 hopefully over the next three days i can progress a little bit each day i just need to get a little more strength and a little more confidence in it
8410511 the total picture is if youre consuming a diet with glutamate in it particularly high levels youre making your cancer grow very rapidly i refer to it as cancer fertilizer
8410512 epos and dvos are just one part of a comprehensive safety plan
8410513 i think we all like to think that it doesnt affect our lives but statistically it does affect everyones life
8410514 it was important for me to finish this chapter of my life
8410515 its like all of us were all kind of hopeless romantics who want the story to end well weve all been programmed that way from tv and movies everybody wants the happy ending
8410516 when he graduated he could have said see ya later but he didnt he never stopped working he never sulked he never moaned
8410517 i felt very strongly he should not play at the end of last year
8410518 he had headaches for quite a while and short term memory loss football is a game and thats his health
8410519 he knows he has talent and i dont mean in an arrogant way
8410520 it was obviously frustrating for him to end the season with a concussion that way
8410521 right before spring ball i said ok listen im going to go for this thing
8410522 and i knew that the odds were stacked up against me even to play chris had finished the year and josh was coming back but ive always loved the competition part of things everything i do i like to finish it
8410523 it has completion percentage attempts plays of 16 yards and more interceptions touchdowns it has everything
8410524 jordan wants to do so well and is probably more detailed and probably prepares better than the rest of the guys
8410525 but hes so hard on himself and wants to be perfect all the time that he tightens up
8410526 this isnt a situation where youre running the triple option and the quarterback has to be not only your game management guy but your guy thats going to go out and make plays what we need is a guy thats going to manage the team and put his teammates in a position to be successful and make the plays that are there
8410527 as the years go on you dont worry about it as much i see freshman running back davin meggett and hes all worked up as more time goes on you start to relax and see the big picture
8410528 we already provide hundreds of thousands of users with a very powerful value proposition on fpo we believe that
8410529 with our fpo experience and knowledge gained from sumobrain beta testing including direct dialogue with countless law firms and corporate users we are well armed to prioritize and execute what is most important to our customers while sumobrain already offers a very compelling solution at an extremely competitive price point we are not resting on our laurels and plan to continue to pressure the marketplace bringing our customers the best possible solution
8410530 we are excited about this important step in the evolution of the allows for the full text cross collection searching of us and ep patents and applications
8410531 we know its going to head into the gulf after that were not sure
8410532 for that reason everyone in the gulf needs to be monitoring the storm at that point were expecting it to be a category 3 hurricane
8410533 a bad storm churning in the gulf could be a nightmare scenario
8410534 we might see oil prices spike 5 to 8 if it really rips into platforms
8410535 actually beats the other offers out there because most of the companies offering cheap toll packages target customers who already have a phone connection with telecom or telstraclear
8410536 customers will have a normal phone number and can make high quality toll free calls to any location within the 40 countries we connect to

8410538 i honor john mccains service to our country you know he served in uniform with honor and distinction
8410539 we owe him gratitude for that but we dont owe him our vote
8410540 do we have a president who gets that people are struggling everyday who gets that veterans are struggling everyday or do we have somebody who doesnt get it
8410541 who wants to give more tax cuts to the big corporations including
8410542 not surprisingly a whole bunch of people in nevada were like hold on a second john mccain is in favor of yucca mountain except it turned out that he didnt want the stuff shipped through arizona to get to nevada
8410543 somebody said we could have used some of his houses as that wasnt my joke that was this gentleman right here so im not gonna take credit for that one

8410565 it is still amazing to me how much press this has generated for us
8410566 if its been mentioned on the office people want to come and see it
8410567 we couldnt be happier they picked scranton and not utica
8410568 when the city started to decline and the coal industry moved out we suffered
8410569 the streets were a mess the sidewalks were falling into the ground it wasnt the prettiest thing
8410570 people make choices on where they want to live and businesses make choices about where they want to be identified with
8410571 should come to scranton and walk the rope line and let people see him its politics 101 you gotta knock on a lot of doors
8410572 not until you ship me your income tax return and send me your monthly bank statements
8410573 karl brings a lot of special skills and we recognized that
8410574 he makes his case well and comes across as thoughtful and fair
8410575 itll be interesting to see what happens to roves reputation and how much people are willing to listen to his crap if obama wins
8410576 they want to send money back but they just cant
8410577 there are no jobs and when they do find vacancies they get asked for papers they are just scraping by with the odd days work they even asked about coming home but i told them with all the deportees fighting for jobs here there is nothing for them
8410578 there is no money to keep the kids in school no money to keep a family warm people are getting desperate and turning to crime making the community more insecure
8410579 for a long time we were seeing these huge numbers for remittances and we couldnt work out where it all went it just didnt add up
8410580 the adverse effect in these communities reaffirms our suspicions half this money may not be remittances at all
8410581 ever since i met del 55 years ago i could never imagine a day would come when she wouldnt be by my side
8410582 i also never imagined there would be a day that we would actually be able to get married
8410583 i am devastated but i take some solace in knowing we were able to enjoy the ultimate rite of love and commitment before she passed
8410584 we would not have marriage equality in california if it werent for del and phyllis they fought and triumphed in many battles
8410585 through it all their love and commitment to each other was an inspiration to all who knew them
8410586 the greatest way we can honor the life work of del martin is to continue to fight and never give up until we have achieved equality for all
8410587 this is a big problem and countermeasures must be taken
8410588 countries like england ireland and sweden which are seeing population increases have a relatively open labor market while germany still makes it difficult for people to immigrate
8410589 a combination of economic differences and relative freedom of movement
8410590 its impossible to balance out the decline in births completely
8410591 i dont see these changes making a dramatic difference in how the whole fannie and freddie fiasco plays out
8410592 we are not convinced that the government needs to take any action over the near term
8410593 most managers are taking the position that it would unthinkable to imagine a scenario where the government wouldnt back the debt
8410594 the end result is probably going to be that they go bankrupt and the government nationalizes the function
8410595 how can we expect our kids to compete on an equal playing field with kids at suburban schools
8410596 im going to say open these doors and put my kid on equal footing
8410597 but the fact that the amount of money spent on education is determined by where you live is fundamentally unfair
8410598 if we had a little bit of the resources of the districts five miles from us we could close the gap that much quicker
8410599 by most measures the performance of u s students has remained stubbornly flat in the face of resource or policy adjustments
8410600 telling them to go to another district and enroll sends the message that your teachers arent as good as those in the suburbs
8410601 i bring the same level of competence to my classroom as any other teacher
8410602 i have spent long periods of time with him in the past two years
8410603 similarly if a sitting president suffers from such mental and psychological problems constitutionally he cannot retain his office
8410604 we know that people with incomes that low are living in unsafe conditions
8410605 older americans are hit by a one two punch of jobs and medical problems and the two are often intertwined
8410606 they discover that they must work to keep some form of economic balance and when they cant theyre lost
8410607 i paid the bills whether i ate or didnt whether i went to the doctor or not
8410608 id go to bed and all i had on my mind was bankruptcy
8410609 you have to cry and try and figure out what in the world could i do
8410610 by the verdict today they have given voice to the victims
8410611 this defendant is dangerous he is a predator who takes pride in his work
8410612 he earned this day his actions call out for the death penalty
8410613 i am so glad this is over justice has been served
8410614 this defendant uses the time that he has to think out these plans and he is dangerous
8410615 generally for human beings its pretty hard to maintain impartiality when confronted with such horror
8410616 you may have covered it before i found your blog but at our local jonesboro arkansas target in the 1 bins they have a line of products lotion body butter body wash lip gloss note pads eye mask brush etc
8410617 i said here are the pros and here are the cons
8410618 the cons to me outweigh the pros but youve got to sit down and sleep on it and look over the aegean sea and think about it one thing i love about him is that when he goes out to perform he wants to perform to the ultimate level at this point i dont know if he was ready in his heart to do that
8410619 i told him to think about the reality that in two months how are you going to feel everything is worn off and now youre in the battle again do you really want that when youve been working on your other career at that point we came to the conclusion that it didnt make a lot of sense he loves the giants and he loves the fans but it just wasnt the right thing
8410620 by the verdict today they have given voice to the victims
8410621 i am so glad this is over justice has been served
8410622 its a huge issue its at least as big an issue as the dns issue if not bigger
8410623 i went around screaming my head about this about ten or twelve years ago we described this to intelligence agencies and to the national security council in detail
8410624 theres no vulnerabilities no protocol errors there are no software problems the problem arises from the level of interconnectivity thats needed to maintain this mess to keep it all working
8410625 everyone has assumed until now that you have to break something for a hijack to be useful
8410626 but what we showed here is that you dont have to break anything and if nothing breaks who notices
8410627 the rate of bgp path updates goes up by a factor of 200 to 400
8410628 they simply dont because it takes work and to do sufficient filtering to prevent these kinds of attacks on a global scale is cost prohibitive
8410629 that means that nobody could put themselves into the chain into the path unless they had been authorized to do so by the preceding as router in the path
8410630 we havent seen the attacks and so a lot of times people dont start working on things and trying to fix them until they get attacked
8410631 but the youtube case is the perfect example of an attack where somebody could have done much worse than what they did
8410632 the only thing that can force them to fix bgp is if their customers start to demand security solutions
8410633 pilosovs innovation is to forward the intercepted data silently to the actual destination so that no outage occurs
8410634 now these guys show up to declare theyve discovered the problem
8410635 had it not been for not just the speech but the movement behind the speech and the sentiments behind the speech the work and the toil and the risks that were taken by previous generations then i wouldnt be in denver on thursday accepting the nomination for the presidency
8410636 we live in a moment right now where we are color blind and color mute we act like we dont see it and we dont talk about it or name it
8410637 to talk about race is to indict someone you have to talk about racism when he even calls himself a black man it renders him marginal to a whole set of people
8410638 i think that the noteworthiness of the moment will be apparent to everyone
8410639 during the course of a 19 month campaign i think that youre on the television screen youre in big auditoriums but sometimes who you are may get lost
8410640 and i want people to come away saying i know what he stands for i know where he comes from i know what he believes
8410641 he is going to be using the speech to persuade people who are alienated by civil rights
8410642 he is going to try to stay above that and he has to do it because of the force and strength of american racism people want to hear the high notes
8410643 in the spirit of unity with faith in the party lets declare in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate
8410644 i read the releases and things saying there were changes to make it more volatile and you could move
8410645 but in terms of the actual points and how big a move i could make i didnt know i didnt really study it that much
8410646 but obviously i love it and im sure theres a few guys that dont love it but its the playoffs its like any sport you play to get there and when you get there its whoever is playing best at that time that comes out on top
8410647 when the second ball went out of bounds on my 13th hole on friday my thought went from get in good position on the weekend to ive got to play good these last five holes to even be around on the weekend
8410648 if you had said to me then id be sitting here now 67th in the fedexcup points i wouldnt have believed it but ill say im happy to be here
8410649 if someone had told me that at the start of the year i never would have thought i could have gotten there
8410650 thats really what it has been i started hitting the ball a lot better at the john deere and my ballstriking has kind of stayed the same but my putting has really been the big difference
8410651 the last round in canada i played with retief goosen and i had never played with anyone of his status before
8410652 i wasnt really nervous i was more excited to see how i played i played pretty good and i had fun
8410653 hes had a great rookie year never even been on the nationwide tour i dont think

8410662 i know we could be so happy baby if we wanted to be
8410663 wir hatten gerade einen hamburger gegessen mein sohn ist dann mit einem freund weiter nach vorne gegangen
8410664 es war kein lauter knall eher ein dumpfes ger usch als wenn etwas verpufft
8410665 dann das feuer der brandgeruch das geschrei das chaos den menschen lief die haut herunter das kann man nicht beschreiben
8410666 das durchsto ene herz ich habe oft dar ber nachgedacht
8410667 ich habe jeden tag vor unserem kreuz im wohnzimmer gebetet und geweint
8410668 ich hatte immer gr ere angst es k nne irgendetwas passieren obwohl wir viele jahre mit dem auto in den urlaub gefahren waren traute ich mich kaum noch auf die autobahn
8410669 jeder bekam ein handy wir mussten uns nach jeder fahrt bei ihm melden das war schon fast telefonterror
8410670 ich sa im urlaub auf der bettkante schaute aus dem fenster in die sonst so geliebte s dtiroler landschaft und fragte mich was ich hier eigentlich soll
8410671 ich habe noch nie erlebt dass menschen so offen sein k nnen
8410672 ich konnte es nach dem ungl ck kaum ertragen mich im dorf zu bewegen die leute haben einen bogen um mich gemacht
8410673 the cell is becoming one of the most talked about institutions to take root in our great city
8410674 the exhibit does a great job of addressing and explaining the difficult subject of terrorism and while it is a serious experience the cell allows individuals to educate and ultimately empower themselves in the goal of terrorism prevention
8410675 it is our intent that once people experience the cell exhibit they will be more engaged and focused on the need for community involvement and preparedness in response to the current ongoing global terrorism threat
8410676 this is an educational and interactive exhibit that uses state of the art multi media tools and was created in consultation with world renowned terrorism experts and designed by academy award winning artists
8410677 we are pleased to have introduced the exhibit today in front of many visitors who are here in denver attending the democratic national convention
8410678 they might not otherwise get the opportunity to explore this complex subject matter in a state of the art facility
8410679 going to be vice president of my fantasy football league
8410680 i am extremely disappointed in not being able to continue in my position on icos board of directors as i think very highly of the management and people at ico and i believe the company has a bright future unfortunately i believe my ability to serve as an ico board member would be limited due to conflicts with other business and personal commitments
8410681 consistent with our previously disclosed growth plans this private placement provides the company with the extra capital necessary to expand our sales force to service and develop new and emerging markets
8410682 the company continues to add new healthcare facilities to its growing list of customers and the need for a physical presence in these areas is necessary to keep up with the demand
8410683 while we have taken several important steps to preserve capital we are obviously disappointed that the anticipated sale of the manufacturing plant and equipment fell through having completed diligence and agreed to terms for reasons entirely unrelated to vaxgen or the plant in light of this however our expectations going forward need to reflect the difficulty we have experienced selling this asset the encumbrance of the facility lease represents our single largest remaining financial liability
8410684 with our new strategic transaction committee of the board fully engaged and given the status of the transaction process and our business the company and piers can now part ways
8410685 piers has made innumerable contributions to vaxgen since joining vaxgen in 2002 his strategic thinking negotiating skills and breadth of experience have been of tremendous value to the company he will be missed
8410686 these individuals are highly dedicated and train year round in high angle rescue first aid and fire fighting techniques for use in coal mine emergencies
8410687 mine rescue is an important part of our overall safety program
8410688 while its essential to prepare we hope we wont need to use our mine rescue teams the employees of thunder basins black thunder and coal creek mines are working hard to eliminate all accidents and injuries our ultimate goal is to attain a perfect zero

8410703 there is a lot of issues that cricket faces at the moment not just the twenty20 not just the ipl
8410704 i believe they india account for about 80 per cent of world cricket revenue its a reasonably strong position to be in one would think as a business
8410705 so how do they how does the icc and the cricket world manage that not deal with it but manage it because its real and its happening and fair play to them theres immense passion for the game there and a great love for it
8410706 twenty20 cricket will it ruin test cricket i dont think so i really do think that the basic fundamentals of the game are still the same
8410707 we survived world series cricket 30 years ago it is a game that does have the ability to mutate to come in different forms short long energetic some may say slow boring relaxing whatever your take is it does have the ability to evolve and turn itself around
8410708 i guess you have a look now at the guys who we consider greats of the game and their performances and then you look at what hes done
8410709 i think the highest test average is about 66 and then you look at his at 99

8410728 we are not convinced that the government needs to take any action over the near term
8410729 most managers are taking the position that it would unthinkable to imagine a scenario where the government wouldnt back the debt

8410738 iraqis view it a serious problem and we certainly share that view

8410799 ci piace offrire agli attori determinati ruoli e riscontrare in loro potenzialit diverse da quelle a cui siamo abituati
8410800 e noi ci divertiamo a scrivere ruoli e parti per le persone che conosciamo
8410801 devo dire che interessante il momento in cui scriviamo la sceneggiatura e creiamo il personaggio dice ethan coen ma questo non ha a che fare con il personaggio in quanto grande star si tratta di una persona e di come la vedi in quel ruolo non cos diretto n collegato al modo in cui loro si vedono non so perch ti viene in mente che un certo tipo di abbigliamento possa star bene ad un attore per funziona cos come demente brad sicuramente allaltezza di george entrambi reputano i loro personaggi intelligenti e questo vi fa capire quanto sono intelligenti loro scherziamo ovviamente

8410813 we have commissioned a concept plan for endeavour park with areas marked out for a skate board park adventure playground and arboretum barbecues etc
8410814 the major effect and problem for the business owners has been the revaluation of the business properties by the valuer general
8410815 all properties are reviewed by the valuer general about every four years and this has had an effect on both businesses as well as residential properties which is completely out of the control of council
8410816 this has had the effect for some businesses of doubling or in some cases nearly tripling the value of the property
8410817 although this means that their property is now far more valuable than a few years ago their rates have gone up
8410818 by law councils must charge at least 50 per cent of a propertys rates on the property value
8410819 because our overall rates revenue is decided by rate pegging legislation any further reduction for businesses would mean an increase for other categories

8410842 against the backdrop of the drumbeat of negative news of the last several weeks it was encouraging to see a little bit of positive news the basic fact of the matter is that although the economy has been weak it hasnt fallen off a cliff

8410901 hillary told us in no uncertain terms that shell do everything she can to elect barack obama that makes two of us
8410902 everything i learned in my eight years as president and in the work ive done since in american and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for the job
8410903 no matter where we stood at the beginning of this campaign democrats stand together today
8410904 we believe passionately in barack obamas message of changing the direction of our country

8410931 hace un tiempo atr s un mensaje general era efectivo ahora las marcas enfocadas con un mensaje espec fico y en medios segmentados tienen m s xito
8410932 un enfoque cualitativo a la planificaci n de medios el mensaje debe ser congruente con el medio en que se transmite y segmentarse para poder establecer un v nculo personal con los consumidores
8410933 en el contexto del marketing y la publicidad actuales no basta con seleccionar un medio considerando exclusivamente el tama o de su audiencia es necesario evaluar las ventajas cualitativas que el medio ofrece a la campa a
8410934 seguimos tratando a la tv paga como si fuera inferior a la tv abierta decimos la tv abierta tiene m s rating es m s efectiva para lograr recordaci n y tiene mayor impacto vivimos preocupados con el tama o de la audiencia y no nos damos cuenta que el medio es el mensaje los canales de tv paga son m s que canales son marcas s lidas y reconocidas
8410935 ya no nos es funcional un mensaje gen rico una sola campa a un s lo mensaje esto era efectivo cuando la publicidad era emitida por medios generales pero en este contexto ese mensaje ya no es relevante
8410936 pegarse a esta estrategia generalista perdi 5 billones de d lares este a o
8410937 encontrando una relaci n ptima en la fusi n de tv paga y tv abierta
8410938 creemos que lo importante es el rating alto con la mentalidad de que el tama o es lo importante bigger is better cuando lo importante pasa por descubrir qu canal es la mejor v a de transmisi n para la marca porque le suma valor
8410939 una de las principales ventaja que posee la tv paga frente a la tv abierta es la segmentaci n de la audiencia agrupando bajo un mismo canal o programaci n a un tipo de consumidor mujeres mayores de 50 a os ni os menores a 10 a os hombres de nse medio alto y alto que practican deportes extremos etc esto facilita al anunciante alcanzar al p blico objetivo fortaleciendo su mensaje con la imagen de marca de la canal
8410940 este definir los medios para llegar a el porque el medio es el mensaje el medio ser parte de la comunicaci n y aportar al compromiso de la marca a sus valores si esto est alineado el propio consumidor ser evangelista de mi marca
8410941 youve come here from so many different places having made this journey and feeling in your heart what is right for you to do

8410944 i voted for hillary this morning because i gave my word and i keep my word
8410945 were not little kids to be told what to do in a half hour
8410946 i dont see any further reason to continue to carry out a pretense that shes a candidate shes not
8410947 if we dont have an official roll call vote state by state it is going to reopen a wound
8410948 i think it is reflective of the unity that i sense that is building across the party
8410949 that doesnt mean there wont be outliers that are still heartbroken their favorite candidate didnt make it
8410950 going to be able to bring themselves to vote for anybody other than senator clinton
8410951 even though hillary tells us not to spend any time thinking about what might have been
8410952 im sure all of us were thinking about what might have been last night
8410953 if shes not a strong enough leader to get her followers to do whats right for america then that would surprise me
8410954 i think they are going to follow her lead and her lead was very crystal clear last night

8410958 if you cant stand up with the clintons how can you stand up to the terrorists
8410959 my view is we need to come together as a party
8410960 i admire hillary clinton greatly but i think it would be divisive to have a vote on the floor
8410961 full of romance humor rivalry and betrayal a passion most pure will captivate readers from the first page

8410969 this is all a learning process i need to shorten that process as quickly as i can
8410970 i havent struck out seven times in my life ever in your whole life you are always experiencing first times and hopefully thats the last time i experience that
8410971 but at this point i was going up there more trying not to strikeout than get a hit
8410972 thats a bad approach thats like playing not to lose rather than playing not to win
8410973 as an african american and a lesbian i havent been through one day without facing some sort of discrimination but this is just shocking
8410974 we are able to see the scrolls in such detail that no one has before
8410975 my name is irene and this is victor that little guy you have there is david his parents must be worried sick about him off lost in a place like this
8410976 i am not at all surprised we predicted this but we have got steps to take we could take them to a judicial review but we have got to talk to our legal people it is not over
8410977 we are very pleased with the decision they have taken into account all the additional information we had put forward
8410978 we would like to reassure people as a company that the thornborough henges are safe
8410979 more oil drilling will not lower gas prices or create energy independence
8410980 it does look like maybe a lot of florida is not considered abnormally dry anymore
8410981 you need more persistent rain not all at one time short term things like too much rainfall at one time does cause flooding a slower steadier rain over a longer period of time will alleviate drought
8410982 right now the ground is saturated and everyone has had it with rain

8410986 i was asked to assist a friend of mine whose son recently returned from iraq and was having problems getting his job and benefits back we contacted esgr and they were very helpful the situation was resolved in less than two weeks and while we were involved with esgr and that issue they asked us both to be volunteers we thought this was a worthwhile organization so we both joined about three years ago
8410987 to know that support is there is very beneficial for us
8410988 we know who to contact now in the event that we have any questions and vice versa if they ever need to contact us
8410989 i like the fact that i know were performing a much needed task
8410990 i know the work we do is appreciated by both the employer and the employee i get a great sense of satisfaction out of helping

8410994 the pursuit of freedom as defined in an age of consumerism has induced a condition of dependence on imported goods on imported oil and on credit the chief desire of the american people
8410995 is that nothing should disrupt their access to these goods that oil and that credit the chief aim of the u s government is to satisfy that desire which it does in part of through the distribution of largesse here at home and in part through the pursuit of imperial ambitions abroad

8410999 seven years into its confrontation with radical islam the united states finds itself with too much war for too few warriors and with no prospect of producing the additional soldiers needed to close the gap
8411000 u s troops in battle dress and body armor whom americans profess to admire and support pay the price for the nations refusal to confront our domestic dysfunction
8411001 have been engaged in a de facto ponzi scheme intended to extend indefinitely the american line of credit
8411002 how are we gonna pay the bills how are we gonna pay for the commitment of entitlements that is going to increase year by year for the next couple of decades especially as baby boomers retire

8411134 this has been a great year for the python developer community with the advent of great frameworks such as django and deployment solutions such as google app engine
8411135 now the tooling is getting better all the time one of the great tools is pydev especially if you are eclipse minded having aptana take on pydev only means progress for that project and python developers
8411136 the addition of pydev to the aptana product suite rounds out the set of scripting languages that aptana already supports including ajax and javascript php ruby and ruby on rails and now python too pydev brings first class python support to aptana and sets the stage for a full suite of products and services from development through cloud deployment pydev is one of the most popular python ides for eclipse since aptana studio is also eclipse based it was the natural choice for aptana
8411137 pydevs popularity in the python community and eclipse ecosystem made it the clear choice for aptana
8411138 interest in python has been steadily growing and got a big boost earlier this year when google announced that python was the language for google app engine google is also a worldwide licensee of the commercial version of pydev pydev extensions which includes even more high productivity features for python developers
8411139 pretty much anyone these days who is creating web sites and applications is using ajax
8411140 offering pydev as an extension to aptana studio and therefore eclipse will make it even easier and faster for pydev users to create test deploy and manage their web applications

8411153 i cant wait to see what he is like could turn out to be a bargain and bendtner is never good enough for arsenal he has a touch of a drunk elephant and his movement is shocking surely vela a better option

8411234 when joe explained the difficulties the new samsung projector had utilizing traditional projection screens we challenged our chemists and engineers to develop a new material that would deliver the very best hd digital image in our experience
8411235 with hd progressive and enhanced matte white screen fabrics we have the first materials designed to deliver the next generation of hd digital projector images we are extremely pleased to launch the jkp affinity screens using these break through projection screens

8411238 ive seen war up close not as a political slogan or a think tank theory
8411239 america needs a president who has the strength and wisdom and courage to talk with our enemies and consult with our allies
8411240 a president who has the judgment to use war as a last resort not as a first resort a president who can adapt to things that change and a president who will respect our veterans when they come home instead of leaving them without the medical care and benefits they deserve
8411241 for the last eight years under the failed policies of george bush the american dream has been slipping away
8411242 previous studies have showed that the steep decline begins around five years before death

8411254 glede na na elo materialne resnice bi morala policija svoje trditve nedvoumno dokazati saj ima kot aparat prisile s strani dr ave zagotovljena sredstva ki naj bi ji omogo ila njihovo pridobitev in e proti prito niku kot ibkej i stranki v postopku ne obstajajo dovolj trdni materialni dokazi bi ga sodi e pa moralo oprostiti ne zato ker je nedol en ampak zato ker proti njemu dr ava ni zbrala dovolj dokazov

8411265 if that isnt the sign of some sort of major manipulation on the part of the producers i dont know what is
8411266 i dont think craig voided the wrong check on accident they wouldve just admitted that or laughed about it this clearly seems like a manipulation
8411267 for blocking purposes the paymaster has to tell the producer each week who theyre voting off thats so they get the right shot
8411268 but i dont like to know that information because it sort of helps with authenticity this way my reaction is real the way that everything was going and the way toasteee was talking i just assumed that whiteboy was going to go that was the smart choice why wouldnt she get rid of whiteboy as soon as she said 12 pack youre gone boom i stamped whiteboys check it was me being ahead of myself as im hosting the show i feel like im watching it im into it i cant wait to get back the next day to see whats going to happen so thats what happened here i was so into watching it that i forgot i was hosting

8411284 our baptismal covenant brings us to an understanding of the gifts of laity that isnt really understood in the same way by the rest of the communion in the book of common prayer the catechism says that the ministers of the church are lay persons bishops priests and deacons in that order and so we are called by god to do the work we are given
8411285 does one person like the archbishop of canterbury for instance have a corner on the truth market
8411286 has one particular group been given the gift of pure truth and the rest of us just cant hear it
8411287 i dont think so right now the how of coming to the truth is as important as getting to the truth right now the way in which the anglican communion goes about the search for the elusive truth is as important as the truth itself
8411288 i am the way and the truth and the life no one comes to the father but by me
8411289 if you continue in my word you shall be my disciples indeed and you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free
8411290 are tec baptisms valid well yes they are barely all that is required is the trinitarian formula and moving water

8411372 its not a new medication or one that isnt already widely used
8411373 we probably give magnesium sulfate to 100 women to prevent one seizure

8411389 we still are hopeful that well get electricity reform through
8411390 if mr ofarrell stays true to his word he will support it but unfortunately it seems last night there was some doubt about that
8411391 we will proceed and if we dont get the legislation through we will then consider the position
8411392 it seems that he is happy to play games with the states economic future for a quick and cheap political win
8411393 hes got a number of hours before the debate kicks off later today we are urging him to carefully consider his position and the long term needs of the families and businesses of this state and to support electricity reform
8411394 we think that it is in the public interest not to rush ahead
8411395 morris iemma has recalled the parliament today and tomorrow simply because he thought he had the numbers simply because he thought he could ram this through and we dont think that he is exercising due diligence in relation to this process
8411396 ive already indicated that the only basis ill stay around is if there is public sector reform and micro reform to be done ill make that as a personal decision and thats irrelevant to whats going on here
8411397 at the end of the day power supplies need to be secured and people are going to have to come with a strategy to secure those power supplies
8411398 we can understand the opposition in the labor party weve got people that are admittedly and proudly unreconstructive socialists
8411399 but theres no excuse for the liberal party barry ofarrell has been proven to be gutless in the face of national party opposition
8411400 the issues wont go away after today but we will make sure that his position is clear for the public to see he will have to vote down something that allegedly is their philosophical position
8411401 every hospital school and road that doesnt get built as a result of this will be laid at the feet of barry ofarrell
8411402 it could be a really interesting day or it could be the greatest anticlimax ever
8411403 it really is back in the oppositions court and if mr ofarrell and mr stoner stick to opposing the legislation then it will be defeated
8411404 its undeniable that morris iemma still maintains significant support within the caucus
8411405 the real issue here is the future of the treasurer michael costa is the architect the proponent and the strategist behind this whole legislation and would be more concerned about the future

8411410 come i will recite what your lord has prohibited you from join not anything in worship with him be good and dutiful to your parents do not kill your children because of poverty allah provide sustenance for you and for them do not come near to al fawahish shameful sins illegal sexual intercourse etc whether committed openly or secretly and kill not anyone whom allah has forbidden except for a just cause this he has commanded you that you may understand
8411411 men are the protectors and maintainers of women because allah has made one of them to excel the other and because they spend to support the women from their means therefore the righteous women are devoutly obedient to allah and to their husbands and guard in the husbands absence what allah orders them to guard e g their chastity their husbands property etc as to those women on whose part you see ill conduct admonish them refuse to share their beds startle them set forth a clear example or parable for them to make clear the point of what is going on before divorcing them so if they return to proper obedience to allah and their husbands do not annoy them any further surely allah is ever most high most great
8411412 o you believers intoxicating drinks gambling fortune telling etc is the hated work of the devil so stay away from all of that horrible stuff that you will be successful
8411413 the devil only wants to create hatred between you with intoxicants alcoholic drinks etc and gambling and to keep you from the remembrance of allah and from your proper worship prayers so why wont you away from them
8411414 this is a direct result of very bad trade and industry policy of the previous government
8411415 clearly what its decided is that it is going to be in its interests to manufacture some parts in the us rather than australia
8411416 and we say that is one of the by products of the american free trade agreement and its also one of the by products of the downturn in the local industry
8411417 we actually support emissions trading and we support australia addressing the global challenge that climate change represents
8411418 take a deep breath everybody work together and get something that works for this country something that doesnt damage the economy
8411419 its like you love to see me confused and a mess im losin my mind

8411421 the 25th hour fund is meant to provide resources to families if they are going through a crisis period it could be a sickness in the family or someone loses their job and theyre down in the dumps
8411422 its sort of a revolving fund and a safety net unfortunately these days the numbers of those in need are increasing
8411423 this year we hope it will be significantly bigger we also have added a silent auction
8411424 this is an important event in the northwest area i have run this event every year since its inception it really is a good event a good organization and an excellent contribution to our community
8411425 we hope people will sign up for the easy stroll its 5 and they get a t shirt the idea is to spread the word what i like about this is that it brings people from the community together with families who have a disabled family member

8411430 were finding that basically the current economic downturn is related to consumer factors its consumer driven

8411433 the vehicle was traveling north on 1862 on the west end of the county when it missed the intersection on fm 616
8411434 the vehicle proceeded across the ditch and landed up on the railroad tracks
8411435 as he got to the 1862 intersection he noticed the car up on the tracks and having just passed the train he knew trouble was coming fast
8411436 at the same time the railroad engineer had observed the vehicle on the tracks and went into emergency breaking and started to blow the whistle
8411437 the injured man said he could not get out so kopaz reached in grabbed him and helped him out
8411438 he immediately stumbled so the trooper reached in and put his arms under him and drug him off the railroad tracks
8411439 they went about 18 feet he had to lay him down on the ground he covered him up with his body just as the train hit the car it was that close the car was taken 1 500 feet down the tracks before it came to a stop
8411440 these individuals come from very small departments they are none the less extremely valuable to the law enforcement program in matagorda county
8411441 as you all know this will be my last 100 club award banquet to serve in this capacity and i want to tell everyone that it has been an extreme honor
8411442 one of the greatest honors i think that can be bestowed upon an individual in addition to being a peace officer is serving as a texas sheriff
8411443 the reason i am so proud is because i have had the opportunity to work with this group of men and women of the matagorda county sheriffs office
8411444 i cant say enough about them it has been my distinct honor to work with each of you
8411445 the reason why i chose this person is because every time i needed help at the crisis center i could always pick the phone up and call this person and he would always call me right back and help me with whatever i needed help with
8411446 weve spent many a night at the hospital together on sexual assault calls

8411452 the cia already conducts operations in partnership with the pakistanis
8411453 nato would like to have the same relationship with pakistan
8411454 they are the first thing we ask for when we plan an operation
8411455 the big thing is that they help us at the lowest tactical level they find information that which allows us to make decisions
8411456 its inspiring to look at what some of these women have done and to listen to some of their life stories
8411457 since multimedia often transcends linguistic barriers we thought it apt to help translate a multimedia player into local languages we chose vlc because it is undoubtedly the most popular open source media player available
8411458 at translate org za we believe that people express themselves best in their own language and people should be encouraged to create multimedia such as podcasts and sound bytes in their native languages
8411459 our way of empowering local languages is to help make popular software in these languages available
8411460 we also make it easier for volunteers by providing a simple web based translation system called pootle which is hosted at pootle locamotion org which makes it easy for anyone to help translate software
8411461 weve split the vlc language file into more workable chunks to make the number of source words more manageable
8411462 organisations such as ours can freely use open source software as a catalyst for creating language communities
8411463 anyone who wants to help translate vlc into their language can make use of our translation system
8411464 having accurate information about the application process is vital to survivors as they begin the process of recovering from tropical storm fay as the teams go door to door it lets them know that there is help available
8411465 as cr teams seek out locations where people affected by the disaster might be found they gather information to help those with special needs such as the elderly and people with disabilities
8411466 when unmet needs are identified cr teams pass that information on to the state or federal staff best able to respond
8411467 fuelwatch has a lot going for it and it didnt justify some of the criticisms that were appearing about it
8411468 so we just wanted to set the record straight about what evidence wed received
8411469 it was just an attempt to get the facts straight it was just an attempt to inform people
8411470 i invite people to read the report and they will see that its not based on the evidence we heard and i think theyll also understand that the attempt to breathe new life into fuelwatch has not revived the corpse that fuelwatch is
8411471 at the end of the day we are obliged to serve the best interests of the australian people and we could not let it pass through the senate knowing that australians would be paying higher prices for their petrol and that is something that we are not willing to countenance

8411477 if you see the newly installed beacons on the backside of the school assemblies flashing the school speed limit is 20 mph
8411478 we will have extra patrol out on the streets next week mainly to remind the public that school is starting and we need to look out for the safety of the children
8411479 the first thing that will help you make positive memories is there has to be positive choices on your part
8411480 people who attempt great things and fail are infinitely better off than those who attempt nothing and succeed
8411481 dream big and dont be afraid to go for it

8411485 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request
8411486 we take call in orders all the time so that working people can stop by and pick up their food to go
8411487 the best thing about our store is our family of employees
8411488 no one works for someone we all just work together

8411499 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
8411500 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
8411501 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
8411502 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
8411503 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
8411504 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
8411505 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
8411506 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
8411507 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
8411508 everything was going good until he started messing around on me
8411509 im sorry for shooting duke but he hurt me very bad love hurts and you dont play games with people s feelings
8411510 was going to shoot him in the leg but he wouldnt come around to my side of the car
8411511 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
8411512 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
8411513 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
8411514 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity

8411532 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county

8411541 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one

8411543 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
8411544 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
8411545 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community

8411548 the russian president says he is not afraid of a new cold war we dont want a new cold war he has a big responsibility not to start one
8411549 the sight of russian tanks in a neighbouring country on the 40th anniversary of the crushing of the prague spring has shown that the temptations of power politics remain the old sores and divisions fester and russia is not yet reconciled to the new map of this region
8411550 if we dont watch out europes whole security architecture will start to falter with unforeseeable consequences for all of us the spiral of provocation must stop immediately
8411551 there are other objectives that one can suppose are objectives for russia in particular the crimea ukraine and moldova
8411552 i can only say that we will not be roving the globe twisting hands and twisting arms of people for them to recognise south ossetia or abkhazia
8411553 this recognition was absolutely unavoidable short of losing our dignity as a nation we couldnt act otherwise

8411590 would you like to look at the tests of people whove done worse than you or better
8411591 the gulf of mexico area has a large percentage of oil production and refining
8411592 when katrina hit it knocked out 8 percent of the refining capacity for supplies of retail gas to go down by 8 percent is a huge shock to the system
8411593 over the course of three or four days that type of hike was unheard of at the time
8411594 i dont think weve seen anything like that since gas has been high this summer but it was more of a gradual increase
8411595 more often than not if crude oil prices are going up oil companies will pre emptively raise gas prices to slow demand
8411596 oil companies dont like to scare off consumers if they can ease people into price hikes consumers are less likely to change their habits
8411597 weve seen gas prices come down significantly but its still high and supplies are tight its a bad time to have a hurricane on a holiday weekend
8411598 fear of legal problems is one of the main reasons why smes are slow to launch internet based services from e commerce to online marketing

8411600 web 2 0 refers to the sharing collaboration and interactivity typical in many of the most successful online services that have launched in recent years
8411601 we didnt use the wikipedia software which is also open source because any users can post information
8411602 we check contributors manually using our panel of experts around europe to establish that the contributor has a sufficient level of expertise to write an article on internet law
8411603 most of the contributors come from universities or law firms who want to raise their profile
8411604 the choice of contributors was deliberate because were hoping to keep the service as low cost as possible so it will remain sustainable
8411605 we are building a critical mass of users and contributors around the world and we hope the service will continue to track the rapid change in online law
8411606 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
8411607 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
8411608 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
8411609 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
8411610 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
8411611 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
8411612 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
8411613 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
8411614 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
8411615 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
8411616 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
8411617 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
8411618 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
8411619 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
8411620 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
8411621 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
8411622 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
8411623 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
8411624 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
8411625 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
8411626 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
8411627 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
8411628 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them

8411639 you can use the simple powershell script below to check esx server patching status from your windows client
8411640 is a script which can remove the connected iso files from the cd drive some administrators do not disconnect a cd drive when the have finished use the iso the side effects of this behavior are the vm regularly polls the cd drive which creates a slight overhead and a vmotion may fail this script can run unattended e g every night so even when an iso file remains mounted it is ejected every night
8411641 this script automatically detects any disconnected host and reconnects it be sure you connect to virtualcenter before running it though on the first line the script also allows setting a password sometimes you cant reconnect a host without a password usually because the password has been changed if this applies to you set the password here and youll be re connecting hosts faster than ever
8411642 i wrote a little powershell script that goes out to a virtualcenter instance and grabs a list of all the port groups in use by every esx host under vc management it ignores the default vm network service console and vmkernel portgroups then it goes out to each esx host under management and makes sure that it has all of the vlans and that they are using the correct vlanid it does some simple error checking if the vlan ids dont match up the script prompts you to ask you to pick the right one so now when i need to add a network i can just add it to any host under management and then run my script to reconcile everything i think its neat saves me time and human error

8411677 you dont want to run up on him and ask him this and that once he started feeling his way around here and i saw what type of guy he was i saw that he was a real good guy talking to him is an opportunity to learn from one of the best
8411678 im young so every time i see somebody im like man thats so and so

8411681 i didnt even turn the music on i just sat there and talked to him hes a real good guy
8411682 being able to play with a guy like that thats something that i never would have dreamed of
8411683 growing up as a receiver you watch those types of great players and you always want to mimic what they do its just a blessing to watch him in practice and see the way he does it if he gives you a pointer or something you have to take that and do what he says because obviously it has been working for him

8411685 i just ran what the play was called and as long as you do that in this offense anyone can make plays
8411686 when your number is called you have to go in there and make plays
8411687 i have always believed in myself yeah i might not be the biggest or i might not be the fastest guy but i know i can make plays in this league when my number is called im going to catch the ball

8411843 the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition
8411844 misrepresented the history and nature of the authentic teaching of the catholic church against abortion
8411845 since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion this teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable direct abortion that is to say abortion willed either as an end or a means is gravely contrary to the moral law

8411848 iran radical islamic government known sponsors of terrorism developing nuclear capabilities to generate power but threatening to eliminate israel
8411849 obama says iran is a tiny country doesnt pose a serious threat
8411850 terrorism destroying israel those arent serious threats obama dangerously unprepared to be president
8411851 and ultimately that direct engagement led to a series of measures that helped prevent nuclear war and over time allowed the kind of opening that brought down the berlin wall
8411852 now that has to be the kind of approach that we take you know iran they spend one one hundredth of what we spend on the military if iran ever tried to pose a serious threat to us they wouldnt stand a chance and we should use that position of strength that we have to be bold enough to go ahead and listen that doesnt mean we agree with them on everything we might not compromise on any issues but at least we should find out other areas of potential common interest and we can reduce some of the tensions that has caused us so many problems around the world

8411857 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8411858 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8411859 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8411860 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8411861 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8411862 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8411863 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8411870 the animating principle of my faith as taught to me by church and home was that the cardinal sin was abuse of power
8411871 it was not only required as a good catholic to abhor and avoid abuse of power but to do something to end that abuse
8411872 i get comfort from carrying my rosary going to mass every sunday its my time alone
8411873 there are elements within the church who say that if you are at odds with any of the teachings of the church you are at odds with the church i think the church is bigger than that

8411888 the big shot was one of the most unique cameras polaroid ever introduced released in 1971 and produced until 1973 it was designed for portrait use and had a fixed focal distance of a few feet it has a 220mm lens a single speed mechanical shutter and a fixed focus rangefinder to help the photographer keep the subject in focus the long body makes the big shot one of the largest instant cameras to be mass produced dwarfing the smaller colorpack style models above the body is a flash diffuser it diffuses the light from the flash to soften shadows cast when taking the picture famed artist andy warhol was purportedly fond of this camera in particular and today it has a cult status among polaroid cameras for its eccentricity

8411916 theres a lot he can do at the convention to prove his respect for both clintons that would be very very welcome
8411917 if that were done it would be inevitable that millions of people would support obama with time money and votes
8411918 ultimately on the foundational principle that god created the earth for the sustenance of all his children therefore that all persons are equal in the inherent claims upon the bounty of nature

8411922 actually the last time i heard it was a steel mill about nineteen or twenty miles southeast of us
8411923 we just wanted to show our support for barack obama
8411924 the reason we chose this is several years ago mel carnahan of rolla missouri was running for governor
8411925 we just kind of thought if we had rednecks for carnahan well wed have rednecks for obama
8411926 ive had people step out here and ask me what entitles me to call myself a redneck
8411927 shoot im from the country i was raised without running water in the house till i was out of high school i went to a one room schoolhouse ive raised hogs ive raised cattle ive raised chickens i hunt i fish i own guns i own a boat a four wheel drive and i like nascar if that dont qualify me to be a damn redneck i dont know what the hell does
8411928 yeah thats the message were trying to send out dont be afraid to vote for obama
8411929 i dont know some people just dont like change and weve never had a president that was the skin color he is but that dont cut no ice with me i dont care if youre black green or yellow if youre qualified for the job and he certainly is

8411950 sometimes being here at duke because weve been very very successful they expect you to be perfect they dont look at process anymore
8411951 its like what we havent gone to the final four what we didnt win the national title very spoiled and it ruins it a little bit really a lot
8411952 part of that then becomes you win and sometimes youre just relieved to win
8411953 im not saying that it happens all the time but it happens at the end of that spain game most people would say werent you relieved no i wasnt i was exhilarated it was euphoric it was the way it should be thats the way its going to be for the rest of my career here at duke
8411954 each one of the coaches brings such a wealth of knowledge to the table and for a young coach to obviously be around coach k every day is an amazing opportunity
8411955 but to be around some of the other top coaches in the world and be able to pick their brains and learn the game through their eyes is just a wonderful opportunity
8411956 doing those two things at the same time afforded me an amazing opportunity to grow
8411957 throughout this time there have been sometimes articles you should do this you shouldnt theres no way that i shouldnt have done this for duke for me for our country for the kids i coach im a better coach to them a better person as a result and when i was coaching them it was that we didnt go to the ncaa final four during the last two years because we had two young teams and we got beat all of a sudden theres a reason shame on you you dont do that thats wrong the people who wrote about those things they were wrong
8411958 were going to go after it were going to do it and if some student doesnt go to the final four after their four years at duke then thats just too damn bad
8411959 but our team is going to have fun is going to be representative and theyre going to have the opportunity to grow just like our olympic team did

8411981 the whole idea of weapons of mass destruction was never the issue yet they keep trying to bring this up
8411982 i cant answer that in fact ive never been one of the real strong fans of general powell
8411983 the media made that the issue because they knew saddam hussein had used weapons of mass destruction so we knew that they were there but that was incidental to the fact we were going after terrorist camps
8411984 our intelligence system has said that we know that saddam hussein has weapons of mass destruction i believe including nuclear theres not one person on this panel who would tell you unequivocally that he doesnt have the missile means now or is nearly getting the missile means to deliver a weapon of mass destruction and i for one am not willing to wait for that to happen

8412005 some questions such as how earths continents have moved over millions of years cannot be answered with experimental data instead of getting data from experiments geologists make observations all over earth they also use models based on the laws of physics
8412006 what i want to be true ill call true regardless of lack of any evidence
8412007 you cant explain it so that means my god did it
8412008 i say that the red shift was caused by a flying spaghetti monster how would you prove me wrong

8412010 show me some evidence mel and id be perfectly willing to change my mind
8412011 problem our scientific method uses our sensory observations to establish what has happened
8412012 uncertainties in measurement cannot be avoided although we try to make them as small as possible for this reason it is important to clearly describe the uncertainties in our measurements

8412015 we dont know how long the bone has been dead
8412016 our planet was born approximately 4 6 billion years ago as a great cloud of gas and dust condensed into a sphere as gravity pulled this matter tightly together heat from great pressure and radioactivity melted first the planets interior and then most of its mass as far as we can tell earth cooled enough to allow the first solid rocks to form on its surface about 4 billion years ago
8412017 experiments first performed in 1953 by american scientists stanley miller and harold urey provide a fascinating glimpse of events leading to the appearance of earths first life forms
8412018 the next step in our story is the most difficult to understand completely for the jumbled mixture of molecules in the organic soup that formed in earths oceans the highly organized structures of rna and dna must somehow have evolved
8412019 for over thirty years i have been publishing experimental results verifying that po halos in granites and other crystalline rocks did not originate with secondary po from u decay but instead with primordial po and hence constitute prima facie evidence of almost instant creation of those rocks

8412025 as for the experiences you may have had in rehoboth beach those are irrelevant in this context
8412026 to study the universe is to study jesus apart from jesus there is no study of the universe
8412027 you need to generate a predictive hypothesis that is independent of the observations and assumptions used to make the hypothesis thats how science works
8412028 this is a common creationist tactic when confronted by problematical evidence deny it
8412029 thats not news mel that was always exactly my point im glad that you finally got around to admitting it
8412030 those in the creation camp believe a priori that there must be an involved creator who designed and made all things
8412031 i am satisfied that i exist and i suspect most of the readers of this forum are satisfied as well some of them have even met me in person
8412032 thats not news mel that was always exactly my point im glad that you finally got around to admitting it
8412033 those in the creation camp believe a priori that there must be an involved creator who designed and made all things
8412034 i see no requirement to provide you with anything more rigorous than what you have already obviously accepted
8412035 understanding biological evolution and producing scientific progress in this area does not depend at all on any specific notions about the origin of the universe

8412040 people who buy hand guns for protection have already defined their world as being a dangerous hostile place that sooner or later will compel them to shoot someone
8412041 i agree completely but i have to ask are there any reliable statistics on the subject
8412042 if you try scholar google com for your search instead of just plain google
8412043 the problem isnt that idiots are allowed to buy guns without receiving training its that there are idiots
8412044 i dont know who it is is therefore i should shoot

8412061 has taken its eye off the ball when it comes to maintaining current equipment
8412062 we continue to lose confidence in the reliability of the equipment we are tasked to use to keep the system safe and efficient
8412063 we thought if we gave people something fun to do then maybe they will forget about the difficult economy
8412064 knowing that the day after we took the initial vote that that would be the penalty for following through with the veto override and the six of us all went in kind of with our eyes opened and we needed to decide whether we thought our leadership position was more important than our roads for me personally it was the 13 people that died in the i35w bridge collapse and the transportation system for our state and i said you know im willing to give up my leadership role in the caucus in order to do something that i believe is right for our state and then so all six of us voted to override the governor along with the 85 democrats that was enough to get that through then despite the governors veto
8412065 that was a severe mistake very very severe mistake and what happened out of that is the enormous partisanship that we have today to break that partisanship that we have today we need to go back to a non partisan legislature i was wrong i voted wrong to convince the people to change the minnesota constitution to a partisan legislature
8412066 the minneapolis park system is world famous but it didnt just happen
8412067 almost no one realizes what a central impact the formation and building of this system has had on minnesota
8412068 at its root was a gigantic real estate scheme but the people who planned and launched our park system also valued being good stewards of the earth thinking ahead 100 years preserving the natural beauty of minneapolis for future generations and making parks available and accessible to everyone the minneapolis park system is a model for coordinating public and private interests in the political process this model has given shape to the entire political history of the state our park system is a big reason for why the media are reporting that the republican national convention is in minneapolis not saint paul
8412069 everybody learned a lesson about staying so the highways will be twice as packed this time

8412075 im sure there are other cases of hidden people in the rural areas
8412076 we have excellent systems and processes in place but this week its our best efforts that failed not the regulators not the canadian food safety system
8412077 i emphasize this is our accountability and its ours to fix which we are taking on fully
8412078 we have an inspector in place on a daily basis when the plant is running in order to oversee the production process in order to validate that the controls are indeed in place
8412079 its tantamount to if you had a haystack with a needle in it
8412080 you can walk out and take 10 samples of that haystack you likely wont find the needle what adds value is address what caused the needle getting in there in the first place
8412081 has made the establishment of a single set of high quality accounting standards a matter of growing importance

8412083 there is no doubt that it was a great missed opportunity to prevent people like you who shaped the minds of the generation to come to israel and perform

8412085 i am extremely disappointed in not being able to continue in my position on icos board of directors as i think very highly of the management and people at ico and i believe the company has a bright future unfortunately i believe my ability to serve as an ico board member would be limited due to conflicts with other business and personal commitments

8412091 this is the worst case i have seen of mans inhumanity of man
8412092 its inspiring to look at what some of these women have done and to listen to some of their life stories
8412093 a lot of the women who dropped off the list this year were for job related reasons
8412094 in some cases its simply a matter of the woman still has a powerful position but other women are relatively more powerful and pushed her down and off the list
8412095 certainly had she been the democratic nominee that probably would have catapulted her higher
8412096 shes still an incredibly powerful force shes way more powerful than any other female senator
8412097 we dont have a lot of time to unite the democratic party
8412098 that which historically divides us cannot divide us if we want barack obama to be president of the united states
8412099 barack needs illinoisans to love each other then he needs us to leave our front row seats and go hug ohio go hug michigan go hug florida

8412107 its a tall order but it is important to have a consistent policy governing everything from internet protocol regulations to intellectual property on the web
8412108 protesters say police used overkill cops say anarchists had rocks
8412109 after the confrontation some of the protesters were seen stopping by the portable toilets in civic center to refuel their weapons with feces
8412110 but valentine and gebremedhin who are making a documentary of the 2008 election for a college class disputed the account
8412111 there are no visible weapons on valentines video of the march it does though show protesters sitting down in the middle of the street when police begin surrounding them and ordering them out of the street

8412135 were all starting to see more demand because of the food prices going up and utilities and its a balancing act for most of the people we serve as non profits

8412148 when hilliary clinton spoke it appeased the vast majority of clinton delegates
8412149 in essence she was giving her blessing and her permition this morning most people even though they may not entirely agree with obamas positions on things or affections for him they realized there is a big difference between his and john mccains positions

8412281 and president obama is going to need a working majority in the senate
8412282 television has the greatest potential to inform and educate in the history of any medium
8412283 i am just going to denver to provide some balance to whats going on there on behalf of my candidate senator mccain
8412284 hes on vacation ive been told thats all im allowed to say hes on vacation
8412285 ill even go one step further with you than ive gone with other reporters
8412286 ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world
8412287 a tiny portion of america is casting half an eye towards us every now and then maybe we hope
8412288 all in favor of having the presumptive nominee be the actual nominee say more pork sausage please okay its unanimous sally could you bring everybody their own carafe of syrup and drop the check at microsoft at amp t and gms table over there in the corner thats a darling
8412289 in some voters it will continue to be an issue
8412290 and it has been ever since barry goldwater ran against lyndon johnson in 1964 and thats the reason that the republican party has been so successful in the south
8412291 if barack loses by that amount theyll say its racism
8412292 the only thing stopping me from going to work with a gun
8412293 how to understand your benefits and the social security program
8412294 for us africa still has a huge amount of promise
8412295 there are still things we want to do with the african setting and i think its safe to say well continue to explore it
8412296 that said we might find something new and compelling about the antarctic setting that wants us to make the next game there but honestly were still at the preliminary stages if we wanted to make the next game set in the forest of south america we could do it but i think to save time for us one of the reasons we chose to use the african setting is because we felt that in order to retain the far cry brand value of an exotic dangerous environment a place that maybe people havent had a chance to see themselves or have seen extensively in film television and other games we wanted to choose africa lets face it jungle islands are probably less exciting as they were four years ago
8412297 im not denying anything i just cant comment for the company
8412298 if we could win arizona this year it would set such a milestone for the democratic party we would bury the republicans for 25 years
8412299 but ive been here before folks if anyone can screw this up its the democratic party
8412300 there were two words no convention speaker in 2004 could say george bush
8412301 if you cant defend yourself then you sure cant defend the american people
8412302 are going to make the swift boat ads look like public service announcements
8412303 the american people are dumb enough to give the republicans another shot
8412304 encourage users to analyze comment on and even challenge washingtonpost coms articles
8412305 everything should be made as simple as possible but not simpler
8412306 obama and chief strategist david axelrod are clearly aware of what past campaigns did right and what they did wrong
8412307 there were lessons we really learned from howard deans primary
8412308 you cant just have this internet presence it has to be real on the ground
8412309 increased atmospheric carbon has a warming effect on the earth
8412310 while the scope and long term consequences of this warming effect are the subject of ongoing research we believe the united states should take measured and reasonable steps today
8412311 the next six months are going to tell the story
8412312 we were still working over the speech text in the car over to the fleet center in 2004
8412313 the world as it is just wont do that we have an obligation to fight for the world as it should be
8412314 feeling the whole weight of her future in his hands
8412315 todo un acontecimiento el potencial de estas seis obras maestras puede ser incre ble
8412316 fuelwatch has a lot going for it and it didnt justify some of the criticisms that were appearing about it
8412317 so we just wanted to set the record straight about what evidence wed received
8412318 it was just an attempt to get the facts straight it was just an attempt to inform people
8412319 i invite people to read the report and they will see that its not based on the evidence we heard and i think theyll also understand that the attempt to breathe new life into fuelwatch has not revived the corpse that fuelwatch is
8412320 at the end of the day we are obliged to serve the best interests of the australian people and we could not let it pass through the senate knowing that australians would be paying higher prices for their petrol and that is something that we are not willing to countenance
8412321 ine i chipul n soare i nu vei vedea umbra
8412322 dulce este lumina i o pl cere pentru ochi s vad soarele
8412323 daca nu ai iubi cum ai putea pre ui orbitoarea lumin a soarelui i mangaietoarea lumin a lunii
8412324 nu te poti bucura pe deplin de lumina atata timp cat nu inveti a vedea frumuseta in intuneric
8412325 as an organization that started as a small guerilla group the tigers will retain their capacity to go back to their origins
8412326 the havoc that even a small group of determined persons can do is inestimable
8412327 yeah mccains a decent guy but damn i just cant trust the republicans to be in charge anymore
8412328 el ministro est en lo cierto ya que es plenamente conocedor de la cantidad de cabezas que tiene la provincia y la forma en que va evolucionando
8412329 son muchos kilos pero lo podemos lograr si trabajamos fuertemente con los planes productivos de manera eficiente y con el avance tecnol gico podemos lograr en pocos a os cumplir con esa demanda que tiene la provincia
8412330 estamos mejorando a trav s de los diferentes programas impulsados desde el gobierno y la tecnolog a que posibilita entre otras cosas una mayor cantidad de parici n
8412331 venimos insistiendo en realizar el remate en la zona norte una vez al mes y con 150 cabezas ya podemos hacerlo
8412332 la falta de unidad de los productores para realizar este remate que servir a para encontrar un patr n de precios y ser a lo ideal
8412333 when she spoke about obama she really did not emote very much
8412334 the only thing she showed was a very weak smile the cheeks didnt tend to lift very much it was really almost what i would call a crocodile smile where even the slight corners of the lips sometimes raise into a little bit of a smirk
8412335 development of race based products such as vitamins and drugs
8412336 misleading the public to believe that races are biologically distinct requiring race specific products but the basis for their wares flies in the face of science
8412337 el caudillo manda organiza resuelve y todos los espa oles obedecen
8412338 now theres some people who say george bush is doing a great job
8412339 no no wait hold up give me a chance let me explain i know i know what youre saying youre saying george bush is out of touch he doesnt understand me or my suffering and i hear ya but hear me out hey listen im doing pretty well myself cant complain but let me tell you about a friend of mine
8412340 do you think that john mccain at home in one of his many houses could ever relate to the pain of a single mom with cancer trying to raise kids and make ends meet when he cant even remember how many houses he owns
8412341 a really important aspect of it is our ability to really be able to quantify what the benefit is
8412342 the green meter capability coupled with what we can already compute in terms of miles that would otherwise be traveled or gas expenditures that are associated with people going to these meetings as well as productivity loss with those travel hours is significant
8412343 green meter detects through the ip internet protocol locations of all those attendees who would travel to the host and through a series of complex algorithms is able to measure and provide metrics of what the carbon emission output would be from the trip as well as the fuel costs and fuel amounts associated with that trip
8412344 we first launched green meter a little over a year ago and since then across ilincs customers were going to save almost 2 billion pounds of carbon emissions this year
8412345 we err on the side of being extremely conservative because the numbers are so good
8412346 based on the distance of those flights it can determine the size of the jet that youd be taking
8412347 its very intuitive because of what our developers have built into it
8412348 the idea for this came from the governor janet napolitano herself who cast her efficiency review steering committee which is composed of senior staff in her office to basically go out and look for strategies that would help benefit the environment reduce travel and provide another basket of benefits that are associated with this kind of technology for web conferencing
8412349 we have end to end aes advanced encryption standard encryption that is the highest government level you can get
8412350 so that means everything that is leaving my computer right now gets encrypted and then it doesnt get unencrypted until it hits your computer
8412351 i think that in these times of tight budgets and increased sensitivity to the environment that web conferencing when done correctly can really provide a strong benefit for state and local governments
8412352 he has to bring the smoke he has to bring the rain
8412353 attack thats the vps role make the case for the presidential candidate make the case against the other guy
8412354 the advantage of the role of the vice president is he doesnt have to worry about subtlety
8412355 we remember that he voted against the creation of medicare against the creation of medicaid against the clean air act against head start against the peace corps in the 60s and americorps in the 90s he even voted against the funds to send a man to the moon
8412356 if hes the most optimistic man in america id hate to see the pessimists
8412357 i think he can be ready but right now i dont believe he is
8412358 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
8412359 basically a true story but it just hasnt happened yet
8412360 a thrilling spectacle but ultimately distances the public from the problem
8412361 we were interested in blurring the lines between fact and fiction
8412362 its very important that the program is clearly labelled a drama and not a documentary
8412363 even though the chances of climate change are significant there are processes in place to manage the consequences
8412364 the bottom line is our cities are not going to run out of water
8412365 this movie is to climate science as frankenstein is to heart transplant surgery
8412366 the power of population is so superior to the power of the earth to produce subsistence for man that premature death must in some shape or other visit the human race
8412367 a terrifying glimpse of the none too distant future when climate change will force the worlds powers into a desperate struggle for advantage and even survival
8412368 there is a probability of wars including even nuclear wars if temperatures rise 2 to 3 degrees celsius
8412369 my background is 30 years in the strategic field and i look at this stuff and the potential for huge disruption to internal relationships and international relationships to me looks enormous
8412370 there is a range of possibilities here thats why these scenarios are not mutually independent each one is a free floating possibility and they depend on the amount of change that you have got but that basically is a question of dates
8412371 i dont imagine people reading this book will be empowered or disempowered to the extent that it will make a whole lot of difference to the balance of outcomes
8412372 im not a pessimist i dont think these are foregone conclusions we are on a large highway and there are any number of exits off this highway that we could take and avoid the bridge thats out down the road
8412373 but there are no guarantees that any of them will be taken and further down the highway very bad things will happen if the exits arent taken
8412374 the diocese has invoked the provision that returns control of the parishes to the diocese an action that was approved by the diocesan council
8412375 declared that they had voluntarily left the ordained ministry of the anglican church of canada and had come under the jurisdiction of a bishop reporting to the argentina based anglican church of the southern cone
8412376 no communications have been received from st matthias and st luke since its priest left the anglican church of canada
8412377 attempts to appeal those rulings in both cases have been unsuccessful and costs have been awarded to the dioceses involved
8412378 knights of the keyboards did the hubs fourth estate proud when they rallied a la the sox in the 2004 alcs here versus the yankees from deficits of 4 0 after the first inning and 7 1 in the fifth to score eight runs in the last four frames to pull out an 8 7 victory over gothams ink stained wretches
8412379 i may be fat but youre ugly so whats your excuse
8412380 im so much better looking than you so if im ugly you must be a hideous monstrosity
8412381 what am i doing im a fucking grown person acting like im 6

8412387 without a life i would be stuck again let the rain of what i feel right now come down where is the coast guard im treading for my life
8412388 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
8412389 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
8412390 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
8412391 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
8412392 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
8412393 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8412394 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
8412395 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
8412396 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
8412397 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8412398 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
8412399 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
8412400 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
8412401 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
8412402 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
8412403 i chill at white castle cause its the best but i fly at fatburger when im way out west
8412404 although inspired by the contents is not a representation of mr mcgartlands life
8412405 he was also given the opportunity to have the name of the lead character replaced with a fictional character name which he declined
8412406 i should not have been placed in that position i was never in such a position
8412407 i cannot understand why they had to change things to that extent
8412408 available in four captivating designs these special edition notebooks not only look good but are also expressions of the users taste and character
8412409 the president already has the mark of the american people hes the worst president we ever had
8412410 the miami herald and usa today reported george w bush would have widened his 537 vote victory to a 1 665 vote margin if the recount ordered by the florida supreme court would have been allowed to continue
8412411 clinton ordered the attack friday but the raid was delayed a day so it would not fall on the muslim sabbath the missiles struck late at night between 1 a m and 2 a m baghdad time because clinton wished to minimize possible deaths of innocent civilians
8412412 however tempting it might be to some when much trouble lies ahead to step aside adroitly and put someone else up to take the blows i do not intend to take that cowardly course but on the contrary to stand to my post and persevere in accordance with my duty as i see it
8412413 men of goodwill can disagree and still love their country and want the best for her
8412414 i consider president george w bush the greatest president this country has ever had
8412415 lets not judge them too harshly we have a hundred years of history to study since president bush they did not
8412416 what i havent heard about gas going to 4 a gallon
8412417 is the world a safer place upon his her departure fromt the world stage in all tests gwb is and will always be a great world leader
8412418 the repubs are trying to use hillary supporters as they do all the other factions of their party get them angry win their votes then abandon them amp their ideals when they are elected into office
8412419 the way i see it many conservatives are doing more to hurt america than any minority group has thus far all most minorities are trying to do is live the american dream
8412420 conservatives has been living the american dream so they are easily manipulated by stupid emotional issues packaged amp served to them by the fox news types
8412421 easily manipulated by stupid emotional issues packaged amp served to them by the
8412422 they live lavish with their large bank accounts amp ignore those of us who are struggling then when the bad news bite them in the butt they look to the federal government to bail them out just like the minorities
8412423 we should be holding the rush limbaugh amp sean hannity types accountable for their role in giving us the bu h crime family
8412424 for example detroit whose mayor has been indicted on felony charges hasnt elected a republican mayor since 1961 buffalo has been even more stubborn it started putting a democrat in office back in 1954 and it hasnt stopped since unfortunately those two cities may be alone at the top of the poverty rate list but theyre not alone in their love for democrats cincinnati ohio third on the poverty rate list hasnt had a republican mayor since 1984 cleveland ohio fourth on the list has been led by a democrat since 1989 st louis missouri sixth hasnt had a republican since 1949 milwaukee wisconsin eighth since 1908 philadelphia pennsylvania ninth since 1952 and newark new jersey 10th since 1907 the only two cities in the top 10 that i didnt mention miami florida and el paso texas havent had republicans in office either just democrats independents or nonpartisans over the past 50 years the eight cities listed above have had republican leadership for a combined 36 years the rest of the time a combined 364 years theyve been led by democrats five of the 10 cities with the highest poverty rates detroit buffalo st louis milwaukee philadelphia and newark have had a democratic stranglehold since at least 1961 more than 45 years two of the cities milwaukee and newark have been electing democrats since the first model t rolled off the assembly line in 1908
8412425 a lie can travel halfway around the world while the truth is still putting on its shoes
8412426 its going to take a major hit on america with thousands of lives lost before anybody will do anything your son and his mates lives are not enough to get their presidents politicians attention
8412427 i will put my trust in the promises of god and since i am trusting him what can mere man do to me they are always twisting what i say all their thoughts are how to harm me
8412428 ill be long gone before some smart person ever figures out what happened inside this oval office
8412429 no my life is not better off in fact it is worse
8412430 i dont use liberal talking points i excrete liberal talking points
8412431 dont worry about a thing cause evry little thing gonna be alright
8412432 sort of the origin tale that mixes the historical prince vlad of transylvania with sort of the fictionalized bram stoker take

8412434 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8412435 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8412436 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
8412437 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8412438 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8412439 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
8412440 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
8412441 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
8412442 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
8412443 we wanted to give the mustang pony a more realistic feel
8412444 we lifted the head to make the pony more proud tipped the neck into the wind to give it a feeling of greater speed and better balance
8412445 its more chiseled and more defined and looks more like a wild horse
8412446 its more realistic in terms of proportion to an actual mustang
8412447 his top contenders are said to include minnesota gov tim pawlenty and former massachusetts gov mitt romney less traditional choices mentioned include former pennsylvania gov tom ridge an abortion rights supporter and connecticut sen joe lieberman the democratic vice presidential prick in 2000 who now is an independent
8412448 mark cuban joins techcrunch50 for a one on one interview with jason calacanis
8412449 its inspiring to look at what some of these women have done and to listen to some of their life stories
8412450 a lot of the women who dropped off the list this year were for job related reasons
8412451 in some cases its simply a matter of the woman still has a powerful position but other women are relatively more powerful and pushed her down and off the list
8412452 certainly had she been the democratic nominee that probably would have catapulted her higher
8412453 shes still an incredibly powerful force shes way more powerful than any other female senator
8412454 for the first time in my adult life i am proud of my country
8412455 many folks around the country have never voted for an african american not for president
8412456 but we are confident barack obama will be elected when working class voters know who he is and what he stands for
8412457 we need to accept the fact that there are going to be some angry white guys who wont vote for barack obama because hes a black man
8412458 the fundamental challenge for us is not the whole issue of what color his skin is its that our economy has gone into the toilet
8412459 the reality is we have the first african american candidate running for president and you cant minimize that dynamic
8412460 we have to keep it simple we have to tell a worker the difference between barack and mccain is that mccain is trying to do away with employer provided health care
8412461 mccain has not distanced himself from bushs economic policies at all
8412462 i dont think white working class voters have been made aware of that yet and as economics comes to the fore you can expect that obama will capture a lot of the undecideds
8412463 im not aiming for a lot of high rhetoric im much more concerned with communicating how i intend to help middle class families live their lives this is going to be a more workman like speech
8412464 i am absolutely convinced that both hillary clinton and former president bill clinton understand the stakes
8412465 we are after all democrats so it may take a while were not the fall in line party we are diverse but make no mistake we are unified
8412466 the truth is im just bitter that clinton didnt get the nomination once again the black man has got something before any woman did sexism is alive and well in this country
8412467 there may be a few of us who go for mccain but most of us understand we need to kick republicans out of the white house
8412468 there is nothing not holy there is only that which has not yet been hallowed
8412469 the plans are dear to the souls of the beautiful goddesses for they are noble
8412470 en optant pour ce geste humanitaire les plus hautes autorit s de letat ont manifest une volont dapaisement certaine qui ouvre aujourdhui mme petrella la voie de lespoir

8412472 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
8412473 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
8412474 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
8412475 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
8412476 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
8412477 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
8412478 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
8412479 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
8412480 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
8412481 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8412482 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
8412483 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
8412484 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
8412485 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
8412486 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
8412487 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
8412488 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
8412489 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
8412490 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
8412491 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
8412492 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
8412493 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
8412494 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
8412495 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
8412496 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
8412497 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
8412498 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues

8412504 workers understand whats happened to them over the past eight years they understand that we have to elect democrats
8412505 its important that workers recognize that they need political power to achieve changes
8412506 we couldnt get the employee free choice act if we had a continuation of the republican administration workers are understanding more and more that mccain would just be a continuation of the bush administration
8412507 the chamber is a bipartisan organization but clearly we endorse far more republicans than we do democrats because were a business organization
8412508 this is a battle that these guys are going to find very uncomfortable
8412509 one of the major reasons im here is we want to preserve the right of a secret ballot the suggestion by american labor unions is that we would eliminate that right
8412510 you only have to fear the efca if youre an employer paying sub standard wages and have unsafe working conditions
8412511 a number of his members are so opposed to the employee free choice act because theyre scared to death of workers having a stronger way to express themselves in terms of whether they want to belong to a union
8412512 we believe that with a democratic majority in both the senate and the house and a president who is already committed to signing a bill when it gets to him that its going to be a major victory

8412515 i feel sad that i dont know what happened to her i am sure her family would love to have some closure so would i
8412516 its never dawned on me that she might be dead
8412517 i always thought she might be in trouble i think i have always believed that she ran for her life
8412518 but there was something wrong with the guy his stories often changed
8412519 there was some conjecture that he tried to burn the body
8412520 it looked like as if you had dug a hole and filled it up
8412521 there was a lot to point to it being john

8412523 it is my submission that that has not been proved certainly not to the criminal standard and that a doubt based on reason exists
8412524 jose hernandez theres evidence before this court to conclude has no accent he speaks like a canadian born young man because thats what he is
8412525 colours all of the rest of the evidence which the crown proffered in support of the theory that mr hernandez is the speaker overheard by mr mcmynn
8412526 this kind of evidence is neither sufficiently accurate nor reliable to support a conviction in my view
8412527 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
8412528 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
8412529 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
8412530 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
8412531 when i counted up how many there were i was just shocked that they were taking out half the trees in florence park
8412532 i think it will be less useful as a park
8412533 can you imagine what this would be like without these trees hot it would be hot
8412534 were not saying that they shouldnt cut any trees down
8412535 we just feel like they should try to trim and save the ones they can i think its a cost effective issue
8412536 we love trees we love shade we love people to come to our parks
8412537 the trees have major structural damage in their crowns they do have some cracks in them
8412538 we dont wait and say hmm lets hope for the best
8412539 im not sure were going to save as many as we would like

8412544 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8412545 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8412546 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
8412547 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
8412548 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
8412549 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
8412550 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8412551 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8412552 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8412553 im so excited to finally be able to bring my show to new zealand this will be my second visit but my first concert performance and i cant wait to see you all there
8412554 i have often found it comical at exhibitions when i have seen people touch works thinking no one is watching them
8412555 i was even on the phone yesterday calling my bank to see what my account was
8412556 is this the brad lester from auburn whos the starting quarterback
8412557 honestly i think both of them could go out and start both of them are good quarterbacks we trust both of them
8412558 everybody is fired up trying to find out who that guy is
8412559 what im looking for is leadership and a guy that can control the football team and guys will look up to if thats both of them then it will be both of them
8412560 sometimes when you have a quarterback battle with two people a lot of people say you must not have one i think this is totally different i think both these guys have earned the right to play
8412561 thats one thing you always worry about but ive talked with the seniors and weve talked with the team
8412562 its a unique situation but i think its a real good situation for us when we put this offense in i was told pretty bluntly by several buddies of mine that have run this offense that you better have more than one for what youre getting ready to get into
8412563 it does get to you a little bit but you cant worry about that
8412564 when i get my chance when my name is called youve got to be able to perform
8412565 i just tell them thanks but there are two quarterbacks so they have to go with that
8412566 we cant let this divide the team at all between me and chris we have to stay strong as quarterbacks and not let our individual things get in the way of the teams goals
8412567 if there was a clear cut starter it would be a lot easier to take leadership of the team
8412568 id be the guy so i could say this and do that
8412569 i cant worry about that at this point i just have to keep getting better and trying to be the best quarterback i can in this system
8412570 knowing or not knowing i guess its always in your head
8412571 youre still out there competing and its making us both better because were still competing for that
8412572 i think its a team advantage that everybody doesnt have other teams are going to have to prepare for that
8412573 theres a lot of things in this offense that you ask a quarterback to do
8412574 there are some of them that you cant judge in a scrimmage or in a practice theres a lot of intangibles those will be looked at as we go through the first two non conference games by the time we get to mississippi state this thing could be worked out or it could be the same
8412575 either way i think were going to be in good shape
8412576 it is getting pretty taxing chasing tom mcclintock all over california to get him to speak to us the final straw was that the next sighting of mcclintock is down in orange county at ed royces bbq and he is charging 200 to see him
8412577 my daddy always told me if i want to live like a republican i should vote like a democrat daddy i am so sorry you always knew best

8412585 i dont see these changes making a dramatic difference in how the whole fannie and freddie fiasco plays out
8412586 we are not convinced that the government needs to take any action over the near term
8412587 most managers are taking the position that it would unthinkable to imagine a scenario where the government wouldnt back the debt
8412588 the end result is probably going to be that they go bankrupt and the government nationalizes the function
8412589 i dont think an adult could have handled it with any more grace or strength

8412595 youve come here from so many different places having made this journey and feeling in your heart what is right for you to do
8412596 i voted for hillary this morning because i gave my word and i keep my word
8412597 were not little kids to be told what to do in a half hour
8412598 i dont see any further reason to continue to carry out a pretense that shes a candidate shes not
8412599 if we dont have an official roll call vote state by state it is going to reopen a wound
8412600 i think it is reflective of the unity that i sense that is building across the party
8412601 that doesnt mean there wont be outliers that are still heartbroken their favorite candidate didnt make it
8412602 going to be able to bring themselves to vote for anybody other than senator clinton
8412603 even though hillary tells us not to spend any time thinking about what might have been
8412604 im sure all of us were thinking about what might have been last night
8412605 if shes not a strong enough leader to get her followers to do whats right for america then that would surprise me
8412606 i think they are going to follow her lead and her lead was very crystal clear last night
8412607 that question is on the minds of a lot of people
8412608 if we pass this bill which the democrats irresponsibly oppose well solve this problem
8412609 if we bring a new attitude of hopefulness and respect for the world well make the seas higher and the fish more numerous
8412610 our choice wasnt between a benign status quo and the bloodshed of war it was between war and a greater threat dont let anyone tell you otherwise and certainly not a disingenuous filmmaker who would have us believe that saddams iraq was an oasis of peace
8412611 we wanted to offer our customers the opportunity to buy a uniquely specialized automobile which would capture their passion for performance and distinctive styling our plan for this enhanced version of the scorpion supercar is to offer state of the art upgrades such as durable ceramic brakes and optional carbon fiber wheels the limited edition will not only employ our revolutionary hydrogen assist fuel system but will also possess an energy efficient air conditioning system along with impressive horsepower to weight ratios
8412612 our decision to produce this limited line of scorpion hx models comes directly from our enthusiastic customers
8412613 our standard scorpion model has been well received by the public and demand for an eco exotic of the scorpions caliber is extremely high therefore ronn motor company decided to put the plans in place for the scorpion hx well ahead of our planned schedule
8412614 prolactin induced increase in neural stem cell numbers and therapeutical use thereof
8412615 we were very pleased to begin recruiting patients for the regenesis phase iib stroke trial in may of this year however site initiation and patient enrollment have been slower to date than anticipated as a result we are looking to do a portion of the trial in india if we are successful in this regard then we may be able to meet our milestone of completing enrolment in the phase iib clinical stroke trial by the end of this year
8412616 following last year when our principal concern was not having enough water stored to sustain operations through the dry seasons this year we have had to deal with a very wet summer that was topped off by a very high rainfall event over the past few days
8412617 big creek which crosses our mine access road rose over two metres in 24 hours and overtopped protective dykes designed to keep water off the road during flood conditions temporarily affecting road access to the mine the klondike highway was also closed between carmacks and whitehorse due to flooding water levels are now receding and access is expected to be restored within two days
8412618 in addition excessive run off from the hills surrounding the minto mine quickly filled the water storage pond where water levels despite diverting as much run off as possible into the lower benches of the open pit which are not currently being mined rose half a metre in eight hours in order to manage its water resources we applied for and received from the yukon water board an amendment to our water licence to discharge excess stored water it is important to note that the stored water is non toxic to aquatic organisms and while slightly above discharge levels set in mintos water licence is considerably below federal standards for discharge set out in the metal mining effluent regulations further this is not a discharge from a tailings pond since the minto mine uses the dry stack tailings storage method where tailings are mechanically dried and stored in a compacted storage facility and therefore the mine has no tailings pond
8412619 and despite meeting the cost down demands of its customers the company has decided to let 80 workers go
8412620 we need better trade and industry policies to ensure that redundancies like these do not continue to occur
8412621 ten years ago pbr bosch employed over 1200 workers it now employs half that that is a direct effect of the 10 years of neglect by the former government that saw 50 000 jobs lost from the manufacturing sector
8412622 she is female which addresses the novelty of the opposition she is smart and well respected she is knowledgeable on key issues especially domestic policy
8412623 shes been around for decades and is not going to start making mistakes now
8412624 her nomination would be a signal to american women that mccain takes their aspirations seriously even if obama does not hutchison is not charismatic but her circumstances would be if she were nominated the prospect of a woman vice president would electrify women throughout the nation
8412625 she has clearly set her sights on governor and looks at that as the way she wants to complete her long and distinguished career of public service
8412626 the conservatives could probably stomach hutchison a lot better than a tom ridge or joe lieberman
8412627 she is a woman and their strategy seems to be to go for disaffected clinton voters but i would say this is more like the chet edwards boomlet it raises the profile there is no downside to being mentioned but hutchison at this point looks like a last minute ploy not a considered judgment

8412629 its going to kind of be like listening to coach shoop through him because hes going to be talking directly to him and hes going to be giving us the signals yates said
8412630 its going to be a little different when i get off the field because im going to have to put on the headphones and talk to shoop instead of sitting next to him and talk to him
8412631 he wont be out there to coach us up on every little thing so well have to prepare more and be more focused and confident as a whole in our offense
8412632 all of the places i had ever coached before the coordinators were in the box davis said
8412633 it not only gives them the chance to see the field better see personnel groupings it cuts down one extra communication to someone in the box to someone on the sidelines to identify what the other teams personnel what theyre getting into its a little bit more of a quiet environment to collect your thoughts youre not quite in all the chaos
8412634 i was proud of him when he qualified for the olympics
8412635 the medal was a bonus the icing on the cake
8412636 medal or no medal he made it to the olympics and its tough to make it to the olympics in boxing because you have to qualify
8412637 he played really well at the start of the year and hasnt had too much success lately but he is a tricky serve volley lefty
8412638 i played him once before in metz and won quite comfortably but i think hes playing a bit better than he was when i beat him

8412659 president bush can start to reverse the u s and the wests carteresque response to russias subjugation of georgia by strengthening the u s dollar in 2004 the weak dollar triggered a global commodities boom just as it did in the 1970s major commodity producing countries such as russia have since received revenue windfalls of hundreds of billions of dollars the higher the price of oil the more assertive moscow has become in its foreign policy in 1981 ronald reagan fearlessly attacked a rise in inflation far worse than the current one he succeeded the dollar was strengthened and interest rates came tumbling down then sky high oil prices tumbled from almost 40 a barrel to 10 by the mid 1980s that precipitous fall in oil was a critical and utterly unappreciated factor in the soviet unions collapse mikhail gorbachev ascended to power with the vigorous support of hard liners starved for hard currency he turned to such liberalizations as glasnost and perestroika out of desperation not principle strengthening the dollar with reaganesque determination would send oil to the 40 to 50 per barrel range at the same time the u s and its allies could start putting restrictions on russian oligarch held bank accounts in europe and here

8412662 while the us economy has avoided recession to date the major economies are experiencing a generalized slowdown weaker demand in the major economies coupled with the need to contain inflationary pressures will dampen growth in the fast growing asia economies
8412663 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8412664 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8412665 we dont want to give the message that there are no connections
8412666 so you spent this time posting this info instead of taking the time to sign up for the sffl
8412667 it seems there are a few of us jeff turners around
8412668 i know this will break your heart but you have better credentials than the mainstream media does
8412669 in 2004 the state party wouldnt even return my calls theyve shown us a lot of faith and innovation to be letting us do what were doing
8412670 part of what this convention is about is making sure people know who is
8412671 blogging widens the participation it lowers the barrier to entry so we dont have to worry about one persons bias serving as a gatekeeper
8412672 i say with every fiber of my being i believe we cannot as a nation stand for four more years of this
8412673 the normal political thing to do in terms of the best decision to make to win wouldve been to pick hillary clinton
8412674 it is a no brainer she got 18 million votes joe got 9 000 votes
8412675 he understands both the economic stresses here at home and the strategic challenges abroad he is pragmatic tough and wise
8412676 my opponent will tell you that ive been a democrat all my life which is very untrue for nine years over half my voting life ive been a republican but he wont tell you that
8412677 the fact is ive been a republican half my voting life
8412678 unfortunately i did not complete the voter registration paperwork to make this switch official i hope this clarifies any confusion about my party past
8412679 we have a legitimate concern that they will go to no stops to destroy tony i will be honest as tonys wife that i am scared about what they will do i know that we all have busy lives but i wouldnt ask unless i had a real need here we must join around tony here please let me know if you can be there physically tony is a man of great character and faith and we need to make it clear that he has a lot of supporters and wont be bullied by white supremacists
8412680 calling the elected grassroots party workers the precinct committeemen crazy people and white supremacists is an outrage this woman is as big a liar as her husband is and just how many meetings has she attended have either of them ever been elected as pcs of course not unless it was in the democrat party
8412681 if they think republicans are bigots why didnt he run as the democrat he has always been only because the district is predominantly gop this is a scam from beginning to end a scam built on lies
8412682 unbelievable ive been a precinct committeeman since i was eighteen i have never seen such underhanded and unethical behavior even from democrats i hope that the party sanctions those responsible for these actions
8412683 what in the hell is this woman talking about white supremacists at the republican district meetings no district meetings ive ever attended had any such agenda
8412684 her husband tony bouie has been outed as a lifelong democrat who registered as a republican five days before announcing his intention to run for the state legislature in a predominantly gop district
8412685 where are the party leaders why are bouie and his wife allowed to make such unfounded allegations against the backbone of the arizona republican party i am disgusted by the bouies but the party officials and those who have endorsed this con man need to step forward and give this affront the official spray of antiseptic it needs
8412686 john shadegg pamela gorman jim waring endorce tony bouie are they comfortable about the general
8412687 i used to think kevin gibbons was as low as it could get wow calling ld6 republican pcs white supremacists and racists because they chose to back genuine republican candidates is a brand new low
8412688 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
8412689 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
8412690 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
8412691 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
8412692 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
8412693 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
8412694 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
8412695 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
8412696 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
8412697 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
8412698 no philadelphia quartet deals with whiskey nights and stark urbanity like they do that attitude seeps through the pores of guitarist pete rydberg bassist brian murray and drummer rob giglio even when raging through beretta76s thickest wordless passages but throw in sex beauty queens one hour stands attitude y princesses more sex old rock scribes throwing dismal dinner parties and even more sex theres a woman wrapped in a cobra on the cover for a reason hoss make it blunt unprissy immediate pissed off melodic and raw rocking without lacking in precision toss in the punch of power pop and the cutting clarion foxiness of singer and guitarist camille escobedo its a brutal beauty you got in your hands its a record that hones their acerbic agit power pop into something thats sleek tender taut and tough without ever embracing rock from a feminist aspect
8412699 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8412700 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8412701 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way

8412706 when i got the call i was just so incredibly excited i got chills up and down my spine ever since then ive been pretty much just floating on air and i really feel like my grandparents are kind of shining down on me
8412707 to me age just means so much because my grandfather was 70 when i was born and he was a huge influence on my life and the wisdom that comes from people in their 70s is just amazing i like him mccain obviously because hes a war hero but because he is a war hero and had all of these horrendous things happen to him he doesnt want war i think he can help bring the world to peace through strength
8412708 but mccain is a special person this is probably the last time ill get a chance to help get someone nominated who can make a difference in the world this is the guy for the time

8412711 there will be substantive issues dealt with at this convention and i think thats important when you look at the situations facing the world right now with georgia and russia with the middle east the energy issues that we are facing this is not a time for a party this is a time for real leadership and thoughtful leadership on very important very far reaching impactful issues
8412712 the convention for me isnt about going to a convention
8412713 its about engaging in the political process engaging in your civic duty thats one of the reasons i feel this is important its just kind of the character of who i am and who my family is we engage we dont sit on the sidelines and complain we see issues and we get involved and try to work to make them better

8412792 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources

8412796 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military

8412800 i didnt do anything differently except this is the only time that i have competed only for that competition
8412801 everything else i have done has been a qualifier or a test or something else for the olympics this time it was really i am only doing this lift for today and nothing else it was kind of a weird feeling but i dont know that it was negative or positive it was just different
8412802 i am just really lucky to have had the support from the yukon community
8412803 when i missed lifts at the gold rush inn for julys northwestel test event people where cheering so much thats what i thought of when i missed 105 kg like it doesnt matter people only want me to succeed they are not going to judge me if i fail so thats how i tried to see it the whole time

8412817 the best scientific evidence is that product testing does not add any value to your ability to assess the risk of listeria being in the product
8412818 im not a scientist but you can sit down with a statistician to understand that if you would go out and take 10 samples from the haystack its likely you wont find the needle
8412819 no matter how many times you walk out and pull out a sample
8412820 statistically the vast majority of times youll get a negative result even though its positive
8412821 this week its our best efforts that failed not the regulators or the canadian food safety system

8412830 this case is not about iraq and whether you support or oppose the war

8412838 i support barack obama because america needs a president with the strength wisdom and courage to talk with our enemies and consult with our allies

8412845 our players earned this victory this is a big day for us its like we won the champions league tonight
8412846 when it was 0 0 at half time it was looking good for us
8412847 we couldnt stay calm and that hurt us this is a difficult moment for us

8412860 each one of the coaches brings such a wealth of knowledge to the table and for a young coach to obviously be around coach k every day is an amazing opportunity
8412861 but to be around some of the other top coaches in the world and be able to pick their brains and learn the game through their eyes is just a wonderful opportunity
8412862 doing those two things at the same time afforded me an amazing opportunity to grow
8412863 throughout this time there have been sometimes articles you should do this you shouldnt theres no way that i shouldnt have done this for duke for me for our country for the kids i coach im a better coach to them a better person as a result and when i was coaching them it was that we didnt go to the ncaa final four during the last two years because we had two young teams and we got beat all of a sudden theres a reason shame on you you dont do that thats wrong the people who wrote about those things they were wrong

8412882 was so laughably low the editor who interviewed me made no secret that the paper wanted to hire a female critic but clearly what the joint really wanted was a cheap date

8412928 the really tough part figuring out how to blame suicide attacks on america when they dont occur in iraq i know im not supposed to say this and upset harps groove but if people are willing to slaughter their fellow citizens because american troops are in country im thinking they would probably be willing to do for other reasons you get a d in basic logic

8412955 el cristianismo est debe estar totalmente comprometido con la creaci n especial descrita en g nesis y los cristianos han de pelear con todas sus fuerzas contra la teor a evolucionista llega a estar claro que la vida y la muerte y resurrecci n corporal de jesucristo est n profetizadas en la existencia de ad n y la fruta prohibida que l y eva comieron sin pecado original qui n necesita ser redimido sin la ca da de ad n en una vida de pecado constante que termina con la muerte cu l es el prop sito del cristianismo ninguno
8412956 la selecci n es ciega y la forma m s cruel de evolucionar las especies nuevas y de m s organismos complejos refinados
8412957 no hay fundamento para suponer que la materia y la energ a existieron antes y de repente se galvanizaron en acci n qu podr a distinguir ese momento de cualquier otro momento en la eternidad es m s simple postular la creaci n ex nihilo creaci n de la nada la divinidad constituir a la naturaleza de la nada
8412958 nunca asever tan absurda proposici n de que cualquier cosa puede surgir sin causa
8412959 si el ojo humano es fruto del azar tambi n puede serlo un telescopio

8412967 rechazo la teor a de la evoluci n porque considero que es obsoleta porque el conocimiento de anatom a histolog a cistolog a y embriolog a obtenido con dificultad desde 1830 en diciembre de 1831 darwin zarp a bordo del beagle no puede ser armonizado con su idea b sica si el amor por los cuentos de hadas y las novelillas no estuviese tan arraigado en el coraz n de los hombres el fant stico edificio sin fundamento que es la doctrina gr dogma de la evoluci n hace mucho tiempo que habr a encontrado el destino que merece

8413007 samanthas a control freak and shes using lindsay to further her career lindsays been sold out by so many people in the past sam would just be another name on the list
8413008 feeding lindsay alcohol behind the scenes but thats really lindsays fault for taking it its not about drugs or alcohol a person can be a drug and sam is a drug shes very controlling and manipulative and its not a healthy relationship for lindsay
8413009 i blame a lot of lindsays problems on dina shes two faced and plays both sides of the coin she tells me its important to get sam out of lindsays life and then she turns around and has dinner with them
8413010 thats not the reason at all lindsay is fragile and sam takes advantage of her and the relationship is too intense and too dramatic sam and dina are probably the two worst people lindsay could be around right now along with her friend patrick as long as sams in lindsays life lindsay will never be able to reach the potential god gave her
8413011 its not about sam giving lindsay drugs or alcohol or anything there are prescription drugs from doctors psychotropic drugs antidepressants that have a serious effect on a person and i would like to put that out there these things can mess with a persons mind i see some parallels between britney and lindsay the instability the domineering companion lindsays not in the state that britney was or is but there are minor similarities just because a persons not abusing drugs or alcohol doesnt mean theyre healthy and lindsay being with sam is making matters worse i would sacrifice my own life to get sam out of lindsays

8413030 we need to be doing more for troops and their families

8413038 if we keep accelerating the rate at which we are able to save these very little babies we are likely to see more cases of cerebral palsy in which case we havent saved them neurologically

8413040 its not a new medication or one that isnt already widely used
8413041 we probably give magnesium sulfate to 100 women to prevent one seizure

8413045 toots magsinos work is compelling and vaguely reminiscent of an intimate diary on the nature of existence it is both a courageous and daring act to risk personal revelation

8413048 i liked the schools system of providing students a lot of space to discover their own artistic sensibilities
8413049 leatrice took me under her wings and helped me discover my very own artistic voice i owe much of what ive learned technically and aesthetically from her astute artistic sense
8413050 this show allowed me to share a more intimate side of my art with a theme that touched on my experiences as an artist

8413107 the ageing of the population will pose particular problems for workforce participation and productivity at an industry level skills shortages will be exacerbated over the next decade as large numbers of experienced workers retire for the overall economy as the population ages there is a risk that the rate of participation in the workforce will fall reducing output and productivity

8413122 we are currently notifying all participating clinical trial sites and regulatory agencies that enrollment of new patients into vital 2 has been suspended as has treatment with gvax immunotherapy for prostate cancer of patients enrolled in the study
8413123 current news of gvax vital 2 phase 3 trial termination makes future development of the gvax prostate uncertain and adds additional developmental risk
8413124 we believe that there may be limited new news from the pipeline to provide catalysts for increased stock valuation until final data of vital 1 expected in the second half of 2009

8413158 the illegal recruitment and trafficking of filipino women to malaysia is fast becoming a thriving enterprise and we call on the malaysian and philippine governments to forge a bilateral pact against human trafficking
8413159 with mere p3 000 the recruiter turns a blind eye on whatever fate awaits the recruit bound for malaysia
8413160 the recruitment is now done door to door in both urban and rural areas and the only way to stop this is through active public vigilance leading to higher arrest and conviction rates
8413161 its a script that my company red hour got that was written as a live action movie but we thought it would work as an animated movie so we brought it to jeffrey katzenberg and now were in pre production
8413162 im in it and robert downey jr plays an evil superhero villain basically its about a bad guy who loses to the good guy that hes fighting all the time so he has to create another good guy for him to fight
8413163 a building coming to life as an entirety the more it glows the more it has that self maintaining fire and when that building is on fire it becomes a part of nature like ocean waves or blades of grass its parts are governed by the endless play of repetition and variety created in the presence of the fact that all things pass

8413168 he was telling stories of his early days at the royal shakespeare theatre but some of the regulars didnt recognise him
8413169 we take inner city kids and put them through a six week course in filmmaking
8413170 we were able to take some of the students and have them work on this major film it was incredible
8413171 i called jason out he looks nice on camera in all of his movies you know driving fast cars blowing up the directors and all that
8413172 hes like this big rock star but lets take it to the freeway for real
8413173 racing is what i do in the streets for real
8413174 animals too are gods creatures degrading them to a commodity seems to me in fact to contradict the relationship of mutuality that comes across in the bible
8413175 bla bla put up some sentimental financial story here if you intend some financial gain
8413176 its clear to our more than 300 video id partners that our technology has created a framework that allows copyright holders to sanction the creativity of their biggest fans
8413177 these partners now have a new way to successfully distribute and market their content online
8413178 the second big media companies say yes to profiting from those clips this way it will make it hard for them to argue that isps should be forced to screen for unauthorized material its hard to make that argument when youre re being compensated
8413179 several start ups are working on technology that will track unauthorized videos wherever they exist on the web and then insert an advertisement into the clips
8413180 i feel your face against my shoulder breath upon my skin embers barely smoldered i make love to you again
8413181 after she sang her part on the song she looked into my dads video camera and said well jessica sang her butt off i sang my butt off so now were two blondes with no asses
8413182 we can pull levers on voting machines and talk into microphones at hearings
8413183 but dont worry theyre not connected to anything and nobodys listening cept us
8413184 she goes to cardinal glennon in st louis every six months for an echocardiogram
8413185 the doctors say she could grow out of it but her aorta is narrowing as she grows and thats not good shell probably have to have more surgery
8413186 when she was just about five days old she was very fussy
8413187 nobody knew what was wrong with her at the time but i would hold her and rock her and try to quiet her i started singing to help calm her down
8413188 one day she told me she wished she could meet the lady that sang that song
8413189 we drove a rental car provided by make a wish from knoxville to pigeon forge
8413190 later we got to see her in concert and she dedicated that song to brooklynn
8413191 he supports making the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts permanent understands the importance of farm programs the need to expand trade the urgency of funding to rebuild the locks and dams on the illinois and mississippi rivers and will vote to expand domestic supplies of energy including renewable fuels
8413192 w ere going to be out there in full force not necessarily to write tickets but to make sure people get to and from their destinations safely
8413193 we want everyone to obey the speed limit wear their seat belt and give themselves plenty of time to travel with high volume of traffic
8413194 all flesh is like grass and all its glory like the flower of grass the grass withers and the flower falls but the word of the lord remains forever
8413195 we must fight for the title this doesnt mean that we cannot lose but we certainly must be in contention until the last day of the campaign
8413196 now i have returned home i will not look back anymore but forward
8413197 i want to start again i hope that the injuries i had in recent seasons wont be repeated but here i have everything to do well and it depends only on me
8413198 my team is proving to be psychologically really strong and tactically compact
8413199 it s going to be beautiful challenging and we must be ready from the first game against fiorentina
8413200 everyone was asking me before what it was going to be like i was like i dont know i havent talked to her in 10 or 15 years i had that tension and i started to let it get to me is she going to be nice is it going to be a bad environment but when i saw her everything was fine
8413201 i think when youre 18 your personalities conflict then you meet up 10 or 15 years later and the playing ground is totally different and youre fine
8413202 it let me find a little bit of peace and discover who i was as a person
8413203 not the person who the press made me out to be because id had a few bad experiences in my personal life and i was struggling to figure out a bad husband or a bad boyfriend and i was doing it under the spotlight so i wasnt reacting well to any of it
8413204 i dont think we ever hit each other scratching im not going to deny that
8413205 all those people who wrote the i hate brenda newsletter are going to get mad at me now like why are you leaving your child with brenda
8413206 tell me what democracy looks like this is what democracy looks like
8413207 i just cant imagine driving through my neighborhood at home and seeing a security checkpoint
8413208 you want to drive people to the internet and give them more information on the internet and then bring them back to the network
8413209 i think it shows that viewers want to be able to access content where and when they want it and that wont hurt television numbers
8413210 i think the 2008 summer olympics is certainly the first games in canada anyhow that we were able to really take advantage of mobile television
8413211 its also the type of event thats perfect for this platform it goes on all day and you may have a particular sport that you follow and you can pop in and get what you need and pull back out again its great to have this on demand or a live broadcast streaming this kind of content
8413212 i think we were able to take the olympic viewing out of your home and you could take it with you
8413213 the evidence is mostly indicative of what your canadian broadcasting company found is that it does help rather cannibalize the tv audience
8413214 i dont think the technology is ready i dont think consumers are aware of it either
8413215 from what weve seen were pleased to see the consumer enthusiasm for mobile olympic coverage
8413216 were sharing the data with clients to reveal just how those consumers leveraged mobile this games
8413217 i think one day ill be able to meet him and michelle i just dont think its going to be this week
8413218 this song is a pointed attack at people who call themselves christians but act anything far from it
8413219 give me my tax cut for producing violent hateful porno movies or ill call you a nazi forever
8413220 c stato qualche contatto ora stanno parlando con il mio procuratore franco zavaglia e lui che mantiene i contatti con le societ che una grande squadra come ludinese mi cerchi una cosa che fa piacere
8413221 bisogna chiedere al procuratore perch lui che vaglia le opportunit qualcuna di a e qualcuna di b
8413222 s potevo rimanere l ma visto che il mio contratto per la serie b era oneroso abbiamo deciso consensualmente di rescinderlo
8413223 la stagione non andata benissimo giacch s conclusa con la nostra retrocessione io arrivavo da un infortunio importante che ora ho superato e parlando con il livorno abbiamo preferito cambiare
8413224 ha mantenuto la rosa dellanno scorso ha nellattacco il suo punto di forza e ha acquistato un mister molto bravo come acori diciamo che punta alla vittoria e secondo me parte in pole
8413225 la societ dalla famiglia pozzo a leonardi puntano sui giovani e ogni anno ne lanciano tre o quattro sono ottimi talent scount
8413226 queste cose non fanno bene alla squadra perch il gruppo fondamentale servono 20 30 giocatori con molta intesa e una cosa che risolveranno per non un buon momento
8413227 io ho conosciuto il presidente perch lultimo anno mio stato il primo suo e uno che vuole accentrare tutto nelle sue mani ora sta facendo bene visto che la squadra buona
8413228 come detto prima fa bene da tanti anni e una societ di prestigio
8413229 servirebbero pi italiani nelle squadre dovrebbe esserci un tetto ad almeno 5
8413230 alla fine laccordo si trover per strano che si ritrovi sempre allultimo giorno per decidere
8413231 inter milan e juve hanno una marcia in pi la quarta se la giocano roma e fiorentina
8413232 dipende dallopportunit lanno scorso sono andato a livorno in a perch pensavo fosse una scelta giusta limportante il progetto sia in a sia in b
8413233 this contest is the perfect complement to w network with a significant portion of our prime time schedule already dedicated to programming featuring w networks roster of talented experts the w expert search is a great way to find new and undiscovered talent and build on this pool of expertise
8413234 we feel that this is a low risk exposure but we want to be aggressive about identifying any potential contacts
8413235 new fda regulations and current indian policies do not specify any maximum acceptable concentrations or daily dose limits for metals in dietary supplements for domestic use
8413236 we suggest strictly enforced government mandated daily dose limits for toxic metals in all dietary supplements and requirements that all manufacturers demonstrate compliance through independent third party testing
8413237 thursday thirteen 46 thirteen things im way excited to receive as wedding gifts
8413238 the fact that all these exchanges are in the public domain is not helping us and harms our attempts to find a solution to this affair
8413239 the more the dossier remains confidential the more likely it will come to a successful conclusion
8413240 so for the moment christian lariepe is the coach assisted by vincent rautureau until we find a new coaching team
8413241 we indicated yesterday tuesday that contacts had been struck up with alain perrin
8413242 my heart goes out to phyllis lyon for the loss of del martin her soul
8413243 along with phyllis del was a courageous civil rights pioneer from co
8413244 she helped to lay the groundwork for much of the progress we have enjoyed
8413245 on a personal note del made an invaluable difference in my life in 1979
8413246 at the moment we owe something to our fans but we can and we must give a lot more and thats what we are working on
8413247 i have no doubt in my mind that tottenham are capable of beating any team and on sunday we are going for the three points
8413248 chelsea are a great team but we also have a very solid base the lads are working well and we have to forget about our anxieties and simply do what we have shown we are all capable of doing footballers and coaching staff alike
8413249 we didnt deserve to win but we were in shape to win in both games
8413250 we didnt but we dont have to panic nothing changes because the quality is still here although obviously its not a good situation
8413251 we now need to focus on chelsea and this week has been about reinforcing the positive things and not being negative
8413252 knowing that the day after we took the initial vote that that would be the penalty for following through with the veto override and the six of us all went in kind of with our eyes opened and we needed to decide whether we thought our leadership position was more important than our roads for me personally it was the 13 people that died in the i35w bridge collapse and the transportation system for our state and i said you know im willing to give up my leadership role in the caucus in order to do something that i believe is right for our state and then so all six of us voted to override the governor along with the 85 democrats that was enough to get that through then despite the governors veto
8413253 that was a severe mistake very very severe mistake and what happened out of that is the enormous partisanship that we have today to break that partisanship that we have today we need to go back to a non partisan legislature i was wrong i voted wrong to convince the people to change the minnesota constitution to a partisan legislature
8413254 the minneapolis park system is world famous but it didnt just happen
8413255 almost no one realizes what a central impact the formation and building of this system has had on minnesota
8413256 at its root was a gigantic real estate scheme but the people who planned and launched our park system also valued being good stewards of the earth thinking ahead 100 years preserving the natural beauty of minneapolis for future generations and making parks available and accessible to everyone the minneapolis park system is a model for coordinating public and private interests in the political process this model has given shape to the entire political history of the state our park system is a big reason for why the media are reporting that the republican national convention is in minneapolis not saint paul
8413257 we thought if we gave people something fun to do then maybe they will forget about the difficult economy
8413258 i am extremely disappointed in not being able to continue in my position on icos board of directors as i think very highly of the management and people at ico and i believe the company has a bright future unfortunately i believe my ability to serve as an ico board member would be limited due to conflicts with other business and personal commitments

8413261 when i heard that dynamo were serious i spoke to pim about it and he said that it would be a good move
8413262 he has been to the club knew a lot about it and there are dutch coaches involved in the youth coaching set up here
8413263 it was important to get pims opinion because not only did he have insight into the club and the russian league but we have an important time coming up with the national team and his opinion on how that would work was very important
8413264 things change quickly and things happen quickly i heard of dynamos interest and came over here to have a look at things and it was very exciting
8413265 they have fantastic facilities some of the best that i have ever seen anywhere russia showed at the euros this year how they are developing and it is an exciting time to be involved
8413266 i was disappointed to hear what he said because he out of everyone should know how football works
8413267 i had a great time at twente and it was sad to leave the club is truly like a second family to me so it was not an easy decision

8413286 the important thing for me is to feel valued im grateful for the effort they made to keep me and it meant i didnt need to think the matter over much it didnt take long to reach this decision which i believe is the right one
8413287 any player is happy to hear a club is interested in them but when negotiations started with villarreal everything was very simple and real madrid were always in the background
8413288 im happy here and thats the most important thing i want to grow here and be a part of this teams growth for many years

8413297 russias decision has called into question its commitment to peace and security in the caucasus
8413298 we deplore russias excessive use of military force in georgia and its continued occupation of parts of georgia

8413308 el reconocimiento de los rostros lo logran sin esfuerzo personas de todas las diferentes culturas y por ello se consideraba como un mecanismo universal entre los humanos
8413309 sin embargo el uso de una novedosa tecnolog a de imagen cerebral ha permitido el descubrimiento de que las diferencias culturales causan que miremos a los rostros de manera distinta
8413310 demuestran que el procesamiento de rostros no puede considerarse como algo que surge de una serie universal de eventos perceptuales
8413311 la estrategia empleada para extraer informaci n visual de los rostros difiere con las culturas
8413312 en una serie de estudios del movimiento de los ojos mostramos que la experiencia social tiene un impacto sobre la forma en que las personas miran a los rostros
8413313 espec ficamente notamos una gran diferencia en los movimientos de los observadores occidentales y los del este de asia
8413314 encontramos que los occidentales tienden a mirar rasgos espec ficos en el rostro de un individuo tales como los ojos o la boca
8413315 los observadores del este de asia tienden a enfocarse en la nariz o el centro de la cara lo cual da una visi n m s general de todos los rasgos
8413316 el excesivo contacto directo de ojos puede considerarse rudo en las culturas de asia oriental
8413317 brinda nuevos elementos para entender por qu la comunicaci n no verbal entre personas de culturas diferentes a veces es problem tica
8413318 we are solidly together but there are no plans to marry
8413319 the california legislature has approved a bill with important though limited reforms this year
8413320 while it doesnt do everything needed to protect consumers going forward it represents a positive step to help california borrowers and mortgage markets now the ball is in gov schwarzeneggers court
8413321 this is the most important mortgage market reform bill the legislature has sent to the governor
8413322 his signature on this modest bill should be a slam dunk
8413323 the new broker duties should help ensure that california mortgage brokers are looking out for the best loans for borrowers not with fattening their wallets
8413324 we hope the legislature and governor will move next year to finish the job of making the subprime and nontraditional mortgage markets safe for borrowers
8413325 i am so surprised to hear that question that is honestly the first time ive been asked that question

8413376 i am very happy that i was able to finish first at wcg germany before the games started i was under pressure because i was one of the favorites and my personal goal was to make the grand final in the first match i had to beat mossos i knew mossos did not expect to win the match but this was dangerous for me because he had nothing to lose i beat mossos in two games and then met deto in the following round i have never beaten deto in a important match and i knew that it will be a hard match finally we had to go in penalty shoot out and i came out the lucky one in the 3rd round i got zooky and i was very concentrated because this game decided who gets the ticket for the grand final after losing the first match i refused to give up and i won the next two games which got qualified and very satisfied in the overall final i had to beat bvbstar two times and after five games i was the winner of the wcg national finals

8413412 with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8413413 senator clinton moves that we nominate barack obama by acclamation is there a second all in favor of nominating by acclamation
8413414 i support barack obama because america needs a president who has the strength wisdom and courage to talk to our enemies and consult with our allies a president who has the judgment to use war as a last resort not a first resort
8413415 the time has come for a president who has lived the american dream who is on our side a president who will cut our dependence on foreign oil and lead us into the new energy frontier a president who will make us stronger and safer as americans
8413416 no matter where we stood at the beginning of this campaign democrats stand together today we believe passionately in barack obamas message of changing the direction of our country we support enthusiastically his plans to restore the american dream for american families and we stand united proudly in our determination to elect barack obama

8413429 i believe the person probably died of massive trauma but thatll be determined in the next day or two from the post mortem
8413430 the rally from 1 4631 is in 3 waves as is the decline from 1 4908 these waves are most likely waves a and b of either a flat or triangle yes wave b can come under the origin of a in a triangle the path for the next few days should be higher in wave c of either the triangle or flat
8413431 it is also possible that a temporary low is in place at 8493 as the drop from 8813 could be a leg of a triangle or flat similar to the eur gbp and chf
8413432 the nzdusd rally from 6824 and decline from 7215 are either waves a and b of a flat or triangle the short term direction is most likely up until at least 71 in wave c of a triangle in the case of a flat price would exceed 7215 before rolling over
8413433 yellowstone is located atop of one of the few large volcanic hotspots on earth
8413434 but though the hot material is a volcanic plume its cooler than others of its kind such as one in hawaii
8413435 although yellowstone sits above a plume of hot material coming up from deep with the earth its a remarkably lukewarm plume
8413436 it would be a mistake to write off yellowstone as a dead volcano a hot plume even a slightly cooler one is still hot
8413437 although it is relatively rare to find the eggs and babies of extinct animals it is even rarer to find them inside the body of the mother
8413438 the turtle specimen was partly broken when it was first discovered it is this fortuitous break that revealed that the fossil was a mother
8413439 based on these fossils we have determined that the ancestor of living hidden necked turtles which are most of todays turtles and tortoises laid a large number of eggs and had hard rigid shells
8413440 the fat cells we found in our obese patients were deficient in several areas

8413443 data centers will soon be hit with a perfect storm in terms of coal and natural gas driven utility cost increases coupled with the new carbon caps these sites already have energy densities that are ten times greater than that of commercial office buildings and their energy use is doubling every four years the combination of rising energy usage coupled with significant electricity price increases and carbon caps creates a very troubling picture for data centers
8413444 colocation facilities in particular need to be able to provide each customer with the ability to manage their own energy and carbon usage and to provide a system to bill back customers appropriately
8413445 trendpoint has seen that virtualized servers generate significantly more heat visa vis the under utilized machines and therefore need careful attention with their cooling management without proper cooling virtualized servers like all highly utilized systems can develop server thermal inversions within a data cabinet

8413447 obamas not my cup of tea but ill vote for him for the partys sake
8413448 the older people are just not that into obama because hes black
8413449 the democrats have to wake up and smell the coffee
8413450 they need to know theres a new man in town
8413451 just to be part of the process of electing what i hope is going to be the next president of the united states is just a tremendous honor for me
8413452 when i got the call i was just so incredibly excited i got chills up and down my spine ever since then ive been pretty much just floating on air and i really feel like my grandparents are kind of shining down on me
8413453 to me age just means so much because my grandfather was 70 when i was born and he was a huge influence on my life and the wisdom that comes from people in their 70s is just amazing i like him mccain obviously because hes a war hero but because he is a war hero and had all of these horrendous things happen to him he doesnt want war i think he can help bring the world to peace through strength
8413454 but mccain is a special person this is probably the last time ill get a chance to help get someone nominated who can make a difference in the world this is the guy for the time
8413455 any disharmony in the democratic party works in our favor
8413456 is just an opportunity for the larger audience the larger national and international audience to see the kind of leader he would be and the vision he has for america
8413457 there will be substantive issues dealt with at this convention and i think thats important when you look at the situations facing the world right now with georgia and russia with the middle east the energy issues that we are facing this is not a time for a party this is a time for real leadership and thoughtful leadership on very important very far reaching impactful issues
8413458 the convention for me isnt about going to a convention
8413459 its about engaging in the political process engaging in your civic duty thats one of the reasons i feel this is important its just kind of the character of who i am and who my family is we engage we dont sit on the sidelines and complain we see issues and we get involved and try to work to make them better
8413460 id have to say no because hollywood has not seen a lot of return on movies like that its a spy thriller and is set against that backdrop it actually has interesting ideas and is thought provoking
8413461 more and more were seeing people willing to take that on and really bust that idea out but this one doesnt really do that it kind of tiptoes around it instead of taking it on fully i dont think our movie really does it has elements that get into it
8413462 not on our watch the mission to end genocide in darfur and beyond
8413463 i had been doing other things prior to hotel rwanda but nothing on the level of activism
8413464 what drew me in after i was done with that movie i was asked to go on a congressional delegation to sudan once i did that i kind of got pulled into the stream
8413465 he met with several of us about seven of us
8413466 he wanted to sort of get our opinion on what he should do but nobody tells spielberg what to do
8413467 i think that would be one of the most difficult things with where we are at in that very few people in this country in the state department in the cia even speak arabic and who could ever infiltrate those organizations being so insular
8413468 your chances of making it in this business are very very slim its like wanting to be a professional basketball player as a dream even if you happen to be 6 foot 8 its an exceptionally long shot
8413469 it was never my way or the highway instead it was great having someone like him to talk to about where i was going with this story obviously he has so much experience writing that his opinion carries an awful lot of weight but it was never a forced thing
8413470 ninety percent of the stowaway was written by geno with me standing right next to him and helping along the way i helped to guide him on the pacing of the story and the growth of the characters
8413471 ive read everything about him since ive been able to read i know drizzt as much as anyone alive
8413472 fantasy is like an idealized reality and the core of fantasy is the one person can make a difference
8413473 the big difference is that this story is told from the perspective of a 12 year old we didnt tone down any of these scenes although we did tone down the violence theres more chase and less violence but we dont want to talk down to teens theyre pretty sharp
8413474 im going to teach him how to survive on the road what you really have to do is take pleasure in the people you are meeting
8413475 writing can be a tough gig whenever you do something in which you put yourself out there if that becomes the focus of your life you miss the point of living
8413476 youve really got to get the grounding of family and the things that are important in your life and make that your focus
8413477 to establish a program to support a transition to democracy in iraq
8413478 it should be the policy of the united states to support efforts to remove the regime headed by saddam hussein from power in iraq and to promote the emergence of a democratic government to replace that regime
8413479 iraqs search for weapons of mass destruction has proven impossible to deter and we should assume that it will continue for as long as saddam is in power
8413480 we have known for many years that saddam hussein is seeking and developing weapons of mass destruction
8413481 the crew is working with teams on the ground to eradicate the virus and look for actions to prevent that from happening in the future
8413482 you dont play the game to reach these milestones but it was nice news to receive after the game
8413483 to pass a great player like olivier magne is a fantastic achievement but ive got plenty of time and plenty of games ahead of me
8413484 my body is feeling really good at the moment and im enjoying the football im playing hopefully if the time comes id like to meet that mark
8413485 we are more focused on what we need to do and thats to prepare well for this match
8413486 theres no doubt the springboks will be hurting and good teams bounce back from that but hopefully they dont bounce back this weekend the confidence the boys gained from that game last weekend is good but we have to be mentally and physically fresh for this game
8413487 you can have faster reaction time at the breakdown than a bigger more physical guy
8413488 it works differently for different teams it works around the way the team is coached as well
8413489 the elvs have made it a bit more exciting for myself
8413490 i enjoy the faster more energetic game that it provides with the old laws it was very dynamic in the first four phases but this is a more unstructured type of game
8413491 thats a question that comes up every week the breakdown is an important part of the game it will definitely be an area we will take notice of
8413492 its always very physical at the breakdown theyve got big guys who can disrupt play in that area we definitely have to be on our game in terms of the breakdown work
8413493 cricket is australias favourite game and i am so honoured to be able to turn my passion for the sport into a professional career
8413494 i personally look forward to emulating sir donald in leaving the game in better shape for having been a part of it
8413495 universal flu vaccines that could either block uptake or generate a broad immune response against many flu strains at once
8413496 were carrying rocks and other items that could be used as weapons
8413497 were celebrating free speech as much as you can do it
8413498 but when a group looks like theyre bent on destruction and violence we have to step in
8413499 what do we do when we have a bar fight
8413500 we surround them and divide them and get them out of the bar
8413501 i dont see anybody dead i dont see anybody in the hospital
8413502 obviously were getting lost in the hype and the hoopla in the convention talking about issues at home finally but we need to readdress the war
8413503 barack obama will be a commander in chief who understands that young americans in uniform must never be committed to a mistake but always to a mission worthy of their bravery
8413504 the average american doesnt have ownership in the war in iraq the policy has been to go shopping health care the economy was well down on the list now the economy is number one
8413505 people are worried about the alligator closest to the canoe and the alligator closest to the canoe to most americans is the economy
8413506 when you talk about mccain you talk about a veteran
8413507 wouldnt be able to tell you for it security reasons
8413508 the show will be all new improved and definitely top drawer for 2009
8413509 its the place to come for everything that is hip hot and happening and of course to find green gifts for a sustainable future
8413510 with a re designed show in february 2009 we are poised for a new era in the life of the sfigf and will create the wave that others will ride
8413511 the sfigf continues its pattern of being a show where buyers can find new and unique product that will help them differentiate themselves from their competitors what better way to do that than to take a cue from our host city with a focus on san franciscos classic neighborhoods
8413512 south of market soma named after san franciscos iconic cultural district will bring focus to museum resources and the increasingly popular handcrafted markets
8413513 some people dont even know theyre dressed crazy but they are

8413516 i wasnt going to get one these guys got em
8413517 but then it was raining and i said theyre only ten bucks ill get one too
8413518 xp clients dont automatically have the extended roots in them to see ev ssl
8413519 the next time you visit that site or any ev ssl site certified by verisign youll see the green bar
8413520 our solution is called the auto enhancer and it installs with the ssl certificate itself
8413521 all that an e merchant or the person maintaining their website needs to do is install this auto enhancer code along with their ssl certificate from that point on any site visitor coming to their site will automatically see the green address bar from the very first time they come to their site
8413522 were the only site in the industry that works with one quick install code on the server
8413523 it installs and maintains just like an ssl certificate which means it doesnt require any changes to individual web pages
8413524 the other half of consumer education around understanding why the browsers are turning green
8413525 theyll say something like weve chosen to use ev ssl heres what it looks like and heres what it means
8413526 organizations going for the informal approach can lack structure in their environmental policies and this can affect the level of success that they achieve in reducing both energy costs and co2 emissions
8413527 while computers may drive efficiency the data centers that run businesses are often far from efficient
8413528 they are at the heart of environmental challenges created by it but the average retailer just does not have the necessary knowledge to bring about change they need specialist help and the actions we offer in our thought leadership initiatives are designed to illustrate how they can improve their carbon footprint and wider environmental position while also reducing operating costs and improving it service delivery
8413529 promise technology is very pleased to be a part of the green grid and its quest to improve overall data center efficiencies
8413530 as a major supplier of enterprise class raid solutions we hope to do our part to advance the innovations for improving energy savings in the data center as storage needs grow so do the requirements for green technologies to minimize our environmental footprint and it costs

8413582 last year i saw a newspaper article on the tech camp and checked out their web site
8413583 id had a lot of experience working with kids and was studying game design at wpi with a major in interactive media and game design when i went on their www internaldrive comweb site i viewed it as if i were a student coming to camp would i enjoy it i found it is a well set up camp with a beautiful web page
8413584 i really enjoyed it so i came back this year
8413585 id like to work for a game development company either nearby or in california or texas i could start as a programmer and work my way up to being a lead designer someday
8413586 when i first came here i expected to see narrowly focused kids
8413587 the truth is we have kids from all walks of life with all sorts of interests really into athletics and social activities theyre really a diverse group of individuals theyre what makes this all worth it
8413588 we tell them that people have already built just about every concept imaginable
8413589 we tell them lets build on it take it a step further
8413590 i wanted to make a fan page about this game im obsessed with
8413591 we do a lot of fun stuff besides making video games
8413592 its obvious the owners want it to be the best computer camp
8413593 we want the kids to be creative but at the same time there are measurable standards for every class
8413594 i think its really fun i like working with computers and we get lots of time to hang out
8413595 weve found that the girls in the camp are really creative
8413596 its like a jigsaw but the pieces can be molded to any shape you want
8413597 the programs are easy to work with and its fun to make maps
8413598 this week im making a web page and animating a character in flash

8413602 the best thing about the camp is that i like working with a partner to make an even cooler comic book
8413603 its fun to be able to create a web site its a lot of fun and its cool to see when you finish
8413604 its a hard balance but we manage to pull it off
8413605 this is a fun place to go and do what you like
8413606 its a lot different from some of the other computer camps you have freedom they give you guidelines but you can use your imagination
8413607 parece que foi ontem que entreguei minha vida ao senhor jesus cristo sendo chamado pelo esp rito santo para obedecer lhe e servir lhe como ele quisesse no entanto passaram se 57 anos desde que deus marcou a minha vida para sempre jamais sonhei que o senhor iria me oferecer a possibilidade de atingir tantas vidas para o seu reino

8413609 weve had one of the lowest rates in bexar county and probably around the state especially because of all the building programs that were doing and were able to fund that with just the 26 cents
8413610 one hundred years ago surgery was the only option to treat cancer but there are now a number of treatment options available with radiotherapy chemotherapy and hormone treatments well established and a variety of new types of treatment being tested
8413611 in the future we will better understand the disease have better treatments and be able to predict which treatment will be effective for a particular case we will also be able to better predict the risk of developing cancer increasing the scope for preventative surgery
8413612 its been a carefully spun campaign and this is the logical conclusion to the campaign by the police
8413613 we are also reminding the public and our staff of the vital importance of good hand hygiene for preventing the spread of this highly contagious illness
8413614 that means washing your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds and then drying them for 20 seconds
8413615 this is to ensure as a sector we all benefit from the experience gained through this event
8413616 mr key is going to need partners after the next election if he is going to form a government
8413617 we have supported both labour led and national led governments reliably we are ready to play that role once more in the interests of good and stable government
8413618 we have a new leader man we have a new captain on this ship
8413619 what hes done so far is taken an opportunity and made the most of it to say that i expected him to be this good id be lying to you

8413622 the gulf of mexico area has a large percentage of oil production and refining
8413623 when katrina hit it knocked out 8 percent of the refining capacity for supplies of retail gas to go down by 8 percent is a huge shock to the system
8413624 over the course of three or four days that type of hike was unheard of at the time
8413625 i dont think weve seen anything like that since gas has been high this summer but it was more of a gradual increase
8413626 more often than not if crude oil prices are going up oil companies will pre emptively raise gas prices to slow demand
8413627 oil companies dont like to scare off consumers if they can ease people into price hikes consumers are less likely to change their habits
8413628 weve seen gas prices come down significantly but its still high and supplies are tight its a bad time to have a hurricane on a holiday weekend
8413629 a lot of the growth that we have seen this year has been attributed to retention
8413630 we brought in the same number of new students but we are doing more to retain students
8413631 youll find stephens to be a fairly student centered place
8413632 we really work with them to stay through their program and graduate from stephens

8413643 on march 11 we arrived at the fulton county courthouse to have our world totally rearranged we witnessed a battle of good versus evil right versus wrong heaven versus hell
8413644 after we began to talk he said he thought that i was an angel sent from god and that i was his sister and he was my brother in christ and that he was lost and god led him right to me to tell him that he had hurt a lot people

8413648 we know that people with incomes that low are living in unsafe conditions
8413649 children probably are not getting enough healthy food to eat people may be living in shelters seniors are likely skipping dosages of medication to make ends meet
8413650 we know that many people are struggling harder and harder just to get by and more vulnerable people are turning to public services for help
8413651 this reinforces the need to strengthen our strained safety net and policymakers must pay attention to these startling figures

8413659 lisa open rates have some utility in measuring trends but only to a limited extent your prior
8413660 can you find another word that doesnt indicate a judgment
8413661 this is one experimental case that is indicative but there are many others
8413662 there is the possibility of creating designer drugs with this newly discovered information
8413663 these are models that conform to the point of view that the structures have been designed to exert very strong control of their motions
8413664 those motions correspond closely to the motions needed for their function
8413665 this is a promising new lead in the search for biological pathways that contribute to obesity
8413666 this finding may eventually lead to the development of new drugs to regulate appetite in people who have not had success with other treatments
8413667 tech camp sounds like an ideal opportunity for children to experiment with software that may be inaccessible to them
8413668 they can also work with experts in the field that may not be available in the regular school year and dedicate time to hone a new skill
8413669 because its at a university the child may decide to apply there
8413670 this is very fun its what i live for every year
8413671 we get to learn a skill that not a lot of people get to learn
8413672 its a great environment to teach in because theyre so eager to learn more
8413673 theres a lot more to developing a computer game than making one thing shoot at another
8413674 we want them to get a whole design with a story line plot beginning and end
8413675 most games that are 2 d are from old times
8413676 i didnt know anything about making video games before i came here
8413677 most students come back with a willingness to be open minded
8413678 after i make the game everybody gives me compliments about how much they like it
8413679 each child takes their own track and makes their own custom designed project
8413680 the spiders name is cirrus and hes fighting nimbus the demon im going to sell the idea to nintendo
8413681 but in the end youre responsible for what you do its always a trade off between freedom of expression and the public good
8413682 it gives the campers the change to live a college life and also experience being independent
8413683 the whole point of the camp is to show kids these are skills they can really use
8413684 its a rewarding experience teaching software to the next generation
8413685 a lot of them suffer writers block they dont know where to take their game so we give them a break to relax
8413686 the people are great the animation is pretty easy to do and its rewarding to see it online
8413687 i love id tech camp i was here last year and i loved it so much i came back and took it this year
8413688 im going to hang around and walk through the convention hall and shake as many hands as seem to be friendly
8413689 they say i got them into politics not the young ones of course
8413690 they invite us we wave everybody cheers we sit down

8413692 this is one of the most promising breakthroughs in the management of high risk pregnancies in more than 30 years
8413693 the active ingredient we used in this study magnesium sulfate is better known as epsom salt
8413694 and virtually every delivery room in the united states is already stocked with magnesium sulfate solutions that are given to pregnant women during childbirth for other reasons
8413695 so what we have learned from this study is that we have a cheap widely available treatment already in hand that cuts in half the risk of babies being born with an extremely disabling disorder that is a tremendously exciting development
8413696 the problem is that if you happen to be an individual who has the wrong genetic code in tlr3 you might inadvertently trigger a detrimental effect in your retina
8413697 you might cure the individual of one thing and increase their risk in something else
8413698 this discovery has significant implications for diagnosing the dry form of amd which is the most prevalent form affecting more than 8 million americans
8413699 it also allows us to develop new drugs to treat the dry form of amd for which there currently is no treatment
8413700 what tlr3 does in the case of infection is sacrifice an infected cell to protect the neighborhood
8413701 you and me we have a good 20 to 30 percent chance of getting macular degeneration
8413702 so when the time comes for us to start thinking about intervention we might want to get genotyped first and then decide what kind of therapeutic paradigm might be most appropriate for us
8413703 if we can figure out which viruses might be acting as triggers we might be able to find a way to combat them this would be a far more effective therapy in my view than trying to design a gene therapy approach
8413704 clearly the statement that were not all the same is not exactly novel and yet im still struck by how homogenized people become when it comes to clinical trials
8413705 do i really want my president to be just like me
8413706 breast cancer and prostate cancer develop due to many reasons but environmental factors and lifestyle play a major role in these cancers
8413707 when men and women from india and pakistan migrate to the united states their disease profiles change mirroring the american risk
8413708 we need to educate the immigrant population about risk factors as well as preventive measures they can take to reduce their risk of prostate breast cancer lung cancer and colon cancer
8413709 today marks an exciting development of the partnership between land rover and rugby not only do we have extensions to our existing agreements with premier rugby and the rfu but we are excited about the new land rover premiership cup which will aim to get even more young people involved in the sport land rover and rugby share a number of common values both the players and the vehicles go further than any other and push their limits todays announcement further illustrates our commitment to rugby at all levels of the game from the elite of the england team and the 12 premiership clubs to the next generation of players across the country
8413710 it is exciting news that land rover have continued their partnership with premier rugby and england rugby as they have been a tremendous and loyal partner of the sport their cars are pretty awesome and the players are big fans of driving them
8413711 through their community vehicles land rover play a vital role in transporting children equipment and players to games at all levels we are looking forward to taking our partnership with land rover to the next level through the introduction of the land rover premiership cup

8413720 second as others have pointed out mccain is perilously close to turning his pow record into a punchline
8413721 like so many john mccain served our country bravely and suffered for years as a pow for that he deserves our thanks and respect and we have paid and continue to pay him that respect but having been a pow is not an excuse for a litany of bad votes in the senate and wrong positions as a candidate having been a pow is not an excuse for voting against veterans benefits or an excuse for supporting president bushs tax cuts for the wealthy or an excuse for supporting the use of torture john mccain was a brave soldier but he cannot hide behind that experience and use it as an excuse for every bad decision hes made since hes being anything but brave as a senator and as a candidate he should continue to use that bravery to try to defend those positions if he truly believes in them he should not hide behind his war experiences thats the opposite of bravery if they can figure out an artful term for it call him a damn wimp
8413722 we had to sit around in the dirt and eat if we were lucky
8413723 this transaction highlights the value of our southern timberlands and is both earnings and cash flow accretive for plum creek the formation of this joint venture allows plum creek to immediately capture substantially all of the value of these timberlands and to maintain an ongoing interest in their continuing cash flow and potential for growth
8413724 on behalf of our investors we are extremely pleased to enter into this joint venture with plum creek the 454 000 acres are strategically located in well established log markets and provide for management efficiencies with the campbell groups nearly 2 million acres of southern timberland assets currently under management we look forward to continuing to manage these lands responsibly and under the requirements of the sustainable forestry initiative r standard
8413725 capital allocation remains plum creeks most important task we expect to utilize half of the proceeds from this transaction to retire existing debt the remaining proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes including continued repurchase of the companys stock
8413726 some people believe football is a matter of life and death i am very disappointed with that attitude i can assure you it is much much more important than that

8413729 how could i leave after a night like that it was the greatest night of my life
8413730 the english club proved that miracles really do exist ive now made liverpool my english team they showed that football is the most beautiful sport of all the liverpool supporters didnt let me go to sleep the night before there were 10 of them to every three milan supporters they showed their unconditional support at half time when they were losing 3 0 and still they didnt stop singing
8413731 liverpools fans are just amazing the best feeling i have at away games is anfield it is just incredible i love it you get goose bumps when you see their supporters sing youll never walk alone
8413732 mike brings to office depot strong financial skills and a wealth of operating experience

8413736 we are pleased to welcome dr gayle dolecek to sucampos board of directors
8413737 gayle has worked with sucampo since its founding first as a consultant and now as head of research and development he guided the development of sucampos regulatory strategy ensuring compliance with fdas complex requirements played an instrumental role in establishing our research and development department and played a critical role in the recent approval of amitiza r for irritable bowel syndrome with constipation in the united states which triggered the recent 50 million milestone payment from our marketing partner his expertise has also been instrumental in the regulatory submissions for amitiza r in europe gayles considerable research and development experience have been vital in the continued progress of sucampos earlier stage programs which are likely to be a key component of our long term growth we believe that gayle will continue to bring valuable insight to the board
8413738 we become something that we were not the day before

8413744 for us africa still has a huge amount of promise
8413745 lets face it jungle islands are probably less exciting as they were four years ago
8413746 i will talk about how we campaigned i campaigned for jimmy carter and what i thought worked effectively
8413747 i was in ohio more than their county commissioners were and we carried a lot of those states and joe biden is perfectly positioned to do that
8413748 i think people want to know that hes not in that elite category that we now identify so heavily with what with his seven homes and all
8413749 that makes a difference just feeling that they have a better understanding of their lifestyles and how the average person lives in america
8413750 he brought somebody to the table who will sharpen him who will challenge him who will cause him to think in new and exciting ways
8413751 i dont think its always a good idea to surround yourself with yes man i think they are going to be a great team
8413752 he brings a lot of things that may have been perceived as a weakness he can help win for us he does complement the ticket quite well as far as foreign policy experience which is one of obamas perceived weaknesses
8413753 we welcome senator biden to the race but he largely reflects senator obamas voting record against domestic energy production in favor of raising taxes in favor of not holding education accountable for the outcomes and the like
8413754 so we welcome senator biden to the race but hes largely an echo chamber for senator obama on many positions
8413755 i cant speak for other states but our delegation is not like that were here to support a president of the united states
8413756 were united i think thats what the message is were united
8413757 i think she was speaking to minnesotans to americans as she talked about did you vote for me
8413758 did you support me because of me or because of the veteran whos returning home or because of that mother with cancer whos struggling without health care
8413759 we supported hillary clinton because we believe in these issues
8413760 and we know we have to take this all the way across the line to november and finish the race and win the race and that means that now we have to unite behind senator obama
8413761 specifically on policy issues i mean hillary is by far a national expert on health care and america is crying out for health care reform
8413762 and i think that barack could really benefit from her experience in that area so i would like to see him appoint her in some way to lead that effort
8413763 in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory
8413764 everything ive learned in eight years as president and the work ive done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8413765 no matter where we stood at the beginning of this campaign democrats stand together today
8413766 we believe passionately in barack obamas message of changing the direction of our country
8413767 were not little kids to be told what to do in a half hour
8413768 a lot of white workers and quite frankly a lot of union members believe hes the wrong race

8413822 we opted to continue running treated water into the irrigation system for the remainder of the summer to get folks by
8413823 and of course we will continue to do that but next year is a whole different animal frankly we dont have the capacity or the water to be able to do that on a regular basis
8413824 the implications are that they are not going to build it

8413839 personally is in favor of the chief justice but there is a position in the party which says that he has become too politicized in the last many months and he has been leading rallies
8413840 perhaps he cannot reveal the whole truth to the nation

8413848 in 1984 i was very unpopular with the democratic party
8413849 i had committed the unforgivable sin of losing in 1988 there was a little more warmth and this year ive been more or less reconstituted as a positive figure
8413850 i have participated in the last three conventions when we did not have an incumbent president to re elect
8413851 but will now follow the custom established during the past 40 years by other democratic presidents including harry truman who only attended the first convention after he left office
8413852 anyone who believes he is responsible for what bill clinton did in secret at night with a young intern is absolutely stupid and ridiculous carter told georgias delegates
8413853 he cant stand up as frankly as i did and explain it to you but somehow in the american peoples minds he has to convince them of that absolute truth

8413858 capitalism is the greatest system ever created for alleviating general human misery and yet it breeds ingratitude because we constantly hear how cruel capitalism is while this collectivism or that is more loving because unlike capitalism collectivism is about the group not the individual

8413863 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
8413864 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
8413865 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
8413866 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
8413867 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
8413868 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
8413869 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection

8413873 the pirates were forced to request that pedro be placed on the restricted list because we were informed by his agent scott boras that pedro will not sign the contract to which he agreed on august 15 boras further informed us that pedro will not report to the club unless we renegotiate his contract and agree to pay him more than the 6 million signing bonus to which he agreed
8413874 rodriguez signed with the mariners shortly before going to class at the university of miami in late august and on oct 14 boras submitted a grievance backed by the union that the mariners didnt make clear the terms of the contract he signed the grievance asked that rodriguez should be allowed to renegotiate his contract or void it and become a free agent
8413875 mr boras refused to engage in any negotiations at all until shortly before the august 15 deadline and even then an agreement was reached only after pedro took control of the negotiations
8413876 the main bone of contention is not so much that an extension was given and ive received no confirmation that it was but rather that the players association wasnt informed of an extension as required by the cba
8413877 we believe the grievance is entirely without merit the deadline was extended to accept minor league contracts voluntarily entered into by the clubs and the players with the help of their agents it is settled law that the arbitration panel has no authority to disturb such minor league contracts
8413878 if were an arrogant nation theyll resent us if were a humble nation but strong theyll welcome us

8413880 the former u s vice president is just desperate for attention because he has no friends
8413881 barack obama has a good lead with women and an even greater potential to increase that lead
8413882 where he has shown the most room to grow is among these senior women
8413883 is not living up to his full potential with white older unmarried women
8413884 this is an issue that really demonstrates youre in touch with womens lives

8413888 were so excited to get back on the ice this season
8413889 it was just the dynamics in that particular campaign that they happened to face
8413890 sometimes theres just a big element of luck in life
8413891 i congratulate senator barack obama on his selection of my friend
8413892 i have enjoyed for many years the opportunity to work with joe biden to bring strong bipartisan support for united states foreign policy
8413893 will continue to have widespread support for higher office during many years ahead
8413894 he selected lieberman and the two men not selected in 2000 wound up being our national ticket in 2004
8413895 so for evan bayh getting this far in this process points to only bigger and better things to come in the future in my view
8413896 dear i finished second or third in a contest where they dont give bronze or silver medals
8413897 a hoosier was considered so seriously for such an important post
8413898 i welcomed that and i came through in fine shape
8413899 and then they showed pictures of me in the kitchen making breakfast
8413900 senator biden was kind enough to say youve got a lot of years ahead of you and this could happen next time for you
8413901 i suspect obama might well have preferred bayh as his vice president in office but opted for the person he thought most likely to help in the campaign
8413902 bayhs future continues to be bright in the senate or in an obama administration
8413903 certainly has more to do with joe biden than evan bayh
8413904 hes still young by presidential campaign standards and hes got a great record and profile
8413905 i think that this process here more than in 2000 and 2004 exposed the rest of the nation to how great a leader he is in the democratic party and all the great assets he brings
8413906 we now know that barack obama doesnt truly respect hoosiers
8413907 when we think about some of the details of the durable goods report the basis for optimism isnt that great but the markets reaction shows the market may be ready to embrace better news
8413908 acts detrimental to the updf conduct and rules of procedure
8413909 we keep raising the bar on awareness you either do something about it or you stick your head in the sand
8413910 honestly meth labs can be made in the back of a van

8413921 weber sees no need for the european central bank to lower interest rates any time soon and said the ecb should consider raising interest rates when the european economy strengthens toward the end of this year
8413922 adds to the still nascent optimism that the us economy may be turning the corner
8413923 even so it is still too early to sound the all clear and activity and sentiment indicators remain vulnerable to any deterioration in the news flow surrounding the ongoing credit crisis banking sector problems and housing market woes

8413929 when mohamed siad became president he did a lot of work within the country building roads and schools
8413930 everybody was required to go to school to learn at least reading and writing and everybody capable of working was offered a job there were high hopes for the country
8413931 people didnt know how to operate their equipment and would shoot in random houses and the whole family inside would be destroyed
8413932 a lot of people mentally werent able to continue because of what happened
8413933 when the war happened people were not able to go out and buy their groceries
8413934 so a lot of people started to move to other places
8413935 then people would come and steal everything people even came and took the doors from our house
8413936 we had to return to mogadishu first and then we took an airplane to egypt
8413937 sixteen days after we were in egypt the tribal war started and it got horrible after that mom always thought things would cool down and we would be able to go back but that never happened
8413938 they say oh no we dont want 10 kids every month every two months every six months i will go look for another apartment it was very hard
8413939 i hate egypt i dont want to stay there another time
8413940 i look for another house and i go everywhere when they say move i move
8413941 to get the process done is when you have to give people money
8413942 but i was a little worried because i didnt speak the language i didnt know the people i didnt know the place
8413943 some people came and had to go to school to learn to live here rahma is an educated person so whatever you told her she would understand i liked to work with her
8413944 im able to work and make money i support my family i am independent

8413948 we cant go back wed like to go back and inshallah it will happen sometime you cant understand what the life was over there the life was easy your relatives are all close to you but here its individual
8413949 we lived for 10 years in egypt and never saw an uncle or an aunt
8413950 being able to have a family reunion being able to get your whole family together at thanksgiving thats something a lot of people dont have

8413969 to all the candidates tell me your position on gun control as myself and other americans really want to know if our babies are safe
8413970 this is my baby purchased under the 1994 gun ban
8413971 i believe we ought to move it out let the individual communities decide their gun laws and how guns ought to be treated
8413972 it has had a devastating impact on elections because the nra has targeted and spent millions of dollars distorting individual members views and al gores views
8413973 the key is going to be also attacking poverty bringing people together dealing with those kids in the ghettos that are heavy users of gun violence and they are victims of gun violence to make sure that this country attacks the core problems of poverty having child care bringing parents together
8413974 are you going to be able to keep his baby safe
8413975 ill tell you what if that is his baby he needs help
8413976 i dont know that he is mentally qualified to own that gun
8413977 we should be working with law enforcement right now to make sure that we protect people against people who are not capable of knowing what to do with a gun because theyre either mentally imbalanced and or because they have a criminal record
8413978 get bitter they cling to guns or religion as a way to explain their frustrations
8413979 the ipcc is a scientific intergovernmental body set up by the world meteorological organization and by the united nations environment programme

8413982 malthus was right in predicting that the population would grow geometrically but he didnt foresee our ability to make geometric improvements in agricultural technology even today with several countries in the world suffering massive famines there is little doubt that a commitment to use more land and newer agricultural methods could vastly increase the amount of food produced on earth the problem we now face is therefore more complicated than the one malthus identified in theory the food supply can keep up with the population for a long while yet but in practice we have chosen to escape the malthusian dilemma by making a set of dangerous bargains with the future worthy of the theatrical legend that haunted the birth of the scientific revolution doctor faustus
8413983 observations concerning the increase of mankind peopling of countries etc
8413984 the great increase of offspring in particular families is not always owing to greater fecundity of nature but sometimes to examples of industry in the heads and industrious education by which the children are enabled to provide better for themselves
8413985 we are the finest race in the world and that the more of the world we inhabit the better it is for the human race just fancy those parts that are at present inhabited by the most despicable specimens of human beings what an alteration there would be if they were brought under anglo saxon influence i contend that every acre added to our territory means in the future birth to some more of the english race who otherwise would not be brought into existence
8413986 are reproducing relatively too fast therefore birth control methods must be taught them they must not have too easy access to relief or hospital treatment lest the removal of the last check on natural selection should make it too easy for children to be produced or to survive lengthy unemployment should be grounds for sterilization or at least relief should be contingent upon no further children being brought into the world and so on since a high degree of intellect and imagination of scientific and artistic ability and other qualities cannot be adequately expressed or utilized in the great majority of the lower strata it is useless to plan for their genetic increase in these strata indeed it is more than useless it is dangerous for the frustration of inherent capacity leads to discontent and revolution in some men to neurosis and inefficiency in others the case is strictly analogous to that of cattle in africa in an unfavorable environment too drastic genetic improvement is worse than none
8413987 it will be necessary quite soon to face the fact that only a certain fraction of any human population is equipped by heredity to be able to take full or even reasonable advantage of a full higher or professional education
8413988 thus even though it is quite true that any radical eugenic policy will be for many years politically and psychologically impossible it will be important for unesco to see that the eugenic problem is examined with the greatest care and that the public mind is informed of the issues at stake so that much that now is unthinkable may at least become thinkable
8413989 and thats before they know about his position on choice and that hes against equal pay
8413990 the development on the out of touch argument is an actually critical development of the campaign

8413993 i went to attend a screening of the creationist propaganda movie expelled a few minutes ago well i tried but i was expelled it was kind of weird i was standing in line hadnt even gotten to the point where i had to sign in and show id and a policeman pulled me out of line and told me i could not go in i asked why of course and he said that a producer of the film had specifically instructed him that i was not to be allowed to attend the officer also told me that if i tried to go in i would be arrested i assured him that i wasnt going to cause any trouble
8413994 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
8413995 ladies and gentlemen your kitchen table is like mine you sit there at night after you put the kids to bed and you talk you talk about what you need you talk about how much you are worried about being able to pay the bills well ladies and gentlemen thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
8413996 i know that joe will campaign well for senator obama and so i think hes going to be very formidable
8413997 ive always respected joe biden but i disagreed with him from the time he voted against the first gulf war to his position where he said you had to break iraq up into three different countries we really have different approaches to many national security issues
8413998 mccain competing in blue states obama is competing in red states they are rewriting history every single day
8413999 we dont want to go back to tomorrow we want to go forward

8414005 we have clearly shown that berries which contain a variety of anticancer compounds have a genome wide effect on the expression of genes involved in cancer development

8414007 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
8414008 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
8414009 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants

8414179 fight in the cause of allah against those who fight you but do not transgress limits allah does not love transgressors
8414180 if they seek peace then seek you peace and trust in allah for he is the one that heareth and knoweth all things
8414181 o you who believe shall i show you a commerce that will save you from a painful doom you should believe in allah and his messenger and should strive for the cause of allah with your wealth and your lives that is better for you if you did but know
8414182 lo allah has bought from the believers their lives and their wealth because the garden will be theirs they shall fight in the way of allah and shall slay and be slain it is a promise which is binding on him in the torah and the gospel and the quran who fulfills his covenant better than allah rejoice then in your bargain that you have made for that is the supreme triumph
8414183 the true believers are only those who believe in allah and his messenger and afterward doubt not but strive with their wealth and their lives for the cause of allah such are the sincere
8414184 those of the believers who sit still other than those who have a disabling hurt are not on an equality with those who strive in the way of allah with their wealth and lives allah has conferred on those who strive with their wealth and lives a rank above the sedentary unto each allah has promised good but he has bestowed on those who strive a great reward above the sedentary degrees of rank from him and forgiveness and mercy allah is ever forgiving merciful
8414185 lo allah loves those who battle for his cause in ranks as if they were a solid structure
8414186 whoever dies and had not fought for the sake of allah or did not even consider fighting for the sake of allah dies upon a branch of hypocrisy
8414187 those who were left behind from the jihad rejoiced at sitting still behind the messenger of allah and were averse to striving with their wealth and their lives in allahs way and they said go not forth in the heat say the heat of hell is more intense if they but understood then let them laugh a little they will weep much as the reward of what they used to earn if allah brings you back from the campaign unto a party of them and they ask of you permission to go out to fight then say unto them you shall never more go out with me nor fight with me against a foe you were content with sitting still the first time so sit still with those who stay behind and never pray for one of them who dies nor stand by his grave lo they disbelieved in allah and his messenger and they died while they were evildores
8414188 how can you not fight for the cause of allah and of the feeble among men and of the women and the children who are crying our lord bring us forht from this town of which the people are oppressors and raise for us from you one who will protect and raise for us from you one who will help
8414189 a man came to the messenger of allah pbuh and said
8414190 can you while the muslim fighter is in the battlefield enter your mosque to perform prayers without cease and fast and never break your fast
8414191 the one who makes jihad is rewarded even for the footstep of his horse while it wanders about for grazing while tied on a long rope
8414192 spend your wealth for the cause of allah and be not cast by your own hands to ruin and do good lo allah loves the beneficent
8414193 when the muslims were trying to penetrate and throw themselves into the enemys ranks at constantinople some of them said that they were not supposed to kill themselves by their own hands
8414194 we are more knowledgeable about this verse it was revealed concerning us the companions of the prophet pbuh we participated in the battles with the prophet and allah aided us
8414195 if you abandon the jihad take after the tails of cattle that is spend all of your time with your agriculture and wealth and deal in eena type of riba then allah will make you accompanied with humiliation and you will not get rid of it until you repent to allah and return to your old state
8414196 if you go not forth for jihad he will afflict you with a painful doom and will choose instead of you a folk other than you you cannot harm him at all allah is able to do all things
8414197 the punishment that is awaiting them is not just of the hereafter but there is also a punishment in this life this punishment includes the humiliation that comes to those who stay back from the jihad and facing their enemies therefore their enemies overtake them and prevent them from bounties furthermore they will also lose lives and wealth much more than what they would have lost if they would have faced their enemies and taken part in jihad there is no nation that has left jihad except that allah has afflicted it with humiliation
8414198 we verily sent our messengers with clear proofs and revealed with them the scripture and balance that mankind might observe justice and he revealed iron wherein is mighty power and many uses for mankind
8414199 we have been sent by allah to deliver whom he pleases from the lordship of his slaves that is humans to his own lordship and from the narrow confines of this world to the boundlessness of the next and from the oppressiveness of other ways of life to the fairness and justice of islam
8414200 you are the best nation raised for mankind you order the good and you forbid the evil and you believe in allah
8414201 and they will not cease from fighting against you till they have made you renegades from your religion if they are able to
8414202 and the jews will not be pleased with you nor will the christians until you follow their way of life
8414203 and if allah had not repelled some men by means of others the earth would have been corrupted
8414204 the head of the matter is islam its pillar is the prayer and its apex is jihad

8414447 tuhan telah menjauhkan dosamu itu engkau tidak akan mati 12 14 walaupun demikian karena engkau dengan perbuatan ini telah sangat menista tuhan pastilah anak yang lahir bagimu itu akan mati
8414448 ketika anak itu masih hidup kita telah berbicara kepadanya tetapi ia tidak menghiraukan perkataan kita bagaimana kita dapat mengatakan kepadanya anak itu sudah mati jangan jangan ia mencelakakan diri
8414449 apakah artinya hal yang kauperbuat ini oleh karena anak yang masih hidup itu engkau berpuasa dan menangis tetapi sesudah anak itu mati engkau bangun dan makan
8414450 selagi anak itu hidup aku berpuasa dan menangis karena pikirku siapa tahu tuhan mengasihani aku sehingga anak itu tetap hidup 12 23 tetapi sekarang ia sudah mati mengapa aku harus berpuasa dapatkah aku mengembalikannya lagi aku yang akan pergi kepadanya tetapi ia tidak akan kembali kepadaku

8414460 affirmative action is something the good dont need and the bad dont deserve
8414461 the men who create power make an indispensable contribution to the nations greatness but the men who question power make a contribution just as indispensable especially when that questioning is disinterested for they determine whether we use power or power uses us
8414462 the problems of the world cannot possibly be solved by skeptics or cynics whose horizons are limited by the obvious realities we need men who can dream of things that never were
8414463 i love america more than any other country in this world and exactly for this reason i insist on the right to criticize her perpetually

8414471 my kind of loyalty was loyalty to ones country not to its institutions or its officeholders the country is the real thing the substantial thing the eternal thing it is the thing to watch over and care for and be loyal to institutions are extraneous they are its mere clothing and clothing can wear out become ragged cease to be comfortable cease to protect the body from winter disease and death

8414505 unless the state of texas violates their own election laws congressman barr will be the only presidential candidate on the ballot
8414506 we are up against them constantly in our fight to get on the ballot across the nation when we miss deadlines we get no second chances this is a great example of how unreasonable deadlines chill democracy
8414507 republicans and democrats make certain that third party candidates are held to ballot access laws no matter how absurd or unreasonable
8414508 therefore republicans and democrats should be held to the same standards
8414509 a political party is entitled to have the names of its nominees for president and vice president placed on the ballot if before 5 p m of the 70th day before presidential election day the partys state chair signs and delivers to the secretary of state a written certification of the names of the partys nominees for president and vice president
8414510 this year the texas libertarian party and bob barr are the only ballot listed presidential candidates on the texas ballot so the texas libertarian party could if it wished bring a lawsuit however the result of the lawsuit would probably be to get the deadline declared unconstitutional no court would order that obama and mccain be kept off the ballot

8414512 there is perhaps nothing more reprehensible than an act in exploitation of children those members of our society who because of their age and inexperience are especially vulnerable to manipulation and deceit
8414513 americas children are its most cherished and valuable resource the fbi will continue to do all that it can to protect them from those that would rob them of their innocence
8414514 as criminals exploit technology to commit their crimes whether it be identity theft money laundering distribution of child pornography or any other criminal conduct law enforcement will quickly react to develop equally sophisticated means to track down their wrongdoing
8414515 we will do everything in our power and use every tool at our disposal to keep our children safe whether they are around the block or around the world

8414579 it is the first fossil of a pregnant turtle found in the world and its only the second fossil of an animal found in the world thats pregnant
8414580 its a very primitive turtle and its basically an ancestor of modern turtles so we can look at characteristics of the eggs and nests and we can learn about the evolution of these traits in turtles today
8414581 the turtle was prepared at the royal tyrrell museum so basically the fossil was removed from the rock so that probably took about a year
8414582 last year we finally finished the preparation of the turtle nest so i wanted to publish them together in a single paper so thats why its out now
8414583 although it is relatively rare to find the eggs and babies of extinct animals it is even rarer to find them inside the body of the mother
8414584 the turtle specimen was partly broken when it was first discovered it is this fortuitous break that revealed that the fossil was a mother
8414585 the odds of actually of finding an animal that died and was fossilized at the time it was basically laying its eggs is basically one in a million so when you find something like that you know youve found something that is unique
8414586 absolutely thats why we keep going back every summer in the hope that you actually find something new that was not known before

8414620 there is no excusing the excesses of the serbs under former president slobodan milosevic but there is no denying also that jihadists have been pouring into bosnia and kosovo preparing to use them as a base for jihad activity in europe and we have been helping them
8414621 when kosovo independence was declared thousands of kosovars gathered in pristina and chanted kla
8414622 this was a telling indication of the broad popular support the kla enjoys
8414623 there is little doubt that there are powerful elements in kosovo who are islamic supremacist and pro sharia islamic law
8414624 they will do all they can to turn kosovo into a jihadist camp in the heart of europe
8414625 most of the albanian muslims are cultural muslims who have not been radicalized
8414626 however the muslims in the balkans have been subjected to heavy jihadists infiltration and recruitment for almost two decades now
8414627 are on the wrong side of the fight just as american policy in general has been on the wrong side of the balkans conflict for years
8414628 as kosovo today begins its life as an independent state the united states pledges to be its close friend and partner
8414629 for the first time the region is today poised to move forward with final status for kosovo and transitioning continuing responsibilities there to increasing european control at long last closing the door on the regions painful past

8414676 hair cuts are more tailoring is more dry cleaning is more there is a female tax there are many instances in which women are paying more for the same services so the inequality is really across the board

8414678 it has to talk about the democratic tradition what he brings to it and how his campaign will move forward from the previous administration
8414679 this is the one time that voters get a real look at these guys unmediated speaking at some length on a variety of subjects
8414680 what he now needs to do is say you can trust me with your national security trust me with your economy im not going to tax you to death and

8414682 it really hurt him it was both phony and boring

8414685 you know youre going to hit warmer days during the winter and you get runoff so this will be a continual buildup of ice and thats what were worried actually like ice dams forming in your yard and eventually that water will continue to funnel it self into our homes
8414686 all that water that went up there and did infiltrate through the soil is still moving through the springs and getting down here things just arent draining
8414687 fema is engaged in its effort and i think were making progress were looking at options
8414688 what were looking at here is to make sure people are in safe housing first but then the source of the problem has to be identified and im looking at from my perspective what can we do as fema while were here
8414689 you can only live in a camper so long so if the weather gets cold without a furnace or anything else in the house im going to have to end up renting or something
8414690 people have been voting for ted for 40 years and their inclination is to keep doing it

8414703 barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8414704 se nota que hay premura en la redacci n de la ley hubo un desconocimiento pleno entre quienes redactaron esta ley la primera observaci n que se tiene es que esta ley en su dise o carece mucho de t cnica legislativa hay disposiciones que son transitorias y la ley no las establece como tal pero lo peor es que esta ley contradice el art culo 61 de la ley tambi n org nica de hidrocarburos
8414705 hay entonces una contradicci n entre dos leyes de un mismo car cter
8414706 aqu lamentablemente pareciera que lo que se quiere es convocar a un paro de transporte de hidrocarburos l quidos nosotros tenemos que tener cuidado con eso tenemos que ser responsables por el pa s no podemos promover un conflicto que paralice el suministro de combustible y colapse el mercado nacional
8414707 el problema no era la deficiencia de transporte de combustible en los tiempos del paro petrolero el transporte de combustible no se par fueron controlados por la guardia nacional

8414714 most of the time these proposals end up as design guidelines as ideas to move forward
8414715 in china i wouldnt be surprised if some of these get built
8414716 i think the important thing is contributing ideas to the ongoing dialogue
8414717 more green spaces give more lungs for the city to breathe and absorb some of the pollutants its a good sized site it could have value for the overall metropolitan area
8414718 they have a really rich tradition of having green cities but because of the growth and the explosion in the use of automobiles the old tree lined boulevards are disappearing and the open spaces are disappearing
8414719 what is mind boggling is the immensity of the urban structures
8414720 theres world class architecture but theres been a lot of criticism because the traditional side of chinese architecture isnt being preserved its been argued that its almost too late
8414721 old streets and ancient buildings are just getting demolished to build the super block
8414722 local students aim to help beijing stay green despite growth
8414723 we have an immigration hold on him based on the concern of his immigration status
8414724 should the determination be made that he is unlwawfully in the united states then he will be processed for deportation or given a judicial hearing before the appropriate judicial authority
8414725 this is why the tsa has multiple layers of security in place
8414726 it is important to err on the side of safety and involve local and federal law enforcement officers so that we are fully examining the situation

8414739 nosotros estamos en colombia porque entendemos que la informaci n provee bases para pensar que las farc los paramilitares b sicamente han cometido cr menes de lesa humanidad
8414740 congo y colombia tienen gravedad similar 5 000 muertos entre 2002 y 2004 sin embargo la diferencia es que en aqu coexiste un sistema de alta violencia con un sistema institucional respetado
8414741 una raz n sustancial como la inexistencia de procesos o que los procesos no sean genuinos contra los m ximos responsables
8414742 mi deber es relevar los procedimientos nacionales que se est n haciendo seguirlos y en la medida que sean genuinos respetarlos en la medida en que no sean genuinos intervenir
8414743 en este momento hay procesos en diferente mbitos y estamos viendo eso hay gente que est preocupada por este asunto de la extradici n sin embargo el fiscal colombiano mario iguar n est muy confiado de que va a conseguir la posibilidad de la cooperaci n a trav s de los fiscales norteamericanos
8414744 todav a es prematuro saber cu l va a ser el impacto de esa extradici n y c mo pueden haber alternativas que permitan manejar el caso

8414773 er was saamhorigheid en focus dat is wat we wilden na die wedstrijd van zaterdag
8414774 ik had het gevoel dat het hele team scherp was fysiek waren we stukken beter dan zaterdag we moesten ook goed georganiseerd spelen omdat de tegenstanders erop rekenen dat je je geduld verliest maar we waren gedisciplineerd en gefocust en geen moment in gevaar
8414775 we went to great pains to sort of depict a certain kind of physiology for the fangs
8414776 i wanted to approach the supernatural not as being something that exists outside of nature but something that is more deeply rooted in nature
8414777 we hoopten ze toch nog een beetje onder druk te kunnen zetten maar we liepen alleen maar achter de feiten aan we hebben helemaal niets afgedwongen
8414778 om te kunnen winnen van dit soort clubs moet je top zijn over twee wedstrijden dat is niet gelukt
8414779 this increase seen with heated seats is unlikely to be a significant issue unless you are sitting in a car for a long period of time on a regular basis with the heater on

8414781 if im not mistaken hillary clinton rocked the house last night
8414782 i have known and been friends with john mccain for almost 22 years but every day now i learn something new about candidate mccain to those who still believe in the myth of a maverick instead of the reality of a politician i say lets compare senator mccain to candidate mccain
8414783 great speech and the best case for obama weve heard yet
8414784 he still embraces the extreme philosophy that has defined his party for more than 25 years
8414785 the republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief
8414786 sound familiar it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it will not work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8414787 that primary generated so much heat it probably speeded up global warming
8414788 shes going to do everything she can to elect barack obama

8414797 i havent really noticed that many accidents around here so i dont really think its necessary said steve bruno
8414798 fuelwatch has a lot going for it and it didnt justify some of the criticisms that were appearing about it
8414799 so we just wanted to set the record straight about what evidence wed received
8414800 it was just an attempt to get the facts straight it was just an attempt to inform people
8414801 i invite people to read the report and they will see that its not based on the evidence we heard and i think theyll also understand that the attempt to breathe new life into fuelwatch has not revived the corpse that fuelwatch is
8414802 at the end of the day we are obliged to serve the best interests of the australian people and we could not let it pass through the senate knowing that australians would be paying higher prices for their petrol and that is something that we are not willing to countenance
8414803 a national ban on junk food advertising during childrens tv viewing hours is a sensible first step in tackling childhood obesity
8414804 an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure
8414805 recent comprehensive and systematic reviews of the evidence show that food advertising affects what children eat what they prefer to eat and what they pester their parents for
8414806 for some time now the opc has been calling for national legislation to ban junk food advertising at peak times when children are actually watching television and to substantially restrict all other forms of promotion of unhealthy food to children and adolescents
8414807 the federal government needs to put in place legislation that protects children supports parents and does not undermine campaigns to promote healthy lifestyles
8414808 it is a shame that the revised standards have put broadcasters revenue before our childrens health
8414809 you have 4 weeks within which to return unwanted goods however we insist that you have proof of purchase and that the items is returned in the same state as it was sold

8414828 young men ought to want to grow but to carry on into middle life or even into early manhood this concern about being adult is a mark of really arrested development when i was ten i read fairy tales in secret and would have been ashamed if i had been found doing so now that i am fifty i read them openly when i became a man i put away childish things including the fear of childishness and the desire to be very grown up
8414829 they said we had good margins and good quality they also like our item complete delivery and the quality of our service we are truly the new international bedding
8414830 is that despite those losses weve grown quite a bit with our existing partners we wouldnt be growing if we didnt have a good product portfolio and good plants
8414831 this is a very meaningful show of support from our senior lenders
8414832 we appreciate the confidence that our senior lenders board of directors and ownership have shown in the management team and in all the employees at international bedding during what has been a very difficult period for the entire bedding industry as international bedding enters the second half of the year we are financially stable our plant operations continue to improve our sales are growing and we are very optimistic about the future

8414841 every time i get down or feel good i look down on my arms and know this is the reason im here
8414842 i have the power to change how i feel whatever im doing in my life
8414843 im a huge critic of myself when i got hurt i got down a little bit
8414844 i was all worried about not being able to come back and play at the level i can
8414845 that negative talk is the worst thing you can do
8414846 i credit myself on being the most positive person in my life talking myself up knowing i can do whatever i want
8414847 it was a lot of hard work getting back but it was worth all the pain and stuff i went through in the offseason to get here
8414848 hes working really hard to get there and well see where he is on a day to day basis
8414849 you couldnt ask him to work harder and play harder and we are real proud of him and see where he is at game time
8414850 i have to talk to the staff but i think i can be back soon
8414851 it will be hard to wait but at the same time you know you are helping the team and that its the right thing to do
8414852 it wasnt a good performance but we always know we have the quality to score
8414853 its kind of as simple as that theres no need for panic or anything like that but thats not acceptable and well play better defense in the future
8414854 im always concerned if were not performing the way were supposed to be but im confident that were capable of doing it of being a dominant defense and we will be
8414855 i think if wed have played this game and we just dominated san francisco everybody would have said its just a preseason game lets do that against indy now we played terrible and everybodys like well whats going on well its still a preseason game do you not feel the same way its a preseason game you dont want to play that bad obviously but we did we know what we need to correct and well do it come the indy game you wont see that defense ill tell you

8414860 we have that relationship not just a football relationship which is a big part to having good chemistry in the quarterback room
8414861 hes a little more laid back than mullen but he still gets after it
8414862 to not coach the quarterbacks like he did his tackles and tight ends i thought he was going to get them on the sleds and start driving 200 pound dummies
8414863 i would say that we wont skip a beat there
8414864 yeah i was in the room when he got back from the interview
8414865 i was in the room when he slammed the door and said its going to somebody else
8414866 he really didnt say i was thinking more of an assistant or associate head coach myself
8414867 but i dont know what he was thinking at the time
8414868 but i think in jonathan dwyer they probably have a better player than theyve ever had at that position i have great respect for him i dont know if they ever could have recruited jonathan to play fullback in this offense but hes probably perfect
8414869 our recent financial performance reflects the continued challenges facing our industry as softer top line trends along with higher costs at the restaurant level resulted in de leveraging across much of our income statement

8414886 apple is having two issues one probably more important than the other
8414887 you never know which part of the internet youll need the do you need sun cream part the whats the quickest way to the airport part the what about an ocean view room part or the can you really afford this part which is why all the parts of the internet are on the iphone
8414888 youll never know which part of the internet youll need
8414889 clearly the iphone does not allow the utilization of flash nor java and to say you can surf the whole internet seen through a rigid lens is not true
8414890 at the end of the day there is lots of goodwill that seems to be happening around that with internet users debating who screwed up with many arguing that the advertising authority was too strict the net result is unfortunate but not too negative
8414891 the element i find most disturbing is what happened in poland

8414903 in that certain moment i felt big pain so i just had to tape the ankle but its going to be all right
8414904 that was kind of a turning point in my career
8414905 i started believing after the finals that i really can win
8414906 washington arizona state san diego state arizona and cal are recruiting me right now
8414907 im going to set up official visits to wyoming and nevada
8414908 ive kind of been to a lot of schools already with my brother cal frosh running back covaughn deboskie but i also want to visit san diego state and then cal to see my brother
8414909 you just have to keep working hard and keep your grades up
8414910 also the offense if its a spread or do they throw the ball a lot how the program is run and the team chemistry how many people they send out of college is important too
8414911 i want to wait before making a commitment let the process play out
8414912 i want to do everything my coaches say and obviously to win state as a team
8414913 i also want to be the best team player i can be
8414914 i like getting the letters and reading things about past people who have been there
8414915 just talking to the coaches and getting to know them better
8414916 hay gente que est saboteando las leyes habilitantes dicen que asistir n a la organizaci n de estados americanos oea para que esta organizaci n las supervise pero el que lo haga estar perdiendo su tiempo porque este es un estado soberano y por lo tanto la oea no tiene nada que ver en estos asuntos
8414917 por qu no le ganan las elecciones a nuestros candidatos eso es lo que tienen que hacer en vez de estar tratando de sabotear nuestras leyes pero ellos saben que est n perdidos
8414918 i would look at different marketing please in this market you work every deal till you can
8414919 it was very important for me that i play very well here to come back as a top 10 player and play very good
8414920 i played good for a first round because i can be nervous and my confidence is not so great at the beginning of a tournament i played well all three sets fighting well with very good concentration
8414921 i didnt want to really play tennis i didnt want to prepare for tournaments thats why i didnt play very good in toronto and cincinnati
8414922 thats is why i have tried to come back i have few tournaments to end this year and it was very important for me to play good here this is the last grand slam tournament this year
8414923 but i still play i dont want to quit tennis i try to play better and better and maybe i find my game maybe i find my confidence mentally and can play very well
8414924 i didnt hear anything now i dont know whats happening i dont hear anything really long time
8414925 for me i think it is good because i dont think about any different things just for the tennis
8414926 but i know our players are excited about it its certainly a big challenge on the road against stanford right off the bat this is the lot thats been cast
8414927 sometimes starting out with a lesser opponent you dont learn as much about your team
8414928 obviously this is an equal opponent a pac 10 opponent a rivalry team its great its got our players attention from the point six months ago when we announced this game
8414929 we play nine conference games so there are no cupcakes on the schedule
8414930 every week that you play there will be high quality football teams great athletes well coached teams if i did have the authority to make the schedule i would try to find a cupcake or two
8414931 i saw it for the first time this morning my wife said it was a nice picture thats all i know
8414932 that game in my experience is a game that everybody is going to bring their a game anyway
8414933 i dont imagine we could get their guys to plan any harder than they would have im not concerned with that
8414934 theres no question it will be fun to run out of the rose bowl tunnel but that will be short lived because on the other side of the field will be the tennessee volunteers and we all know what kind of program they are you cant get too lost in the moment or you will get it rained on your head pretty quickly
8414935 it feel like things arent totally settled were ready for a game its time we worked really hard to get to this point i dont know that were 100 percent settled in everything we do weve made a lot of headway this game will be a measuring stuck so we can build from there
8414936 lleg el momento de que los venezolanos nos pongamos los pantalones largos y salgamos a las calles c vica y pac ficamente a defender la democracia y la constituci n nacional es momento de entender que la unidad de la oposici n no puede ser y no lo es gracias a dios solo para escoger candidaturas unitarias para gobernaciones y alcald as sino que debe servir como un instrumento claro de lucha por la defensa de nuestra democracia que est atravesando por un momento de apremio cuando por una v a no contemplada en la constituci n se pretende imponer a los venezolanos un r gimen hegem nico de gobierno similar al que desde hace m s de 40 a os fidel castro le impuso al pueblo cubano situaci n que por el bien de la patria bajo ning n concepto podemos permitir ni tolerar
8414937 los venezolanos no podemos permitir que ch vez se burle una vez m s del pueblo venezolano que de manera categ rica le dijo no a su proyecto pol tico el pasado 2 de diciembre ch vez debe entender que los venezolanos queremos vivir en paz y tranquilidad que apostamos a la reconciliaci n y al reencuentro entre todos los ciudadanos que estamos hartos de la constante conflictividad pol tica adem s que no toleraremos que sea desconocida la voluntad mayoritaria que anhela vivir en el marco de la pluralidad democr tica que a el tanta fobia al parecer le provoca el presidente ch vez lo que debe es ponerse a gobernar y a solucionar los innumerables problemas que tenemos en el pa s y dejar de una vez por todas a un lado su fantasioso sue o de perpetuarse a como de lugar en el poder
8414938 el tema de una ley una ley de telecomunicaciones hoy sali aqu gobierno plantea controlar conexiones de internet no aqu dice en el universal de ayer agregan 34 normas m s para sancionar a los medios se ores tienen un alboroto montado con una ley que dicen que est lista en la asamblea para ser aprobada primero dijeron que era de la habilitante no que es la asamblea nacional
8414939 lo ha desmentido la asamblea nacional un grupo de diputados no tenemos nosotros ya mi per odo habilitante termin as que no tenemos ninguna ley pendiente nosotros ac tampoco est en la asamblea nacional pero ellos arman igual todo un alboroto
8414940 que yo necesite una ley o una medida para limitar la libertad de expresi n para nada adelante se ores pitiyanquis con sus televisoras con sus peri dicos no ya tenemos una constituci n con unas leyes a m lo que me gusta m s bien es este debate ante el pa s y ante el mundo
8414941 a homeless teenager who was drugged and forced to fight with afghan militia then abused by the united states which transported him halfway around the world and imprisoned him at guant namo for five years without charge and is now using him as a guinea pig to test a new system of military justice with no regard to his initial status as a juvenile
8414942 deliberately blurred the detention and interrogation functions thereby undermining a fundamental safeguard against torture and other ill treatment
8414943 compromised the objectivity necessary to fairly and dispassionately evaluate the evidence
8414944 sometimes being here at duke because weve been very very successful they expect you to be perfect they dont look at process anymore
8414945 its like what we havent gone to the final four what we didnt win the national title very spoiled and it ruins it a little bit really a lot
8414946 part of that then becomes you win and sometimes youre just relieved to win
8414947 im not saying that it happens all the time but it happens at the end of that spain game most people would say werent you relieved no i wasnt i was exhilarated it was euphoric it was the way it should be thats the way its going to be for the rest of my career here at duke
8414948 each one of the coaches brings such a wealth of knowledge to the table and for a young coach to obviously be around coach k every day is an amazing opportunity
8414949 but to be around some of the other top coaches in the world and be able to pick their brains and learn the game through their eyes is just a wonderful opportunity
8414950 doing those two things at the same time afforded me an amazing opportunity to grow
8414951 throughout this time there have been sometimes articles you should do this you shouldnt theres no way that i shouldnt have done this for duke for me for our country for the kids i coach im a better coach to them a better person as a result and when i was coaching them it was that we didnt go to the ncaa final four during the last two years because we had two young teams and we got beat all of a sudden theres a reason shame on you you dont do that thats wrong the people who wrote about those things they were wrong
8414952 me he reunido con los candidatos del psuv que aspiran a gobernar en las alcald as de caracas hemos analizado los recursos de que se dispone y un programa que se podr implementar una vez que stos hayan sido electos en funci n de mi experiencia como alcalde de londres durante ocho a os
8414953 al igual que los candidatos del psuv con quienes habl creo que caracas en un periodo de unos 20 a os puede ser transformada en una ciudad de primer nivel
8414954 corresponde a los venezolanos tomar la decisi n acerca de c mo hacer para que esto se materialice
8414955 en efecto nuestro fracaso en las elecciones de mayo de este a o puso fin a ese acuerdo que hab a beneficiado a unas 140 mil personas de los sectores m s humildes en londres pero hemos estado trabajando con los sindicatos a fin de que presionen al actual alcalde para reanudar el acuerdo
8414956 we have excellent systems and processes in place but this week its our best efforts that failed not the regulators not the canadian food safety system
8414957 i emphasize this is our accountability and its ours to fix which we are taking on fully
8414958 para nosotros los j venes venezolanos la aplicaci n de las 26 leyes significa seguir en un pa s donde la democracia esta en peligro estamos convencido de que nuevamente tenemos una gran responsabilidad mucho mayor de la que tuvimos en el a o 2007 cuando asumimos la responsabilidad de anunciarle al pueblo venezolano el contenido del proyecto de reforma socialista propuesto por el primer mandatario nacional donde el nico beneficiado era el mismo presidente de la rep blica hugo ch vez
8414959 no tenemos la menor duda de que el pueblo desconoce el contenido de esas 26 leyes nuevamente tenemos la misi n de divulgar el contenido de las mismas donde se pretende perjudicar a los ciudadanos
8414960 la mesa est servida y nosotros estamos claros no permitiremos imposiciones y menos las que atenten con la democracia y el desarrollo social de los venezolanos estaremos recorriendo todos los rincones de la geograf a nacional explicando el contenido del paquetazo y conquistando voluntades
8414961 quien acostumbra a dar madrugonazos a espalda de los venezolanos
8414962 el presidente ch vez me ha pedido que contin e trabajando con los futuros alcaldes
8414963 para m un honor que se me haya confiado la tarea de asesorar a los candidatos
8414964 theres a lot of different opinions for the most part you feel like even when we were at big ten media day people within our big ten media were asking about the whole perception of our strength of schedule and stuff
8414965 theres not really much you can say about any of that the only thing that will change any of that is just to win
8414966 and maybe coach paterno would give me a couple weeks off to swim in beijing
8414967 he shared some of his experiences in college and the nfl so it helped out a lot
8414968 play with confidence and have fun you cant live and die with the game of football so just go out there and have fun
8414969 we talked to some of the players and they are really excited about it

8415039 we found that the company never really made money over the last four years
8415040 it turns out that around 20 to 25 per cent of 2006 earnings those profits from that year were derived from the sale of the right to provide employees to abc owned centres so about 20 odd per cent of that years profit by way of example just wasnt as stated
8415041 similarly the financial transactions that the companys entered into with developers it turns out and only recently disclosed that a big portion of earnings is being derived by transactions with developers
8415042 the cash flow analysis of the last couple of years on a cash profit basis the numbers were negative rather than positive thats what you would expect from a company making acquisitions but that was certainly our reading of it

8415045 it was a big game for us and i felt we were well organised disciplined focused and basically never really under threat from fc twente what was most important was not to make mistakes be patient and score our goals
8415046 i felt the whole team was sharper and physically we were much better than on saturday afternoon maybe that is why we made it easier it was a game that gave us the same problem as in the first game by man marking us all over the pitch when they had the ball they didnt take many risks they were more focused on possession we had to be well organised because they played a little bit with our patience
8415047 i believe he brings calm and confidence to the side and overall we had a good balance in the side he could have stayed on he was more disappointed twente didnt really have a go at us he likes to play he wants always to play but i took him off because he has just come back from a hamstring and we play again on saturday recovery time will be very short
8415048 the response was clear it was togetherness it was consistency and that is what you want on a night like that we want to play with the best and to do that means qualifying for the group stage there was so much at stake tonight that of course it was a big mental test
8415049 we have been struggling a little bit for goals but i was never really worried about that because we can create chances it is difficult when you start the season with a qualifier and in between you have an international friendly at that moment the bodies arent completely ready to absorb all that and you can have a dip a little bit i felt that on saturday
8415050 he had a stomach bug during the game and was sick at half time he couldnt go on

8415070 i had with me a nikon camera and around 90 film rolls with tell tale evidence of blatant demographic colonialism being perpetrated by the chinese inside tibet through a systematic disfiguring of all that has to do with tibet its people its culture and age old traditions
8415071 before opening tibet to international tourism china took care to ensure that visitors cant see anything that china does not want them to see it is like a murderer throwing a party after cleaning up the murder site spotting meaningful frames in such a situation is a great challenge to a professional photo journalist
8415072 when i approached the dalai lama for the first time in 1972 at his dharamshala headquarters it was with a kind of professional detachment not out of any reverence or any sense of spiritual allegiance but when i met him i was greatly impressed by him he converted 80 000 tibetan refugees in india into one of the best organised refugee settlements
8415073 it was to lend a sense of credibility to my tibetan studies that i decided to take advantage of the chinese decision to open up tibet to tourists and entered the region for the first time in 2003 on a tourist visa
8415074 there is no doubt that urban parts of tibet have undergone tremendous modernisation wonderful malls wide roads impressive housing complexes and most lavish car brands are seen on the streets only if you can distinguish between a chinese and a tibetan face would you realise who owns these goodies and for whose benefit all this development is being undertaken
8415075 my exclusive focus during the second trip was on verifying chinas claim that tibet has undergone unprecedented development that the region has gained out of this change and that tibetans are very happy under chinese rule
8415076 anything could have happened to me had i been caught with these films obviously it would not have been easy to explain the reason for taking so many photographs but when i have a mission to complete nothing can come in my way

8415080 the gulf of mexico area has a large percentage of oil production and refining
8415081 when katrina hit it knocked out 8 percent of the refining capacity for supplies of retail gas to go down by 8 percent is a huge shock to the system
8415082 over the course of three or four days that type of hike was unheard of at the time
8415083 i dont think weve seen anything like that since gas has been high this summer but it was more of a gradual increase
8415084 more often than not if crude oil prices are going up oil companies will pre emptively raise gas prices to slow demand
8415085 oil companies dont like to scare off consumers if they can ease people into price hikes consumers are less likely to change their habits
8415086 weve seen gas prices come down significantly but its still high and supplies are tight its a bad time to have a hurricane on a holiday weekend

8415090 this was just nothing more than just a couple bars under here and the kids would get their trays and come down
8415091 the younger children theyre very tippy and wobbly so our janitor put this on for us so the kids dont they dont loose their trays on the floor any more
8415092 i like it a lot its exciting because before we had to eat with our teachers and that was no fun
8415093 it feels like were partly normal where were supposed to be
8415094 one great thing about hockey is that youre able to display aggressive behavior in an acceptable manner you dont have to go to prison or whatnot for striking someone with an elbow it makes a good setting to look at aggression
8415095 we were astounded to see that this relatively simple measurement in the face predicted how aggressive men were in a lab based computer game and then equally astounded to see that the same measure could predict aggressive behavior in a real world setting that of sports
8415096 competitors may have used this cue likely on a subconscious level to decide whether or not to take an opponent on
8415097 for example if people were asked to rate how aggressive men were was on the basis of photographs would their ratings be accurate
8415098 these are the types of follow up research questions that we are now investigating
8415099 perhaps what the authors have documented is not an effect of masculine facial qualities and effects of testosterone but rather behavioral compensation for the social effects of babyfaceness

8415124 if you never listen to another sensible word i ever say again deb i would if i were you think who your audience really is america the world or people who really know you because we know when you come over sometimes as sarky or saying the odd swear word or having a dig at someone you are probably joking others who dont know you at all or may think it is odd on a christian blog to read something which they think is addressed to them or just surprised you speak such words as a committed devoted catholic just because they dont leave comments in your reply box doesnt mean they dont think it there are quite a few parishioners i was surprised who read ukok and facebook and it was one of these people who got me and fr peter into reading your archives that made me realise i have definately made the right choice never ever to start up blogging you obviously feel comfortable telling everyone what you do how you feel and that is your choice some things you have wrote if you look back are definately carefully scripted and you come across as if your audience you are talking to are those on your doorstep not thousands of miles away and that you prefer to communicate better talking in your own tongues but the holy spirit gives each of us the wisdom to unscrabble and understand what you mean

8415144 theres like this tipping point in which people are asking more and more for ways to get active and do some real things
8415145 canada is an ideal place to meet the changes that will put us at the vanguard of policing
8415146 in a lot of countries the police are perceived quite rightly not as an impartial servant of the public interest but the arm of an oppressive segment of society
8415147 diversity is a rich element for the community but it brings challenges in terms of management
8415148 its not easy to be a police officer in 2008
8415149 you have to consider very very complex problems when we talk about diversity its not only a police problem its a society problem we have to bring together a lot of people we need the community we need the social worker on the street we need parents
8415150 we have to be more aware of how we are perceived
8415151 build a relationship not just when theres an incident or misunderstanding
8415152 its going to take a few years were working on it weve been struggling

8415157 youve had the opportunity to get rehab since july 2 i dont think that max is serious about going to rehab if he is he wouldve gone three months ago
8415158 it is my submission that that has not been proved certainly not to the criminal standard and that a doubt based on reason exists
8415159 jose hernandez theres evidence before this court to conclude has no accent he speaks like a canadian born young man because thats what he is
8415160 colours all of the rest of the evidence which the crown proffered in support of the theory that mr hernandez is the speaker overheard by mr mcmynn
8415161 everyone was asking me before what it was going to be like i was like i dont know i havent talked to her in 10 or 15 years i had that tension and i started to let it get to me is she going to be nice is it going to be a bad environment but when i saw her everything was fine
8415162 i think when youre 18 your personalities conflict then you meet up 10 or 15 years later and the playing ground is totally different and youre fine
8415163 it let me find a little bit of peace and discover who i was as a person
8415164 not the person who the press made me out to be because id had a few bad experiences in my personal life and i was struggling to figure out a bad husband or a bad boyfriend and i was doing it under the spotlight so i wasnt reacting well to any of it
8415165 i dont think we ever hit each other scratching im not going to deny that

8415168 he was also given the opportunity to have the name of the lead character replaced with a fictional character name which he declined

8415175 its inspiring to look at what some of these women have done and to listen to some of their life stories
8415176 you want to drive people to the internet and give them more information on the internet and then bring them back to the network
8415177 i think it shows that viewers want to be able to access content where and when they want it and that wont hurt television numbers
8415178 i think the 2008 summer olympics is certainly the first games in canada anyhow that we were able to really take advantage of mobile television
8415179 its also the type of event thats perfect for this platform it goes on all day and you may have a particular sport that you follow and you can pop in and get what you need and pull back out again its great to have this on demand or a live broadcast streaming this kind of content
8415180 i think we were able to take the olympic viewing out of your home and you could take it with you
8415181 the evidence is mostly indicative of what your canadian broadcasting company found is that it does help rather cannibalize the tv audience
8415182 i dont think the technology is ready i dont think consumers are aware of it either
8415183 from what weve seen were pleased to see the consumer enthusiasm for mobile olympic coverage
8415184 i think one day ill be able to meet him and michelle i just dont think its going to be this week

8415231 essentially you have a sea of plants monocultures for tens of kilometers in what sense can that ever be sustainable
8415232 i am extremely wary of well meaning people who like to feel good about themselves contributing in a terrible way to the destruction of our planet
8415233 the good news is that youre starting to see people all over the world starting to talk about these issues
8415234 people are much more amenable to following these standards and adopting them
8415235 they see it as a very typical developed country attempt to keep developing countries from profiting off a commodity
8415236 its been on their landscape for the past 15 years
8415237 but it will take a lot of time to prove it and to achieve accountability
8415238 this cabinet that i had was the worst in history they look at themselves they are unreliable
8415239 a cabinet systems of government share two common principles first they observe the principle of collective responsibility cabinet ministers share in the process of making cabinet decisions and are duly bound to defend those decisions in public irrespective of private opinion secondly they observe the principle of parliamentary accountability
8415240 to be honest im glad im keeping and not batting against them

8415246 at aston villa it was difficult when he wasnt playing i saw him on saturday when he played for 70 minutes and i thought he was outstanding he looked lively and bright
8415247 i spoke to shaun and he feels that with a couple of games under his belt he would be back to 100 per cent so i had no hesitation in calling him up now we just have to hope that hes going to get over this knock hes picked up
8415248 he has started well he gives us a different dimension and hes in good goalscoring form

8415256 obviamente ni aznar era culpable de aquellos atentados ni rodr guez lo es de un accidente que ha costado la vida a 154 personas pero es evidente que aquellos atentados de madrid no hubieran tenido lugar de no haber mediado la decisi n pol tica de situar a nuestro pa s en el bando norteamericano en la guerra de iraq es decir se daban las condiciones objetivas para que ese atentado tuviera lugar igual que ahora rodr guez ha creado las condiciones objetivas para que el accidente de barajas fuera posible
8415257 fuelwatch has a lot going for it and it didnt justify some of the criticisms that were appearing about it
8415258 so we just wanted to set the record straight about what evidence wed received
8415259 it was just an attempt to get the facts straight it was just an attempt to inform people
8415260 i invite people to read the report and they will see that its not based on the evidence we heard and i think theyll also understand that the attempt to breathe new life into fuelwatch has not revived the corpse that fuelwatch is
8415261 at the end of the day we are obliged to serve the best interests of the australian people and we could not let it pass through the senate knowing that australians would be paying higher prices for their petrol and that is something that we are not willing to countenance

8415265 it was a big game for us and the response was clear
8415266 there was togetherness and focus that is what we wanted after a result like saturday
8415267 we needed to be organised because they play a little with your patience we were disciplined and focused and we were never really under threat
8415268 i felt the whole team was sharp physically we were much better than saturday

8415299 in anticipating music my soul is dancing before the first note is played
8415300 a painter paints pictures on canvas but musicians paint their pictures on silence
8415301 i have my own particular sorrows loves delights and you have yours but sorrow gladness yearning hope love belong to all of us in all times and in all places music is the only means whereby we feel these emotions in their universality
8415302 music cleanses the understanding inspires it and lifts it into a realm which it would not reach if it were left to itself
8415303 music is the wine which inspires one to new generative processes and i am bacchus who presses out this glorious wine for mankind and makes them spiritually drunken
8415304 alas for those that never sing but die with all their music in them
8415305 music is enough for a lifetime but a lifetime is not enough for music
8415306 it is only by introducing the young to great literature drama and music and to the excitement of great science that we open to them the possibilities that lie within the human spirit enable them to see visions and dream dreams
8415307 music washes away from the soul the dust of everyday life
8415308 of all the earthly music that which reaches farthest into heaven is the beating of a truly loving heart
8415309 music is the mediator between the spiritual and the sensual life
8415310 every mans work whether it be literature or music or pictures or architecture or anything else is always a portrait of himself
8415311 to me the greatest pleasure of writing is not what its about but the music the words make
8415312 music is well said to be the speech of angels
8415313 i hear the music in my head that no one else can hear the drummer keeps a steady beat the guitarist throws a riff while the sax man blows it long and low it finally hits my feet a shuffle then a bump a swing as hips go side to side and then the trumpet sidles in and i begin to glide
8415314 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8415315 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8415316 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8415317 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8415318 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8415353 nevertheless the debate did bring to an end the long and thorough period of trialling evaluation analysis and consultation
8415354 we will now take steps to reintroduce 32 tasers to the three auckland districts and the wellington district
8415355 before that can happen the tasers will need to be retrofitted with cameras and appropriate refresher training undertaken

8415360 this ignores the realities of policing where an emergency could require all sworn staff to report to frontline duty at a moments notice

8415370 it felt like i was inside a deep fryer like an overcooked chip it knocked me down and i was still convulsing after the first hit
8415371 this has been an extremely spirited and hard fought primary and now it appears as if we wont know the results until sometime wednesday at the earliest
8415372 im confident the final results will give us a primary victory and we can move on to the general election
8415373 ever since i met del 55 years ago i could never imagine a day would come when she wouldnt be by my side i am so lucky to have known her loved her and been her partner in all things
8415374 i also never imagined there would be a day that we would actually be able to get married
8415375 i am devastated but i take some solace in knowing we were able to enjoy the ultimate rite of love and commitment before she passed
8415376 for all of dels life she was an activist and organizer even before we knew what those terms meant
8415377 her last act of public activism was her most personal marrying the love of her life after 55 years
8415378 in the wake of losing her we recognize with heightened clarity the most poignant and responsible way to honor her legacy is to preserve the right of marriage for same sex couples thereby providing the dignity and respect that del and phyllis love deserved
8415379 no secret anymore the times of del martin and phyllis lyon
8415380 if we had a secret we would have written a book and made a million dollars
8415381 we love each other we have similar interests our lives were very similar even before we met
8415382 i think today marriage as an institution has been strengthened
8415383 being able to help make changes in the way lesbians and gay men view themselves and how the larger society views lesbians and gay men

8415385 morales wasnt as good as ive seen him in the past
8415386 he gets away with a lot because he has such good stuff
8415387 hes got a lead and walks the first two in the fourth and fifth
8415388 its an honor to get votes and be up with those guys and just get mentioned
8415389 one thing i said to my coaches is if i can id like to go ahead and go just to stay sharp
8415390 i think i started slowly i dont think i had a great camp
8415391 i think in the last two games i played a little bit better felt a lot better
8415392 no clue as to what went on or when its going to be finished but im sure it will be done in a timely fashion
8415393 i think the biggest thing our team has to overcome is the belief that they can win
8415394 the players are so hungry to win theres really no resistance
8415395 when we ask them to do something different than what they did in the past instead of questioning why theyre being asked to do it theres a natural tendency for players to think that hopefully if its different than what they were doing it will help them win
8415396 something were trying to catch the spirit of is motivating ourselves to believe in ourselves and have confidence to execute plays and assignments and alignments so we can be positive and confident on the field
8415397 to characterize ourselves as a certain brand name of offense or defense
8415398 these changes are different and separate from the changes in thinking skills that occur as people get older
8415399 we found accelerated changes in peoples mental skills that indicated a terminal decline phase years before death
8415400 cardiovascular conditions such as heart disease or dementia that is too early to be detected could be factors
8415401 increased health problems and frailty in old age often lead to inactivity and this lack of exercise and mental stimulation could accelerate mental decline
8415402 this is the first human study to show that the fat in obese people is sick meaning that it does not function as it should
8415403 the bad health effects associated with obesity are probably not caused by the extra fat itself
8415404 they probably result from the constant overloading of the system with excess calories
8415405 people have all kinds of theories about why bariatric surgery works the way it does but the most simple and straightforward explanation is that the dramatic and immediate reduction in caloric intake is responsible for this improvement
8415406 we know it exists but we dont have a good molecular explanation for it studies like this one provide important clues
8415407 you have made no effort to see the kids i am not letting them be your bridesmaids
8415408 well there will be two disappointed girls if she brings that on herself
8415409 suck it up and get on with it as nothing was going to land in her lap and dont be upset if your inaction leads to disappointment

8415411 there wasnt anything that he was proposing that i disagree with
8415412 i think the act has been poorly served in the last four years at least by its current administration that theyve let canberra stagnate
8415413 i think its quite interesting in the context of mr seseljas work ethic the workload that hes accepted and the energy that hes put into his work as a member of the assembly that in four years hes tabled three bills
8415414 rich for a government that has shut down debate throughout the last four years and has used its majority to prevent this kind of legislation from coming on it is a bit rich for them to be criticising us for the number of pieces of legislation
8415415 im all in favour of any democratic process that involves ratepayers and to have a community advisory board or committee is a good idea
8415416 but i would caution that if the sole purpose of this advisory board is to embark on a process of de amalgamation its just not going to happen and people basically are wasting their time because theyre missing the opportunity to influence how the council operates
8415417 i think shes been placed between a rock and a hard place in this whole process
8415418 she has a responsibility as a regional councillor to think of the whole region but shes also got responsibilities to her division
8415419 we actually support emissions trading and we support australia addressing the global challenge that climate change represents
8415420 does this information create my chance of getting an interview
8415421 the bill is being introduced into the upper house today where six labor mps have also pledged to block the sale
8415422 we still are hopeful that well get electricity reform through
8415423 if mr ofarrell stays true to his word he will support it but unfortunately it seems last night there was some doubt about that
8415424 we will proceed and if we dont get the legislation through we will then consider the position
8415425 it seems that he is happy to play games with the states economic future for a quick and cheap political win
8415426 hes got a number of hours before the debate kicks off later today we are urging him to carefully consider his position and the long term needs of the families and businesses of this state and to support electricity reform
8415427 we think that it is in the public interest not to rush ahead
8415428 morris iemma has recalled the parliament today and tomorrow simply because he thought he had the numbers simply because he thought he could ram this through and we dont think that he is exercising due diligence in relation to this process
8415429 ive already indicated that the only basis ill stay around is if there is public sector reform and micro reform to be done ill make that as a personal decision and thats irrelevant to whats going on here
8415430 at the end of the day power supplies need to be secured and people are going to have to come with a strategy to secure those power supplies
8415431 we can understand the opposition in the labor party weve got people that are admittedly and proudly unreconstructive socialists
8415432 but theres no excuse for the liberal party barry ofarrell has been proven to be gutless in the face of national party opposition
8415433 the issues wont go away after today but we will make sure that his position is clear for the public to see he will have to vote down something that allegedly is their philosophical position
8415434 every hospital school and road that doesnt get built as a result of this will be laid at the feet of barry ofarrell
8415435 it could be a really interesting day or it could be the greatest anticlimax ever
8415436 it really is back in the oppositions court and if mr ofarrell and mr stoner stick to opposing the legislation then it will be defeated
8415437 its undeniable that morris iemma still maintains significant support within the caucus
8415438 the real issue here is the future of the treasurer michael costa is the architect the proponent and the strategist behind this whole legislation and would be more concerned about the future

8415444 yes come in i have a messy kitchen and its stressing me out it would help greatly if you would do my dishes
8415445 it must be considered that there is nothing more difficult to carry out nor more doubtful of success nor more dangerous to handle than to initiate a new order of things for the reformer has enemies in all those who profit by the old order and only lukewarm defenders in all those who would profit by the new order this lukewarmness arising partly from the incredulity of mankind who does not truly believe in anything new until they actually have experience of it

8415457 i met my teacher and shes really nice her name is mrs moore and i hope i make lots of good friends
8415458 i lost my old backpack that my dad gave me and my lunch box had like liquid in it so it was nasty and thats why we bought a new one
8415459 the school sends me a list its very nice and it lays everything out what we need to buy
8415460 just really watching for sales and whatever i didnt get from the sales i just got the list so whatever i didnt get from the sales im now filling in the gaps
8415461 they get sick they come into the clinic they need medication they come into the clinic
8415462 last week we saw 43 patients with the nurse practitioner and we saw over 50 visits for just regular triaging children
8415463 at this school we have lots of children on insulin pumps we have tube feeders normal catheterzations here medicines that have to be given during the school day
8415464 so this was the ideal place to start the program
8415465 when we interview them further we find out weve got a spelling test this afternoon so then think thats probably the problem school belly is what we refer to it
8415466 we just want the kids to have the best care we want them to be healthy because healthy students make better learners
8415467 i like to be able to cook for gavin and have a nice clean house when he comes home and clean clothes
8415468 im not lazy when it comes to the baby and my house im quite obsessive compulsive about cleaning
8415469 hed say well theres your target see how you do and we could do it when we were kids
8415470 you never know which part of the internet youll need the do you need sun cream part the whats the quickest way to the airport part the what about an ocean view room part or the can you really afford this part which is why all the parts of the internet are on the iphone
8415471 youll never know which part of the internet youll need
8415472 clearly the iphone does not allow the utilization of flash nor java and to say you can surf the whole internet seen through a rigid lens is not true
8415473 at the end of the day there is lots of goodwill that seems to be happening around that with internet users debating who screwed up with many arguing that the advertising authority was too strict the net result is unfortunate but not too negative
8415474 the element i find most disturbing is what happened in poland
8415475 sometimes being here at duke because weve been very very successful they expect you to be perfect they dont look at process anymore
8415476 its like what we havent gone to the final four what we didnt win the national title very spoiled and it ruins it a little bit really a lot
8415477 part of that then becomes you win and sometimes youre just relieved to win
8415478 im not saying that it happens all the time but it happens at the end of that spain game most people would say werent you relieved no i wasnt i was exhilarated it was euphoric it was the way it should be thats the way its going to be for the rest of my career here at duke
8415479 each one of the coaches brings such a wealth of knowledge to the table and for a young coach to obviously be around coach k every day is an amazing opportunity
8415480 but to be around some of the other top coaches in the world and be able to pick their brains and learn the game through their eyes is just a wonderful opportunity
8415481 doing those two things at the same time afforded me an amazing opportunity to grow
8415482 throughout this time there have been sometimes articles you should do this you shouldnt theres no way that i shouldnt have done this for duke for me for our country for the kids i coach im a better coach to them a better person as a result and when i was coaching them it was that we didnt go to the ncaa final four during the last two years because we had two young teams and we got beat all of a sudden theres a reason shame on you you dont do that thats wrong the people who wrote about those things they were wrong
8415483 were going to go after it were going to do it and if some student doesnt go to the final four after their four years at duke then thats just too damn bad
8415484 but our team is going to have fun is going to be representative and theyre going to have the opportunity to grow just like our olympic team did
8415485 we thought if we gave people something fun to do then maybe they will forget about the difficult economy
8415486 these contracts were meant to protect u s soldiers serving their country and we will not tolerate corruption that deprives the troops of the benefits of competitively sourced goods and services
8415487 a committee appointed 16 months ago by gov jim gibbons to recommend ways to reduce greenhouse gases in nevada supports plans by three companies to build coal fired power plants in the eastern part of the state
8415488 but in our view the report of the committee is seriously flawed for its contradictory conclusion about the proposed coal plants you cannot reduce greenhouse gases if you give the go ahead to coal fired power plants which is what this report does

8415531 what is dangerous about this work is that it states clearly that it is restoring the christian church back to its first century moorings which it then seeks to revolve almost totally if the reader follows their reasoning almost completely on 1 corinthians 14 26 that this be not centered around one person but all participate with biblical teaching hymn leading etc in this same scriptural text they exhibit poor exegetical skills by concluding that everyone ministers when assembling together ecclesia however this text denies women to speak in these asemblies this is but one example of inaccurate biblical exegesis which they exhibit none of in this work other than reference violas other writings but do the proof texting in the footnotes which they seriously deride their opponents of

8415566 my grandfather left china to come to malaysia during the most difficult times of china
8415567 my grandfather father and i have never forgotten our roots in zhongshan now that the new china has emerged economically i thought why dont i take the opportunity to come back to do something for my ancestral home
8415568 it was with hope and expectations that i came back to do business i wanted to execute my plans for the company to perfection
8415569 we are very clear about our corporate philosophy we keep clear of politics and religion we also dont talk bad about others
8415570 the 100 schools are not our ultimate goal we want more so far we have built 71 schools in various poverty stricken parts of china
8415571 some entrepreneurs feel that its sufficient to build a strong company and leave charity work to the government i dont share that kind of opinion none of us are poor enough not to help others and none of the companies are small enough not to do charity
8415572 we have to create a humane environment in our company if a company can do equally well in its business matters and in charity work it will win the hearts of its consumers
8415573 whether its top 10 philanthropist or honorary citizen awards all of them are simply titles what touches me more are the letters and artworks we received from the children of the hope schools as well as people in the area
8415574 whenever i read their greetings and see their works i will imagine the smile on their faces and its a very good and peaceful feeling thats the force of charity
8415575 if you ask me whats the recipe of success i think being hardworking in everything you do is very important even though you may not succeed initially

8415580 that was well and truly a squeaky bum night good to see the ground full but looking through the team sheets before especially at the bench we are so short of decent players el zhar looked good when he came on but aurelio was awful as was kuyt except for the goal hopes for the season cant be high after that also robbie keane just cant seem to fit in babel wide left is ok but its right we are struggling dont just stick mascherano back in the centre and waste gerrard out there rafa bring someone in riera is left wing utility why not joaquin swp
8415581 if that team is good enough to win the premier league this year then there is something wrong with the world mascherano doesnt make that much of a difference to that team the display of liverpool over 210 mins was a joke

8415623 following last year when our principal concern was not having enough water stored to sustain operations through the dry seasons this year we have had to deal with a very wet summer that was topped off by a very high rainfall event over the past few days
8415624 big creek which crosses our mine access road rose over two metres in 24 hours and overtopped protective dykes designed to keep water off the road during flood conditions temporarily affecting road access to the mine the klondike highway was also closed between carmacks and whitehorse due to flooding water levels are now receding and access is expected to be restored within two days
8415625 in addition excessive run off from the hills surrounding the minto mine quickly filled the water storage pond where water levels despite diverting as much run off as possible into the lower benches of the open pit which are not currently being mined rose half a metre in eight hours in order to manage its water resources we applied for and received from the yukon water board an amendment to our water licence to discharge excess stored water it is important to note that the stored water is non toxic to aquatic organisms and while slightly above discharge levels set in mintos water licence is considerably below federal standards for discharge set out in the metal mining effluent regulations further this is not a discharge from a tailings pond since the minto mine uses the dry stack tailings storage method where tailings are mechanically dried and stored in a compacted storage facility and therefore the mine has no tailings pond

8415630 hunters and anglers who care about conservation are looking for the candidate with the boldest clean energy plan
8415631 the technology solutions that help families reduce their dependency on fossil fuels are the same technologies that will also solve the climate crisis clean the air and help protect americas natural resources for our childrens future
8415632 we can improve the environment and strengthen the economy by investing in renewable energy technologies that create jobs while reducing global warming
8415633 the united states needs to set a bold new vision on energy policy and set a goal to achieve 100 percent of its electricity from clean renewable sources of power within 10 years
8415634 drilling on public lands that are critical habitat for wildlife for the last drop of oil is not going to solve our energy or climate crisis
8415635 irresponsible energy development is turning our public lands in the west into one giant pin cushion and it wont reduce gas prices at the pump we need commitments from our elected officials that theyll get down to the business of solving these problems without sacrificing what americans cherish about the west
8415636 ive spent my life fishing and hunting and ive witnessed firsthand the rapid changes triggered by global warming
8415637 we can only solve our climate and energy crisis by cutting carbon emissions and developing new clean energy sources at the same time these problems are linked and so are their solutions
8415638 conservation is a way of life for millions of americans who care about the natural heritage were leaving behind for our children and grandchildren
8415639 the decisions we make today will affect them long after were gone we owe it to them to do everything we can to find better energy choices that help prevent the worst consequences of climate change

8415647 the grand old party is no longer grand it is just old
8415648 i see arrogance at home and incompetence at home and i simply cant tolerate and america cant afford four more years
8415649 we came so close to winning and this time we will
8415650 america can do better than that and barack obama will
8415651 lets send a message thanks but no thanks in this case the third time is not a charm
8415652 in his first presidential decision his selection of a running mate he hit it out of the park
8415653 that campaign generated so much heat it increased global warming
8415654 last night hillary said shes going to do everything she can to elect barack obama that makes two of us
8415655 clearly the job of te next president is to rebuild the american dream and to restore american leadership in the world
8415656 i love this and i thank you im here first to support barack obama
8415657 and second im here to warm up the crowd for joe biden

8415663 and by the second show he offered to put over one grand into the show with sound equipment and promotion ive finally got someone to pay my flyer bills
8415664 i just want it to be a brand name like you dont know what starbucks means but you know that there will be coffee there so i want it to be that way but with performance shows and art whether its physical whether its comedy
8415665 whatever it is i want it to be under the banner of transient authority
8415666 its like that corny quote that ive always hated about weather if you dont like it wait a minute i took that quote and applied it to my shows if you dont like one night just wait until the next one
8415667 if anyone knows business after a year you cant really expect profits
8415668 but as long as i walk out of there even i dont care as phony as that sounds and as idealistic as that sounds of course i want to make money but if i can walk out and fill up my gas tank thats a success and if the show is great and the bands are happy thats a success for me
8415669 when you think youre doing what you think you should be doing and you have a lot of people coming up to you saying that what youre doing is great for the city or great for the arts you cant even respond to stuff like that
8415670 you cant say i know you cant say that was the plan or that you knew it would work out
8415671 i have my flaws im on certain medications ive been there and i had bad moments but im not ashamed of it and i dont want other people to be
8415672 its helped me more this past year with transient authority than the four or five years that i went through therapy medication and even hospitalization

8415678 the second part is ours which will undertake ethical and cultural issues to change the society from its tendencies toward a secular and western orientation to a society based on islamic and religious culture
8415679 they never carry weapons and they do not care for the military side at all their main work is absolutely cultural and intellectual

8415686 the perception of impropriety is pervasive throughout this blatant attack on the pocketbooks of all of lancaster citizens this reprehensible rape of the public treasury has not and will not go unnoticed the cavalier attitude of the town board in this case needs to be exposed i was personally treated to an outright subversion of the truth by supervisor giza while on a tour of the building at 3949 walden avenue accompanied by approximately 30 people
8415687 i asked supervisor giza if he had ever heard the name robert benzel
8415688 i think he was a truck driver for colecraft manufacturing
8415689 call it what you will perfidy or deceitfulness but plainly said it was a lie
8415690 and you have a lot of storage there the board is determining whether we should go in there and remodel it and we have a grant from empire state development esd for 350 000
8415691 i heard rumors that you are interested in selling it are you selling it
8415692 ill be honest with you i had one party interested in purchasing it i wasnt against it
8415693 when former police chief fowler was in office he didnt think it was big enough to put a police station in
8415694 current police chief gary stoldt one of his captains and i looked at it and we think we could build a nice police station there and use the current police building for storage which is a couple feet away from there
8415695 there has been board consensus and talk about putting up this up on the market this has been delayed for so long and maybe you should not put all your eggs in one basket harper industrial and put the building up for sale sometimes you have to take a little bit of a hit when you put it up on the market but it would put it back on the tax rolls lets do it
8415696 its not an easy fix if the board decides to sell it finds a place to store the materials then well get an appraiser that will tell us what its worth
8415697 my whole body had shut down i was in absolute terror
8415698 in my mind it wasnt just that they were trying to scare me i thought that they were going to kill me
8415699 a national ban on junk food advertising during childrens tv viewing hours is a sensible first step in tackling childhood obesity
8415700 an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure
8415701 recent comprehensive and systematic reviews of the evidence show that food advertising affects what children eat what they prefer to eat and what they pester their parents for
8415702 for some time now the opc has been calling for national legislation to ban junk food advertising at peak times when children are actually watching television and to substantially restrict all other forms of promotion of unhealthy food to children and adolescents
8415703 the federal government needs to put in place legislation that protects children supports parents and does not undermine campaigns to promote healthy lifestyles
8415704 it is a shame that the revised standards have put broadcasters revenue before our childrens health

8415716 there peter ould i believe the issue is with the lack of the specific father role model wayne leman
8415717 everywhere else countries are moving to end this abhorrent practice but in iran the numbers of death sentences seem to be increasing
8415718 killing people for crimes committed as children provides neither justice nor safety for iranian society
8415719 the iranian authorities willingness to lie to lawyers and to deprive families of a last chance to see their loved ones only underscores the depravity of these executions
8415720 the breakup of the soviet union provided the opportunity for two regions within georgia to flex their own muscles
8415721 conflicts between the georgian army and armed groups of separatists in abkhazia and south ossetia have resulted in the deaths of thousands of people and displaced more than 300 000 civilians
8415722 the course of history must not depend entirely on what the georgian president is saying
8415723 they just ran they abandoned their posts at the start of the bombing of gori
8415724 we showed the whole world what good peacekeepers the georgians are so in the end we just told them good bye
8415725 they said no we cant help georgians whoever pays us money we have to do what they want
8415726 why does everyone support them why are we the bad ones here
8415727 our children have been through this once and no one paid attention now the world does but why cant they understand we dont want to live with the georgians and thats it

8415736 we are looking at all the options really at this moment in time so i cant really say much more

8415747 in a cavernous auditorium in birmingham alabama this past january i heard barack obama tell my state that our generation can find its way again

8415785 however the ministry is aware that while the ratio is very low in some schools there are some urban schools that have very high teacher student ratio because they have high student enrolment
8415786 it has been discovered also that other schools also located in urban centres have very low teacher student ratios
8415787 the uneven distribution is evident and the freedom of choice by parents as allowed under the education act is a critical factor
8415788 it is for this reason that principals have been reminded to keep their student population within the approved school level or classification

8415803 an executive producer helps provide the resources a filmmaker needs to make a movie in my case i bought some microphones for tariq because the movie was accepted for showing at the venice film festival i am eligible for an industry credential

8415827 they del martin and phyllis lyon defined from my perspective what marriage was supposed to be about
8415828 years ago to put a human face on the issue of gay marriage we called phyllis and del to be the test case del martin came to her second wedding in a wheelchair del and phyllis were on their way to their 56th anniversary we had a gift of a lifetime to allow them both to say i do yet again
8415829 we are greatly saddened by the passing of such an extraordinary and courageous woman
8415830 del martin and her partner of 55 years phyllis lyon fought for decades to secure equal rights for all americans regardless of sex or sexual orientation
8415831 we can see in retrospect that the ruling came just in time for del and phyllis to gain what they so dearly deserved equal state legal recognition and rights for their 55 years together its wonderful that the recent legal advances in california enabled such a fitting tribute

8415863 we have been waiting some time for this decision from the fda and we are pleased to finally receive our clia waiver the granting of the clia waiver is expected to greatly impact our relationship with our laboratory alliance as up until this point the lab alliance has been obtaining clia waived devices from another supplier now that our rapid tox device is clia waived they will be obtaining all of their urine based point of collection devices from abmc
8415864 clia waiver also allows us to complete our negotiations with several distributors who service the physician and hospital market we are anxious to be able to penetrate new markets with our products and this waiver opens the first door for us i expect to see an immediate impact on sales beginning in the fourth quarter of this year and ramping up throughout 2009
8415865 in spite of the problems and expenses related to this in 2007 our chief science officer martin gould and director of quality assurance and regulatory affairs richard reilly have completed this first waiver well under budget in 2008 we expect future waiver applications to be more cost effective and expedient due to their efforts

8415872 we want cme to be unbiased and science driven and we dont want it to be influenced by marketing we want our educational activities for whomever we are serving whether its our own faculty or our colleagues in the community locally or globally to be true to the science and the evidence and not be influenced by any kind of financial industry support
8415873 bias either by appearance or reality has become woven into the very fabric of continuing education
8415874 under the present system in many circumstances a cme course will be held only if a commercial company is willing to sponsor it
8415875 while for profit enterprises may occasionally engage in philanthropy it should not be surprising that the core motivation of pharmaceutical and medical device industries in supporting cme is to market their products and services
8415876 this leads to a cme curriculum which is at least in part designed to address market needs rather than being entirely focused upon improving performance of practicing physicians
8415877 clearly it would be preferable for stanford faculty to design our cme curriculum solely based upon the needs of our learners as they seek to address the health care needs of their patients
8415878 we all agreed it is inappropriate for industry to influence content
8415879 if industry really wants to enhance the education of clinicians they should be given the opportunity to do so
8415880 but we wanted to create a situation in which they had no effect on the choice of topics or their content so were happy to have industry support as long as it is provided without strings or expectations about the course content
8415881 really brings control of cme curricula back to academic medical centers
8415882 one of my hopes is to make stanford a destination so we can hold cme programs here leveraging the wonderful cultural attractions on campus
8415883 i think right now industry is under a lot of pressure in its use of marketing for education theyre re examining their role in cme as well
8415884 as we take this step my hope is that other institutions will start to follow suit i think the climate will change dramatically to enforce that if institutions do not take greater responsibility there is going to be a mandate whether its one that we initiate or one that is imposed that frees up these intertwined interactions of academia and industry around medical education

8415895 its my belief that a lot of visual effects houses basically ignore federal and state labor law and dont pay overtime for a lot of the job positions that they have
8415896 a lot of people in the non union cgi world tend to sidestep they just look at the weekly check they dont look at the number of hours they work to earn the money in the weekly check
8415897 i dont believe in fair or unfair i believe in leverage if you have the leverage to get what you want youll get it
8415898 overtime is basically something that was put into place not so much so that an individual crew member would make a lot of money in a given week overtime was originally setup so that there would be a financial incentive not to overwork people
8415899 the first thing that anybody thats working in the industry should do is know what their legal rights are under law know what the labor regs say know what the company should be doing

8415904 the private sector and governments are in a catch 22 situation with regard to tackling climate change in which governments feel limited in their ability to introduce new climate change policy because they fear business resistance while companies are unable to scale up investment in low carbon solutions because of the absence of long term policies

8415961 the gulf of mexico area has a large percentage of oil production and refining
8415962 when katrina hit it knocked out 8 percent of the refining capacity for supplies of retail gas to go down by 8 percent is a huge shock to the system
8415963 over the course of three or four days that type of hike was unheard of at the time
8415964 i dont think weve seen anything like that since gas has been high this summer but it was more of a gradual increase
8415965 more often than not if crude oil prices are going up oil companies will pre emptively raise gas prices to slow demand
8415966 oil companies dont like to scare off consumers if they can ease people into price hikes consumers are less likely to change their habits

8416011 it let me find a little bit of peace and discover who i was as a person
8416012 not the person who the press made me out to be because id had a few bad experiences in my personal life and i was struggling to figure out a bad husband or a bad boyfriend and i was doing it under the spotlight so i wasnt reacting well to any of it

8416044 we dropped the price only 5 000 but we listed it down below 10 000 what she paid for it 2 years ago so today were 15 000 below what she paid for it
8416045 theres a whole glut of town homes especially clustered together
8416046 the inventory levels today are huge they represent about 27 percent of total homes on the market today

8416050 id have to say its my weirdest night as a professional in the big leagues
8416051 i knew there was a possibility so it wasnt a complete shock when i got called in and was told i would be scratched from the lineup due to precautionary reasons the club was in discussions for possibly moving me
8416052 if thats the case if im moved to a club that has postseason possibilities you cant be disappointed as a player
8416053 ive had a lot of fun here and ive been happy with bobby cox and the organization

8416058 to wrest that distinction from us a guy in a chicken suit and el homo loco were our biggest stars we had a scientologist boy band and a mexican viking people threw tortillas at us the promoters actually passed them out before the show and encouraged the boozehounds party girls and retro hipsters that pressed themselves up against the ring to fling them at the wrestlers
8416059 started out in the south of market club scene and ended up selling out the fillmore more times than many rock stars
8416060 combined two sets of surreal satire dressed up as masked mexican wresting with raucous post punk sets by bands like the super suckers nofx the dickies and the queers at our height billie joe armstrong of green day and james hetfield of metallica could be seen shouting at ringside jello biafra of the dead kennedys often played the part of a bad guy manager and fred durst of limp biskit once even begged to get into our wrestling ring

8416093 thank you for your email i still have it for sale but before i answer to any of your questions i want to inform you that i cant handle this tranasction the old fashioned way because i travel a lot with business and cant do this by my self however i will use craigs trader to handle th transaction for me i know alot of people that don t know about craigs trader so if you are still interested and don t know about this service let me know and i ll fill you in with the rest of the details thank you marvin
8416094 ok i m glad that you re still interested like i said before i will explain how craigs trader works they are the first and only trading service on craigslist and act as an escrow service so they have the item in their custody packed and insured for shipping if you decide to purchase the item i will need your full name and shipping address and will forward this information to them they will send you an invoice and the payment instructions you will pay one of their agents and as soon as the payment is confirmed by them they will start the shipping process you will have a 10 day money back guarantee starting from the day you receive the item and if by any reason the item is not as expected you will return it and they will send you a full refund if you accept it they will make all the necessary paperwork and transfer the payment to me the pick up or viewing is not an option because their service allows you to inspect the item before i get paid and you can return it with no questions asked they keep the item in one of their warehouses and there is no escrow service out there that allows the buyer to pick up the item the shipping is included in the price of sale so you don t have to worry about that if you want to find out more about this service you can visit their website at www craigstrader com maybe there are some things i forgot to mention and you can find them there i used them before and it s a pretty god service especially if you don t have the time to do the selling all by yourself like i said i m traveling a lot with business and i don t have the time to handle a transaction if you accept the terms and would like to try this please let me have your full name and shipping address and i ll get the ball rolling they will contact you by email so if you have other email accounts please forward them to me because i want to be sure that they send you the invoice in time i hope you understand everything i explained and if you have other questions let me know and i ll be glad to answer them thank you marvin

8416099 how many events do you think i should be working
8416100 well you know we had a long primary season which means that a lot of stuff was backed up
8416101 which means that ive got to still do work preparing for thursday night
8416102 people know that i can give the kind of speech that i gave four years ago
8416103 theyre more interested in what am i going to do to help them in their lives so in that sense i think this is going to be a more workmanlike speech im not aiming for a lot of high rhetoric im much more concerned with communicating how i intend to help middle class families
8416104 the better off this campaign is going to be because i think i can make the case im the right choice for them thats what i want to spend my time doing
8416105 i was surprised given the convention but i think its great hes here
8416106 seems to know what were thinking what we need hes not one of those multimillionaire guys
8416107 there is no witness so dreadful no accuser so terrible as the conscience that dwells in the heart of every man
8416108 obamas not my cup of tea but ill vote for him for the partys sake
8416109 the older people are just not that into obama because hes black
8416110 the democrats have to wake up and smell the coffee
8416111 they need to know theres a new man in town
8416112 id have to say no because hollywood has not seen a lot of return on movies like that its a spy thriller and is set against that backdrop it actually has interesting ideas and is thought provoking
8416113 more and more were seeing people willing to take that on and really bust that idea out but this one doesnt really do that it kind of tiptoes around it instead of taking it on fully i dont think our movie really does it has elements that get into it
8416114 not on our watch the mission to end genocide in darfur and beyond
8416115 i had been doing other things prior to hotel rwanda but nothing on the level of activism
8416116 what drew me in after i was done with that movie i was asked to go on a congressional delegation to sudan once i did that i kind of got pulled into the stream
8416117 he met with several of us about seven of us
8416118 he wanted to sort of get our opinion on what he should do but nobody tells spielberg what to do
8416119 i think that would be one of the most difficult things with where we are at in that very few people in this country in the state department in the cia even speak arabic and who could ever infiltrate those organizations being so insular
8416120 your chances of making it in this business are very very slim its like wanting to be a professional basketball player as a dream even if you happen to be 6 foot 8 its an exceptionally long shot
8416121 it was never my way or the highway instead it was great having someone like him to talk to about where i was going with this story obviously he has so much experience writing that his opinion carries an awful lot of weight but it was never a forced thing
8416122 ninety percent of the stowaway was written by geno with me standing right next to him and helping along the way i helped to guide him on the pacing of the story and the growth of the characters
8416123 ive read everything about him since ive been able to read i know drizzt as much as anyone alive
8416124 fantasy is like an idealized reality and the core of fantasy is the one person can make a difference
8416125 the big difference is that this story is told from the perspective of a 12 year old we didnt tone down any of these scenes although we did tone down the violence theres more chase and less violence but we dont want to talk down to teens theyre pretty sharp
8416126 im going to teach him how to survive on the road what you really have to do is take pleasure in the people you are meeting
8416127 writing can be a tough gig whenever you do something in which you put yourself out there if that becomes the focus of your life you miss the point of living
8416128 youve really got to get the grounding of family and the things that are important in your life and make that your focus

8416131 were celebrating free speech as much as you can do it
8416132 but when a group looks like theyre bent on destruction and violence we have to step in
8416133 what do we do when we have a bar fight
8416134 we surround them and divide them and get them out of the bar
8416135 i dont see anybody dead i dont see anybody in the hospital
8416136 obviously were getting lost in the hype and the hoopla in the convention talking about issues at home finally but we need to readdress the war
8416137 barack obama will be a commander in chief who understands that young americans in uniform must never be committed to a mistake but always to a mission worthy of their bravery
8416138 the average american doesnt have ownership in the war in iraq the policy has been to go shopping health care the economy was well down on the list now the economy is number one
8416139 people are worried about the alligator closest to the canoe and the alligator closest to the canoe to most americans is the economy

8416325 americans the british and the germans worry about the direct threat to israel from iran and fear irans potential to share nuclear technology with terrorist groups
8416326 all countries want diplomacy over military action to address this threat the germans oppose military action for historical and cultural reasons and the british do not want another iraq yet the americans are more open to military action especially if a diplomatic solution fails to become a reality
8416327 the threat of a nuclear iran isnt a democratic issue or a republican issue its a concern for all peace loving people who dont want to live under the constant threat of a nuclear attack by an unstable regime and its terrorist proxies hezbollah and hamas let us not forget that iran is the worlds largest state sponsor of terror and continually threatens to attack the u s and europe

8416329 i have urged the colonization of the negroes back to africa and i shall continue my emancipation proclamation was linked with this plan of colonization there is no room for two distinct races of white men in america much less for two distinct races of whites and blacks i can think of no greater calamity than the assimilation of the negro into our social and political life as our equal within twenty years we can peacefully colonize the negro under conditions in which he can rise to the full measure of manhood this he can never do here we can never attain the ideal union our fathers dreamed with millions of an alien inferior race among us whose assimilation is neither possible nor desirable
8416330 you and we are different races we have between us a broader difference than exists between almost any other two races whether it is right or wrong i need not discuss but this physical difference is a great disadvantage to us both as i think your race suffer very greatly many of them by living among us while ours suffer from your presence in a word we suffer on each side if this be admitted it affords a reason at least why we should be separated

8416336 a national ban on junk food advertising during childrens tv viewing hours is a sensible first step in tackling childhood obesity
8416337 an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure
8416338 recent comprehensive and systematic reviews of the evidence show that food advertising affects what children eat what they prefer to eat and what they pester their parents for
8416339 for some time now the opc has been calling for national legislation to ban junk food advertising at peak times when children are actually watching television and to substantially restrict all other forms of promotion of unhealthy food to children and adolescents
8416340 the federal government needs to put in place legislation that protects children supports parents and does not undermine campaigns to promote healthy lifestyles

8416367 even though hip hop is a form of music about which many people have little understanding i knew immediately that this story had potential for wide appeal
8416368 loosely based on shakespeares stories of henry iv and falstaff clay employs the humor intensity and lyricism of contemporary hip hop music to tell the coming of age story of a teenage boy named clifford
8416369 escaping the dysfunction of his family clifford flees the suburbs and seeks his future in the city where he falls under the tutelage of a rapper named sir john together they transform clifford into clay a rising hip hop star
8416370 hip hop is a powerful and emotional musical genre that has now become a global phenomenon

8416380 it was the stillness before you went on the air that was so dramatic
8416381 because everybody would be in place in plenty of time but everybody would be silent nobody talking nobody moving the hands on the keys but not moving the only thing moving was the second hand on the big clock and then when it hit the top everybody started to move it was very dramatic that peace that calm before you took the dive into it it was a great thrilling moment and you suddenly loved every actor and you just wanted them all to be rich and have children and go to happy graves

8416389 i wanted it to be along the lines of the kinds of records marty paitch and to speak of not a lot of piano the horns sort of lead the way over the bass and the drums that way the piano and the guitar are more like soloists the first call that i made was to arranger don sebesky i told him i wanted to use horns on six of the tracks he just ate that up he was very excited because those torm records are some of his favorites
8416390 it was just a matter of how i wanted to present the songs we did all of our homework in a three week period we made a decision about the concept we got the best people we could find and we recorded the album in two days everyone was on their game it couldnt have gone better
8416391 don sebesky arranged that recording which is why the song appears on this record the ensemble section after the piano solo on my record is a harmonization of chets first chorus on the version from his record
8416392 used to play this when my father and i opened for him when i was a kid
8416393 benny loved this song my father has just recently started playing it again in his show so thats why its on this record

8416408 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8416409 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8416410 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8416411 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8416412 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8416579 nature never intended the infants stomach to be converted into a receptacle for laxatives carminatives antacids stimulants and astringents and when these become necessary we may rest assured that there is something faulty in our management however perfect it may seem to ourselves
8416580 to feed an infant with animal food before it has teeth proper for masticating it shows a total disregard to the plain indications of nature in withholding such teeth till the system requires their assistance to masticate solid food and the method of grating and pounding meat as a substitute for chewing may be well suited to the toothless octogenarian whose stomach is capable of digesting it but the stomach of a young child is not adapted to the digestion of such food and will be disordered by it it cannot reasonably be maintained that a childs mouth without teeth and that of an adult furnished with the teeth of carnivorous and graminivorous animals are designed by the creator for the same sort of food if the mastication of solid food whether animal or vegetable and a due admixture of saliva be necessary for digestion then solid food cannot be proper when there is no power of mastication if it is swallowed in large masses it cannot be masticated at all and will have but a small chance of being digested and in an undigested state it will prove injurious to the stomach and to the other organs concerned in digestion by forming unnatural compounds the practice of giving solid food to a toothless child is not less absurd than to expect corn to be ground where there is no apparatus for grinding it that which would be considered as an evidence of idiotism or insanity in the last instance is defended and practised in the former if on the other hand to obviate this evil the solid matter whether animal or vegetable be previously broken into small masses the infant will instantly swallow it but it will be unmixed with saliva yet in every days observation it will be seen that children are so fed in their most tender age and it is not wonderful that present evils are by this means produced and the foundation laid for future disease

8416734 the gulf of mexico area has a large percentage of oil production and refining
8416735 when katrina hit it knocked out 8 percent of the refining capacity for supplies of retail gas to go down by 8 percent is a huge shock to the system
8416736 over the course of three or four days that type of hike was unheard of at the time
8416737 i dont think weve seen anything like that since gas has been high this summer but it was more of a gradual increase
8416738 more often than not if crude oil prices are going up oil companies will pre emptively raise gas prices to slow demand
8416739 oil companies dont like to scare off consumers if they can ease people into price hikes consumers are less likely to change their habits
8416740 weve seen gas prices come down significantly but its still high and supplies are tight its a bad time to have a hurricane on a holiday weekend
8416741 when people leave organizations today they are potentially taking with them knowledge thats critical to the future of the business

8416745 they are spending their last months making it more difficult to put needed protections for workers in place in the future
8416746 but when you have a well recognized hazard like coal mine dust
8416747 the only thing it gets you is additional years of rulemaking and that translates into delayed protection
8416748 to slip through a rule that may have a profound negative impact on the health and safety of american workers
8416749 the more things change the more they stay the same
8416750 this board meets once a month and they get right down into the weeds on marketing strategy and financing issues they want to make decisions that i and my executive team should be making hasnt anyone taught them the difference between governance and management
8416751 since 2002 weve moved so dramatically on the international scene that our board has been left behind i feel like a teacher explaining to them whats going on in the business today and they all smile and say thats great believe me im happy they dont get in our way but i would give anything to have people who could challenge our thinking on the issues were confronting or who have dealt with these issues themselves
8416752 who are these people where do they reside at what level can they contribute
8416753 our company doesnt need a massive change we dont need someone from outside who would be so different in terms of style and thinking
8416754 when the board and the individuals are ready i am prepared to move on and do something else with my life
8416755 unexpected ceo departures provide a window into the quality of governance
8416756 every board should have in place an emergency ceo succession plan just in case the ceo is unexpectedly incapable of doing his or her job if the board appears to make the plan up in the heat of firing a ceo this highlights the board did not focus on emergency ceo succession planning
8416757 empowerment does have a huge impact because now we can meet the needs of our students and they deserve it the school and the teachers are so excited
8416758 empowerment schools have exceeded the district averages in academic performance

8416760 so two years ago a group of kids who appeared to be deep in a ditch are now breathing thin air high atop a summit of school achievement
8416761 just because theyre audit committees there is no better director in any certain committee the audit committee may not be the most difficult to serve on in some cases each board member has a dramatic role to play its not that i think there shouldnt be disparity between the pays it just shouldnt be dramatic
8416762 some pay all in equity some strictly in cash its one of those things its difficult to have hard rules where everyone should do this or that every company is different
8416763 there are situations where youve got to pay them boards for the value of time
8416764 i think meeting fees makes sense to me it just makes the simplicity of it appealing
8416765 you know i just dont have anything for you on the vp front im not campaigning for that what im doing is campaigning for john mccain want to make sure that hes elected and that barack obama is able to go back to the senate and get the experience that i think he needs

8416768 sandwiched between a restaurant and supermarket 100 anti population protesters spent their second starving day in a plastic enclosure the so called hunger show a week long starve in aimed at dramatizing mans future in an overpopulated underfed world
8416769 you who believe fasting is prescribed for you as it was prescribed for those before you
8416770 the month of ramadan is the one in which the quran was sent down as guidance for mankind with clear signs containing guidance and discrimination any of you who are resident for the month should fast it but any of you who are ill or on a journey should fast a number of other days
8416771 allah the mighty and exalted said every action of the son of adam is for himself except for fasting it is mine and i repay it fasting is a shield when someone is fasting he should not have sexual relations nor quarrel if someone fights him or insults him he should say i am fasting by the one in whose hand the self of muhammad is the changed breath in the mouth of the faster is more fragrant to allah than the scent of musk the faster experiences two joys when he breaks his fast he rejoices and when he meets his lord he rejoices in his fasting
8416772 he has left his food and drink and appetites for my sake fasting is mine and i repay it any other good deed i repay with ten like it
8416773 fasting is mine and i repay it he leaves his appetites and food for my sake the faster experiences two joys a joy when he breaks his fast and a joy when he meets his lord the changed breath in the mouth of the faster is more fragrant to allah than the scent of musk
8416774 the one who spends out two kinds of actions in the way of allah will be summoned from the gates of the garden and told o slave of allah this is better all the people who did the prayer will be called from the gate of the prayer all the people who did jihad will be called from the gate of jihad all the people who fasted will be called from the gate of rayyan all the people who gave sadaqa will be called from the gate of sadaqa
8416775 may my father and mother be sacrificed for you messenger of allah no one called from those gates will feel distress will anyone be called from all those gates
8416776 yes and i hope that you will be among them
8416777 there is a gate in the garden called ar rayyan which those who fast will enter on the day of rising and none but they will enter it
8416778 no slave fasts one day in the way of allah without allah putting his face seventy years journey away from the fire on account of that day
8416779 anyone who prays in ramadan motivated by belief and in expectation of the reward will be forgiven his past wrong actions
8416780 when ramadan comes the gates of the garden are opened the gates of the fire are closed and the shaytans are chained up
8416781 fast when you see it the new moon and break the fast when you see it if it is cloudy then make shaban complete with thirty days
8416782 the latest downtempo masterpiece that he has released under the name nightmares on wax
8416783 let me tell you a story i too at times
8416784 it is as if there are two wolves inside me one is good and does no harm he lives in harmony with all around him and does not take offense when no offense was intended he will only fight when it is right to do so and in the right way but the other wolf ah he is full of anger the littlest thing will send him into a fit of temper he fights everyone all the time for no reason he cannot think because his anger and hate are so great it is helpless anger for his anger will change nothing sometimes it is hard to live with these two wolves inside me for both of them try to dominate my spirit
8416785 dont cry because its over but smile because it happened

8416833 eventually i started fashioning my own equipment and began churning out some fine quality chocolate
8416834 it is extremely hard work and takes a lot of time but boy is it beautiful when you get right
8416835 chocolate is an affordable indulgence no matter how difficult economic times get well always want to treat ourselves
8416836 now you can go to kansas city and find a good chocolate maker who rivals the quality and craftsmanship of that you would find in europe
8416837 people love chocolate especially in hard times when they want to be comforted

8416853 im not saying ill need to get on the welfare line
8416854 but all my pay comes from the performance of the company im opposed to guaranteed salary stock options and the rest of it the philosophy is that senior management does well when the company does well
8416855 with this gesture the executive is calling him or herself an employee in chief and saying he or she will fall with the fate of the company
8416856 of course it can be a double edged sword since in doing so theyre inevitably pointing to their own wealthy status that effectively as far as pay is concerned they can take it or leave it

8417080 it was considered that the human health and safety considerations must come first
8417081 tamworth also tested positive to serological tests indicating past infection with hendra virus the serum neutralisation test used is regarded as the gold standard for detection of antibody response to hendra virus infection

8417083 we also seriously considered the option of long term quarantine and monitoring of the surviving horse
8417084 it was considered that the human health and safety considerations must come first

8417102 we play a lot of shows and we learned early on that if all of our songs sound the same its pretty boring to play night after night

8417107 i was riding the heat jumping into the wagon box then id jump off the wagonbox onto the outriding horse and not even miss a heat
8417108 i really want to concentrate on making calgary stampede i got to start concentrating on driving
8417109 its a team thing its tough to get into this sport without a family

8417112 in the wpca youve just got more top end competitors
8417113 the cpca still has lots of good drivers and lots of tough drivers but theres a few more of them in the wpca
8417114 fuelwatch has a lot going for it and it didnt justify some of the criticisms that were appearing about it
8417115 so we just wanted to set the record straight about what evidence wed received
8417116 it was just an attempt to get the facts straight it was just an attempt to inform people
8417117 i invite people to read the report and they will see that its not based on the evidence we heard and i think theyll also understand that the attempt to breathe new life into fuelwatch has not revived the corpse that fuelwatch is
8417118 at the end of the day we are obliged to serve the best interests of the australian people and we could not let it pass through the senate knowing that australians would be paying higher prices for their petrol and that is something that we are not willing to countenance
8417119 based on the missouri democrat delegation being seated in the nose bleed section at the democrat national convention it does not appear as if anything has changed missouri is not a priority for democrats
8417120 other indicia of the lack of commitment to missouri included network televisions coverage of claire mccaskills remarks many networks didnt cover her entire address but rather had commentators speaking and asking who she was if the democrats cared about missouri they would have briefed the media on the importance of her remarks
8417121 we are preparing and planning a public course of action once again using mass media in response to what the dnc has done to the process itself
8417122 she comes out of this week in denver and the entire election season as a bigger and more powerful figure than she ever was before

8417125 he earned this day his actions call out for the death penalty
8417126 i am so glad this is over justice has been served
8417127 this defendant uses the time that he has to think out these plans and he is dangerous
8417128 generally for human beings its pretty hard to maintain impartiality when confronted with such horror
8417129 how could any juror not want to see this person removed from our list of living human beings how could you live with yourself as a juror if theres any chance this human being could escape from jail and do something like this again

8417133 i support barack obama because america needs a president who has the strength wisdom and courage to talk to our enemies and consult with our allies a president who has the judgment to use war as a last resort not a first resort
8417134 the time has come for a president who has lived the american dream who is on our side a president who will cut our dependence on foreign oil and lead us into the new energy frontier a president who will make us stronger and safer as americans
8417135 no matter where we stood at the beginning of this campaign democrats stand together today we believe passionately in barack obamas message of changing the direction of our country we support enthusiastically his plans to restore the american dream for american families and we stand united proudly in our determination to elect barack obama

8417142 n o posso imaginar bill clinton n o falando sobre economia que um tema que ele gosta muito e pelo qual muito respeitado seus feitos na presid ncia neste quesito s o unanimidade

8417161 el presidente ch vez me ha pedido que contin e trabajando con la ciudad de caracas y con los nuevos alcaldes a fin de utilizar la experiencia que hemos tenido en londres para que caracas se transforme en una ciudad del primer mundo es un honor que se me haya confiado la tarea de asesorar a los candidatos para que caracas se haga m s vivible para sus habitantes

8417170 as an actress its so easy to be passive in your career just waiting around for somebody to give you a ring and tell you to show up on set in a week or not
8417171 i thought we know what happens to actresses in their 40s and 50s
8417172 but what happens when youre a model or a playboy bunny and youre too old what skills do you have

8417189 on monday the rubber dinghy started taking water and it overturned with the immigrants drowned
8417190 they just kept holding on to the dinghy until last night they were spotted by the maltese fishing vessel
8417191 my appeal goes to the government to release these immigrants from the detention centre because of their health and traumatic conditions
8417192 nothwithstanding that they know about previous tragedies these desperate people still try and make the journey to europe
8417193 reach out to religious voters and anti abortion democrats and independents
8417194 build a coalition largely of pro choice people but with some a few pro lifers in order to win 60 seats in the u s senate
8417195 an example of senator obamas ability to find common ground
8417196 having senator casey up there who disagrees with barack obama on the issue of abortion who will talk about it and talk about how they disagree but how he respects obama and the way he handles this issue its something that they hope catholic voters will be listening to
8417197 respect for the views of people who may disagree with him
8417198 while it unequivocally endorses a womans right to abortion and the roe v wade supreme court decision affirming it the platform also includes calls for support for alternatives to abortion those measures include improved prenatal care better financing for sex education family planning and parenting classes and more help for adoption
8417199 build a coalition largely of pro choice people but with some a few pro lifers in order to win 60 seats in the u s senate
8417200 you want to vote according to what is in your heart i am not going to tell you what to do you have come from different places and made a long journey
8417201 president clinton will lay out the choices that we face on foreign policy
8417202 he will talk about how barack obama has what it takes to be a strong commander in chief
8417203 obama says iran is a tiny country doesnt pose a serious threat
8417204 while barack obama recognizes that iran has been the biggest beneficiary of the war in iraq and that the bush mccain fear of tough diplomacy has allowed iran to spin 3800 centrifuges threaten israel and fund terrorism john mccain promises more of the same
8417205 if john mccain was serious about dealing with the threat from iran he would join barack obamas bipartisan effort in the senate to step up sanctions on iran instead of adopting the same tired old bush rove playbook
8417206 you make that sound keith i can do the same to you okay thats what i thought all right and i said it
8417207 discussing hillary clintons upcoming speech matthews began talking about women s reactions to hillary his producers likely wary of any more cries of sexism against the host and the network presumably tried to get him to wrap as he said ill wrap in a second ill wrap in a second
8417208 olbermann then tried to attribute matthews point about women voters to rachel maddow to which matthews said good ideas can be shared
8417209 then when introducing steny hoyer olbermann mocked matthews for going off at the mouth and made a hand gesture implying that matthews talked forever
8417210 were really happy to get a quality player who is also a quality person back to our team especially this time of year
8417211 this is very encouraging in that people that otherwise could not afford to can now buy vegetable or fruit plants to feed themselves at home
8417212 le gouvernement aurait bien tort de penser que notre m moire puisse tre d faillante sil ne tient pas ses engagements le conflit quil aura vit en juillet aura lieu coup s r en octobre
8417213 there is no doubt that it was a great missed opportunity to prevent people like you who shaped the minds of the generation to come to israel and perform
8417214 the worst thing that can happen in this economy is everybody has to pay double and triple the taxes and thats what sen barack obama is looking to do
8417215 donald when you go out to your all mogul lunches and dinners when you sit around with the other people who have where theyre very successful what do they say who is the better president with the better philosophy and principles for you whos going to make you richer whos going to make the country better
8417216 i think from a business standpoint they like sen john mccain because they like his taxing policies this is a very fragile economy its an economy thats not doing well the worst thing that can happen is everybody has to pay double and triple the taxes and thats what sen barack obama is looking to do
8417217 obama would give larger tax cuts to low and moderate income households and pay some of the cost by raising taxes on high income taxpayers in contrast mccain would cut taxes across the board and give the biggest cuts to the highest income households
8417218 all right donald before you go youve got to tell us about the celebrity apprentice
8417219 well be talking and negotiating over the next few days and i expect the picture to be clearer by the end of next week the next few weeks are going to be hard as we say goodbye to valued colleagues and good friends
8417220 and the exciting part of that is we dont have any of these structures recorded in the whitewater valley
8417221 rocky mountain gas is cheaper and bringing that gas to indiana and ohio we hope is going to have a positive impact on the market
8417222 tart dried cherries from michigan they cost a fortune if you buy them in the supermarket if you like them ive got more where that came from i ordered four pounds
8417223 i havent let you down before and heidis melons heidi montag and spencer pratt shop for snap ron jeremy in the early 80s you
8417224 its not too much different from preparing for any other speech but because youre on a clock trying to fit a certain media schedule this is a far more organized and disciplined operation than youd see in any other setting
8417225 they want you to know where to go how the podium works how to use the teleprompter
8417226 they help you get into the convention center which is a big help in itself
8417227 it really is a special vantage point to watch the convention
8417228 my management style is different i wanted to have one person in charge
8417229 it works great because you have one individual whos responsible for everything
8417230 if they forgot their tie or they have a dirty shirt we have wardrobe
8417231 someone may show up late there may be traffic we may just want to move something around
8417232 most people overestimate the amount they can actually say in a speech with a time limit
8417233 i know this will break your heart but you have better credentials than the mainstream media does
8417234 in 2004 the state party wouldnt even return my calls theyve shown us a lot of faith and innovation to be letting us do what were doing
8417235 part of what this convention is about is making sure people know who is
8417236 blogging widens the participation it lowers the barrier to entry so we dont have to worry about one persons bias serving as a gatekeeper
8417237 people are just beginning to learn that cutting their meat consumption has a big impact on global warming
8417238 people think that they have to go out and buy a new car or take a drastic step like that but the best thing they can do is as simple as changing their diet
8417239 i never heard of it before but is seems like a good idea
8417240 there are a lot of difference things that we should tax like gas i dont know if meat is one of them
8417241 when i realized i was supporting that with my meals i couldnt sit down to a meal then i learned the health benefits
8417242 the amount of methane released by a cow each day is amazing

8417256 allesercito tedesco viene rinfacciato di avere utilizzato nella sua guerra contro le spietate uccisioni perpetrate dei partigiani contrarie al diritto internazionale quote di rappresaglia da uno a 10 e raramente maggiori quale misura dissuasiva
8417257 4 aprile 1992 dopo decenni scrisse sullo svolgersi di quel fatto

8417277 the area where your candidate senator mccain has admitted weakness has been famously economics
8417278 mr mayor now that senator clinton has spoken to this gathering and president clinton tonight and presumably the democrats will leave here thursday after obamas speech saying they are united as one
8417279 now the other thing is of course with so many speeches at the podium you hear this kind of generic cry to get out of iraq and while theres talk of schedules and drawdowns you know better than most that to get out of iraq you may run into a newly inaugurated president may run right into a joint chiefs that is unwilling to do so and says hold on how can we even put an air bridge together to get everything out of there and what happens in our wake how do you counsel a barack obama on this kind of thing

8417281 have been financed by islamic charities of the iranian regime based in california and by the silicon iran network
8417282 in exchange the senator does his best to aid the mullahs
8417283 i believe than an improved relationship with iran is in the naked self interest of the united states of america
8417284 we had hoped that after the 11 september attacks the iranian regime would end its support for terrorists
8417285 but iran did not stop its support for terror indeed the hard line elements of the iranian regime facilitated the movement of terrorists escaping from afghanistan
8417286 biden has been too cozy with the supporters of the iranian regime which is anti american anti iranian and has a horrendous human rights record
8417287 this is because the iranians instead of empowering the lobby supporting them undermine it
8417288 senator joseph biden said that even if iran was a full democracy like india it would want nuclear capability like india what the world needed to address was irans emotional needs he said with a nonaggression pact
8417289 he really impressed us by his grasp of world affairs
8417290 he encouraged us to make our views known and to get more involved in american politics
8417291 iran always wanted to be an ally of the united states and to have good relations with the u s
8417292 as iranian americans we dont want anything to happen to the iranian government or to the iranian people as a result of this war on terrorism
8417293 mr youssefi has earned the reputation of being a vocal supporter of iran us rapprochement and d tente
8417294 in march of 2000 he created fairpac the foundation for american iranian rapprochement a political advocacy council as a means of informing and educating interested persons everywhere of the benefits of improved u s iran relations
8417295 iapac has no relationship with the islamic republic of iran and is not focused on u s policy towards iran establishing ties with or legitimizing the government of iran
8417296 highlights the need to really investigate the web of iranian influence in the united states
8417297 what you have here is a group of people who have been working together through different groups and organizations for the past ten years

8417302 the gulf of mexico area has a large percentage of oil production and refining
8417303 when katrina hit it knocked out 8 percent of the refining capacity for supplies of retail gas to go down by 8 percent is a huge shock to the system
8417304 over the course of three or four days that type of hike was unheard of at the time
8417305 i dont think weve seen anything like that since gas has been high this summer but it was more of a gradual increase
8417306 more often than not if crude oil prices are going up oil companies will pre emptively raise gas prices to slow demand
8417307 oil companies dont like to scare off consumers if they can ease people into price hikes consumers are less likely to change their habits
8417308 weve seen gas prices come down significantly but its still high and supplies are tight its a bad time to have a hurricane on a holiday weekend
8417309 if deemed to be at high or immediate risk of delivery prior to 32 weeks women and their doctors should consider using magnesium sulfate to prevent their child from having cerebral palsy
8417310 we define high risk as threatening delivery prior to 32 weeks
8417311 its too early to know if magnesium sulfate has an overall effect on the incidence rate of cerebral palsy

8417314 the populations that bear the greatest burden nationally blacks for example and men who have sex with men are highly represented in new york city
8417315 because hiv is more prevalent within those groups the risk of hiv infection per sexual contact is higher
8417316 this is a core group which is at high risk for getting and spreading hiv
8417317 im sure the folks at nbc news are happy about increasing their margin over their broadcast rivals for the second night of the democratic national convention
8417318 a political party is entitled to have the names of its nominees for president and vice president placed on the ballot if before 5 p m of the 70th day before presidential election day the partys state chair signs and delivers to the secretary of state a written certification of the names of the partys nominees for president and vice president
8417319 unless the state of texas violates its own election laws congressman barr will be the only presidential candidate on the ballot
8417320 we are up against them constantly in our fight to get on the ballot across the nation when we miss deadlines we get no second chances this is a great example of how unreasonable deadlines chill democracy
8417321 republicans and democrats make certain that third party candidates are held to ballot access laws no matter how absurd or unreasonable
8417322 therefore republicans and democrats should be held to the same standards
8417323 we conclude that apixabans dose may be insufficient to stop clotting and therefore resulted in less bleeding although our consultants continue to believe that it is a viable drug

8417325 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
8417326 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain

8417328 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
8417329 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
8417330 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
8417331 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table
8417332 existen en las empresas personas sensibles que est n dispuestas a trabajar para el cambio

8417360 i figured once i cleared waivers and there wasnt really any action that id finish out the season in atlanta
8417361 but this obviously is exciting to come to a club thats in the playoff race and especially one like boston that has the history of a great tradition

8417367 drug company marketing is often the only way you get information about new drugs in a timely fashion
8417368 gps receive far more information from drug companies than from independent sources the government needs to increase funding to ensure gps have better access to timely objective information
8417369 drug companies really seem to be the only ones who get out there and do it more nps attention would be wonderful
8417370 gps are bombarded with marketing and promotions from drug companies this can influence their prescribing habits and this isnt in the best interest of consumers
8417371 because the information provided isnt independent it can lead to inappropriate prescribing practices which expose consumers to unnecessary risk it can also increase the cost of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme which is funded by taxpayers

8417387 the iphone is a computer just like a desktop computer and so it can easily be booted in such a way that one can mount the disk and delete or modify the devices configuration including the passcode configuration
8417388 ive found even the most novice cop geeks have been able to crack the iphones passcode and install my forensics toolkit on the device
8417389 many criminals who once thought the incriminating evidence on their iphone was safe have come to the rude awakening that passcodes do not equate to security

8417391 a perceptually validated model for surface depth hallucination capturing depth to represent detailed surface geometry normally requires expensive specialized equipment and or collection of a large amount of data by trading accuracy for ease of capture the authors of this paper aim to recover surfaces that can be plausibly relit and viewed from any angle under any lighting this multiscale shape from shading method takes diffuse lit and flash lit image pairs and produces an albedo map and textured height field using two lighting conditions enables subtraction of one from the other to estimate albedo experimental validation shows that the method works for a broad range of textured surfaces and users are frequently unable to identify the results as synthetic in a randomized presentation
8417392 software then compares the brightness of every matching pair of pixels in the two images and calculates how much of a pixels brightness is down to its position and how much is due to its colour that information is used to produce a realistic rendering of a surfaces texture by altering the direction of illumination on the virtual surface the system can generate realistic shadow effects

8417495 he was very close to returning but the great part about michael is that he takes his time to think about things and he is very thorough
8417496 you can get excited about coming back and running through the tunnel one more time
8417497 in the end he felt he could not get back to where he was
8417498 this has been one of the toughest nights of my life
8417499 but after long deliberation and throwing around a million scenarios in my head for the past day i think its just best if i stay retired
8417500 its great having nobody put a finger on me you really put yourself through an awful lot in this league more than people realize
8417501 we know the parameters of the contract and the giants would have been generous
8417502 we knew it was a long shot but we owed it to ourselves to exhaust the possibility
8417503 we appreciate michael even considering ending his retirement he has a new career in front of him and we wish him nothing but the best as we all said when he announced his retirement michael was and is a great giant
8417504 there is a reason he went in the first round obviously
8417505 the guy he is playing behind strahan and osi and then we moved him to linebacker so obviously he is one of our top players on the team and he is going to show that he is a top defensive end in the league
8417506 we know we are a confident team and we are a playoff capable team and we have to go out and perform like it
8417507 the reason we took the underdog role last year was because everybody said it and we just went with it were not thinking like that this year we do have a chip on our shoulders and it grows more and more when somebody gives us something to feed off of
8417508 the only reason he will come back is if he wants to play
8417509 we are the great state of florida the sunshine state 833 miles of us from sea to shining sea and we believe in one vote for one person cheers and we have cast those votes the next president of the united states barack obama 136 hillary clinton 59 and one absention
8417510 lifes most urgent question is what are you doing for others
8417511 i support barack obama because america needs a president who has the strength wisdom and courage to talk to our enemies and consult with our allies a president who has the judgment to use war as a last resort not a first resort
8417512 the time has come for a president who has lived the american dream who is on our side a president who will cut our dependence on foreign oil and lead us into the new energy frontier a president who will make us stronger and safer as americans

8417529 you dont want to spend time and resources on someone if theyre just going to up and leave
8417530 the solution is to give the border patrol chief a bit of breathing space to find the right recruits

8417534 the one thing the team took out of last season is that we never gave up
8417535 we played hard the whole season and even at the end of the season when it was clear that we would not make the tournament we played for pride the fact that our season was essentially done i think our kids did a great job in staying focused in practice and we learned how you win volleyball matches and how you dont win volleyball matches
8417536 if we can get healthy we can be a pretty good team
8417537 we could get right back where we were near the top 25 health is going to be a big issue for us this year
8417538 i wish that we could announce that we have amber but she has not been 100 yet this summer
8417539 its a lot better thinking that we are going to have her she is doing well and we do not anticipate not having her last year the injuries were a big blow to our team

8417564 he has improved his first touch his link play his control he looks to have found the right balance between team play and individual play
8417565 we are hurt and disappointed we didnt play how we can we didnt have belief
8417566 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
8417567 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
8417568 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
8417569 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
8417570 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
8417571 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
8417572 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
8417573 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
8417574 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
8417575 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
8417576 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
8417577 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
8417578 who are open to doing something on the production side
8417579 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
8417580 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
8417581 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
8417582 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
8417583 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
8417584 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
8417585 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
8417586 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
8417587 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
8417588 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
8417589 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
8417590 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
8417591 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
8417592 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
8417593 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
8417594 you dont have to be a star to be in my show

8417602 i had been on vacation for a week so i caught up on reading newspapers
8417603 if we dont have adequate supply to match up with demand then we encounter some short term outages
8417604 it may require fuel tanker drivers to go farther to get it
8417605 we are meeting our planned commitment to deliver products to the magellan line
8417606 were being told demand is outstripping supply at this time
8417607 many of us are having a hard time believing that
8417608 were being told that the next six to eight weeks could be touch and go from our sources
8417609 at this point in time were kind of taking a wait and see approach
8417610 the new name stems from the latin word exire meaning
8417611 the name exeo is advanced forceful and technological which signals excellence and is highly suggestive of driving pleasure

8417618 everybody learned a lesson about staying so the highways will be twice as packed this time

8417620 we dont need anything of this magnitude to come here
8417621 a bad storm churning in the gulf could be a nightmare scenario
8417622 we might see oil prices spike 5 to 8 if it really rips into platforms
8417623 im not going to worry about it until i see it in the gulf
8417624 we are what we repeatedly do excellence then is not an act but a habit

8417629 in a way i like it because they shot up my house too
8417630 and in a way i dont like it because a few minutes ago i had to walk to the store and the police stopped me and asked me what i was doing and where i was going
8417631 something is wrong with me all the thoughts of death and killing in my head and now its true ive killed
8417632 la iniciativa ha sido mal interpretada pues su objetivo era s lo contar a trav s de internet la vida en los conventos y los relatos m s bellos de la vida de las religiosas

8417634 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
8417635 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
8417636 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
8417637 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
8417638 just so you know we know that rushs moving pictures isnt up yet
8417639 there is a technical difficulty that is being worked out ill alert you when it is all clear
8417640 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
8417641 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
8417642 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
8417643 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
8417644 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
8417645 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
8417646 i get the impression that production at western particularly american developers is ahead of those in japan
8417647 but i think that more and more in japan the process of making video game music is becoming specialized more and more japanese production companies are working together with foreign companies and sound production quality in japan is approaching that of the west
8417648 you dont notice much difference in the quality of the tracks themselves but when it comes to post production elements like recording and mixing japan still lags behind overseas operations
8417649 the trouble is im a college student and not an affluent one
8417650 and i simply do not have the time energy or resources to fight this battle right now theres a point at which i am willing to give up and be practical to let the world have its way with that ever mistreated little ideal of principle
8417651 when i have the time and can find a good copyright lawyer ill be figuring out exactly what my position is and how i can make
8417652 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
8417653 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
8417654 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
8417655 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state

8417659 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8417660 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8417661 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8417662 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8417663 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8417671 thank you for listening and the professional help is on its way
8417672 the cape york approach is that we dont take money away from families
8417673 there is a lot of mention that we are stripping people from welfare but nobody loses any money
8417674 a clamp might be put on your money to make sure that you spend it on your childrens clothes and so on but our approach does not deprive people of money
8417675 we want to put people in a position where if they are taking responsibility there should be no interference
8417676 especially out in the summer when youre out having fun with the kids you constantly hear planes making bodgy noises

8417700 we knew theyd dig in defensively we couldnt get past that wall

8417703 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
8417704 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
8417705 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
8417706 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis

8417717 were killing church members not like killing them dead although thereve been members ive wanted to kill in the past but we are just killing membership you know its its going away and the reason is because for years and years weve done it and we just did it because other people did it and in my mind it always kind of bothered me some because i thought well if you are a believer youre already a member of the family of god but you still join a church because thats what you do and so we just said well were not going to do just what everyones done before because instead of joining a church we hope that youll see yourself as joining a movement and instead of joining and being a member of a church like you would a country club or something instead we hope that you will see yourself not as a member but as a partner as someone who is called by god set apart by god to partner with other believers to lead people to become fully devoted followers of christ

8417827 fuelwatch has a lot going for it and it didnt justify some of the criticisms that were appearing about it
8417828 so we just wanted to set the record straight about what evidence wed received
8417829 it was just an attempt to get the facts straight it was just an attempt to inform people
8417830 i invite people to read the report and they will see that its not based on the evidence we heard and i think theyll also understand that the attempt to breathe new life into fuelwatch has not revived the corpse that fuelwatch is

8417898 depending upon the time well make the temptation bigger and bigger the idea was to see if anybody would be dumb enough to choose comfort over the only thing that guarantees you to stick in the game which is immunity
8417899 by the time this season is over you can make the case that maybe this is the dumbest team when it comes to idol play

8417957 a nation which can prefer disgrace to danger is prepared for a master and deserves one

8418001 if all we do is fund some campaigns create a few attack ads and do the occasional lobbying ill be pretty disappointed
8418002 the real goal here is to educate people as to why they should care frankly those of us who care about our rights in the information age have done a really poor job of communicating the importance or relevance
8418003 one of the problems is that we insist on using terms like digital rights the usage of which basically leaves out a large percentage of the population most people dont know what that means and they assume that digital doesnt include them because they dont work in the tech industry and have little contact with people who do so lots of digerati swing around their proverbial phalli and talk digital rights this and drm that and it becomes a kind of high tech circle jerk that is constraining and ultimately self limiting
8418004 its really about the free flow of information and letting free markets do their job once you start there its a quick hop and a skip down the path of the founding principles of this great country
8418005 information restrictions that affect our ability to adequately educate the public
8418006 its really about education innovation and reducing the bar to entry so that america can remain competitive in the 21st century
8418007 in the 10 years that have passed since the dmca we still havent been able to mount a credible reform effort and countless horrible things have taken place on our watch that co opt our so called inalienable rights we must do more and i cant think of a better time to do more than an election year
8418008 protect my constituents fair use rights to information and support the use of open standards in government for the storage and archiving of public data

8418012 theres a community that already exists around these issues why split off the subset of eff supporters who happen to be into free software
8418013 of course eff itself cant be involved because theyre tax exempt but the target is clearly the same people and their friends and colleagues a free software users for dmca reform group would be like cat owners for a balanced budget
8418014 one of the problems is that we insist on using terms like digital rights the usage of which basically leaves out a large percentage of the population most people dont know what that means and they assume that digital doesnt include them because they dont work in the tech industry and have little contact with people who do

8418081 critics say that not only does radiation make food less nutritious and potentially toxic but that the process also does not eliminate the risks of food borne illnesses an analysis by the centers for science in the public interest found that most outbreaks of illnesses associated with salad are caused by viruses which are not affected by the doses of radiation approved by the f d a
8418082 the fdas latest irradiation decision on lettuce and spinach comes in response to the 2006 outbreak of e coli from spinach grown in california an fda investigation found that the likely source of that contamination was the proximity of cattle operations to fields of produce and the likelihood that cattle feces tainted the local water supply e coli is a bacteria tolerated by cattle and found in their feces it has been a big problem for the meat industry during the past year triggering numerous recalls
8418083 irradiation labeling requirements apply only to foods sold in stores for example irradiated spices or fresh strawberries should be labeled when used as ingredients in other foods however the label of the other food does not need to describe these ingredients as irradiated irradiation labeling also does not apply to restaurant foods

8418192 we are up against them constantly in our fight to get on the ballot across the nation when we miss deadlines we get no second chances this is a great example of how unreasonable deadlines chill democracy
8418193 republicans and democrats make certain that third party candidates are held to ballot access laws no matter how absurd or unreasonable

8418230 nun ja eine beschreibung die auch auf jeden blog passen k nnte ausgew hlt wird schlie lich auch da und auch nicht nur die verlobte von boris becker ganz im gegenteil solche klatschgeschichten kommen dort ganz im gegensatz zu den etablierten medien eher selten vor

8418236 america has forgotten kate smiths song god bless america they are cursing america more than blessing her with their words their words have power i have not forgotten her i love her if they dont begin to bless america she will go down
8418237 but the word is very near you in your mouth and in your mind and in your heart so that you can do it see i have set before you this day life and good and death and evil
8418238 if you obey the commandments of the lord your god which i command you today to love the lord your god to walk in his ways and to keep his commandments and his statutes and his ordinances then you shall live and multiply and the lord your god will bless you in the land into which you go to possess
8418239 but if your mind and heart turn away and you will not hear but are drawn away to worship other gods and serve them i declare to you today that you shall surely perish and you shall not live long in the land which you pass over the jordan to enter and possess
8418240 i call heaven and earth to witness this day against you that i have set before you life and death the blessings and the curses therefore choose life that you and your descendants may live
8418241 and may love the lord your god obey his voice and cling to him for he is your life and the length of your days that you may dwell in the land which the lord swore to give to your fathers to abraham isaac and jacob
8418242 and as to his divine nature according to the spirit of holiness was openly designated the son of god in power in a striking triumphant and miraculous manner by his resurrection from the dead even jesus christ our lord the messiah the anointed one
8418243 by means of these he has bestowed on us his precious and exceedingly great promises so that through them you may escape by flight from the moral decay rottenness and corruption that is in the world because of covetousness lust and greed and become sharers partakers of the divine nature
8418244 for this very reason adding your diligence to the divine promises employ every effort in exercising your faith to develop virtue excellence resolution christian energy and in exercising virtue develop knowledge intelligence and in exercising knowledge develop self control and in exercising self control develop steadfastness patience endurance and in exercising steadfastness develop godliness piety and in exercising godliness develop brotherly affection and in exercising brotherly affection develop christian love
8418245 for as these qualities are yours and increasingly abound in you they will keep you from being idle or unfruitful unto the full personal knowledge of our lord jesus christ the messiah the anointed one
8418246 for whoever lacks these qualities is blind spiritually shortsighted seeing only what is near to him and has become oblivious to the fact that he was cleansed from his old sins
8418247 because of this brethren be all the more solicitous and eager to make sure to ratify to strengthen to make steadfast your calling and election for if you do this you will never stumble or fall
8418248 i do not call you servants slaves any longer for the servant does not know what his master is doing working out
8418249 cure the sick raise the dead cleanse the lepers drive out demons freely without pay you have received freely without charge give
8418250 so jesus answered them by saying i assure you most solemnly i tell you the son is able to do nothing of himself of his own accord but he is able to do only what he sees the father doing what the son does in the same way in his turn
8418251 yet the israeli government does a very good job of convincing the whole world that it is the victim in the conflict
8418252 to the israeli oligarchs the death of palestinian civilians is
8418253 my emphasis to those who state that all delich did was link to a perfectly reasonable article written by a perfectly reasonable man but just failed to notice that it was hosted on david dukes white nationalist site it is worth noting that quinn believes jenna delich linked to a far right website run by a neo nazi and recommended racist conspiracism to ucus membership she has now been suspended from the ucu activists list as you can see attempts to censor us have failed we refuse to be cowed by this sort of bullying we owe thanks to the many many people who have rallied round to support us who are now taking care of the dns magic for us theyre a robust sort of company formed to stand up to these threats secondly to who brought our plight to international attention finally huge thanks to all the bloggers who stood by us there really are too many to mention but particularly pleasing was the support from andy newman of socialist unity who showed true solidarity andys politics couldnt be more wrong but he is on the part of the left that on this issue and in his opposition to atzmon his instincts are spot on there are others from predictable standpoints who refuse to acknowledge the real problem of the rise of anti semitism in the so called palestinian solidarity movement and others who are due to their political sectarianism unable to see the problem in internet companies pulling blogs offline due to someone claiming a libel or potential libel lets be clear the issue here is not delich rather it is the blending of the perspectives of the neo nazis the islamists and the far left even if we accept delich made a mistake it would be one which simply could not have happened were is not for the poisonous rhetoric and vicious racism thathas characterised the debate over israel palestine it would have been impossible without the coalescence over the past decade of the coalitions which have constituted both respect and the stwc what after all is the fundamental difference between linking to neo nazis and carrying a placard bearing the slogan we are all hezbollah now
8418254 so fwanker what do you think of all this going to parade to support comrade delich in her battle against the zionazis
8418255 what more can i say either someone does something about these sick pyschopaths or they and their kind in washington and around the world will destroy us all
8418256 nor do i support the view that the position is automatically antisemitic
8418257 not of course that those of her allies who are academics as usually defined are any less prone than she is of resorting to crass misrepresentation and vilification of israel and zionism
8418258 the idea that anyone would hate a person or group simply because
8418259 when it cannot possibly be interpreted in such a way by any logical reasoning
8418260 signs of the times is determined to expose the truth about zionism its infestation of america and its plan to kick start a third world war from which few will survive
8418261 i am opposed to the israeli state murdering innocents in palestine i am opposed to the israeli state breaking untold numbers of international laws and articles of the geneva convention am i a neo nazi
8418262 i do go on demos occasionally unlike decents i dont mind the sweaty socialists hippies and anarchists with pink hair
8418263 ive watched a lot of footy and got sick of it you want to play
8418264 its coming along well its been a long time ive been really looking forward to it and just making sure this week there was no soreness whatsoever so its all good
8418265 obviously you can run around the track a few times and that does count for your base work but game fitness is the key hopefully i can blow out a few cobwebs in the first few minutes get the old kick and chase going well
8418266 ive had two weeks worth of contact so hopefully i will just work my way in this weekend
8418267 ive got to be switched on and really energised to play well
8418268 be patient and do things right was the main thing ive already sacrificed a few months the last thing you want is to rush it for one game and then you are out for another few months
8418269 the all blacks are always a goal but i have to play well in this auckland team and this competition to build that confidence and game fitness up and get going again
8418270 we regret that we missed the opportunity to tell matthew mitchams story we apologize for this unintentional omission
8418271 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8418272 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8418273 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8418274 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8418275 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8418277 supporting young disabled children and their families in the kyrgyz republic
8418278 the project focuses on sustainable development of our partners and the centres and also on cooperation with local communities non governmental organisations and relevant local government agencies
8418279 it includes programs on early intervention and providing advisory and practical support to new families with disabled children
8418280 the project was developed taking into account the needs and wishes of parents and disabled children considering provision of complex and versatile support to children and their parents the project activity is based on social model of disability which recognises that disability is not an illness and in the developed countries it was recognised and accepted and disabled people do not need pity and constant guardianship but need possibilities to study work and communicate to become useful members of society
8418281 now in kyrgyzstan some social establishments childrens homes boarding schools houses for aged people opened by the donor funding and the international organisations are on the verge of closing because of the termination of their financing by the foreign organisations so why cant we support the efforts of non governmental organisations and public associations which will render social services to the population and care for certain number of the aged homeless children or the disabled who cannot be accommodated in the formal establishments now since there are no places or shortage of funds
8418282 the japanese agency for international cooperation jica plans to open in kyrgyzstan a centre for people with disabilities
8418283 after a working visit by kyrgyz delegation to japan it decided to open a head office in kyrgyzstan for the countries of ca it will bring to the republic additional investments after the discussion of details of opening of the centre in october 2008 an international conference will take place in which well known people with disabilities will take part
8418284 we have excluded articles from it that this category of people cannot work their number in workforce should make not less than 5 percent
8418285 it is intended for the local organisations of a civil society for 1996 2007 we have given out 121 small grants for a total sum of 315 thousand
8418286 this project is supported by the japanese fund on reduction of poverty which will allocate 1 million 50 thousands are provided by our government
8418287 cuando te acerques a una ciudad para combatirla le intimar s la paz m s si no hiciere paz contigo entonces la sitiar s

8418291 y se enoj mois s contra los capitanes del ej rcito contra los jefes de millares y centenares que volv an de la guerra y les dijo mois s por qu hab is dejado con vida a todas las mujeres
8418292 matad pues ahora a todos los varones entre los ni os matad tambi n a toda mujer que haya conocido var n carnalmente
8418293 mas jehov nuestro dios lo entreg delante de nosotros y lo derrotamos a l y a sus hijos y a todo su pueblo tomamos entonces todas sus ciudades y destruimos todas las ciudades hombres mujeres y ni os no dejamos ninguno
8418294 y destruyeron a filo de espada todo lo que en la ciudad hab a hombres y mujeres j venes y viejos hasta los bueyes las ovejas y los asnos
8418295 jehov dijo a josu no temas no desmayes toma contigo toda la gente de guerra y lev ntate y sube a hai
8418296 y cuando los israelitas acabaron de matar a todos los moradores de hai en el campo y en el desierto a donde los hab an perseguido y todos hab an ca do a filo de espada hasta ser consumidos todos los israelitas volvieron a hai y tambi n la hirieron a filo de espada y el n mero de los que cayeron aquel d a hombres y mujeres fue de doce mil todos los de hai
8418297 y mientras iban huyendo de los israelitas a la bajada de bet hor n jehov arroj desde el cielo grandes piedras sobre ellos hasta azeca y murieron y fueron m s los que murieron por las piedras del granizo que los que los hijos de israel mataron a espada
8418298 josu los hiri y los mat y los hizo colgar en cinco maderos y quedaron colgados en los maderos hasta caer la noche
8418299 y josu y toda la gente de guerra con l vino de repente contra ellos y los entreg jehov en manos de israel y los hirieron y los siguieron hasta sid n hiri ndolos hasta que no les dejaron ninguno
8418300 y los hijos de israel tomaron para s todo el bot n y las bestias de aquellas ciudades m s a todos los hombres hirieron a filo de espada hasta destruirlos sin dejar alguno con vida
8418301 tom pues josu toda aquella tierra tom asimismo a todos sus reyes y los hiri y mat
8418302 y combatieron los hijos de jud a jerusal n y la tomaron y pasaron a sus habitantes a filo de espada y pusieron fuego a la ciudad

8418336 these are the words which i spake unto you while i was yet with you that all things must be fulfilled which were written in the law of moses and in the prophets and in the psalms concerning me
8418337 paul a servant of jesus christ called to be an apostle separated unto the gospel of god which he had promised afore by his prophets in the holy scriptures concerning his son jesus christ our lord

8418360 and thats a very high number for a whole summer
8418361 the worst track weve run on all season the track is so beat up the surface is totally screwed
8418362 we dont like to see that here but it certainly is not related to the condition of the racetrack
8418363 we have professional equipment operators who have been doing this for years and theres no problems with our racetrack whatsoever
8418364 our guys know the conditions and they got the thumbs up from the cpca people when we had the track ready for them they checked it themselves and theres no issue with our track
8418365 when you have that many outriding horses dying that pretty much tells you the base of the track is shot
8418366 the horses run on a good surface all of a sudden they break through that base and they hurt themselves real bad that has to be what happened there
8418367 when the base gives way theres nothing more dangerous than that thats why it would be outriding horses theyre carrying the weight on their backs a wagon horse is just pulling they dont have weights on their backs so they wouldnt break through as much as an outriding horse
8418368 instead of a casual just review it were going to tell them before you guys get on this track were not going to get blamed for anything
8418369 well be taking this to our education committee to see whether we should have a position on it
8418370 at this point we recognize that its a legal sport and youd hope things would be as safe as possible for both the horses and drivers it sounds like the conditions of the track need to be looked at to ensure that its safe
8418371 these animals are really well taken care of and they love to run
8418372 there are equine events where theres higher risk and more injuries more issues but this is a highly promoted sport and it draws attention
8418373 canadian professional chuckwagon association competitors lost seven outriding horses and the pull horse of mine
8418374 thats eight head of horse that we had to put down this weekend on this track
8418375 we were too close so i couldnt get around him
8418376 it was lucky mitsuings wagon didnt veer left or it would have been a big mess
8418377 the other two gorst and waldenbach had infractions when they left the start
8418378 i guess its a win but its not how i wanted to win it
8418379 if it wasnt for the misfortune i would have had the pcs championship
8418380 this is the worst track weve ran on all season
8418381 the track is so beat up the surface is totally screwed
8418382 they need to resurface the whole thing if they are going to keep running horses on it

8418387 people are trying to understand a game thats inherently interactive by watching a video all i can say is try the demo
8418388 theres glitches in all games its really interesting to me because as an example theres gonna be things you can always improve to me framerates not really that essential in cutscenes and it never has been for us i dont think too humans inconsistent from any of our previous games so theres clipping oh noes bottom line is does it affect gameplay and by how much are there ways to improve too human for sure but the overall big picture happy extremely happy
8418389 if its a sign that people love the game so much that they just want to get back in and play could we make it skippable sure its an easy change is it something we ever would have anticipated since we thought it was faster than going to get your body or losing experience which does not happen in too human is that a change we can make in the future sure
8418390 i think thats gonna be unique to people who pre order it thats a one time thing but weve got tons of ideas that will far exceed the pre order bonus
8418391 sacrificing your future for a slightly more comfortable present is not worth it
8418392 there is someone her with something more important that what you are doing right now
8418393 its election day 2008 we democrats are giving america a wake up call wake up america in 2001 the oil companies the war contractors and the neo con artists seized the economy and have added four trillion dollars of unproductive spending to the national debt
8418394 we now pay four times more for defense three times more for gasoline and home heating oil and twice what we paid for health care
8418395 borrowed money to bomb bridges in iraq afghanistan and pakistan no money to rebuild bridges in america money to start a hot war with iran now we have another cold war with russia while the american economy has become a game of russian roulette
8418396 if there was an olympics for misleading mismanaging and misappropriating this administration would take the gold
8418397 wake up america the insurance companies took over health care
8418398 wake up america we went into iraq for oil the oil companies want more war against iran will mean 10 a gallon gasoline the oil administration wants to drill more into your wallet wake up america weapons contractors want more an iran war will cost five to ten trillion dollars
8418399 this administration can tap our phones they cant tap our creative spirit they can open our mail they cant open economic opportunities they can track our every move they lost track of the economy while the cost of food gasoline and electricity skyrockets
8418400 they skillfully played our post 911 fears and allowed the few to profit at the expense of the many everyday we get the color orange while the oil companies the insurance companies the speculators the war contractors get the color green
8418401 wake up america this is not a call for you to take a new direction from right to left
8418402 this is call for you to go from down to up up with the rights of workers
8418403 up with creating millions of good paying jobs rebuilding our bridges ports and water systems up with creating millions of sustainable energy jobs to lower the cost of energy lower carbon emissions and protect the environment

8418563 the follow up time in this study was only two a half years and it may have hurt us
8418564 but this study in itself doesnt say you have to use angiotensin ii receptor blocker early
8418565 other studies have suggested that these drugs may be better for stroke risk reduction but in this study we cant say that
8418566 that is not the best time to tell the risk to the patient
8418567 people are lying about their income and also misrepresenting their job descriptions and theres also a lot more deception about outstanding debts how much they owe and leaving them out altogether

8418585 if the hurricane hits new orleans and the federal government shows theyve learned from the blunders of katrina this could take a lot of the sting out of barack obamas attack dogs making this election focused as much on george bush as john mccain
8418586 yeah yeah i understand all that but whos flying the plane

8418594 all around peshawar on every side the situation is volatile because of the people coming from bajaur bara dera adam khel and the people from swat and waziristan
8418595 all of this is impacting the infrastructure in peshawar the schools the health system everything is overloaded
8418596 we had no idea it was going to happen the government didnt tell us anything and we didnt see them anywhere
8418597 we are doing what we can to support the people here
8418598 we issued shoot on sight orders in the wake of large scale violence
8418599 this is unprecedented violence much more widespread than weve ever seen
8418600 the violence against the christian community in orissa state which broke out after the reprehensible assassination
8418601 so far a total of nine persons have been killed in various incidents
8418602 the us is gravely mistaken if it thinks it can make a house search in the dprk democratic peoples republic of korea as it pleases just as it did in iraq
8418603 we have decided to immediately suspend disabling our nuclear facilities
8418604 the united states will not take north korea off the state sponsor of terrorism list until we have a protocol in place to verify the dismantling and accounting for koreas nuclear program
8418605 it certainly is in violation of its commitments to the six party framework certainly in violation of the principle of action for action
8418606 this sudden move was not entirely unexpectable as the us has irked north korea by delaying the removal of north korea from the list of terrorism sponsoring states and south korea and the us did the joint military drill which was seen as a threat to the north
8418607 i do not believe that north korea whole heartedly said they will go back to the starting point in terms of denuclearization process i see it as another card at the negotiation table to urge the us to remove it from the terrorism blacklist as soon as possible
8418608 deaths have outnumbered births in germany since 1972 and the gap between births and deaths is continuously becoming bigger

8418613 the overseas sales is very important to the japanese and they do pay attention to it
8418614 a majority of the dvd profits go right back to japan
8418615 when you dont buy a dvd that is lost revenue for the japanese
8418616 they still have their domestic market to fall back on the american revenue is not nearly as big as the japanese
8418617 it is the second largest anime market in the world second only to japan
8418618 wed still be able to produce the big series like haruhi suzumiya with just the japanese market alone but without that overseas revenue we would have to cut out all the smaller shows series like spice and wolf will just disappear
8418619 are we just gravy the importance of american market to the japanese

8418630 as we gather here tonight our country is less secure and more isolated than at any time in recent history
8418631 the bush mccain foreign policy has dug us into a very deep hole with very few friends to help us climb out
8418632 the choice in this election is clear these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader a leader who can deliver change the change everybody knows we need barack obama will deliver that change

8418638 yang jias abnormal behaviour is a measure of abnormality in our own society

8418734 but it sounds like fun and if anyone can do it its sprinkles
8418735 working on the idea slurred to me by verde last night ive pieced together what i think should suffice for one roundtrip to the future and back
8418736 well wedging this bored out zx 11 engine into this bohmerland chassis should give us enough power and stability this rokon two wheel drive system will provide the traction we need this vetter mystery ship fairing is for aerodynamics and grove has a stash of moonshine we can use to power it what im missing though is a catalyst to open a wormhole to get us into actual time travel
8418737 i guess well know after we give it a try
8418738 knuckledragger is the fastest of the bunch so he should pilot the thing and verdes sure as hell going cause its his idea
8418739 i plugged my iphone into the zxs cpu and used a combination of google earth and timeanddate com to put us at the 2009 dunlop tire test i didnt however expect to land in lake lloyd i guess its a good thing these rokon tires are so buoyant

8418743 no pete the bikes fine the crew has made this the fastest machine within the great new rules set by dmg rules which i really like because it seems to have leveled the field taking away any advantage all your hard work might have provided while earning my six ama superbike championships
8418744 matt mladin would never ever say anything close to that where are we sprinkles whered you take us
8418745 maybe we crossed wired dimensions or something its the first time ive ever time traveled ya know but i dont want to take any chances so lets get back to the bike and jettison our butts back to the past
8418746 no worries by the time anyone notices well be gone
8418747 while you were paddling the bike to shore i was drinking the moonshine
8418748 there are some guys stranded on the far side of the track im going to sacrifice some of my practice time and give them a ride back to the paddock
8418749 the bike wasnt generating enough heat because of the lower horsepower limitations so we scrapped the cooling system but that lightened the bike so to fatten her up we grafted a 78 gs750 subframe to bring the bike up to the minimum weight allowance
8418750 other modifications include carburetors in place of fuel injection right side up forks 18 inch wheels and bias ply tires
8418751 but do you know a place thats serves moonshine were on our way to uzbekistan

8418800 once you get that chunky jewelry to fit right the best way to make it look perfect on you is to wear it with confidence
8418801 how come you guys dont talk about the crashing economy
8418802 thanks to the internet i can order new pantsuits 24 7
8418803 a book is a mirror if an ass peers into it you cant expect an apostle to look out
8418804 we die that may be the meaning of life but we do language that may be the measure of our lives
8418805 the detail can explode with so much fullness in literature and can stagger the heart as though it were not only itself but the whole of man
8418806 nor is insight from universals alone but one must also perceive things according to their particulars
8418807 it is necessary for the rhapsode to be an interpreter of the thought of a poet for the sake of his audience and to do this well without having known what the poet says is impossible
8418808 budget gaps are starting to increase the viability of public private partnerships

8418817 i was with harry last weekend so far he is very happy with his club
8418818 turkish football suits him very well so yeah i think hes thrilled with the new challenge
8418819 totally new world new league new people new faces and very happy with his move to turkey
8418820 the players ive picked up theyre the players whove made an impression on me the last five or six months i know what they can do
8418821 i know they can do a job for us in the national team and at this moment thats what im looking for
8418822 this is a direct result of very bad trade and industry policy of the previous government
8418823 clearly what its decided is that it is going to be in its interests to manufacture some parts in the us rather than australia
8418824 and we say that is one of the by products of the american free trade agreement and its also one of the by products of the downturn in the local industry
8418825 mi piacerebbe che fosse messa in risalto la bellezza sia fisica che spirituale delle suore
8418826 stiamo parlando di persone molto preparate che operano nel sociale dove oltre alla bellezza spirituale ma per avere visibilit ce anche bisogno di una bella presenza
8418827 se faccio cavolate mi dico st da solo e non soffro per questo
8418828 warriors who never knew hunger and could not be stopped
8418829 were happy with the verdict but its a shame this should have been limited to one death
8418830 he should have had the courage and the guts to kill himself before killing anyone else
8418831 this defendant is dangerous he is a predator who takes pride in his work
8418832 he earned this day his actions call out for the death penalty
8418833 i cant speak for shasta i cant get inside her head
8418834 possibly now well have to be dragged through a court proceeding in california if they go ahead with the prosecution it would be such as waste of taxpayer money because hell never spend a day in a california prison
8418835 by the verdict today they have given voice to the victims
8418836 generally for human beings its pretty hard to maintain impartiality when confronted with such horror
8418837 its a tremendous loss for the college but beyond that we just dont have a lot of information
8418838 were presenting five dramatic first features from the region which is almost unheard of
8418839 i dont think weve ever had a year with that many first features were kind of highlighting that
8418840 the festival has nurtured and humoured me as a filmmaker for about 10 years
8418841 the festival is that thing that you aim for its the most immediate thing that you have to know theres a good possibility your work is going to be shown
8418842 because my film is such a low budget the tax credits for sure play a major role
8418843 local filmmakers make up about 50 to 60 per cent of the projects in the province from year to year
8418844 the community has grown theres lots of film schools here and these are also people whove also had long term writing and directing shorts careers
8418845 theyre finally taking the next step with the support of government bodies and weve always screened their work and supported them all the way along so when you get all of these factors built in eventually people will take the next step and were here to celebrate it
8418846 this is the second time and it is a record for the history of the festival we have five american films in competition
8418847 the assassination of jesse james by the coward robert ford
8418848 it was an honour to receive this last year and it remains an honour to accept this this year
8418849 we will see 21 films and i hope and i have a lot of confidence in marco that we will see 21 films that will give us the state of art of what is cinema today
8418850 we started writing the movie as kind of an exercise thinking of what kind of parts these actors might play what kind of story they might inhabit
8418851 david s extensive experience in it and business management puts him in a strong position to lead vmware s business and support customer requirements across greater china said carl eschenbach executive vice president of worldwide field operations vmware
8418852 vmware offers the industry s broadest portfolio of virtualization solutions vmware is in a unique position to help organizations in greater china fast track their adoption of virtualization to support their growth
8418853 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8418854 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8418855 if all we do is fund some campaigns create a few attack ads and do the occasional lobbying ill be pretty disappointed
8418856 the real goal here is to educate people as to why they should care frankly those of us who care about our rights in the information age have done a really poor job of communicating the importance or relevance
8418857 one of the problems is that we insist on using terms like digital rights the usage of which basically leaves out a large percentage of the population most people dont know what that means and they assume that digital doesnt include them because they dont work in the tech industry and have little contact with people who do so lots of digerati swing around their proverbial phalli and talk digital rights this and drm that and it becomes a kind of high tech circle jerk that is constraining and ultimately self limiting
8418858 its really about the free flow of information and letting free markets do their job once you start there its a quick hop and a skip down the path of the founding principles of this great country
8418859 information restrictions that affect our ability to adequately educate the public
8418860 its really about education innovation and reducing the bar to entry so that america can remain competitive in the 21st century
8418861 in the 10 years that have passed since the dmca we still havent been able to mount a credible reform effort and countless horrible things have taken place on our watch that co opt our so called inalienable rights we must do more and i cant think of a better time to do more than an election year
8418862 protect my constituents fair use rights to information and support the use of open standards in government for the storage and archiving of public data
8418863 obviously well be most enthusiastic about candidates who support all of those but we will help campaign for candidates who support at least one of those items
8418864 creative commons is a great name electronic frontier foundation is pretty good
8418865 you have to get in some words that imply that the people in the organization actually make something useful and that the organizations goals are public goods network growth and productivity council
8418866 theres a community that already exists around these issues why split off the subset of eff supporters who happen to be into free software
8418867 of course eff itself cant be involved because theyre tax exempt but the target is clearly the same people and their friends and colleagues a free software users for dmca reform group would be like cat owners for a balanced budget
8418868 one of the problems is that we insist on using terms like digital rights the usage of which basically leaves out a large percentage of the population most people dont know what that means and they assume that digital doesnt include them because they dont work in the tech industry and have little contact with people who do
8418869 geeks huh if theyre for it then im against it
8418870 geeks huh dunno what that has to do with me but its probably too complicated im just an artist movie buff media reform activist investigative journalist someone with an ipod
8418871 we are here to represent the interests of one sub group of people against competing sub groups
8418872 we should have the right to access whatever we have the right to access
8418873 a similar group was formed more than five years ago but never quite got off the ground
8418874 they called me saddam hussein and osama bin laden we just wanted to get away get home but they attacked and we couldnt get away
8418875 i blame myself for not saving mohammed but where i come from we are not used to this kind of thing happening at home we never need to defend ourselves like that
8418876 the young man had spent about five weeks in hastings and was due to return home next weekend his death is incredibly sad enormous numbers of foreign students come to hastings and rother each summer in the region of 30 000 to 50 000
8418877 after i asked them to leave i noticed a police car pull up outside i asked them to keep an eye on the boys and they said they would then left less than an hour later mohammed who was like a brother to everyone here had been beaten the attack was completely unprovoked and without reason
8418878 we know its going to head into the gulf after that were not sure where its heading
8418879 for that reason everyone in the gulf needs to be monitoring the storm at that point were expecting it to be a category 3 hurricane
8418880 combined with the deep warm waters rapid intensification could occur in a couple of days
8418881 hoy queremos hacer p blico los abusos del oficialismo en relaci n al uso de los dividendos p blicos para sufragar su campa a electoral en una primera estimaci n hablamos de 19 millones de bol vares fuertes
8418882 ste es el dinero que no es utilizado para responder a las necesidades de un pueblo sino para hacer ruido pol tico en el estado
8418883 los abusos han sido reiterados y en esta oportunidad s lo hacemos un estimado al gasto nacional sin embargo en vargas el candidato por el oficialismo jorge luis garc a carneiro ha despilfarrado el dinero en su campa a sin explicar de d nde salen los recursos
8418884 garc a carneiro ha sido tan descarado que durante una rueda de prensa le preguntaron sobre la situaci n del conocido sector carmen de uria y su respuesta fue que ha esa se ora deb amos ayudarla ya que ha padecido mucho en el estado lo cual no fue m s que una burla para todos los varguenses
8418885 mientras muchos nos estamos preparando para darle a vargas el cambio que merece otros se han dedicado a construir una campa a demag gica que no resuelve los problemas de la gente mientras garc a carneiro y su llave a la alcald a hacen uso de los fondos p blicos para realizar su campa a en nuestro estado siguen creciendo la delincuencia y los actos vand licos
8418886 no lo vamos a conseguir con vallas publicitarias saraos fiestas y reuniones pues estas actividades s lo evidencian su desinter s para recuperar y dar respuesta a las necesidades de todos los varguenses
8418887 as como antonio rodr guez san juan ha sido un cono del fracaso durante sus dos gestiones de gobierno garc a carneiro ser la representaci n del continuismo para el estado vargas es por ello que invitamos a todos los varguenses a despertar y a no permitir que contin en jugando con los recursos que son la garant a de su futuro

8418910 runs every check allowed to ascertain the immigration status of all applicants for its jobs it is company policy that it hires only u s citizens and legal immigrants
8418911 the union uses the tactic of saying immigration was coming and the members of the union would not be taken
8418912 i need a job and got kids i heard that they need some help now
8418913 all them mexicans got fired because they didnt have a pass all these businesses have been taking americans jobs
8418914 that doesnt justify but it certainly explains why they might be hiring individuals who show up and say ill work for you
8418915 theyre putting commercial interest above the interest of children and we know what actually happens in childhood carries on into adulthood
8418916 australian children are exposed to more junk food ads than children in any other country in the world and obesity levels are rising

8418918 andreas jung at the university of giessen in germany and his colleagues fitted temperature sensors to the scrotums of 30 healthy men who then sat on a heated car seat for 90 minutes
8418919 an hour in and scrotal temperature had already risen to an average of 37 3 c with a maximum temperature in one man of 39 7 c
8418920 the team did not test the effect of the heated seat on sperm quality or quantity
8418921 we support the boom in the mining industry you have no shortage of people coming to see us but it is not absolute
8418922 what we say to the mining industry is that we have to do the right thing and we do reserve the right on behalf of the people of queensland to make appropriate decisions in the interest of the environment

8418933 da tempo ludc aveva posto lattenzione sulle aree agricole e sul censimento delle stesse
8418934 e stata necessaria la violenza su i due turisti olandesi per capire che a roma sono centinaia le strutture ex agricole abbandonate e occupate da clandestini e da persone senza fissa dimora
8418935 da anni le organizzazioni agricole chiedono di affrontare questo problema continua ciocchetti unidea dare la possibilit ai proprietari di poter farne un utilizzo produttivo cedendo al comune una parte di queste strutture per utilizzi sociali

8418937 la nostra condotta politica oggi di un partito di opposizione ma si contraddistingue per la seriet e la coerenza verso i nostri elettori

8419073 marijuana should not be a priority of the criminal justice system

8419095 theyve wiped out half my family its disgusting that anyone could do what they appear to have done
8419096 the police still dont know where the family is but theyd been to a barbecue the night before so the chance of them having gone away have got to be remote
8419097 they wont be able to go into the house for a couple of days because its unsafe due to the extent of the fire the waiting is killing me

8419124 this method is only intended for use with objectqueryextensions include to generate expressions trees
8419125 however there are a couple of other features that i think are worth briefly mentioning
8419126 all of us owe george soros a great deal of gratitude
8419127 he thinks the ballot question is a responsible initiative to reduce the overreliance on criminal justice sanctions in dealing with marijuana
8419128 marijuana should not be a priority of the criminal justice system
8419129 decriminalizing marijuana is a slippery slope and sends the wrong message
8419130 compounding this is the fact that users of marijuana are 10 times more likely to be injured or injure others in automobile crashes
8419131 they can move on and get a student loan and get their first apartment and move on with their lives
8419132 people recognize that there are a lot better things we could be doing with our police resources
8419133 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
8419134 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
8419135 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
8419136 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
8419137 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8419138 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8419139 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8419140 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
8419141 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
8419142 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
8419143 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military

8419146 its inspiring to look at what some of these women have done and to listen to some of their life stories
8419147 my expectation would be that we will have another minority i think thats the reality of the current political environment
8419148 i think anyone getting a majority in the current political alignment we have in canada would be unlikely
8419149 it certainly will give whoever wins that election hopefully ourselves that mandate to proceed and to proceed quite aggressively for some period of time
8419150 its important if possible to verify my analysis with the other opposition leaders if theres an election i think its important to give all the parties a chance to prepare
8419151 no matter where we stood at the beginning of this campaign democrats stand together today

8419179 youll never know which part of the internet youll need
8419180 clearly the iphone does not allow the utilization of flash nor java and to say you can surf the whole internet seen through a rigid lens is not true
8419181 at the end of the day there is lots of goodwill that seems to be happening around that with internet users debating who screwed up with many arguing that the advertising authority was too strict the net result is unfortunate but not too negative

8419196 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
8419197 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
8419198 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort

8419204 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8419205 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8419206 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
8419207 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
8419208 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel

8419213 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt

8419257 but heres the thing larry even those who support the escalation have acknowledged that 20 thousand 30 thousand or 40 thousand more troops placed temporarily in places like baghdad are not going to make a long term difference
8419258 not only had we not seen improvements but we are actually witnessing a worsening of the situation there
8419259 now i said at the time when i opposed the surge that given how wonderfully our troops perform that we would see an improvement in the situation and we would see a reduction in the violence
8419260 what i said at the time even at the time of the debate in the surge was that when you put 30 000 american troops in of course its going to have an impact theres no doubt about that
8419261 the only kind of president i dont think i could vote for would be an atheist i could not vote for an atheist president because i just think thats pretty arrogant

8419327 we have observed spectroscopic changes in temperature sensitive molecular lines in the magnetic splitting of an fe i line and in the continuum brightness of over 1000 sunspot umbrae from 1990 2005

8419329 mccracken believes science should be upfront i believe that we must state firmly that a cooling is possible in the near future but that the warming would then resume 10 20 years hence he said via email it will be very hard to argue for public trust if we say nothing about the possibility and then try to argue our way out after it happens using an aussie rules analogy that would be like giving the climate sceptics a free kick 10m in front of goal australia is definitely entering a footy finals period and the earth may be entering a period where human induced global warming slows temporarily many scientists will not be comfortable to consider this possibility and even less comfortable that journalists canvas it because in good faith they want nothing to deflect efforts to combat global warming

8419426 he was an outspoken critic of pakistans dictatorial regime and even endured exile for that

8419652 say you re reading a message board and somebody wrote hey did you guys hear that linkin park is playing at the spectrum on sept 27th i love that song of theirs my december i can t wait for that highlighting that bit of text the system should quickly process it and give you a menu that presents a few different options a wiki link for the music artist the system should be intelligent enough through various grammatical cues and perhaps a quick wiki google search a link to the ticket purchase site plane tickets to philadelphia the system should be intelligent enough to realize that the spectrum is in philadelphia and you live far enough away to justify plane tickets create a new calendar event a map of the region an email this link a youtube link to that song s video this approach is definitely not as powerful as a command line type system but probably much more usable for the average person
8419653 so consider this your subpoena its time to stop doing tina
8419654 it didnt turn out the way we want but they found her and at least have closure
8419655 we do believe that they entered the house unwelcomed and attacked her while she was in her bed following that removed her body put it in her car from her house and drove her to that remote location

8419668 knowledge of catholic history and teaching does not seem to be one of them abortion is always gravely evil and so are the evasions employed to justify it
8419669 never justified or permitted abortion at any stage of development
8419670 the law does not provide that the act abortion pertains to homicide for there cannot yet be said to be a live soul in a body that lacks sensation
8419671 there are indications that the existing bereavement payment claim form may not be clearly reflecting the legislation
8419672 the government will amend the claim form to provide greater clarity to health professionals about baby bonus eligibility

8419675 gerrard has a groin problem so he will have an operation and could be out for 10 to 15 days
8419676 its not serious but we need to do it he has been playing some games in pain not being 100 per cent fit
8419677 he had a problem for the first leg with liege and when he went away with england for the friendly last week against the czech republic we talked with the doctor yesterday and today and it was decided that steven would play in this match with the pain but now we will have to get the situation solved
8419678 he will miss sundays game against aston villa the international games and maybe the game against manchester united on sept 13

8419685 if we dont have adequate supply to match up with demand then we encounter some short term outages
8419686 it may require fuel tanker drivers to go farther to get it
8419687 we are meeting our planned commitment to deliver products to the magellan line
8419688 were being told demand is outstripping supply at this time
8419689 many of us are having a hard time believing that
8419690 were being told that the next six to eight weeks could be touch and go from our sources
8419691 at this point in time were kind of taking a wait and see approach
8419692 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8419693 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8419694 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8419695 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8419696 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8419697 the volume difference between the signal level to the distortion level just isnt big enough to mask it

8419700 i celebrate christmas but because it isnt celebrated by everyone we can no longer say merry christmas now it has to be seasons greetings its not christmas vacation its winter break isnt it amazing how this winter break always occurs over the christmas holiday weve gone so far the other way bent over backwards to not offend anyone that i am now being offended but it seems that no one has a problem with that i am tired of this nation worrying about whether we are offending some individual or their culture since the terrorist attacks on sept 11 we have experienced a surge in patriotism by a majority of americans however the dust from the attacks had barely settled when the politically correct

8419707 i find madonnas attempt to compare john mccain with hitler beyond the pale and an insult to all americans democrats as well as republicans
8419708 comparisons to hitler have no place in a music concert or in the presidential campaign
8419709 whatever madonnas political or personal views it is outrageous to invoke nazi imagery in the context of john mccains candidacy or to make a comment on american political leadership
8419710 doing so trivializes the history of the holocaust and is an insult to the memories of the victims and their families
8419711 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8419712 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8419713 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
8419714 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
8419715 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
8419716 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
8419717 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
8419718 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
8419719 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
8419720 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
8419721 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
8419722 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8419723 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
8419724 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
8419725 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
8419726 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
8419727 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
8419728 tell them to look up tell them to remember the stars
8419729 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8419730 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
8419731 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8419732 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
8419733 tell them to look up tell them to remember the stars
8419734 oh hello were going to be living together for a year
8419735 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8419736 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8419737 get it and cater to a younger clientele they offer interesting cuisine a wide variety of water sport options and a dcor that stimulates the eye

8419744 vamos a tratar de poner un equipo que est a la altura de las circunstancias y que se encuentre en ptimo estado sin embargo nosotros no modificaremos la forma de juego pues la idea es hacer un planteamiento que nos caiga c modo a nosotros l gicamente teniendo en cuenta al rival
8419745 con respecto a la seguridad vamos a seguir restringiendo el ingreso de objetos que podr an ser lanzados al campo de juego como bater as palos entre otros
8419746 resguardaremos m s la seguridad particularmente por la mala experiencia que tuvimos en la ltima participaci n esperamos que no suceda nada para avanzar en lo deportivo y lo reglamentario

8419753 i didnt know so many men like women like me
8419754 the recovery was made from a place which cannot be said to be accessible to an ordinary person without prior knowledge
8419755 the news of ricky martin becoming a father to twin boys hasnt been well received by everyone one leading latino catholic cardinal has slammed ricky for acting without dignity the puerto rican singer recently
8419756 what martin did diminishes the dignity of a human being you cant just buy or rent life its even worse when someone famous and in the public eye is doing it
8419757 i dont think its right to deny children of maternal figures just because you have a big ego
8419758 pretty powerful nominating speech from mike wilson a registered republican for obama
8419759 she needs to pay restitution for that and give the school the money back
8419760 i never would have thought she would do that prom is really important to us and i want to have a good prom i dont like hearing teachers are stealing from us
8419761 i cant imagine preparing i dont want to compare it to the nfl because theyre all professionals to have a football game is a major undertaking we have our hands full we have enough internet coverage and media coverage to ask why a freshman dropped a ball were good were ready to roll id be opposed to that i dont think we could get it done
8419762 it would be stupid i dont think you need to scrimmage against other teams we scrimmage against ourselves but we dont try to put our players in a vulnerable position i dont think theres any need for preseason games
8419763 the nfl does that because they bring in a lot of rookies and free agents and allow them to show what they can do in those games and they can sell them to their fans as part of the ticket packages wed be playing our walk ons and our third teams if it didnt count i dont think anybody would come watch that right now
8419764 i like the schedule and were playing 12 games now anyway
8419765 i certainly dont think we need to go in and bang heads with somebody else
8419766 it would improve the energy in practice as well as they prepare for somebody
8419767 the high schools do it and the pros do it but we dont do it for some reason
8419768 it would help in the development of players if you could do something like that maybe once
8419769 it would tell you about especially your young players which ones are most ready to play were going to have some young players in this game against clemson and were going to find out saturday night if theyre ready to play through adversity or whether theyre going to spit the bit well find out then its all we can do
8419770 it is a particularly nasty weapon that can literally take someones head off we are very glad it is off the streets and we want more weapons handed in
8419771 you know i bought us tickets to a baseball game
8419772 its called stitch n pitch knitting and baseball isnt that cute
8419773 um it is the as but theyll have goody bags
8419774 how can any progressive look themselves in the mirror after the election if mccain wins and they have not devoted at least some time to the obama campaign
8419775 i promise to appoint more justices to the supreme court like roberts
8419776 when i was a child i thought as a child but when i grew up i put away childish things
8419777 boil water and add sugar cut pit and juice fruits steep in sugar water for 25 minutes on low heat strain off ffruit and cool in fridge before serving
8419778 blend all ingredients until creamy and foamy load into canister and add co2 charge
8419779 we have excellent systems and processes in place but this week its our best efforts that failed not the regulators not the canadian food safety system
8419780 i emphasize this is our accountability and its ours to fix which we are taking on fully
8419781 we have an inspector in place on a daily basis when the plant is running in order to oversee the production process in order to validate that the controls are indeed in place
8419782 its tantamount to if you had a haystack with a needle in it
8419783 you can walk out and take 10 samples of that haystack you likely wont find the needle what adds value is address what caused the needle getting in there in the first place
8419784 thats the sign of a good team one that can win in different ways
8419785 weve been able to win the last couple of weeks by sitting back and swinging the bat today we werent swinging the bats very well so we were able to play a little bit different game and it ended up working out for us
8419786 youve got to make sure to take same approach every pitch every at bat every game and not let the mental errors and mental mistakes get to you
8419787 that says a lot for this team how good we feel were going and how good we can be and how were not going to let up until the season is over
8419788 it stayed in and everything was good and i got an rbi once again weve got to do the little things
8419789 one ball left the infield and they got two runs so what can you do
8419790 i felt like i did pretty well especially against that offense but marquis was on his game so theres not a lot i could do
8419791 everyone was asking me before what it was going to be like i was like i dont know i havent talked to her in 10 or 15 years i had that tension and i started to let it get to me is she going to be nice is it going to be a bad environment but when i saw her everything was fine
8419792 i think when youre 18 your personalities conflict then you meet up 10 or 15 years later and the playing ground is totally different and youre fine
8419793 it let me find a little bit of peace and discover who i was as a person
8419794 not the person who the press made me out to be because id had a few bad experiences in my personal life and i was struggling to figure out a bad husband or a bad boyfriend and i was doing it under the spotlight so i wasnt reacting well to any of it
8419795 all those people who wrote the i hate brenda newsletter are going to get mad at me now like why are you leaving your child with brenda
8419796 some people thought we ought to wait until the postseason and that struck me as really being awkward
8419797 id rather go into the postseason knowing weve already used it to use one of my favorite lines this isnt einsteins theory of relativity we have the best technology you can possibly have and the procedures have been described in great detail i wanted to do it as soon as possible
8419798 the sport has a pace to it where you have to be very sensitive
8419799 even if this works well and theres no doubt it will its sort of like the wild card a few years ago first people criticized it and now they want more wild cards just because something works well you dont go on to do more
8419800 we didnt have him in team work tuesday but he did fine and hasnt experienced any problems
8419801 so far so good hell get a little more work today
8419802 weve been telling you guys that hes been doing a lot of things and we have a pretty extensive workout before we let guys get back on the field
8419803 they go through a routine on the side and do some individual work and its like a decathlon so when we clear guys to come back i usually dont worry about how theyre going to be
8419804 its still to be determined from what we do and a lot of that will be based on the medical report on jim and peyton
8419805 so those guys gray and lorenzen are both going to play well see how they do and then well determine whether we keep four three or two
8419806 but hey you know what they say when you assume
8419807 the trade situation has already been presented the game doesnt really matter
8419808 i know jeff was visiting getting more looks at it
8419809 pretty soon well wonder how we got along without it and it wont even be noticed
8419810 you can slow a picture down so much that you can see the grains of sand and the clay around the bag you can see whether or not a person has shaved that day
8419811 the commissioner has come around and hes embraced it because the technology is undeniable im sure there was a time when all of us watched baseball on black and white tvs now i bet you everybody in the room has a high def tv
8419812 the commissioner has been very clear were not going any farther than weve gone
8419813 but we dont expect anybody is going to impact the game in that fashion if it were true that something like that did happen wed impact them very quickly from the commissioners office without a doubt but we dont have that fear not at all everybodys going to want to show the play
8419814 if you are not making an effort to find an effective way of helping the poor then you are acting wrongly
8419815 too often we find reasons not to give i congratulate professor cullity for presenting a strong case for all people to give to help those in need failure to reach out to the needy diminishes us as human beings
8419816 it rained every day but i got the job done now i feel very confident in trying to win this event said montgomerie who added hes been trying to add 20 yards off the tee at the par 73 course measuring 7 320 yards
8419817 my goal is to win and try to forget about everything else and what it all means montgomerie said
8419818 hes one of our main guys but we dont think its a season ending injury
8419819 the time frame it fluctuates but hopefully with his youth and hes been pretty durable and resilient to injury hopefully he does get back soon
8419820 with the offseason moves we made hopefully we can still play at a high level this year to me its more something that you look at as a challenge and you dont let it defeat you you deal with it
8419821 training camp was going to be an important part of his development
8419822 thats going to be postponed obviously but hes got a lot of development on and off the court that hes going to continue to do ive got a lot of confidence in him and now his job is to get healthy
8419823 just in talking to nellie today were talking about maybe spreading that ball around and getting scoring from different areas
8419824 marcus is more of a pass first point guard if at some point he thought he didnt get a chance in new jersey hes going to get a chance now
8419825 live the moment and greet his teams victories less with relief and more with sincere appreciation
8419826 sometimes being here at duke because weve been very very successful
8419827 its like what we havent gone to the final four what we didnt win the national title very spoiled and it ruins it a little bit really a lot
8419828 part of that then becomes you win and sometimes youre just relieved to win he added
8419829 im not saying that it happens all the time but it happens at the end of that spain game most people would say werent you relieved no i wasnt i was exhilarated it was euphoric it was the way it should be thats the way its going to be for the rest of my career here at duke
8419830 like being in a coaches clinic and while theres little chance that boeheims noted 2 3 zone defense will show up at cameron indoor stadium this season collins said some of those coaches principles could make their way onto the blue devils chalkboard
8419831 doing those two things at the same time afforded me an amazing opportunity to grow krzyzewski said
8419832 throughout this time there have been sometimes articles you should do this you shouldnt
8419833 chanting music no electric lighting the whole atmosphere was one of sedation
8419834 the college needs to take more drastic action than it has to date the vincentians should withdraw themselves from the governing council of the college while the investigation is ongoing
8419835 i was gravely concerned because what it does it suggests the particular accused in this case is already guilty this is a mass contaminated case its one in which i just sincerely hope the police properly investigate it so as to ensure that justice is done
8419836 we issued shoot on sight orders in the wake of large scale violence despite a curfew imposed on monday
8419837 this is unprecedented violence much more widespread than weve ever seen in the state
8419838 the violence against the christian community in orissa state which broke out after the reprehensible assassination
8419839 so far a total of nine persons have been killed in various incidents
8419840 on monday mornings he and i often said goodbye by making love
8419841 but one day all of a sudden it just happened
8419842 i knew that something was wrong because i didnt hear anything from him just nothing
8419843 i was just so proud to show off my big old jim mcconaughey and his gift
8419844 i was deciding do i want to have another baby
8419845 thats when matthew was conceived we had tried for 16 years and no baby so matthew was a big surprise
8419846 you better get back in bed get up on the other side of it and get back in this kitchen with a new attitude
8419847 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
8419848 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
8419849 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
8419850 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
8419851 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
8419852 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
8419853 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
8419854 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
8419855 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
8419856 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
8419857 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
8419858 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
8419859 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
8419860 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
8419861 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
8419862 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
8419863 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
8419864 he offered to send me a pair for my backup j frame on the condition that i give them a fair shake and report my findings for good or ill but honestly
8419865 and dont just try on your indoor range try them in low light
