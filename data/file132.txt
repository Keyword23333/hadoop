1320000 chinese president hu jintao made his rare address to the world and the foreign press for the same reason the party maintains a vigorous internet firewall stability foreign journalists and readers across the world are outraged by blatant censorship of what they can read or write those who actually believed that the ioc and the chinese government would all of a sudden release 1 000 white doves into the air and declare the firewall dissolved got what they deserved blocked sites frustration and confusion the same goes for those who actually believed that china could somehow rid the entire beijing area of all traces of smog they should have armed themselves the cooperation between the ioc and china is at best a classic example of the frog and the scorpion

1320052 breaking our oil addiction is one of the greatest challenges our generation will ever face
1320053 it will take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
1320054 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
1320055 as it turns out big oils most successful speculating wasnt in the oil fields it was in washington where they invested millions in john mccain and got their moneys worth

1320058 huge crowds and mostly favorable press reviews of obamas overseas trip have been trumped by mccains attacks on obama

1320063 should texas execute mr medellin before congress has a reasonable opportunity to convert the icj judgment into a justifiable federal right the state of texas will forever deprive mr medellin of his constitutionally protected right not to be deprived of his life without a due process of law
1320064 to ensure that its judgment has its intended effect of guiding the political branches to a constitutionally permissible method of complying with the nations treaty obligations
1320065 executing jose medellin in violation of an order by the world court would be a major step backward for the rule of law

1320072 they also emphasised that preserving this path talks needs a positive and constructive atmosphere

1320085 please stop calling patients consumers patients are people with illnesses or injuries who need medical care consumers are people who purchase goods or services and are informed about what theyre purchasing most patients are not actively dictating what health care resources theyre consuming note there are certainly consumers of health information but a person who comes to me seeking medical attention is not a consumer he or she is a patient
1320086 the patient controls who sees the information in their medical record but the patients physician controls the actual information
1320087 what were looking to do here is follow the common sense approach of bringing this building forward into a new era
1320088 there are no large single office users there is a glut of office space in new jersey and were in a downturn in the economy however we believe that the building is extremely significant and well worth our effort
1320089 even if we could fill the whole place up with office we think that a better and more progressive and environmentally friendly use would be to have a mix of uses
1320090 people dont want to live in one place and work in another and have to drive an hour to go shopping this building would lend itself very favorably to a blending of uses when lucent was there it had a bank and a restaurant and a coffee shop so why shouldnt individual office users have all that and more we want to take the original concept enhance it and bring it into the 21st century
1320091 the foundation of this building is still office users and were going to attempt to lease up space
1320092 senator john mccain received a burst of donations in june from oil company employees after he came out in favor of offshore drilling according to a report released last week by campaign money watch a watchdog organization
1320093 but the largest collective response from a single company the report noted came from the hess corporation
1320094 on monday after the web site talking points memo listed the names of the hess contributors scrutiny fell on a couple alice rocchio who is identified in campaign finance records as an office manager at hess and her husband pasquale who is listed as a foreman at amtrak
1320095 they each gave a whopping 28 500 to mr mccain and the republican national committee
1320096 mr mccains joint fund raising committee took in more than 1 2 million in contributions in texas alone from oil and gas related donors in june according to campaign money watch more than 70 percent of that money came after june 15 the day before mr mccain came out in favor of offshore drilling
1320097 further digging from the wapo has found that a driver for hess maxed out to mccain as well its an unlikely profile for a 2 300 donor
1320098 its entirely possible these contributions are legitimate and that hess staffers just love mccain ever since he flipped on drilling
1320099 its well established that the mccain campaign is crawling with lobbyists and deeply corrupted by their influence with the new set of positions matching the concerns of the new corporate contributors this set of oil company donations is the most vibrant example and so it makes the most sense to continue on the offense and keep pointing them out
1320100 when property manager ryan froerer got a call from a realtor to check on a townhouse he knew something was up it was the sickest thing ive ever seen just unimaginable that someone could live in that he couldnt even open the front door it was blocked from inside as he finally entered the house he found about 70 000 empty beer cans
1320101 to all outward appearances the person who lived in the townhouse was the perfect tenant he always paid on time and he never complained he kept a low profile in the neighborhood the cans were finally recycled for 800 dollars an estimated 70 000 cans 24 beers a day for 8 years
1320102 democracy cannot be imposed from above by clever laws or wise politicians it must not be forced on people like a cap democracy can only grow upwards like a plant democracy must begin at the local level within the local self government
1320103 democracy is not worth a brass farthing if it is being installed by bayonets
1320104 the u s has a strange idea of democracy they first interfered with the bosnian situation bombed yugoslavia then afghanistan and then iraq who is next perhaps iran
1320105 putin inherited a ransacked and bewildered country with a poor and demoralized people and he started to do what was possible a slow and gradual restoration these efforts were not noticed nor appreciated immediately in any case one is hard pressed to find examples in history when steps by one country to restore its strength were met favorably by other governments
1320106 today i continue to be extremely worried by the slow and inefficient development of local self government but it has finally started to take place in yeltsins time local self government was actually barred on the regulatory level whereas the states vertical of power i e putins centralized and top down administration is delegating more and more decisions to the local population unfortunately this process is still not systematic in character
1320107 there is this belief that all those other worlds are only being temporarily prevented by wicked governments or by heavy crises or by their own barbarity or incomprehension from taking the way of western pluralistic democracy and from adopting the western way of life countries are judged on the merit of their progress in this direction however it is a conception which developed out of western incomprehension of the essence of other worlds out of the mistake of measuring them all with a western yardstick the real picture of our planets development is quite different
1320108 i have spent all my life under a communist regime and i will tell you that a society without any objective legal scale is a terrible one indeed
1320109 this ascension will be similar to climbing onto the next anthropologic stage no one on earth has any other way left but upward

1320117 what is happening in south east asia is terrifying to have a group of animals under such a high level of threat is quite frankly unlike anything we have recorded among any other group of species to date
1320118 weve raised concerns for years about primates being in peril but now we have solid data to show the situation is far more severe than we imagined
1320119 tropical forest destruction has always been the main cause but now it appears that hunting is just as serious a threat in some areas even where the habitat is still intact in many places primates are quite literally being eaten to extinction
1320120 the pressures on them have increased with the big push towards growing monoculture crops in part for their use as biofuels the growing of palm oil crops in south east asia and soya beans in the amazon have taken their toll
1320121 but hunting of primates for bushmeat has also increased this was a subsistence issue but now its almost become a luxury food with a higher price than for chicken or fish both in african and in south east asia

1320127 it was a conscious decision to enhance the green credentials of the building because the consensus in the city is that we have to be responsible members of society
1320128 offices are a significant contributor to carbon dioxide emissions because of their high energy consumption a high profile firm such as eversheds can make a considerable impact on that additionally the environment is becoming an important issue to clients and so having an office which follows green ideals leads by example
1320129 the green roof is wonderful to be associated with up there it is quite tranquil the sedum is low and soft to walk on and it is a peaceful place
1320130 roofs are often wasted spaces it is a whole floor that people build that is never normally used
1320131 but we can be more responsible as designers by using them in a green way conventional roofs absorb a large amount of heat making london hotter but because green roofs are full of water which evaporates when heated they make the city a lot cooler and they also bring in wildlife
1320132 sustainability has gripped the office community i have never known anything like it
1320133 its what everyone is talking about the buildings we live and work in use massive amounts of energy there is a real desire to change and a clear acceptance that the way offices have been designed and managed cannot continue the bigger challenge is with existing buildings computers lights and heating should all be reduced that can make a big difference and can cost very little
1320134 what is happening in south east asia is terrifying to have a group of animals under such a high level of threat is quite frankly unlike anything we have recorded among any other group of species to date

1320164 mit den aktualisierten leitlinien tragen wir den wissenschaftlichen erkenntnissen der letzten jahre rechnung zahlreiche studien zeigen dass die kombination eines pap tests mit dem hpv test deutlich mehr sicherheit bietet frauen mit einem erh hten risiko f r geb rmutterhalskrebs zu identifizieren als der pap test allein
1320165 geb rmutterhalskrebs tritt bei frauen ab 30 jahren am h ufigsten auf durch den einsatz beider tests in dieser altersgruppe hoffen wir die anzahl der frauen die an geb rmutterhalskrebs erkranken oder sogar sterben deutlich reduzieren zu k nnen

1320219 dear drs please forgive me for this horrible transgression i have no where else to turn so i ask you to mercifully gently and lovingly please help him sleep his name is kaiser and hes 16 and a half years old hes been my friend my teacher my pupil my lifelong loving and loyal companion
1320220 be good to him as you would your own child for hes been mine for a loving lifetime
1320221 drew came up to me and said hey i like what you did last year and were going to use you more this year
1320222 i feel positive about that especially when its coming from drew brees now i feel like i have a lot more weight on my shoulders because i have to stand up i have to back myself up now
1320223 it puts a lot of pressure on you because thats the quarterback hes the boss on the field and you have to listen to what he says so the only thing i can do is go out there and do the job
1320224 you need seasons of that you need about 10 games like that so i have a lot of work to do but hopefully that one game has showed people that i can play at this level and i can play a full game
1320225 my ribs were real sore but i didnt think much about it during the week because i was getting ready to start
1320226 they said we need you so i just kept practicing with it and played with it
1320227 if i get in get some snaps ill be fine with like three snaps a game
1320228 my whole thing is helping this team out however i can i can help the team with special teams and if they want me in the offense ill go out there and help on offense whatever it takes
1320229 weve all got different styles we can use to help this offense
1320230 deuce hes the big guy hes going to come back and hes going to keep punching it in like hes been doing reggie is versatile so we can used his receiver and a running back
1320231 i came in last year thinking thats where id be
1320232 but sometimes things change whether or not the coaches have confidence in you understanding the scheme or whatnot but ive always gone into each camp preparing and planning to be the starter and if im not then at least i know that if i had the opportunity through injury or something else id be ready to play
1320233 coach payton told me in the offseason it was my job to lose
1320234 he said you are my guy unless you mess it up i wondered if the saints would sign another center but i trust his word and he gave me his word before i signed
1320235 the experience from last year gave me a lot of confidence
1320236 i knew i could do it and i had confidence in myself for a long time but last year reconfirmed that and i think its made this camp a lot easier for me
1320237 ill admit myself my first two years at guard i struggled once i got to my third year i played better and i gained confidence ever since then it was something i knew i could do especially when i moved to center i became even more confident
1320238 when you bring together the best in the business and everybody gets in shape you can be the best in the business and dominate
1320239 when we were here with coach has jim haslett we played inside me and d howard we were the two d tackles and we had two linebackers play end so its nothing new
1320240 in every way possible i think he can bring a lot of electricity to this defense
1320241 when it comes to third down if you just look at him and watch his moves he does the same thing warren sapp did in his prime so thats a great thing if youre a defensive end to watch him get up that field
1320242 run and secondary thats what the linebackers get paid for
1320243 tom is a great quart it was the best weekend it was good to spend some quality with reggie s saintsational
1320244 welcome to millsaps where the strong get weak and the weak just 3 days ago
1320245 even though i havent played important international matches for four months i have been training really hard and i am in good condition
1320246 i feel happy to transfer to ac milan i am a professional footballer every transfer is a new start for me
1320247 but for the moment the most important thing is the olympics its a great honour to represent brazil in the games
1320248 my goal is to create history for brazil the olympics is as important as the world cup and copa america everybody wants to be the champion in the olympic games
1320249 if you like exercise you like the idea of getting more bang for your buck
1320250 if you dont like exercise you love the idea of getting the benefits from a pill
1320251 i love gardening gavin and i grow a lot of our own vegetables and we have some hens for fresh eggs weve got dogs and geese as well
1320252 para esa fecha si es para el 25 de mayo de 2010 falta poco no quedar una sola calle sin asfaltar y ni un vecino sin servicio de agua corriente y cloacas
1320253 esa cuenta es de otro pa s y en mi base de datos no aparece
1320254 the faster train journey between the capital city and the capital of the highlands will undoubtedly attract even more visitors and businesses to the area
1320255 equally we have been clear in our commitment to invest in the a9 on a continuing basis
1320256 were in really good shape were ready and our minds are totally focused on the start of qualifying especially after what happened four years ago
1320257 we were just one game away from finishing in fourth place in the north central america and caribbean zone and that would have earned us a play off place
1320258 it was the first time that a guatemalan national team had still been in with a chance of making the finals going into the final game and that was a big achievement in itself
1320259 of course missing out was hard to swallow but wed never been in that situation before so now we intend to use that experience to take a definitive step forward
1320260 weve got good young players who are important to us and have a lot of quality
1320261 on top of that weve got the same coaching staff in place one that knows the regional game well were also much more experienced which contrasts with what happened to us in the last qualifying campaign
1320262 as weve said guatemala arent the favourites and so well have to play every game as if it were a final our first game is against the united states and that will set the standard for the rest of the qualifiers
1320263 weve got players who are technically gifted others who are quick and others who are physically strong the way we play will depend on the players out on the pitch and which opponents were facing
1320264 weve always been a very skilful side now we have to find something extra in order to be more effective
1320265 definitely because the standard of the guatemalan league is below that of international level and when you play for the national team you notice the difference
1320266 this competition must be treated like a shop window like it was in my case i made my national team debut scored several goals and that opened the doors for a move abroad
1320267 im more mature i see football in a different light being outside guatemala makes you develop a much stronger personality and be more professional
1320268 ive got a comfortable life in the united states and at my age thats very important id only consider offers that were on a par with my current situation and they havent materialised as yet
1320269 i dont think ill keep playing for the national team once this qualifying campaign is over what im aiming to do is to make the fans dream a reality
1320270 im hoping this is the opportunity that weve all been waiting for to qualify for the fifa world cup finals and that way i can bow out having made history
1320271 ive been thinking about those things more and i want to stay in the united states because its better for my family
1320272 to imagine that im going to change would be utopic and dishonest
1320273 can you imagine me being a good boy who accepts everything and says yes to everyone i have ideas i know how the team works and ill go all the way
1320274 im not going to hold back my opinions i regret not being myself during the euro and im not going to do that again people who think that a manager a coach and me in particular can be put under guardianship either theyre stupid or totally delirious
1320275 i made a communications error it wasnt the right time it was something personal you wont hear me ever again on this subject
1320276 its a failure when you dont qualify for a round its obvious we didnt have the feeling that we gave everything we could

1320340 dr rohana ariffin retired associate professor of universiti sains malaysia penang and her former student rachel samuel currently a lecturer with uitm malacca decided to focus their research on the rapist instead for 10 months in 2003 both women conducted interviews with 90 convicted rapists currently detained in four prisons in seremban johor baru kajang and sungai buloh aged 20 to 72 each rapist was asked open ended questions to solicit their perception and attitudes towards women sexual history and experiences
1320341 from just 138 cases in 1980 to 912 in 1994 the number rose to 2 431 cases in 2006 and 3 177 last year between 2000 to 2006 selangor and johor recorded the highest numbers of rape while perlis had the lowest number for 2006 selangor recorded 421 rapes and johor 343
1320342 some of the men convicted for date rape or statutory rape told the researchers that sex was consensual and it was the girls parents who reported them because they disliked the mens low income jobs the rapists also blamed pornography and uncontrolled lust as the main factors which caused them to rape only two of them said women were to blame but over 60 agreed that women were temptresses
1320343 despite years of progress and change women are still objectified as commodities they are still blamed for rape from the way they dress talk or behave in june munirah bahari vice president of the national islamic students association of malaysia caused a furore by stating that school girls white baju kurung was too sexy and lured rapists similarly the kelantan government forbade women to wear coloured lipstick or high heels as these are deemed enticing to men
1320344 so what do women want it is therefore not surprising that when you ask a woman what she wants she often has no clue her natural roles of child bearer and mother alone dictate the direction of much of her energy over and above this she has spent her life being told by her parents educators religious figures and scripts who she may may not and should be she has been influenced to take care of others rather than herself her self esteem is shattered the connection between her mind heart and spirit has effectively been broken by these multiple influencers

1320351 lo que nos interesa realmente es que mejoren los servicios prestados en el hospital comarcal
1320352 la mejor soluci n parece ser negociar la compra del actual hospital concertado para hacerlo p blico pues el hecho de tener como hospital de referencia a un hospital privado supone un derroche de dinero al tener que cubrir los gastos de los servicios prestados y adem s los beneficios correspondientes que tiene una empresa privada

1320355 i could not abdicate from my right to political activity just because of my meagre party wage
1320356 i realized there was a silent decision to get rid of me
1320357 but they didnt want to expel me because of renamos past experience with expulsions
1320358 i was suspended without being heard and without any information
1320359 i was suspended for an unlimited period and the other party members had instructions not to speak with me only the most courageous disobeyed
1320360 each party has its own internal rules just like renamo
1320361 just as samuge was not forced to join renamo so he was not forced to leave it was a voluntary decision and we welcome it

1320370 he is a great citizen of russia and my favorite writer
1320371 my favorite novel is cancer ward there is so much optimism in it so much life affirmation he never forces his ideas upon you but rather asks you to meditate and you come to understand its seriousness and greatness yourself
1320372 people with his understanding of life were our last hope
1320373 today young children are growing up and they dont know anything
1320374 is much more explicit than any recommendation out there right now
1320375 the time frame is that the benefit if there is any from screening is 10 years
1320376 the average life expectancy for men over 75 years is less than 10 years so screening them can do more harm than good
1320377 there is uncertainty about whether the benefits exceed the harm based on existing evidence
1320378 most of the harms are related to treatment rather than screening
1320379 men under the age of 75 should try to make an informed choice at this time
1320380 the current evidence is not enough for us to know the balance between benefit and harm
1320381 that discussion should occur before screening occurs and should include what the test does and does not mean the consequences of finding cancer and the uncertainty about whether benefit exceeds harm based on current evidence
1320382 he doesnt get a lot of headlines but he is one of the key players at qualcomm

1320384 but im surprised they did not pick someone with more imagination in devices im not sure whether a semiconductor guy does the trick can he green light the next five great devices consumers want
1320385 but i would not have taken this job if i did not believe in the organization
1320386 he sees things for what they are and changes things that need to be changed
1320387 i am optimistic that we will be good partners so collectively we make better decisions
1320388 we have strengthened security in all olympic venues and in the olympic village we are well prepared to deal with any kind of threat
1320389 fights between uighurs and han chinese happen about every day on different kinds of scale
1320390 inflation is still an issue and certainly the first half of the year was a big burden on consumer spending
1320391 consumers appear to be acting rationally in a very uncertain economic environment
1320392 i think the industry should be very concerned anything that impacts the spending power of consumers clearly impacts our industry
1320393 the boys and girls who live with hiv are here and we are growing up with many goals
1320394 we want to be artists teachers doctors even get married and have kids but achieving these goals will only be possible when we receive the attention we need when we are guaranteed the medicines that we need when we are accepted in schools

1320426 all of the experts agree if the first drug doesnt work the execution is going to be excruciating
1320427 hes in good spirits but hes in a lot of pain
1320428 i heard a noise outside that sounded like a car sliding
1320429 i turned around and looked out the window real quick and i saw a car flipping bumper to bumper head over heels
1320430 he wanted to get out of the car and lay on the ground
1320431 i told him no he needed to stay put until the rescue people got there
1320432 my understanding of it is she was going to give him a ride home and she did not know the way so he was going to drive the vehicle
1320433 the car was torn up so bad i couldnt tell what it was
1320434 my aim in life when i graduated from high school was to get out of mississippi
1320435 i started coming back in about 1979 because my parents moved back which i couldnt understand what in the world would make you come back here it took me about 20 years to figure that out
1320436 has been a fixture here for a very very long time
1320437 hes got the fame hes got the fortune yet hes got a level head and used that to help people
1320438 were all kind of used to seeing him around the community here so were not surprised when we do see him
1320439 none of those conversations suggest that favre was soliciting a job or that other teams were soliciting his services
1320440 based on the information that we had the packers thought it was appropriate to bring this matter to the leagues attention
1320441 we respect the commissioners investigation of this matter and we now consider it closed
1320442 we provided the league with all information requested so they could be comprehensive in their decision making
1320443 i know if they do open it up to competition not a lot of people give me a chance but i believe in myself and im going to be the best i can be and let coach decide from there
1320444 if he is i might go see him when im done here
1320445 theres no magic wand they got us into this mess by not behaving prudently during the good years
1320446 the most important is to resolve the mortgage crisis there is a very serious shortage of money for the lenders to lend
1320447 were in a situation this year where lending this year will probably be about half what it was last year now thats a very serious drop and we need to see something done to address that
1320448 on october 30 there was to be a cash drop off between 1 and 1 30pm
1320449 the police surveillance operation was mounted from 8 30am when the land rover left liverpool
1320450 at 1 44pm a huge convoy of armed police came towards kingstown and as they passed the bp garage close to the bank the four occupants of the car ran away
1320451 they starburst from the vehicle and ran in different directions
1320452 we will investigate cases like this very thoroughly and vigorously

1320461 from 2007 to the first half of 2008 vulnerabilities affecting web server applications accounted for 51 percent of all vulnerability disclosures
1320462 without a unified process for disclosing vulnerabilities the research industry runs the risk of actually fueling online criminal activity
1320463 there is a reason why x force does not publish exploit code for the vulnerabilities we have found and perhaps it is time for others in our field to reconsider this practice

1320468 does anyone underst amp why obama suggesting that people keep air tires properly inflated is some sort of hilarious gaffe
1320469 mccain supporters in michigan will distribute tire gauges at obamas energy speech in lansing a rnc will also deliver gauges reading obamas energy plan to washington newsrooms
1320470 inflating your tires amp getting a regular tune up sounds more like obamas plan for ego maintenance than it does for helping american families
1320471 obama refers to big oil amp a need to reduce our use of oil by 35 over a next twenty years how do we get are keep inflating those tires folks
1320472 it seems to me a only thing obama wants us to do is inflate tires
1320473 barack obama stood up at a speech recently amp said that one of a things that is really important from energy policy from his st amp point is to check a pressure in our tires so heres a tire gauge amp you can go out in a parking lot here amp check your tires now thats an interesting thing we want you to have good pressure in your tires you know it will very mildly add to your fuel efficiency but checking a air pressure in your tires is not an energy policy for a united states of america

1320545 as the most essential life sustaining substance and the most critical input to economies around the globe water is the only commodity that has absolutely no substitute at any price
1320546 water is the only commodity for which there is no replacement can we replace oil yes oil we can replace same with lumber or soybeans there is only so much water on earth but the demand for water itself is not affected by inflation or tax rates
1320547 water is not the new oil yet because oil is priced as a commodity while water still experiences inefficient pricing relative to the cost of treatment and transporting it to the point if use
1320548 but when one looks at the appreciation of water rights from 2000 an acre to 30 000 an acre in the last 36 months the price of water in various situations is surging the cost of a gallon of bottled water vs the price of a gallon of oil is still 50 higher when put in the terms of what consumers pay for a 16oz bottle water product from pepsi or coca cola

1320554 ich hoffe dass die presse die regelungen der chinesischen gesetze respektiert
1320555 die kontrollen widersprechen dem umfeld das die gastgeber versprochen haben und stehen im gegensatz zu den versicherungen des internationalen olympischen komitees ioc dass die presse wie bei fr heren spielen arbeiten kann
1320556 nachdem sich schon die hoffnungen auf eine verbesserung der menschenrechte in china im vorfeld der spiele zerschlagen haben zeigt sich nun dass auch die zusicherung der pressefreiheit nicht ernst gemeint war

1320566 we might not have played beautiful football under the conditions of the ground but we played effective football i think that is important it is not necessary that we play beautiful football all the time
1320567 myanmar are a good team they are technically good and they play hard game so we cant take them lightly we want to win but it will not be easy
1320568 i was used to playing in such conditions in kolkata but other players were not used to i was scared of them especially youngsters gouramangi singh and anwar ali but fortunately everybody came through and there was no injury
1320569 i wont say it would be the best achievement as for me winning any tournament for the country is a big thing but yes winning this tournament would be one of the high points in my career

1320576 the possibility of a tornado is just as great in downtown chicago as it is in our rural counties
1320577 if you hear the sirens going off dont call 9 1 1 take action protect yourself
1320578 it appears the damage occurred mostly in the northern parts of town from 45th avenue to griffith here north we were heavily damaged in that area and then from ridge road north of that has the most severe damage

1320597 the education dilemma facing quantum information science and engineering is keenly felt at mit because of our leadership role in the field
1320598 mit has research groups and classes in qis led by the fields pioneers but the very diversity and richness of our resources creates a great challenge to giving our students a coherent experience with the nsfs generous support which will combine with resources that the institute will devote as well as participation from a broad consortium of government and industry partners we are going to tackle this challenge with an innovative interdisciplinary approach to training the new generation of qis scientists and engineers
1320599 there is widespread belief that fundamental ideas from qis will lead to useful new information technologyand provide computing communication and control systems beyond the limits of traditional paradigms
1320600 these carry with them profound social implications this is why iquise will incorporate education in ethics and social context
1320601 the students in mits new nsf training program will be encouraged to cross disciplines and develop a common fellowship with their peers we will also address training for post academic jobs directly by connecting students to government and industrial members of the iquise consortium
1320602 the iquise program represents a bold step forward to coalesce and cohere the education and research training that will produce a new generation of quantum information researchers for our nation
1320603 it is especially gratifying that mits strengths in bringing together different disciplines into innovative cooperation will be the backbone of this new program

1320729 i recently had a meeting with barack obama which was very positive and covered a lot of subjects we discussed iran afghanistan and iraq and his views on the middle east peace process we also talked about the economic difficulties both in the us and here in britain
1320730 the scientist who coined the term acid rain says the world is close to a global warming tipping point
1320731 after 15 years research it is now clear to us that as far as forests are concerned our fear of acid rain was totally unfounded
1320732 what we have found is that norwegian forests have had a growth rate of some 25 per cent over the past 15 years and that acid rain is the reason
1320733 i do not foresee a time when welsh mps would no longer exist there will be key issues where britain is stronger for having a united voice while there will also be more domestic issues for individual parliaments there are clearly issues important to the uk what i foresee is a strong union of parliaments
1320734 the lord will fight my case and i shall hold my peace i dont need any telephone communication in this regard because of my health hence the presence of my husbands relatives around me always i dont want them to know about this development
1320735 barack obama has taken howard deans 50 state strategy to heart he is waging a campaign and spending millions of dollars in red states that most professionals expect him to lose with one exception virginia the other states are indiana north dakota north carolina montana georgia and alaska all told obama has spent 7 8 million on tv ads in these seven states vs 1 6 million for mccain many democratic insiders would rather have him abandon them all except virginia and spend the money in ohio missouri colorado nevada new mexico and iowa instead all of which will be very close after the election results are in obama but mostly his advisors david axelrod and david plouffe will be seen either as geniuses or dodos

1320737 so faith comes from hearing and hearing through the word of christ
1320738 if you believe what you like in the gospels and reject what you dont like it is not the gospel you believe but yourself
1320739 wherever we find the word of god surely preached and heard and the sacraments administered according to the institution of christ there it is not to be doubted is a church of god
1320740 and let us with caution indulge the supposition that morality can be maintained without religion whatever may be conceded to the influence of refined education on minds reason and experience both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle
1320741 the ultimate determinant in the struggle now going on for the world will not be bombs and rockets but a test of wills and ideas a trial of spiritual resolve the values we hold the beliefs we cherish and the ideals to which we are dedicated

1320744 these figures show the yawning gulf between rhetoric and reality when it comes to this governments record on renewable energy
1320745 britain has world leading potential when it comes to wave and tidal energy yet the government is sitting idly on the funding which the sector so desperately needs
1320746 how can the government hope to meet its targets on renewable energy when it is not even capable of spending the modest funding it has set aside for wave and tidal technology
1320747 this is a vital time for the development of the renewable energy industry instead of spending so much time pushing its nuclear energy agenda the government should be focusing on getting funding for renewable technologies to where its needed
1320748 the 42m has been set aside to help an industry in its infancy and we have a duty to make sure public money is spent in the most effective way
1320749 we have already made in excess of 100m available to the wave and tidal industry which has helped to take projects from the drawing board and into the water
1320750 in the current global climate of difficult economic conditions and the ongoing effects of the credit crunch businesses are keen to reduce their overheads wherever possible
1320751 last year the carbon trust helped companies here to reduce their energy costs by 18 3million a return on investment of over six to one the renewed backing of invest ni will help the carbon trust build on this success and help local businesses to even further improve the productivity of northern ireland as a whole
1320752 improving the standard of energy management and efficiency within companies is the most effective way to reduce carbon emissions whilst also reducing overheads

1320762 no decision has been made on timing of devolution and other areas such as financing are still to be worked through we continue to work on the basis that sufficient community confidence is required before devolution can take place
1320763 the minister will be elected by the assembly and not by the dhondt process this will ensure cross community support for the new minister
1320764 we have agreed with the dup that powers would be transferred to a single department with a single minister elected by cross community support and that initially neither ourselves nor the dup would take on that ministry this is a significant development
1320765 i think there is this idea that they can rely on us to ride to the rescue well they cant expect that when they havent spoken to us on the issue for the last 16 months
1320766 arguably risks undermining the rights of fair trial for the individuals concerned
1320767 we are concerned that some of the proposals being put forward by the government in the counter terrorism bill would place inappropriate responsibilities on parliament
1320768 considering that any debate will be highly political in nature and any vote may well be whipped by the political parties we are deeply concerned that the independence of the judiciary may appear to be undermined and that trials may be prejudiced
1320769 the committee joins a long list of experts who have condemned the governments ill thought through proposals for 42 days as both unfair and unworkable
1320770 the bill risks conflating the role of parliament and the judiciary which would be quite inappropriate
1320771 we are concerned that some of the proposals being put forward in the counter terrorism bill would place inappropriate responsibilities on parliament
1320772 parliament would have to act in a quasi judicial manner in deciding the pros and cons of detaining suspects without charge for longer than 28 days we are deeply concerned that the independence of the judiciary may appear to be undermined and that trials may be prejudiced
1320773 it doesnt have shareholders now that its owned by the government so its got to come to us so what weve said is that we will put in up to 3bn
1320774 weve got to get state aid approval for that so we cant give a precise figure but up to 3bn may be necessary
1320775 i think the prime minister is very focused on what we need to do to recapture peoples enthusiasm
1320776 but i am very clear in my mind that provided we can get across to people what were for the difference that the government can make the clear principles of fairness that govern everything we can do then we can turn this situation around

1320778 the key stage two sats have become little more than vanity testing proof for the government of rising standards in primary schools which the consumers of these results secondary schools arent buying
1320779 many teachers are now finding that pupils are not at the levels they appear to be at in their tests there is such pressure to do whatever to get kids to the highest levels and for many that means coaching
1320780 these may well represent only the tip of the iceberg in terms of national concerns about the reliability and validity of this years results
1320781 the shambles surrounding the marking of this years tests are a disgrace 460 schools still do not have results for all of their pupils
1320782 the government must now waive the remarking costs to schools for this years exams it would be totally wrong for schools to pay the price for the governments and ets incompetence
1320783 yet again ministers have failed to meet their own targets too many children will be starting secondary school without having a good grasp of the core subjects
1320784 we would like to see a complete review of the current industrial testing system
1320785 we need to move education away from teaching to tests
1320786 the money saved would be better used to finance the governments personalization and intervention agendas
1320787 many people are questioning the value of ks3 testing and there is increasing evidence that the results of ks2 testing are not providing the information which secondary schools want or trust
1320788 a director of education from one of the welsh local authorities has told me of what he saw as a transformation for the better in year 6 following the demise of ks2 testing
1320789 criticising the publishing of the sats results shows a lack of understanding of statistical theory with almost complete returns the results are reliable at a national level
1320790 this doesnt say much however as the reliability of the test results has always been too low to provide accurate comparisons between schools
1320791 atl therefore continues to campaign for the replacement of tests by teacher assessment which can provide a better picture of a young persons learning while reducing the relentless pressure of testing on students
1320792 the proportion of 11 year olds reaching the governments target level 4 has increased more or less steadily since national tests were introduced in 1994 but the rise has not been rapid
1320793 there is also substantial disagreement about what even this slow rate of progress means
1320794 in fact more care has been taken to maintain the standards of the national curriculum tests often incorrectly called sats than gcse or a level
1320795 of course this would be ok if our tests measured what was important in the modern world but they dont
1320796 the foreign office was clearly disturbed that former ambassadors like christopher meyer and craig murray were able to publish highly critical memoirs while paying only lip service to the rules
1320797 but in trying to stop that happening again they have changed the rules in a way that has at least on paper serious unintended consequences this looks like a case of back to the drawing board
1320798 in practice the foreign office continues to rely on the good sense of its former staff

1320896 the mcc presidential search process has stalled and the board of trustees have entrenched themselves in a gridlock position that must end
1320897 the search process has reached this impasse because many trustees have allowed divisiveness and personal agendas to affect their decision making with little regard for the damage they are causing the college while i believe that the board of trustees should operate with some level of autonomy their failure to come to a decision has made it clear to me that i must step in and end the divisive and failed process that has brought us to this point it is time for the board to end the stalemate and conduct a new search process free of politics personal agendas and bitter conflict
1320898 earlier this week former mcc president peter spina sent me a letter offering to help heal the college
1320899 expressing his concern for the future of mcc dr spina graciously offered his assistance during this challenging period after spending nearly twenty years building mcc into the outstanding institution that it is today i know that peter is uniquely qualified to begin a new search process and lead the college in the right direction
1320900 as president dr spina played a pivotal role in forging our modern community college and a return to his leadership is a clear path to securing mccs future
1320901 peter graciously reached out to me in an effort to offer his assistance and the board of trustees must embrace this opportunity i believe former president spina can reinvigorate the presidential search process because he is free of any hidden political or personal agenda and that is exactly how we must proceed
1320902 any trustee who cannot put aside his or her personal agenda and support a new search process clearly does not have the best interests of the college in mind and must step aside and resign immediately
1320903 the students faculty and staff at mcc deserve nothing less and the taxpayers of monroe county are certainly entitled to better than the divisive process we have seen to date mcc is a tremendous asset to our community and as county executive it is my responsibility to protect its integrity and ensure that it has a bright future i am confident that under the leadership of dr peter spina and with a new presidential search we will continue to see mcc grow prosper and offer an affordable quality education to every member of our community

1320931 andy exactly what is mesn doing for the severely affected greg
1320932 in response to andys e mail you wrote exactly what is mesn doing for the severely affected
1320933 this question cannot be answered directly since the severely affected is an abstract concept
1320934 what we do generally other than in response to specific requests from individuals is documented in our literature and monthly newsletter
1320935 dear john as you know i meant severe me sufferers i just want to know exactly what issues mesn on your own initiative and under your own name as you stated are pursuing on behalf of severe me sufferers in norfolk i do not have access to your newsletters and information and meanwhile my wife is in utter torment best wishes greg

1320941 if one were to ask however what is mesn doing for severely affected m
1320942 too many people diagnosed with me cfs have no idea what the illness is they have no burning pains exacerbated by illness they are the ones who recover and are welll enough to run these local groups they never had me thats why exercise diet and relaxation worked for them thats why serious is an abstrat mythical term for them

1321003 the advertising council u s forest service and the national association of state foresters put the public service announcement together to educate riders about fire safety
1321004 but the psa completely missed the mark and questioned the intentions of responsible ohv riders everywhere
1321005 chief kimbell is to be commended for listening to the concerns of the ohv community
1321006 we support public service announcements that promote responsible riding and we have asked the u s forest service to consult with ohv experts when producing ohv related psas in the future the ohv community is certainly willing to help
1321007 our common interest with the forest service makes it imperative that we work cooperatively on all initiatives intended to address responsible ohv use and the prevention of wildfires
1321008 that there were no weapons of mass destruction in iraq intelligence they received in plenty of time to stop an invasion
1321009 over the next few days the habbush letter continued to be featured prominently in the united states and across the globe
1321010 foxs bill oreilly trumpeted the story sunday night on the oreilly factor talking breathlessly about details of the story and exhorting now if this is true that blows the lid off al qaeda saddam
1321011 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1321012 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1321013 the allegation that the white house directed anyone to forge a document from habbush to saddam is just absurd
1321014 ron suskind makes a living from gutter journalism he is about selling books and making wild allegations that no one can verify including the numerous bipartisan commissions that have reported on pre war intelligence
1321015 the way of the world a story of truth and hope in an age of extremism
1321016 ignored the iraq intelligence chiefs accurate disclosure that there were no weapons of mass destruction in iraq intelligence they received in plenty of time to stop an invasion
1321017 they secretly resettled him in jordan paid him 5 million which one could argue was hush money and then used his captive status to help deceive the world about one of the eras most crushing truths that america had gone to war under false pretenses
1321018 operation created by the white house and passed to the cia seems inconsistent with
1321019 intended to influence united states political processes public opinion policies or media
1321020 it is not the sort of offense such as assault or burglary that carries specific penalties for example a fine or jail time
1321021 it is much broader than that it pertains to the white houses knowingly misusing an arm of government the sort of thing generally taken up in impeachment proceedings
1321022 the administration profoundly altered basic democratic ideals of accountability and informed consent
1321023 it should be noted that the intelligence sources who are quoted in this book in no way disclosed any classified information none crossed the line
1321024 tendency of the white house to ignore advice it didnt want to hear advice that contradicted its willed certainty political judgments or rigid message strategies
1321025 was a trained kgb agent who wants you to think hes your friend
1321026 step back in large meetings when they were together like those at the nsc national security council because people were addressing and deferring to cheney cheney said he understood that hed mostly just take notes at the big tables and then he and bush would meet privately frequently to discuss options and action
1321027 complex strategies developed over decades for how to protect a president
1321028 after the searing experience of being in the nixon white house cheney developed a view that the failure of watergate was not the break in or even the cover up but the way the president had in essence been over briefed
1321029 they key was a signaling system where the president made his wishes broadly known to a sufficiently powerful deputy who could take it from there if an investigation ensued or a foreign leader cried foul the president could shrug this was never something hed authorized the whole point of cheneys model is to make a president less accountable for his action cheneys view is that accountability a bedrock feature of representative democracy is not in every case a virtue
1321030 well along in petulance seasoned by a touch of self defensiveness
1321031 moving on its own natural arc the country is in the process of leaving bush his bullying impulse fused permanently with satisfying vengeance in the scattering ashes of 9 11
1321032 the high purpose his angry words carried after the attacks and in two elections since is dissolving with each passing minute
1321033 but this is ivf the rules are much different well get you to 9 months i have confidence in you and me
1321034 what were seeing suggests there may be a social connectivity constant for humanity
1321035 people have had this suspicion that we are really close but we are showing on a very large scale that this idea goes beyond folklore
1321036 first off if you think this post is about you its not
1321037 i bought you your favorite mint no lame ass spearmint like i like
1321038 it is when the criteria we use to prepare to assess someones ability to do a job is radically out of step with the actual demands of the job itself
1321039 the basic requirement of instrumental rationality the wide scope requirement that you should be such that whenever you intend e and know that you will not achieve e unless you both have and execute the intention to take the means m then you will also intend the means m
1321040 the possibly empty set of intentions that you have about how to act in a given situation s is rational if and only if it is reasonable for you to expect that 1 you will execute all of these intentions if any in s and that 2 you will act as you should in s
1321041 what is in fact the way one has most reason to act
1321042 should we cash out the reasonableness of reasonable expectations that adhering to a practical rule will lead to one getting things right partly in terms of the requirements of theoretical rationality
1321043 can he or she with a team of others lead a christ centered community that starts small and grows reproducing itself before becoming unmanageable and outgrowing the gifting of its leadership

1321045 gene doping is the next major headache for the world of sport
1321046 in 2004 people were starting to talk about its use at the athens olympics this year in beijing the case is even stronger that this will be the first genetically modified games many scientists will say its still not possible but im not taking this for granted we need to assume that its happening its already feasible
1321047 there is no other technology that is likely to change the olympics more than gene doping its not possible to detect and theres a good chance that it will never be detectable in any meaningful sense
1321048 this forces the world of sport to reconsider what it does about testing its time for their plans to change its time for the era of human enhancement to take full effect in the olympics
1321049 london 2012 should be watching beijing very carefully to see whats possible there has never been a clean olympics
1321050 the main problem for sports is that there are so many technologies that are under the radar of anti doping that its policies do little more than to point us to successes of anti doping testing
1321051 yes we have no experience with sports people here but the treatment is safe and we can help you
1321052 it strengthens lung function and stem cells go into the bloodstream and reach the organs it takes two weeks
1321053 i recommend four intravenous injections 40 million stem cells or double that the more the better we also use human growth hormones but you have to be careful because they are on the doping list
1321054 we have to believe that athletes will try anything to get an edge and this might occur at the olympics and we work on that basis
1321055 miley cyrus she is going to do a great job presenting today i really like her because she is so confident she knows what she wants so she is a good choice i think
1321056 i think miley is awesome i think she needs to give me some advice she is doing alright for herself
1321057 i would be so nervous that is probably going to be hard but i cant wait to see her too
1321058 probably his biggest impact will be the level and type of engineering talent he will attract to the company over time
1321059 these figures will do nothing to quell fears that the economy is sliding towards negative growth and the prospect of a technical recession looks increasingly likely
1321060 although the looming rise in cpi inflation seems likely to keep rate cuts off the mpcs agenda with consumer and business confidence fragile a shot across the bows rate hike would be brave if not foolhardy in our view
1321061 which would keep the mpcs options open for a rate hike to ward off any signs of a persistent worsening in the inflationary environment
1321062 although market conditions in the home building industry remain challenging we continue to focus on reducing our inventory and generating cash flow from operations

1321064 ive asked the hse to prepare for the introduction from september next year but it has to be cost effective
1321065 every 12 year old girl will be offered the opportunity to have the vaccine subject to her parents consenting
1321066 clearly its controversial in this sense that the vaccine has to be administered to the girls before they become sexually active
1321067 clearly it prevents cervical cancer when the girl is older we have to give the vaccine on the basis of the medical advice available that it should be administered to girls at the age of 12
1321068 we have to have a sense of priority and balance
1321069 we also want to look at extending the age of the women that are called for breast screening
1321070 we release on the second tuesday of every month and immediately the hackers and defenders start reverse engineering those patches and customers immediately start downloading them and evaluating them
1321071 microsofts goal with the active protection program is to give the companies that are providing protections a head start in that race to protections against exploitation
1321072 the goal here really is to help customers prioritize their deployments
1321073 we always assume the worst case and the most talented attacker that was the assumption that we made previously here we are going to actually back this up with our research
1321074 if events develop according to the worst case violence scenario russia will not allow itself to remain indifferent considering that russian citizens live in south ossetia particularly in the conflict zone
1321075 i dont want to make any grim predictions but if such events are repeated the situation may spiral out of control and lead to sad consequences
1321076 further measures in the autumn to help people with housing and through them the housing market
1321077 theres no doubt today that what is happening now is far more profound and will be more prolonged than people thought 12 months ago when the problems first arose
1321078 the important thing is that we are straight with people we are going through a tough time thats likely to continue for a while we are no exception every country in the world is going through this
1321079 i am looking at a number of measures and im not going to be drawn on that today because we have not concluded what exactly we need to do
1321080 its helping people thats important i want to look at a range of options that will help people
1321081 there are two problems in relation to windfall taxes one is the principle and one is the practicality two years ago people were calling for a windfall tax on the banks i dont think anyone will be doing that today
1321082 i think the principle of providing certainty and stability especially if you take our energy companies where i want them to be investing in new plant and power stations i think thats very important
1321083 my main focus is on working with them to see how we can help their customers meet the higher bills that they are facing at the moment
1321084 the prime minister is very focused on what we need to do to recapture peoples enthusiasm
1321085 it is very clear to me that provided we can get across to people what we are for and the difference government can make the clear principle of fairness that governs everything we do then we can turn the situation around
1321086 weve argued that it is easier to make a concession on stamp duty when the amount you are making from it is falling
1321087 its clear that consumer confidence is falling and people would benefit from the reassurance that one of those upfront costs of entering the housing market is being removed
1321088 its still important for the government to sort out mortgage funding if you stimulate demand but dont sort out funding you create a whole set of other problems
1321089 music has been a vital and vibrant part of sonys culture for over 20 years
1321090 this acquisition will allow us to achieve a deeper and more robust integration between the wide ranging global assets of the music company and sonys products operating companies and affiliates it enables us to offer a total entertainment experience to consumers
1321091 after a careful and thorough review we made the strategic decision to sell our investment in this joint venture to sony a step that we believe will benefit the stakeholders of both our companies
1321092 this move is consistent with our new growth strategy and will enable us to focus on our defined growth areas sony has been an excellent partner and they are the right company to take this business to the next step and ensure that it realizes its full value and potential we look forward to witnessing sony music entertainments exciting future under sonys ownership

1321104 das formel 3 masters hat ein gro es renommee auch wenn es zu keiner meisterschaft z hlt hier treffen sich jedes jahr die st rksten nachwuchsfahrer und die besten teams zum direkten vergleich viele sieger haben sp ter den sprung in die formel 1 oder die dtm geschafft
1321105 f r den formel 3 motor aus dem volkswagen konzern ist die strecke in zolder neuland unser partnerteam signature hingegen hat dort schon gute erfahrung gemacht gemeinsam m chten wir trotz zahlenm ig deutlich berlegener konkurrenz ein gutes ergebnis erzielen
1321106 im vergangenen jahr haben wir das richtige rezept f r diese traditionsreiche rennstrecke gefunden und gut abgeschnitten wir arbeiten hart daf r erneut ein gutes ergebnis einzufahren und den schwung f r die verbleibenden rennen in der formel 3 euroserie zu nutzen ein erfolg in zolder w re eine tolle motivation f r den kampf um die meisterschaft
1321107 zuletzt stand ich am norisring auf dem podium da m chte ich nat rlich wieder hin beim masters muss man den grundstein f r ein gutes ergebnis im zeittraining legen wenn man unter die ersten zehn kommt ist alles m glich
1321108 perfekt w re einen satz f r das erste zeittraining einen f r das zweite zeittraining und einen f r das rennen einzusetzen
1321109 aber ich erwarte dass viele fahrer mit allen mitteln versuchen werden in die top 20 zu kommen und im zeittraining mehr als einen neuen satz benutzen werden daher muss man auf den punkt sehr schnell sein wenn man neue reifen f r das rennen aufheben m chte
1321110 unsere leistung im vergangenen jahr war dennoch sehr gut der kurs in zolder weist zwei lange geraden und drei schikanen auf die bremsen sind stark gefordert das sollte unserem auto und dem volkswagen motor liegen

1321138 everybody knows robbie he is a fantastic player and i think he will be a very important player for us our understanding was very good and im very happy with the result at rangers on saturday
1321139 we had only trained three days together which isnt so much time but we will have had three games on the pitch before the premier league starts which will be important for us while the understanding with stevie is also important for robbie and for me

1321285 i then carried out whats known as a function test on the weapon which is when i caught something on the striker of the mini flare which discharged it
1321286 due to where i was sitting the metal cap around the size of a one pence piece fired up first and this is what got lodged into my throat
1321287 the flare itself shot out bounced around in the back of the land rover landed at my feet and burnt off my helmet cover and scorched the helmet
1321288 on hearing the bang pte thompson came down and treated me straight away by putting his hand on my neck to stop the bleeding then a field dressing
1321289 i believe he did save my life there was a lot of blood
1321290 it felt like i had been punched in the jaw it stung a bit too and felt hot
1321291 looking back the force of the explosion and the cap knocked my head back i think this is what moved my head from the flare going off i was lucky that the flare didnt get stuck in too
1321292 the helmet got kicked out of the land rover as we stopped still on fire
1321293 by this time the message had been passed to my vehicle commander and the whole convoy was halted a civilian lorry driver passed up my helmet which had stopped burning by this time
1321294 another troop of force protection from our squadron in germany many of them good friends of mine were passing the same route as us at the same time southbound to kuwait
1321295 i was led out of the vehicle by pte thompson to the ambulance mastiff surrounded by a lot of my mates too i was so embarrassed holding my neck with blood down me they all looked shocked to see it was me
1321296 i had x rays then straight away had the cap removed and was stitched up i was kept in hospital for 24 hours for observation and also so they could give me antibiotics on a drip
1321297 i phoned mum at work and said mum dont panic because im here talking to you but i shot myself with a flare its ok im ok dont worry i asked her to pass on the message to my girlfriend jessica too
1321298 i am extremely grateful to my mate alan thompson for the manner he helped me in he heard the bang and straight away he was down treating me with no hesitation knowing exactly what to do
1321299 and from all the medical staff medics out on the ground and the hospital staff they treated me so quickly and they were so professional but still gave me some stick for shooting myself
1321300 from kuwait and through the border it is sand nothing to see but sand you see the old iraqi army tanks from 1991 in the dessert
1321301 you know there are mines and all sorts of nasties there you go through the oil refineries and you see the fires
1321302 this is only what people see in films i see it for real every day
1321303 you get to the smaller villages nearer basra and there are only a few houses but the small roads are lined with people children all happy to see you waving running along the convoy shouting hello
1321304 you see cars on the roads being driven full of people wherever there is a space there is somebody sitting in that space if its a pick up truck the flatbed is full too
1321305 you go through towns and you are just a magnet to people
1321306 its madness but i really enjoy it out here i enjoy getting out of the vehicle and speaking to the iraqis their english is as good as my arabic so its an interesting conversation
1321307 obviously there is a risk of bad things happening along the routes ieds roadside bombs insurgents kidnapping hostile crowds but it doesnt bother us really
1321308 we are all trained to deal with anything that faces us i feel safe around the people i work with because i know they have all had the same training as me anything i do for them i would expect them to do the same for me
1321309 when we first got there we had to do eight days acclimatisation
1321310 you did fitness in the morning and then we did medical stuff such as if something happens on the ground you learn how to deal with it or if a truck rolls over how to get out
1321311 it was hot but your body gets used to it at night it went down to about 28c
1321312 we went out with the royal anglians i wasnt really nervous it was more like excitement
1321313 i wanted to get out and see what it was like when we went out all the little children waved at you
1321314 i have people out here who live by me who have four and five children and you can imagine how it is on them
1321315 its more important for us to utilize state dollars for textbooks workbooks we try to focus on those things
1321316 we found we were going in a lot of different directions
1321317 you are playing nursemaid counselor janitor every role you think a mom would play that is what we are doing
1321318 i think the cost of everything is going up including sending your child to school
1321319 what kind of problems are you working on in math
1321320 we need all shoppers to be alert for these thieves and to call us straight away if you become suspicious of anyone
1321321 this could be someone standing closer to you trying to distract you or just noticing someone who is paying an older shopper particular attention
1321322 if you are suspicious please call officers using 999 we would rather check out the person you are suspicious of than have older residents be targeted in this way
1321323 in the car park outside my house two of the cars were completely blown up and its affected the others nearby
1321324 mine has been completely destroyed my tyres are ruined and everything inside is melted too
1321325 i woke up at about 3 30am with a sound like a bomb i looked outside and there were big flames everywhere
1321326 the fire service was here within minutes but they couldnt stop the damage and it was 5 30am by the time they left
1321327 i woke up at about 3am and the car was on fire
1321328 theres always a chance guys dont respond to surgeries how much weight he can put on because hes a growing kid when the injuries took place but i remain optimistic he will be back for spring ball
1321329 and then if you miss the call you have to wait for him to call you back you gotta have your cell phone strapped to you at all times
1321330 offered indiscriminately and i think schools come from far away and offer indiscriminately knowing that they can always back out just to get in the game they throw offers out there as i said to former coach karl dorrell you have to be careful because of who you didnt get you lose because you get players that cant play because youre not going to lose them once you get here who wants to leave ucla
1321331 what choice do you have at the end of the day do you want cautious pessimism thats an easy choice and you might be right more often but with an unhappy result i know offensive line coach bob palcic is looking forward to the challenge
1321332 patate formaggio e origano perch se non c il dashi o una qualche preparazione impossibile per noi povere apprendiste cuoche non va vorresti forse farmi credere che gp non abbia apprezzato fino in fondo questo piatto magari scarpetta inclusa orbene signore e signori del blog quale torto potrebbe aver mai fatto un piatto semplice povero ma di genuinit e bont si sopraffina da non meritare un posto accanto a cupolette e frico ecc ecc larringa ti ha convinta
1321333 she was not deliberately selling these as genuine articles and it must have been obvious these were counterfeit
1321334 she was not putting up the pretence they were real she was selling to people who were happy to buy pirated copies
1321335 you should prepare yourself for a custodial sentence or for the case to be committed to crown court it is not 100 per cent but a probability
1321336 this sort of illegal activity prevents honest businesses from making a fair living
1321337 the message that we want to send out to anyone who thinks they can make quick money selling fake goods on ebay is dont be tempted because we will pursue you and when we catch you the punishments are very severe often resulting in prison sentences
1321338 we are determined to take action and put a stop to the sale of fake goods in suffolk whenever we can
1321339 a case of massive rectal bleeding resulting from the placental attachment of an abdominal pregnancy to the sigmoid colon is reported both mother and infant survived this rare complication which should be considered when abdominal colic and major gastrointestinal haemorrhage occur in a pregnant patient
1321340 i went home and wrapped myself in wet clothing and went back into the building
1321341 there were flames everywhere and the heat was intense but i went into auto pilot
1321342 i didnt do it for the glory it was natural instinct
1321343 i saw something that needed to be done and i did it
1321344 i was one of the first to arrive and it was immediately obvious it was going to be a big fire because the place was already well alight
1321345 i found a ladder and noticed there was an open window i climbed the ladder and saw there was a man inside who was asleep but beginning to wake up on the sofa the room was full of smoke
1321346 i roused the man and persuaded him to come outside i had to help him down the ladder because he clearly needed some assistance
1321347 every woman should have the ability to recieve balanced information so they can make their own decisions
1321348 daddy i am so glad you are back home then i dont have to wake up same time as jiejie and i can sleep more i like it when you send jiejie to school first and send me later
1321349 if events develop according to the worst case violence scenario russia will not allow itself to remain indifferent considering that russian citizens live in south ossetia particularly in the conflict zone
1321350 if events continue to develop in this way if the attitude is not changed this wont lead to anything good
1321351 i dont want to make any grim predictions but if such events are repeated the situation may spiral out of control and lead to sad consequences
1321352 we will simply tackle more projects sooner by being judicious in how we design and how we build
1321353 of course were going to still build four lane roads where needed but plenty of other projects can and will be scaled back
1321354 we must choose wisely when deciding where and how to invest our limited transportation dollars
1321355 the only question is can it be built more cost effectively and cost efficiently and still accomplish the intended purpose
1321356 if we have to spend some in order to save a lot then thats exactly what were going to do
1321357 we build what they ask us to build whether its been a cadillac as referred to or if its going to be a chevrolet
1321358 the letter does not mention the freeze for freeze issue
1321359 irans position hasnt really changed as far as any suspension of its nuclear centrifuge activity is concerned
1321360 the best bet in terms of the interests of the west is to start negotaitons without any precondiditions and then in the course of negotations maybe we will be able to get more concessions from iran
1321361 sanctions havent worked and are very unlikely to work any further sanctions would really increase the price of oil and wouldnt benefit the world economy
1321362 you know im going to check into this whole vampire thing
1321363 did i do this wrong is this a rule i didnt know about
1321364 whatever goes as long as youre not bothering anyone else just do what you want to do
1321365 im at base camp im truly happy to be here finally and to be alive
1321366 i now realize that theyre all dead theyre all dead
1321367 now i just want to take off my shoes since my feet are hurting something awful
1321368 we have decided to create a panel of eminent lawyers which would come to work in sudan this has been fully accepted by sudan
1321369 as soon as possible to examine the situation investigate themselves
1321370 we are going ourselves to investigate and work closely with the sudanese government
1321371 some of them may come from africa some of them may come from universities in england in america everywhere
1321372 probably the end result of immune responses to various ubiquitous environmental triggers
1321373 we are very pleased to have dewayne come on board
1321374 he is a veteran in the sec media community and his wealth of experience on the national basketball scene is matched by few
1321375 the kentucky athletics department has a family atmosphere that always made me feel welcome
1321376 working with sec mens basketball for the last eight years i realize the passion that kentucky fans have for their teams my family and i are excited to be a part of the big blue nation
1321377 we cant let that happen we have to take back what was ours to begin with
1321378 when i step on the line in beijing dont worry ill be ready to go
1321379 she made her choice and that was up to her
1321380 in the frame of a transparent and consistent qualification system
1321381 if you want to know what happened or what transpired blow by blow or what words were said im sorry youre not going to know
1321382 its private its between us and its not a big deal and its not the first time it ever happened and it wont be the last
1321383 you never want this stuff to happen but who cares
1321384 were all trying real hard and we get frustrated its going to happen everybody gets to see it oh well
1321385 we always used to watch the olympics as a family growing up
1321386 my dream was winning a gold medal for the united states
1321387 now even though the dream changed a little bit its been kind of bigger than i expected in a way because this story has caught the world by storm im wondering why this girl from south dakota got caught up in this worldwide story
1321388 i need to learn the language im working on it ive only been over there for a year or two and its a difficult language i know a few words but i need to get a lot more words most of the girls speak english so its fine
1321389 if people really do have a hard time with it they should take it up with the olympic committee or fiba im playing well within the rules and i think its a little strange it happens all the time in the olympics for people to get maybe upset or bent out of shape about me is strange because this is something the united states has done many times
1321390 there have been many foreign athletes that have come and competed for the u s and won medals
1321391 i think everyone wants to see the russia america matchup
1321392 if i have to play the united states obviously im going to go out there and compete to win but thats not what i want i know its what everyone else wants but its not what i want
1321393 once the ball went up it was just another basketball game
1321394 you want to meet the u s as late as possible
1321395 i have been playing against those players for 10 years i think when the ball goes up its just going to be another basketball game you just go out there and compete and enjoy the moment since its not going to happen again
1321396 this is a once in a lifetime opportunity and im really looking forward to it
1321397 im glad im not doing as many interviews now just being able to be here and play basketball i think its been put off in the back of my mind for so long just concentrating on what weve been doing in the wnba and now is the first time ive been able to be over here and enjoy the experience
1321398 id love to go watch even if were not taking part in it i hear its pretty tremendous
1321399 im still learning most of the girls on the team three or four of them ive already played with and i have a history with them they are really a good group of girls they are really sweet they have made me feel very welcome and tried to get me accustomed to them very quickly and build chemistry on and off the court
1321400 maria stepanova came up to me and said i was initially against having an american on our team but now that i know you you can play with us any day
1321401 i feel like what happened was a blessing in disguise
1321402 this is something i think has brought this team closer together you may think i sound crazy for saying that but i really think this is bigger than me and steve
1321403 im not going to get into whos right whos wrong im completely wrong
1321404 it was an asinine decision and ill move forward better than i probably have ever had to its the first time in my life that i really havent forgiven myself
1321405 what were seeing here is a clear pattern of repeated violations of patient medical records and patient confidentiality by ucla
1321406 whats startling to us is as we get to a point where we feel weve addressed a specific complaint and a specific issue we identify additional issues
1321407 ucla should have detected the violations by ms jackson years ago and should have immediately initiated the process to dismiss her
1321408 all other employees who were found to have violated patient confidentiality during our review have been disciplined including some who have been terminated
1321409 on behalf of the entire leadership of the ucla health system i am deeply sorry for this failure and the personal distress these breaches may have caused
1321410 californians have every right to expect their medical records to be safeguarded and protected and i am alarmed about repeated violations of patient confidentiality and the potential harm to the citizens of this state
1321411 by putting financial penalties in place for those employees and facilities that do not follow these laws this legislation will lead to better care for all californians
1321412 many aspects of this u s premiere show have never been tried or tested before
1321413 im so excited every girl dreams of being able to play this role
1321414 since the restrictions on internet access became clear in late july authorities have restored access to numerous sites this is a very welcome step toward greater openness
1321415 these limitations fall short of the complete freedom to report promised by wang wei secretary general of the beijing olympic bidding committee in 2001
1321416 the increased openness and accessibility resulting from the olympic regulations for foreign journalists
1321417 to make those olympic reporting regulations permanent as a legacy of the 2008 beijing olympics
1321418 having studied in detail the programmes of real madrid and the dutch eleven i realised that given the physical effort required to perform at my maximum i was going to have to make a choice
1321419 the combination of the competition cup and champions league games of real madrid and the programme of the dutch team is too heavy a burden
1321420 obviously such a decision is not something one takes in a night i have experienced a great euro 2008 with the orange team and i look back on it with fondness
1321421 of course i find it a pity that i wont be able to call on his quality and international experience in putting teams together in the future
1321422 we have agreed on key principles for the road map voluntary and nonbinding cooperation mutual benefit respect for each countrys national oil stockpile policy and bilateral and regional oil stockpile cooperation and a step by step approach with long term perspective
1321423 we expect that we could see a structure of the road map within next year and that we hope to get a substantial road map within the next two years
1321424 weather in japan is also hot so we might have an advantage over the europeans
1321425 the air quality in hong kong is not too bad
1321426 at first i was not happy for having my age being made a big deal
1321427 i still have plenty of tournaments to do well in and i hope i can start here at the olympics and fulfil my dream to win gold
1321428 i only arrived on monday and ive got jet lag but im more tired than normal
1321429 im 80 percent sure my coach hasnt really told me
1321430 its the first miscommunication ive had with my coach i hope it doesnt happen again
1321431 im confident the air quality will not pose major problems to the athletes
1321432 all the people said taufik you are crazy like you are just coming out of hospital and the next day you are training but i say im okay although i only had one week for training
1321433 this study shows that orthokine treatment is a safe alternative to conventional methods
1321434 when a major retail chain remodels or relocates a store they are working to give their customer base the nicest environment possible but on the flip side much of the used equipment would end up in a landfill
1321435 it brings a great return to the retailer on their used equipment and more importantly ensures the majority of replaced equipment is recycled and distributed to other segments of the market
1321436 we have been refining this process for over 30 years and we now have a sales staff finding the best fit for each type of equipment within 20 to 30 days of beginning work on a store we have the equipment sold and shipped to new owners most of the buyers are smaller retailers who are happy to find an entry level price on otherwise expensive equipment
1321437 with the downturn in the economy you wouldnt expect sales to be so strong we are finding a larger number of new start up businesses looking for these products im certain that it can be attributed to higher unemployment levels
1321438 we are so glad to find a solution for our clients and at the same time see new companies grow and create new jobs
1321439 we are glad to work with any business looking for a bargain on shelving and equipment
1321440 the usa is a resilient market made up of the worlds most resourceful people
1321441 if opponents say the refueling activity is unacceptable anyway we would have to consider how to deal with the matter including what else we can do
1321442 it would be impossible that the government has been doing nothing to consider
1321443 the worlds interest has shifted to afghanistan from iraq if japan withdraws from afghan related missions when other countries deploy more troops and units in afghanistan that would be regarded as unacceptable
1321444 we spend money to come here with our families its an inexpensive place to stay
1321445 if they were to say evacuate then yeah we would do it but otherwise no
1321446 i was happy that i could make a comeback to judo my husband and my son are rooting for me i want to do the best for them
1321447 i aim to win my third straight title i had great results in sydney and athens so i would like to continue giving my all
1321448 ive done everything i was supposed to up to this point ive come to beijing with a fresh feeling i want to show the spirit of japanese judo by scoring an ippon against my opponents and shooting for gold
1321449 i have heard that all of the athletes are in good condition our goal is for everyone to do their best to get medals
1321450 weve raised concerns for years about primates being in peril but now we have solid data to show the situation is far more severe than imagined
1321451 tropical forest destruction has always been the main cause but now it appears that hunting is just as serious a threat in some areas even where the habitat is still quite intact
1321452 in many places primates are quite literally being eaten into extinction
1321453 to have a group of animals under such a high level of threat is quite frankly unlike anything we have recorded among any other group of species to date
1321454 we are in good condition and will be looking to play our brand of soccer and get three points
1321455 we may not have any players that are over 23 but we have a strong solidarity this solidarity is the most important thing and it will push us toward victory
1321456 japan is a collective team and has played together for an extended period of time they understand each other very well and as a group as a team that is the biggest strength of the national team
1321457 everyone is trying to point out the bad things but look at the positive side as a coach you are concerned that the team is not always creating chances but during the qualifiers we did create a lot of chances
1321458 we have to forget about big scoring games in todays football it is not possible because the games are so tight and then every situation every free kick and corner kick is valuable to the game and can change the game completely we have to look at the game over 90 minutes and try to win it if it is a goal it doesnt matter how it comes
1321459 look at euro 2008 germany played against portugal who are very fluid but the germans scored three goals from free kicks and nobody complained about that
1321460 i saw japan on tv when we were in hong kong they looked pretty good and we know we have our work cut out for us but at the end of the day the game starts 0 0 and we have go in there and do what we know how to best which is play our game
1321461 he confortola is out of danger he will stay at the base camp for a night and the armys pilots will fly helicopters on wednesday morning to rescue him if the weather has improved there
1321462 are holding up well and are very proud of gers achievement and are still in total shock in relation to the fact that he may not be coming back
1321463 at high altitude at over 8 000 meters 26 250 feet it is too dangerous to mount a rescue to have the bodies returned
1321464 i am going to lead our nation to energy independence and im going to do it with a realistic and comprehensive all of the above approach that uses every resource available to finally solve this crisis
1321465 breaking our oil addiction is one of the greatest challenges our generation will ever face
1321466 my opponent doesnt want to drill he doesnt want nuclear power he wants you to inflate your tires
1321467 when im president of the united states im not going to let them go on vacation theyre gonna become energy independent
1321468 one of the main reasons for the trend is financial difficulties arising from credit card spending overdrafts and other debts resulting in people taking insolvency advice comparisons with the early 90s are ill founded people are taking a view that they may as well going into less expensive rented accommodation than spend all of their income on mortgages and secured loans that will take a lifetime to pay off
1321469 people realise the repossession process will affect their credit rating but they are not too worried about that as most have serious debt problems anyway
1321470 the whole process of repossession turns secured debts into unsecured ones if advice is taken early by taking out an iva or going bankruptcy then losses can be mitigated the worst thing to do is bury your head in the sand the debts wont go way unless you deal with them

1321472 the intent of this ordinance is to try to smear protesters and make them look as if they are somehow criminal or somehow going to engage in some kind of gross conduct
1321473 never stand next to someone who is throwing shit at an armed man
1321474 his mother had no job no pension no husband so from a young age ratko had to fight to survive
1321475 but he was strong he could swim faster than anyone dive deeper run faster throw stones over his shoulder farther than anyone
1321476 if there is a world under the sea then he is hiding there
1321477 it is caught between a rock and a hard place the fed will stand pat
1321478 as a continuation of our core values we are excited to be taking a step toward expanding our initiative to build natural and organic brands and products by signing an agreement to manage market and distribute a branded line of eco friendly products in the bioremediation space we believe in the products their unique technology and the positive impact on the environment as a replacement to harmful and noxious products
1321479 we have worked to make sure that the product holds up to our high eco friendly standards and we believe that it has the potential to increase our revenues in fiscal 2009 while requiring minimal additional overhead
1321480 because it was a localized downpour we couldnt really make a guess
1321481 therell be two inputs present in which one is aplied at the base of the transistor input voltage and other at collector supply voltage vcc
1321482 i also have 240 volts at the nuetrals too is this correct
1321483 i can do this i can breath like this ooo dang i want some pizza
1321484 the nspcc is in a solid financial position but like all businesses and charities in the current economic downturn we are reviewing our activities and this may result in some redundancies

1321496 despite tabloid speculation mary kate olsen had nothing whatsoever to do with the drugs found in heath ledgers home or his body and she does not know where he obtained them ms olsen does not know the source of the drugs mr ledger consumed these descriptions are incomplete and inaccurate
1321497 is not entirely a surprise for the u s market

1321530 youre my friend you know i speak to you all the time
1321531 oh hey how would you like could you bail me out i need this and this and this could we do this or work this together
1321532 i know trends come and go but you need to know about all of them so that you can modify it and pick your own
1321533 i am fine tuning what i do in small groups but there is still much i have to learn thats why ill be working with the literacy professor next year
1321534 youre going to read those pages and complete a worksheet there shouldnt be any talk ing
1321535 i really wasnt concerned as a new teacher about getting paid for this
1321536 i have not been involved in any partnership projects this year i have my own project going an afterschool program for kids who are not reading at grade level
1321537 i have a minimal level of involvement the reason is that i teach two evening classes and i have to leave right after school to get there
1321538 the partnership has helped me learn more about what my colleagues are doing
1321539 you are either in or out and if you are out you dont know what is really going on
1321540 teachers exhibited greater efficacy for positive results than for negative results that is they were more confident in their ability to influence positive outcomes than in their ability to prevent negative ones
1321541 i wanted to improve my literacy center to make it more appealing i also wanted to meet individual needs better the kids are so diverse with their abilities and experiences
1321542 the mixture of the kids really makes or breaks the intentions of the teacher the partnership really cant help that mixture to be working or not the partnership is not as relevant to what occurs in the classroom as some would like to believe
1321543 i wanted to be involved with the literacy project with the suse professor but i dont think she could handle my students very well
1321544 social problem solving was here years ago and the conflict resolution group is much like it yet in both the advantages were undone by the students homes because the practices are not done at home in this way the program hasnt really changed in methodology or in outcome

1321557 a reflection of the time that ive spent working with different movements the art of struggle is a political album that encompasses my perspective on a lot of different issues from immigrant rights to the death penalty to the way that children are impacted most by issues like debt on the african continent and also pride for the rebels that are in my heritage
1321558 my high school never had many computers but they always had plenty military recruiters
1321559 how can i open up these issues and in some way try and put them up against each other in one piece and try and do it in a way so you cant get around the way that this same administration this same system is responsible for all of them

1321563 zur zeit ist eines der gr ten risiken dass die gegenw rtig ausgeschlossenen irgendwann geh r finden und ihren einfluss dann auf nationaler ebene wieder geltend machen daraus entsteht sowohl f r globale unternehmen als auch f r investoren eine herausforderung wie sch tzt man globale unternehmensstrukturen in einer zeit wo sich das l nderrisiko im weitesten sinne versch rft unternehmen m ssen sich gegen politische und soziale unruhen in den nationalstaaten sichern
1321564 der postmoderne imperialismus hat zwei komponenten die erste ist der freiwillige imperialismus der globalen konomie er wird normalerweise von einem internationalen konsortium durch internationale finanzinstitutionen wie iwf und weltbank ausge bt die zweite dimension des postmodernen imperialismus k nnte der imperialismus des nachbarn genannt werden instabilit t in der nachbarschaft stellt eine gefahr dar die kein staat ignorieren kann politische misswirtschaft ethnische gewalt und kriminalit t auf dem balkan stellen eine gefahr f r europa dar die antwort hierauf war eine art freiwilliges un protektorat im kosovo und in bosnien zu schaffen
1321565 freiwilligen imperialismus der glbalen konomie aus verst ndlichen gr nden nicht teilen
1321566 die herausforderung der postmodernen welt ist es mit der idee doppelter standards klarzukommen unter uns gehen wir auf der basis von gesetzen und offener kooperativer sicherheit um aber wenn es um traditionellere staaten au erhalb des postmodernen kontinents europa geht m ssen wir auf die raueren methoden einer vergangenen ra zur ckgreifen gewalt pr ventive angriffe irref hrung was auch immer n tig ist um mit denen klarzukommen die immer noch im 19 jahrhundert leben in dem jeder staat f r sich selber stand unter uns halten wir uns an das gesetz aber wenn wir im dschungel operieren m ssen wir ebenfalls das gesetz des dschungels anwenden
1321567 when the military says robot they mean everything from self driving trucks up to what you would conventionally think of as a robot you would more accurately call them autonomous systems rather than robots
1321568 its a chain of command thing you dont want to give autonomy to a weapons delivery system you want to have a human hit the button
1321569 you dont want the robot to make the wrong decision you want to have a human to make all of the important decisions
1321570 its oftentimes like the difference between the adverb and noun you can act intelligently or you can be intelligent im much more interested in the adverb for my robots

1321587 there was a big problem in that adobe flash is unavailable to the masses the only way a mere mortal can do something really cool on a web site or in a presentation is to hire a flash programmer for a lot of money

1321589 friendster is growing at an enormous rate in asia pacific and is clearly leading the competition i believe this is partly because the internet is transforming the lives of everyone and it will probably become one of the greatest liberators of our time

1321593 the more i think about this question though the more i realize shes already pointed out most of our usual explanations as if shes refuted them
1321594 look i know you work hard for us and do it for no pay but what i dont understand is why youre put off when people write in insulting comments to you also i dont think you really work hard enough for your no money

1321626 heres what landslide provides in the new release a single screen interface that walks its users through the standard tasks that crm fulfills gathering data on customers and leads and then beyond that into a set of processes that guide sales reps all the way through closing the sale
1321627 while the solution comes with a pre set group of processes its also completely customizable so it can fit your organizations way of working and you dont have to impose changes on your staff to fit the software
1321628 its neat for two reasons first of all it brings a wealth of new information to sales people using landslide and it indicates how insideviews information aggregation and evaluation technology is going to become a component of a lot of tools in areas where knowledge of the customer is critical
1321629 i have always felt siemens has a great uc story but nobody is buying it why i have already mentioned they were early to market and they have a great marketing executive in mark straton so why havent they been more successful
1321630 to become a market leader they need to change the way enterprise customers look at communications
1321631 as part of the gores joint venture choices can and will be made will sen continue to focus on hosted solutions as they have been doing with their partnership with bt or will sen drive to build on their leadership position in unified communications with the openscape software suite which leverages the powerhouse relationships with microsoft and network upgrades or will sen continue to claw for share in the slow growth large enterprise ip pbx market where they are in the cluster of firms that are losing share to cisco likely we will see sen pick one or at most two of these
1321632 as expected they are using gores turnaround of enterasys as an example
1321633 the turnaround was from dead to irrelevant id hardly boast about that as a success story surely they have something better this is the most press enterasys has had since the late 90s
1321634 the fact that daptiv has collected the metrics for its project interested me because i think it showcases a certain mindset found in service providers the drive to get clients using the system
1321635 in a traditional software model the vendor of the software makes the bulk of their revenue from a license which is usually purchased before any usage occurs professional services often has an even stranger model in that the flow of money actually decreases or stops when the project is over

1321682 imagine for example that you stand upon a giant puzzle board every now and then you observe one piece of this vast jigsaw fall into place for that one moment you see a connection and witness a change to the landscape beneath your feet in that short instance you witness change and are afforded a brief glimpse of a pattern but what you see is largely without context or theme or if some fleeting glimpse of a pattern emerges such evidence is historical and originally witnessed only through the eyes of those older than you or those who have been and since gone
1321683 as an example at the turn of the 20th century it was predicted that passenger air balloon travel pioneered by the likes of count ferdinand von zeppelin would be commoditized and become the pre eminent means of mass transit in fact it would be so popular by the 1980s people would have their own personal air balloon as their primary method of conveyance obviously this gaze into the future didnt take into account the airplane which put an end to that pearl of foresight

1321724 if we cannot even fight a war of words how can we fight a real war
1321725 if you want peace we must be prepared for a war so long as fanaticism and fear brood over the affairs of men we must arm to deter others from aggression nations strength and security are not easily obtained nor are they quickly and simply explained there are many kinds of strength and no one kind will suffice
1321726 shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection we will have to repent in this generation not only merely for the vitriolic words and actions of the bad people but for the appalling silence of the good people
1321727 it is difficult to set up a state it is even more difficult to keep it going
1321728 the lessons of great men are lost unless they reinforce upon our minds the highest demands which we make upon us
1321729 whenever the rule of force as distinct from the rule of law is seen to succeed the world moves a step closer to anarchy playing for time is not working for a peaceful solution wasting time is not willing a peaceful solution it is simply leaving the aggressor with the fruits of his aggression that to appease an aggressor is to invite aggression on an ever increasing scale

1321749 it is announced from the office of the president that in view of the current investigations surrounding the unauthorised landing of the mysterious plane loaded with cocaine at the lungi international airport it has pleased his excellency the president to relieve mr ibrahim kemoh sesay of his duties as minister of transport and aviation pending the conclusion of these investigations
1321750 that has been further exacerbated by blistering headlines from the local press all conjectures that transport and aviation minister kemoh sesay has knowledge of the cocaine transhipment
1321751 is the fact that his brother ahmed sesay also the national soccer team manager is one of those already in police custody for alleged connection with the cocaine plane
1321752 we have treated these cases without compromise such matters are always charged to court without delay the establishment of this unit has helped to minimise the high rate of sexual assaults on young girls
1321753 sir we the male pupils are really in trouble with the teachers we are compelled to satisfy our teachers in cash since we cannot perform the kind aspect of the principle
1321754 this means we pay stipulated amount of money for each of the subjects so that we can maintain our passing grades otherwise failed marks will dominate our results the girls on the other hand score their passing marks enormously in kind or through food for work when girls dont afford to pay the money they are mostly required to visit the houses of their teachers to provide the food for work
1321755 girls mostly boast of passing all their subjects whenever we seat for an examination even though we are very conscious of their incompetence in passing class examinations we the boys are sufferers because our knowledge can no more determine our promotion to the next class
1321756 the problem is not only with the teachers but to we the female pupils because we some times influence them to fall in love relationship with us sometimes when they are teaching in class some female pupils expose some parts of their bodies as a way of drawing the teachers attention our teachers are like any other man and could be influenced as well
1321757 this relationship i am talking about which exists in schools between teachers and pupils is not a hidden game some times relatives of the girl encourage the teacher into their homes but the most dangerous thing about such relationships is that it takes off the attention of those pupils from the classroom as they are always with the conviction that they will score passing grades with or without their academic performance
1321758 friendster is growing at an enormous rate in asia pacific and is clearly leading the competition i believe this is partly because the internet is transforming the lives of everyone and it will probably become one of the greatest liberators of our time

1321761 never foresake the music there is still a great place in this world of radio for practicing word economy and being the listeners friend talk to your kids and learn to speak their language content is king and as long as we provide the content and stay true to our focus were going to be fine career highlight the relationship we have with listeners it is never lost on me i am always amused when somebody relates to a specific moment during the program i get so angry when people on the air dont realize what a great gift we have been given people are kind enough to invite us into their homes vehicles and work spaces every person that calls our program we end those calls saying thanks for listening thanks for calling everyone is given respect

1321765 you shouldnt have to offer a reward for someone to come forward after the death of such a beautiful girl everyone loved her
1321766 my greatest fear is that we do find this murderer and that greatest fear is we find out because hes done this to somebody else
1321767 at this stage there is insufficient evidence to satisfy a jury beyond reasonable doubt that a known person has committed an indictable offence in relation to ms childs death
1321768 it is understood that the nsw police will continue to investigate fresh evidence into childs death
1321769 the police investigation in the early period following ms childs death unfortunately was not able to capture some items of evidence which are no longer available to the current investigating police
1321770 i saw a picture of myself it looked like it was taken at blacktown station and then i didnt know what to do after that
1321771 i told my parents its not me please believe me
1321772 i told them that it wasnt me i told them to get more hard evidence but they said theyve got all the evidence that they needed thats it
1321773 i was about to break down i didnt know what to do
1321774 police made me think that it was me that id done all these things so in my mind i had to go through it to think whether i really did rape anyone or not thats how much they put it on me
1321775 i had never been to a court before i was just so confused and shocked

1321778 fernando is one of the top drivers in formula one and i think every team apart from one would welcome him
1321779 we are no different but whether it happens who knows
1321780 i think any team would want to have a longer term deal any driver for one year is difficult
1321781 but if you have one year deal well then it becomes two or three years
1321782 i am sure the mclaren deal was more than a one year deal and that didnt last beyond a year

1321899 it can simulate existing and advanced air traffic control procedures showing the resulting emission and noise patterns in the future we expect that air traffic controllers would use the system to evaluate and modify flight paths to reduce noise and emissions
1321900 the air traffic and operations management simulator atoms leads to a smarter cleaner system of air traffic management
1321901 our next big challenge is to translate the innovative air traffic procedures which emerged from the simulation into a form that is acceptable for operations
1321902 introducing such new concepts into an operational environment is challenging given the complexity and dynamics of any air traffic system
1321903 we hebben al relevante informatie gegeven met feiten over het chronologisch verloop van omstandigheden rondom zijn dood ook het feit dat olsen de herkomst van de medicijnen niet kent

1321910 momma were scared we cant close our eyes at night
1321911 in spite of our best efforts and that of his father he avoided arrest
1321912 i had a personal bounty out for him as of 5 25 may 25 anyone who arrested him got 2 days off we have a zero tolerance and do not wait for warrants from the sao the state attorneys office for domestic assaults
1321913 get this bitch some water so she will shut up

1321919 first his physical strength is greater as a result of a more intense training program thats given him another element of power and speed to go with his endurance thats quite a combination
1321920 and his breast has gone from a stroke that was quite weak to a strength
1321921 if they gave black belts for handling pressure michael would be a sixth degree black belt
1321922 hes very matter of fact he focuses race by race day by day and then moves on
1321923 the more you use your imagination the farther youll go
1321924 if you think about accomplishing the unthinkable youll have a good chance of doing it
1321925 he had a temper i remember thinking he had the potential to be really good so i felt a responsibility to set him up for the best chance to do well
1321926 if this amendment 5 were to pass in november which i hope it does people will look at that as a lot more than a tweak
1321927 i think it could be a significant stimulant for floridas economy
1321928 i think the governor would be formidable in his campaign
1321929 i just hate to see him lose because i dont think this amendment is going to pass
1321930 hes one person but statewide we have 260 000 teachers bus drivers cafeteria workers
1321931 he may be popular but i think his star is starting to dim very quickly
1321932 i dont think it would be possible to overestimate the importance of the governors endorsement
1321933 charlie may be the best campaigner ive ever seen i think the governor will sell this quite effectively
1321934 im just trying to figure out the degree of help the time ill have to do it i hope to be very helpful
1321935 its maybe filling up a hole in florida families pockets just because government doesnt have it doesnt mean its not going somewhere
1321936 men need to understand that prostate cancer is very common and the majority of these cancers will progress very very slowly if at all
1321937 most of the cancers found in routine screening will never become a problem
1321938 it just doesnt make any sense to me to ignore a test that could potentially give you a life saving diagnosis
1321939 benefits of treatment for prostate cancer detected by screening are small to none
1321940 i can tell you that a good number of patients are still very healthy at age 75
1321941 they have been getting the test for many years already and they will want to continue getting it
1321942 even after 80 a lot of patients decide they still want a psa on a yearly basis because it just gives them peace of mind
1321943 theyve seen a lot of their friends get prostate cancer and they want to know for themselves

1321970 things like printer services are needed to run the system so you should make an informed decision

1321977 then you wont need to deal with those heart wrenching blue screen events
1321978 external drives are the best value ever because theyre so cheap with rescue and recovery tools and an external drive youve got a dynamite safety net
1321979 even though you can learn how to use a new pc within an hour the problem remains that most people are unfamiliar with how they work the more you know about your computer the better you are able to deal with it
1321980 cada a o miles de trabajadores haitianos son apresados en redadas y deportados a su pa s de origen y en el 2005 turbas armadas incendiaron casas y lincharon a muchos de esos inmigrantes

1321982 leonel fern ndez cuyo segundo mandato comienza el 16 de agosto ordena frecuentemente a la polic a que haga redadas y deporte masivamente a los haitianos que encuentren en las calles
1321983 de igual modo los inmigrantes haitianos y dominicanos radicados en nueva york se enfrentan a una situaci n igual por las redadas que hace la polic a migratoria de los estados unidos
1321984 los dominicanos indocumentados en estados unidos entienden la situaci n que confrontan en su pa s los haitianos y la represi n de que son objeto por parte del gobierno
1321985 hacemos un llamado para que el gobierno dominicano detenga de inmediato las redadas deportaciones y la violaci n de los derechos civiles y humanos de los haitianos los ataques racistas deben parar y llamamos a todos los defensores de los inmigrantes para que se nos unan en esta demostraci n

1322008 facevamo politica e non antipolitica eravamo associazioni di persone nate fuori dai partiti che per volevano dare una delega ai partiti della sinistra che erano ancora sotto choc per la sconfitta del maggio 2001 questa la verit anche se di noi alcuni giornali hanno fatto una caricatura io stesso sono stato rappresentato cos e pazienza
1322009 e mi dispiace che in questo disastro sia stata coinvolta una persona come rita borsellino
1322010 quando si fanno queste cose bisogna saper distinguere tra laltro due dei tre organizzatori li conosco bene sono frastornato e non bisogna trovare scuse o alibi nella non tempestivit con la quale in queste settimane si mosso o non si mosso il pd
1322011 esponenti del pd che escono dal partito e poi vanno nei socialisti e lo spazio rimasto vuoto a sinistra del partito democratico non viene riempito da niente e da nessuno
1322012 manca un progetto politico e mancano anche le persone e la generosit
1322013 con quellintervento che dette il via alla mia imprevista avventura politica io nel migliore dei casi non avevo niente da guadagnare e se allora ho avuto ragione oggi sono ancora pi dispiaciuto allora il germe dellautodistruttivit non cera io non ho mai avuto il mito dellelettorato buono contrapposto ai vertici cattivi dei partiti quei girotondi erano rivolti a tutti i cittadini e mi piace pensare che con noi sfilasse anche qualche elettore di destra per cinque volte abbiamo avuto un candidato premier proprietario di tre televisioni questo non succede in nessuna democrazia europea per chi come me ogni tanto prova a ricordarlo viene considerato noioso ripetitivo dicono che di queste cose agli elettori non importa niente perch in italia purtroppo manca unopinione pubblica delle condanne di previti e dellutri lo stesso non interessa capire pi di tanto un ragazzo cresciuto in questi anni trova normale che il capo del governo abbia le tv e noto che ormai c una certa rassegnazione anche sullipotesi che questa persona possa diventare presidente della repubblica il che mi pare davvero un po eccessivo

1322029 amerika is z groot we hebben er bewust voor gekozen de markt stap voor stap te benaderen
1322030 de amerikanen waarderen de bite die deze wodka heeft dankzij de kruiden
1322031 dat maakt sonnema vodkaherb voor bartenders interessant om mee te mixen
1322032 ik heb z ontzettend veel introducties van nieuwe producten zien mislukken dat de tranen me in de ogen schieten
1322033 iedereen is altijd maar bezig met productvernieuwingen ze zeggen vaak je moet het gewoon proberen mislukt het dan proberen we weer iets anders ik geloof daar niet in zo zitten wij niet in elkaar wij doen alleen waar we zelf voor honderd procent in geloven pas toen we er volledig vertrouwen in hadden dat ketel one vodka een kans zou maken zijn we op pad gegaan en we doen alles zelf er is geen bank die ook maar n euro van ons te goed heeft
1322034 bij het verkennen van nieuwe markten blijkt soms dat de merknaam zich al heeft gevestigd voordat we er zelf ooit zijn geweest
1322035 in nieuw zeeland bleek ketel one in sommige bars al verkrijgbaar te zijn ook in berlijn heb ik dat gemerkt bartenders nemen het voor elkaar mee
1322036 we houden de verkopen bij in de tophoreca die onze wodka verkoopt als de omzet terugloopt kijken we wat er aan de hand is zijn er nieuwe bartenders dan investeren we daarin opnieuw we hebben een relatie met de mensen die ons product verkopen
1322037 we hebben het nu zo mooi en druk met de wodka dat we het bijna niet kunnen bijbenen om dan ook nog de ketel1 graanjenever voort te stuwen in de vaart der volkeren dat is niet te doen
1322038 we hebben iets bijzonders waar we trots op mogen zijn maar dat stralen we niet uit jenever was vroeger groot en het kan opnieuw wat worden ook in het buitenland regionale producten krijgen nu juist weer een kans verdwijnen zal jenever in ieder geval nooit daar geloof ik niets van
1322039 one of the reasons im going is because i want to show respect to the chinese people and this is a proud moment for china

1322077 fulfilling their promise that they made last week the bungie crew has outlined the changes coming to halo 3 as part of the second title update well be seeing release in the near future and even though there wont be any hugely noticeable changes a lot of the updates feature have to do with invisible back end and behind the scenes goodness well be getting a new halo 3 experience system fear not though your current halo 3 rank and experience point total will not be reset instead bungie is adding experience point tracking to each playlist then using experience points and solely experience points bungie will award various military ranks per playlist its a tad bit confusing so you may have to jump over to bungie net to read all the halo 3 title update details
1322078 if events develop according to the worst case violence scenario russia will not allow itself to remain indifferent considering that russian citizens live in south ossetia particularly in the conflict zone
1322079 if events continue to develop in this way if the attitude is not changed this wont lead to anything good
1322080 i dont want to make any grim predictions but if such events are repeated the situation may spiral out of control and lead to sad consequences
1322081 the issued verdicts for all of these cases will not be carried out for now
1322082 in a few other cases these people have asked for forgiveness and their request is under review
1322083 illegally possessed firearms and ammunition have been found and seized
1322084 these servicemen had been invited to kyrgyzstan by the kyrgyz government to carry out antiterror exercises for the kyrgyz ministries
1322085 we hope this incident will be resolved so that the u s and kyrgyzstan can continue their joint efforts on boosting kyrgyzstans antiterror potential
1322086 whenever we apply more than the most superficial effort programming anything we will be wasting time unless some of that effort is turned back on the work itself so as to convince ourselves that the whole is sound
1322087 if you would not be forgotten as soon as you are dead and rotten either write things worth reading or do things worth writing
1322088 the power of accurate observation is commonly called cynicism by those who have not got it
1322089 nothing in the world is more dangerous than sincere ignorance and conscientious stupidity
1322090 i do not feel obliged to believe that the same god who has endowed us with sense reason and intellect has intended us to forego their use
1322091 if you cant say anything nice come sit by me
1322092 the beautiful part of writing is that you dont have to get it right the first time unlike say a brain surgeon
1322093 the person be it gentleman or lady who has not satisfaction in a good novel must be intolerably stupid
1322094 most journalism is people who cant write interviewing people who cant talk for people who cant read
1322095 we are men of action lies do not become us
1322096 no warship or vessel of the enemy will be safe within a 300 kilometer radius of irans borders
1322097 this weapon is completely iranian built and according to our information no other country has used this technology before
1322098 about their military weapons and their military capabilities and saying how unique they are but they are usually just standard military weapons
1322099 i had a look through the different types of antiship missiles which exist in the world and there are not many that have a 300 kilometer range we knew as far back as 2005 that the iranians were buying a russian antiship missile called club and it is in that range category
1322100 so youd think that for a planned purchase being announced in 2005 2008 sounds about right for the hardware being delivered and now being flight tested
1322101 in the councils of government we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence whether sought or unsought by the military industrial complex the potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist we must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes

1322106 the one this thats always burned inside of me deep down is not being able to play state of origin
1322107 we know that a patients mental state affects their physical state but not enough is known about why this happens we believe that when someone is depressed they lose motivation and therefore the will to live
1322108 while patients with advanced cancer are clearly very ill they can still be effectively treated for depression but the first step in the treatment is the recognition that the patient is depressed

1322117 i accept the expert advice that the introduction of a universal high uptake vaccination programme for young girls in conjunction with population based cervical screening could significantly reduce overall cervical cancer rates
1322118 i intend to seek government approval for the programme and for the required funding in the autumn based on the implementation of a plan that can be shown to be cost effective in terms of delivery costs and uptake rates

1322146 die positive entwicklung des im jahr 2002 ins leben gerufenen kleinsatellitenprogramms das auf 20 jahre ausgelegte sofia programm und die steigende zahl der studenten waren wichtige argumente f r den antrag den wir dem wissenschaftsrat im vergangenen jahr vorlegten
1322147 das projekt ist einzigartig innovativ und zukunftsorientiert und passt perfekt in unser forschungsprofil
1322148 das interesse der wirtschaft und der industrie die ber die finanzielle unterst tzung von doktoranden oder die beteiligung an seminaren hinaus in der fakult t verankert sein wollen zeigt uns dass die zeit f r den gemeinsamen vorsto gekommen ist
1322149 in den modernen laboren werden komponenten f r kleinsatelliten entwickelt und im hauseigenen satellitenintegrationslabor zusammengebaut und gesteuert kameras und spektrometer werden im kamerakalibrations und testlabor sowie im detektor und spektrometerlabor unter idealen bedingungen entwickelt
1322150 ich w re als student froh gewesen h tte ich damals die m glichkeit gehabt forschung lehre und die zusammenarbeit mit der industrie an einem ort geb ndelt nutzen zu k nnen
1322151 ab 2010 wird das hier in stuttgart m glich sein
1322152 das kommt der qualit t der lehrveranstaltungen zugute und f rdert die fr he vernetzung der studierenden mit potenziellen arbeitgebern

1322218 for years we have all heard about the issue of work life balance creating balance between your work duties and your personal life
1322219 but what weve uncovered is that the issue of balance does not end when americans come home at the end of the day if anything the struggle for balance inside the home balancing work and play is as acute as the struggle to delineate between work life and personal life
1322220 irobot wants to bring this conversation to the forefront and help people learn more about todays available solutions for better work life balance in the home for example irobots products are designed to make a difference in peoples lives by helping to create better balance in the home a reality irobots automated tools truly help with routine household tasks whether it be vacuuming floor washing or gutter and pool cleaning
1322221 the eod community has been working with this robot for many many years
1322222 now theyve moved up from irobot corporations packbot 500 to a talon or 510 series
1322223 when they get into a level a suit they really only have 45 minutes to go downrange to do what they need to do depending on how they breathe
1322224 the robot will give you four hours downrange to be able to do all of the site characterizations and sampling that needs to happen
1322225 it can go in and mark so you dont even have to send a reconnaissance team in suits
1322226 you can send the cugr in and the cugr does the marking and then the sampling team goes in right after that theres less risk of human life or limb
1322227 irobot does not comment on products that have not been publicly announced

1322257 the current global economic conditions will have an inevitable impact on northern irelands economic performance
1322258 although growth is forecast to decline in 2008 it is expected to remain relatively robust at around 1 8
1322259 a strong labour market and recent success in foreign labour market and export markets should help limit the impact of the slowdown on the economy
1322260 this is clearly a very challenging period for businesses in northern ireland particularly as the impact of the global economic slowdown takes effect
1322261 at a time when firms are already suffering from the fall out of the credit crunch rising oil and energy prices are particularly unwelcome moreover recent reductions in house prices have dampened consumer confidence
1322262 the strength of the labour market where the number of employee jobs stands at an all time high of 722 120 coupled with increased investment in r amp d will help many local firms retain their competitive position

1322280 ive been working my entire adult life to help build an america where economic justice is being served and as president well ensure that economic justice is served thats what this election is about
1322281 from each according to their ability to each according to their need
1322282 if we invest in our families and in ordinary americans by helping them go to college with tax cuts for 95 percent of families to reward them for hard work and give tax cuts to help them save for retirement such are the ways everyone can have a stake in our economy
1322283 we americans cant drive our suvs and eat as much as we want and keep our homes on 72 degrees at all times and then just expect that other countries are going to be ok thats not leadership thats not going to happen
1322284 we dont need a black man to be president so badly that it forces us to take leave of our senses
1322285 will then purchase the remaining interest from bertelsmann for approximately 600 million as a result bertelsmann will receive approximately 900 million in value for its 50 percent stake plus 300 million of its share of cash on sony bmgs balance sheet
1322286 this move is consistent with our new growth strategy and will enable us to focus on our defined growth areas
1322287 sony has been an excellent partner and they are the right company to take this business to the next step and ensure that it realizes its full value and potential

1322291 bray a fool in a mortar with wheat yet shall not his folly be beaten out of him if jesus christ is the greatest man you ought to love him in the greatest degree now hear how he has given his sanction to the law of ten commandments did he not mock at the sabbath and so mock the sabbath s god murder those who were murdered because of him turn away the law from the woman taken with adultery steal the labour of others to support him bear false witness when he omitted making a defense before pilate covet when he prayed for his disciples and when he bid them shake off the dust of their feet against such as refused to lodge them i tell you no virtue can exist without breaking these ten commandments jesus was all virtue and acted from impulse not from rules

1322360 just a few years ago the new male contraceptive seemed like an inevitable reality major pharmaceutical companies like wyeth schering and organon were pumping millions into hormonal birth control development programs for men and researchers were breathlessly promising imminent production
1322361 but in 2008 theres still no birth control for men
1322362 this is what you look like when you have no balls the ability to produce sperm and impregnate a woman with a strong baby is essential for female attraction
1322363 according to kirsten thompson director of the male contraception coalition if phase iii clinical trials were to begin tomorrow on some of those discarded drugs men would probably have their pick of contraceptive gels or implants just like women within five years
1322364 despite 20 years of research the development of a hormonal method acceptable to a wide population of men is unlikely

1322418 what sen mccain neglected to mention was that during those 30 years he was in washington for 26 of them and in all that time he did little to reduce our dependence on foreign oil
1322419 after years of inaction and in the face of public frustration over rising gas prices
1322420 we simply cannot pretend as sen mccain does that we can drill our way out of this problem
1322421 make no mistake the oil companies have placed their bet on sen mccain and if he wins they will continue to cash in while our families and our economy suffer and our future is put in jeopardy

1322467 les guste o no nuestra solidaridad les ha permitido superarnos a los catalanes en calidad de vida y es de mal nacidos no reconocerlo
1322468 el expolio fiscal que sufre catalunya es tan excesivo que permite que ciudadanos de la rioja o extremadura reciban m s euros en inversi n sanitaria que los catalanes

1322477 while others have linked agent orange to cancers such as soft tissue sarcomas hodgkins disease and lymphoma there is limited evidence so far associating it with prostate cancer
1322478 here we report on the largest study to date of vietnam war veterans exposed to agent orange and the incidence of prostate cancer
1322479 our countrys veterans deserve the best possible health care and this study clearly confirms that agent orange exposure during service in vietnam is associated with a higher risk of prostate cancer later in life
1322480 just as those with a family history of prostate cancer or who are of african american heritage are screened more frequently so too should men with agent orange exposure be given priority consideration for all the screening and diagnostic tools we have at our disposal in the hopes of early detection and treatment of this disease
1322481 they had to stay there overnight which is very very dangerous we knew that if there were survivors they would have very bad frostbite it is minus 40 degrees

1322493 dish is such a mess between them and wildblue nobody knows what the hell they are doing
1322494 we hate wild blue sign up and you will too
1322495 i didnt want to do that because wildblue has a faster connection speed than hughes net
1322496 bs because wildblue has no satellites on top of anyones houses mainly mine
1322497 i would suggest that a minority of people had hidden them with the intention of causing harm to police officers and possibly to the horses or dogs we are using on patrol
1322498 to link a stash of knives allegedly found somewhere in the hoo peninsula in kent to the camp for climate action is nothing but a smear campaign against us
1322499 to suggest that the campers environmentalists living at a camp serving only vegan food would even consider hurting a police horse shows the polices press release to be nothing but political policing
1322500 this in no way justifies the way the police are treating the camp
1322501 it is disgraceful to suggest that the campers have criminal intent
1322502 this is obviously an attempt by the police to distract us from raising issues about climate change

1322610 there is no minimal age for entering marriage you can have a marriage contract even with a one year old girl not to mention a girl of nine seven or eight this is merely a contract indicating consent the guardian in such a case must be the father because the fathers opinion is obligatory thus the girl becomes a wife but is the girl ready for sex or not what is the appropriate age for having sex for the first time this varies according to environment and traditions in yemen girls are married off at nine ten 11 eight or 13 while in other countries they are married off at 16 some countries have legislated laws forbidding having sex before the girl is 18 the prophet muhammad is the model we follow he took aisha to be his wife when she was six but he had sex with her only when she was nine

1322618 with interest rates widely expected to be held unchanged the focus will fall on the accompanying statement
1322619 despite the generally better than expected run of us data lately we think the fed will be reluctant to repeat its view from the last statement that the downside risks to growth have diminished for fear of fostering premature expectations of a future interest rate hike
1322620 overall we expect a neutral tone to the statement consistent with the feds keeping rates unchanged over the next few meetings

1322789 accept islam or die you can also live as a slave dhimmi of muslims in the first instance till you get converted
1322790 your religious sadhus are declaring that all religions teach the same thing then why are you taking objection to our getting converted to islam or christianity
1322791 hinduism is wholly free from the strange obsession of some faiths that the acceptance of a particular religious metaphysic is necessary for salvation and non acceptance thereof is heinous sin meriting eternal punishment in hell
1322792 heresy hunting the favorite game of many religions is singularly absent from hinduism
1322793 the intolerance of narrow monotheism is written in letters of blood across the history of man from the time when first the tribes of israel burst into the land of canaan
1322794 wars of religion which are the outcome of fanaticism that prompts and justifies the extermination of aliens of different creeds were practically unknown in hindu india page 40 e
1322795 my angel will go ahead of you and take you into the land of the amorites the hittites the perizzites the cannanites the hivites the jebusites and i will destroy them
1322796 tear down their altars destroy their sacred pillars and cut down the symbols of their goddess asherah
1322797 now kill every boy and kill every woman who has had sexual intercourse but keep alive for yourself all the girls and all the women who are virgins
1322798 do not sin by making for yourself an idol in any form at all whether man or woman animal or bird reptile or fish do not be tempted to worship and serve what you see in the sky the sun the moon and the stars
1322799 when you capture cities in that land that the lord your god is giving you kill every one completely destroy all the people the hittites the amorites the cannanites the perizzites the hivites the jebusites as the lord ordered you to do
1322800 their idolatry made the lord jealous the evil they did made him angry
1322801 with their idols they have made me angry jealous with their so called gods my anger will flame up like fire and burn everything on earth
1322802 in the 8th year that josia was king while he was still very young he began to worship the god of his ancestor king david
1322803 all those who make idols are worthless and the gods they prize so highly are useless
1322804 bring the bull to the front of the tent of my presence and tell aaron and his sons to put their hands on its head
1322805 take one of the rams and tell aaron and his sons to put their hands on its head kill it and take its blood and throw it against all four sides of the altar cut the ram in pieces wash its internal organs and its hind legs and put them on top of the head and other pieces burn the whole ram on the altar as a food offering the odour of this offering pleases me
1322806 but burn the bulls flesh its skin and its intestines outside the camp
1322807 take the breast of this ram and dedicate it to me as a special gift
1322808 every day for all time to come sacrifice on the altar two one year old lambs
1322809 the foreigners living in babylon will run away to their own countries scattering like deer escaping from hunters like sheep without a shepherd
1322810 do you suppose that i came to bring peace to the world
1322811 whoever has a purse or a bag must take it and whoever has no sword must sell his coat and buy one
1322812 go throughout the whole world and preach the gospel to all mankind
1322813 peter you are a rock and on this rock i will build my church and not even death will ever be able to overcome it
1322814 it was then that they made an idol in the shape of a bull offered sacrifice and had a feast in honour of what they themselves had made
1322815 since we are gods children we should not suppose that his nature is anything like an image of gold or silver or stone shaped by the art and the skill of man
1322816 so then about eating the food offered to idols we know that an idol stands for something that does not really exist we know that there is only one god
1322817 what i am saying is that what is sacrificed on pagan altars is offered to demons not to god
1322818 when a jesuit of the minor rank is to be elevated to command he is conducted into the chapel of the convent of the order where there are only three others present the principal or superior standing in front of the altar on either side stands a monk one of whom holds a banner of yellow and white which are the papal colors and the other a black banner with a dagger and red cross above a skull and crossbones with the word inri and below them the words iustum necar reges impious the meaning of which is it is just to exterminate or annihilate impious or heretical kings governments or rulers upon the floor is a red cross at which the postulant or candidate kneels the superior hands him a small black crucifix which he takes in his left hand and presses to his heart and the superior at the same time presents to him a dagger which he grasps by the blade and holds the point against his heart the superior still holding it by the hilt and thus addresses the postulant
1322819 without the shedding of blood no man can be saved
1322820 the first will then present a small piece of paper folded in a peculiar manner four times which the other will cut longitudinally and on opening the name jesu will be found written upon the head and arms of a cross three times you will then give and receive with him the following questions and answers question from whither do you come answer the holy faith q whom do you serve a the holy father at rome the pope and the roman catholic church universal throughout the world q who commands you a the successor of st ignatius loyola the founder of the society of jesus or the soldiers of jesus christ q who received you a venerable man in white hair q how a with a naked dagger i kneeling upon the cross beneath the banners of the pope and of our sacred order q did you take an oath a i did to destroy heretics and their governments and rulers and to spare neither age sex nor condition to be as a corpse without any opinion or will of my own but to implicitly obey my superiors in all things without hesitation of murmuring q will you do that a i will q how do you travel a in the bark of peter the fisherman q whither do you travel a to the four quarters of the globe q for what purpose a to obey the orders of my general and superiors and execute the will of the pope and faithfully fulfill the conditions of my oaths q go ye then into all the world and take possession of all lands in the name of the pope he who will not accept him as the vicar of jesus and his vice regent on earth let him be accursed and exterminated
1322821 o believers take not for your intimates outside yourselves such men spare nothing to ruin you they yearn for you to suffer hatred has already shown itself on their mouths and what their breasts conceal is yet greater now we have made clear to you the signs if you understand
1322822 we will cast terror into the hearts of the unbelievers their lodging shall be the fire
1322823 surely those who disbelieve in our signs we shall certainly roast them at a fire as often as their skins are wholly burned we shall give them in exchange other skins that they may taste the chastisement surely god is all mighty all wise
1322824 the believers fight in the way of god and the unbelievers fight in the idols way fight you therefore against the friends of satan surely the guile of satan is feeble
1322825 this is the reward of those who fight against god and his messenger and hasten about the earth to do corruption there they shall be slaughtered or crucified or they shall be banished from the land that is the degradation for them in this world and in the world to come awaits them a mighty chastisement
1322826 o believers take not the jews and christians as friends they are friends of each other who so of you makes them his friends is one of them
1322827 say shall i tell you of a recompense with god worse than that whomsoever god has cursed and with whom he is wroth and made some of them apes and swine and worshipers of idols they are worse situated and have gone further astray from the right way
1322828 we have sent no prophet to any city but that we seized its people with misery and hardship that haply they might be humble then we gave them in the place of evil good till they multiplied and said
1322829 when thy lord was revealing to the angels i am with you so confirm the believers i shall cast into the unbelievers hearts terror so smite above the necks and smite every finger of them
1322830 surely the worst of beasts in gods sight are the unbelievers who will not believe
1322831 o prophet urge on the believers to fight if there be twenty of you patient men they will overcome two hundred if there be a hundred of you they will overcome a thousand unbelievers for they are a people who understand not
1322832 it is not for any prophet to have prisoners until he make wide slaughter in the land
1322833 it is not for idolaters to inhabit gods places of worship
1322834 o believers the idolaters are indeed unclean so let them not come near the holy mosque after this year
1322835 and the evil doers were seized by the cry and morning found them in their habitations fallen prostrate as if they had never dwelt there
1322836 and when we desire to destroy a city we command its men who live at ease and they commit ungodliness therein then the word is realized against it and we destroy it utterly how many generations we have destroyed after noah
1322837 now we have sent down to you a book wherein is your remembrance will you not understand how many a city that was evil doing we have shattered and set up after it another people then when they perceived our might behold they ran headlong out of it run not return you unto the luxury that you exulted in and your dwelling places haply you shall be questioned they said alas for us we have been evil doers
1322838 and by god i shall assuredly outwit your idols after you have gone away turning backs
1322839 except for gods sincere servants for them awaits a known provision fruits and they high honoured in the gardens of bliss upon coaches set face to face a cup from a spring being passed round to them white a delight to the drinkers wherein no sickness is neither intoxication and with them wide eyed maidens restraining their glances as if they were hidden pearls they advance one upon another asking each other questions
1322840 surely the god fearing shall be in gardens and bliss rejoicing in that their lord has given them and their lord shall guard them against the chastisement of hell eat and drink wholesome apetite for that you were working reclining upon coaches ranged in rows and we shall espouse them to wide eyed houris damsels and those who believed and their seed followed them in belief we shall join their seed with them and we shall not defraud them of aught of their work every man shall be pledged for what he earned and we shall succour them with fruit and flesh such as they desire while they pass therein a cup one to another wherein is no idle talk no cause of sin and there go round them youths their own as if they were hidden pearls they advance one upon another asking each other questions
1322841 the war of preparation being waged by us during peace is vastly more important than the active war
1322842 terror struck into the hearts of the enemies is not only a means it is an end in itself once a condition of terror into the opponents heart is obtained hardly anything is left to be achieved it is the point where the means and the end merge terror is not a means of imposing decision upon the enemy it is the decision we wish to impose upon him
1322843 terror can be instilled only if the opponents faith is destroyed
1322844 whatever the form or type of strategy directed against the enemy it must in order to be effective be capable of striking terror into the hearts of the enemy a strategy that fails to achieve this condition must be reviewed and modified
1322845 accept islam or die you can also live as a slave dhimmi of muslims in the first instance till you get converted
1322846 your religious sadhus are declaring that all religions teach the same thing then why are you taking objection to our getting converted to islam or christianity

1323141 its a story about a teacher but its also a story about how certain children on a certain island are getting through schools seemingly magically but maybe not so
1323142 i never went into teaching thinking that i was going to write a book about this but slowly i started into the world of tutoring and i found it funny in a grotesque kind of way
1323143 sure they were fun books and if i were to talk to andrew trees id say great book but anything boys can do girls can do better
1323144 but on a serious note he wrote a book about a teacher while he was still at horace mann i am no longer a teacher at dalton so no one can fire me
1323145 as a tutor youre going in and out of apartments that look like the met and one day im sure will be turned into museums
1323146 but as a teacher youre coming home to your fifth floor walk up on first or second avenue and sure there are some girls who have walk in closets that when you walk in its like the angels sing and the chandeliers sparkle have you seen sex and the city that closet twelve year olds
1323147 im not going to do that vapid thing like im not a socialite but id just say read my next book
1323148 i knew nothing about that world when i was teaching but after i finished the book i had some time on my hands and some research i wanted to do so i started going out i wont lie there is another story bursting to come out of me does that explain it wink wink
1323149 it will ruffle some feathers no doubt but i think people will get what im saying
1323150 you cant help if someone calls you a hypocrite i was doing this whole thing like im going to kill myself if theyre mean to me i am a cancer so im prone to having these everyone hates me cry fests but then i was watching

1323186 based on extensive studies of users experience with word processors carroll and rosson 1988 identified two significant paradoxes the motivational paradox arises from the production bias that is users lack the time to learn new applications due to the overwhelming concern for throughput their work is hampered by this lack of learning and consequently productivity suffers the cognitive paradox has its root in the assimilation bias people tend to apply what they already know in coping with new situations and can be bound by the irrelevant and misleading similarities between the old and new situations this can prevent people from learning and applying new and more effective solutions
1323187 i received two leaflets last friday one telling me that from august 11 i should put my bin out on a monday and another telling me to put my rubbish out on a thursday from august 14
1323188 so i phoned up the council and the woman told me she didnt know which was the right day
1323189 the council just doesnt seem to be able to organise this and what a waste of money its been sending out all these leaflets
1323190 we have been distributing leaflets to 35 000 households informing them of any changes to their refuse collection days unfortunately there have been one or two minor glitches with the distribution process affecting a small number of households

1323192 a laser doppler scanner would allow very accurate and speedy assessment of the depth of thermal injury
1323193 this will allow us to treat individual burns with a far greater degree of precision and allow us to determine the best treatment very early after injury we are very keen to add this equipment to our department it will allow us to predict much more accurately the likelihood that a burn wound will or will not heal inevitably this will avoid surgery in some patients speed up surgery in others and minimise unnecessary scarring and its consequences in all partial thickness burn patients in doing so it will also save money otherwise spent on avoidable operations and scar management
1323194 we feel our objections have been ignored these shops attract drunken disorderly behaviour violence and litter maybe it wasnt viable as a newsagent but there are too many of these food outlets already we have already lost a large number of shops in the old town
1323195 local residents are already fed up with all the noise in the area and this could only make it worse these late night food outlets can be even worse than pubs as they are more difficult to police
1323196 i have spoken to all the neighbours and they also expressed concern as the cowgate is busy enough in the early hours with pub and club revellers without the need for a fast food outlet adding to the general chaos
1323197 my bedroom is directly above the shop and i feel that the smell from cooking will be unbearable
1323198 the proposal will not lead to an unacceptable increase in noise on street activity or antisocial behaviour

1323202 it is perfectly true that our economy along with every other economy in the world is going to slow down and that slowdown is pretty dramatic in many places
1323203 in relation to the housing market there is no doubt that a combination of peoples general mood and outlook and the fact that mortgage finance has been constrained is pushing prices down
1323204 i dont need to because the bank of england has an obligation to target inflation but also to act in support of the governments general policies
1323205 so its remit is perfectly adequate to allow it to take everything it needs to into account
1323206 at a time when things are difficult where inflation is a problem that is looming one that i think can be dealt with i dont think this is the time to start changing the remit for the bank of england
1323207 i have said before i believe we can get through this i believe we can win the next election provided we discover the same zeal and enthusiasm that we had in 1997 2001 and 2005

1323211 we will get the children to take the money round which will be nice for them and will give them a chance to meet the people they are helping and hear their stories

1323215 i think this is a wonderful gesture the youngest generation helping out the oldest generation im so impressed by the nursery i cannot promise anything at this stage it is something i will have to run past board members
1323216 ambulance demand increases at between three and six per cent a year on average
1323217 last year was in line with that although there was a bigger increase the year before
1323218 its likely to continue going up although its difficult to say why nothing leaps out of the statistics as a particularly strong factor
1323219 we just have to keep on increasing staff levels and improving the way we respond to calls thats why we categorise calls as emergency urgent or routine to make sure those who need help most get it quickest
1323220 i think it is a throwback to when people were not sure about nhs24 it works well but some people still do not want to phone it
1323221 theres no reason for there to be an increase maybe at weekends it is also due to escalating levels of binge drinking
1323222 i just wonder how much of this rise is abuse either from binge drinking or not calling nhs24
1323223 this needs to be investigated but a 50 per cent rise is horrendous
1323224 following advice from the security services last year the spcb reported to parliament that it would be taking steps to improve its perimeter security it would be counterproductive at this stage to discuss the detail of the installation of additional security measures
1323225 they talk about tailgating but who exactly is it that they dont want in to the parliament
1323226 i think if they conducted a poll on the street they wouldnt find one person who wanted to get in there
1323227 it will be interesting to see what the cost of this will be
1323228 i dont know why they feel this is needed but i suppose the corporate body have to have something to do and if nothing else they are often a source of innocent if expensive amusement
1323229 as always with unusual incidents at plays no one is quite sure if its part of the show or not although it advertisement became clear pretty quickly afterwards that it wasnt the adults with her were very concerned as you would expect and the hall emptied
1323230 i wouldnt like to put a figure on the amount of money were spending because our requirements are changing almost daily
1323231 any costs that are incurred will be going to the fringe
1323232 too many people in scotland still dont have access to an nhs dentist and we are determined to reverse the years of neglect and bring nhs dentistry within reach of those who currently dont have access
1323233 i look forward to seeing the detailed proposals that come forward from health boards as we take the firm action needed to give scotland a dental service to be proud of
1323234 justice department officials expressed the view that it would be inappropriate to have separate firearms laws in scotland or indeed among individual local authority bylaws within scotland
1323235 considering the fact that firearms legislation is a matter reserved to westminster and that recent legislation from the parliament has recently been enacted it is most unlikely that a city of edinburgh promoted bylaw seeking to ban the sale and use of airguns in the city would have any prospect of being confirmed
1323236 even if such a bylaw were to be enacted lothian and borders police are clearly sceptical about the enforcement of a bylaw within the city particularly when no such similar bylaw exists in neighbouring authorities covered by the police force
1323237 a local ban would go someway towards helping but it would be easier to tackle this nationally
1323238 the justice secretary has made clear that he believes it is time for the comprehensive review of our firearms controls and laws we will continue to press the uk government to either act or devolve the powers to let the scottish government act

1323241 we were billeted to north berwick to a big house called quarry court it was a huge house fitted out with dormitories
1323242 we used to go to all the farms around north berwick and i used to do general farm work like lifting spuds planting them sowing turnips you name it we did it everybody got on fine we used to get up at 4 30 in the morning it never used to bother me we all just got on with it
1323243 if we got a late pass to go into the dance at north berwick we had to be back by 11pm that was a late pass we used to get some good laughs
1323244 i hereby absolutely and entirely renounce my united states nationality together with all rights and privileges and all duties of allegiance and fidelity

1323246 they deserve to grow up in a private loving and nurturing environment not in the circus they currently live with kate as the cantankerous ring master and jon as her monkey boy doing tricks

1323248 happiness is an attitude we either make ourselves miserable or happy and strong the amount of work is the same
1323249 we basically collect the blood into a small version of the human blood donation bag with dogs and with humans the blood gets broken down into components such as plasma and red blood cells that get separated so they can be stored but its hard to do that with cats because the bags are much smaller
1323250 its used for cats that are anaemic and occasionally we see cats who have had rat poison or have coagulating difficulties like haemophilia and cats that arent producing enough blood cells
1323251 hes no problem at all hes quite relaxed they give us a call and say we need dennis and within half an hour were there

1323257 it almost seems normal but seems sort of weird as well
1323258 when i used to dream about going to the olympics it wasnt very specific but you just assume youre going to race for britain
1323259 it got to the point where i wasnt english to the english and not french to the french
1323260 make it official it was good for my club and good for my career
1323261 the first time i was up on the podium listening to the marseillaise it actually did bring a tear to my eye
1323262 refreshing that there arent any negative overtones whatever your politics theyre really quite into being french and loving the anthem
1323263 a lot of people say i should train as if this is a once in a lifetime event but i dont want to burn out when i get there im following the same routine just more of it
1323264 i can see my abs for once thats quite cool im going to take a photo to show my grandchildren
1323265 it could be positive for some people and negative for others you just dont know until you get there
1323266 im a bit of a show off so ill quite like people cheering me on and sending me messages
1323267 but you have to remember its a race just a race
1323268 i owe a last couple of grands prix races to my club and theres the triathlon world cup in france in september too i want to really make the most of the physical form that i should have after the games
1323269 when this is over and done with that is my next thing
1323270 it would really be awesome to do the games at home in front of family and friends
1323271 its definitely doable if i can stay relatively injury free and not burn out and keep my motivation going its doable
1323272 you remember your roots youre never going to lose that ill always be english to a certain extent
1323273 you dont get that every day its the best of both worlds for sure family and friends from both britain and france
1323274 they have welcomed me with open arms i want to be the best i can for them to me this is paying back my debt
1323275 there are a lot of people who want a degree of service which state provision just cannot achieve and we have set out to do just that i get a tremendous buzz from providing a good service to people in their own homes
1323276 we provide care for not only older people but also adults with physical disabilities and i am determined that every single one of them will receive the same high standard of service which i would provide to a relative or to a friend

1323278 this revised business case estimates potential net savings of 11 5 million over three years as the council starts to spend less on certain areas by standardising our purchasing processes and managing contracts more effectively
1323279 it also estimates that we would be able to provide our services with about 293 fewer posts over the same period although any such staff savings would only come through natural attrition

1323288 there may be some potential to pursue the avenue of commercial sponsorship to subsidise the service 20 though it should be recognised that past attempts to do this have not proved successful and the current retail climate is not likely to be conducive
1323289 one possible option if sufficient council funds can be found is to continue to support the service 20 while the possibility of commercial sponsorship is investigated
1323290 a cold case review is triggered if there is no suspect within a month or if there is an appeal

1323296 to save danish and norwegian prisoners from the german camps
1323297 to attempt to obtain permission in germany for the transport to sweden or denmark of the interned norwegian and danish prisoners
1323298 the swedish states expedition the personnel was almost entirely volunteers from the armed forces the equipment was supplied from the armed forces stockpiles and the expenses were covered by the states coffers
1323299 in general they were in relative good shape compared to other prisoners i have seen and one could not complain regarding their personal hygiene they related that the food packs they had received from norway and denmark had kept their spirits up and recently the treatment had been noticeably better they were all touching sic thankful and happy i believe that all of us that have had the option of helping these poor people in germany have experienced such an overwhelming gratitude that it is enough for the rest of our lives
1323300 i have never in my twelve years practice as a nurse seen so much misery as i here witnessed legs backs and necks full of wounds of a type that an average swede would be on sick leave for just one of them i counted twenty on one prisoner and he did not complain

1323303 on our way to sch mberg the activity in the air was very high and we were overflown many times by allied fighter planes that did not attack us along the autobahn there were a lot of damaged cars and severely injured people on some places where chaos reigned we simply could not just drive past with our white bus with red cross markings but had to stop and give first aid in some cases the damage were enormous
1323304 on behalf of the swedish government folke bernadotte and the crew on the white buses performed the largest swedish humanitarian action during the second world war
1323305 the ill and hungry prisoners poles frenchmen belgians had seemed totally apathetic and been so meager that there were fifty of them in each bus that normally took ten persons

1323320 the duality of technology means that technology is the product of human action and assumes structural properties it is physically constructed in a given context and socially constructed through different meanings
1323321 the interpretative flexibility of technology suggests that technology is continuously constructed in social and physical ways that there is a time space discontinuity development is separated from use in both context and time in traditional models and that individual and social factors influence users working with and shaping technology

1323344 a coincidence that the world top news item on the prosecutors application for an arrest warrant against the sudanese president appeared only a few days after the iloat judgment
1323345 would submit evidence of crimes committed against civilians in sudans western region of darfur over the last five years though he will wait until monday at the pretrial chamber to name names
1323346 on monday 14 july prosecutor luis moreno ocampo will submit to the judges of pre trial chamber i his evidence on crimes committed in the whole of darfur over the last five years
1323347 if moreno ocampo intended to pursue the goal of having al bashir arrested he might have issued a sealed request and asked the iccs judges to issue a sealed arrest warrant to be made public only once al bashir traveled abroad the courts jurisdiction over the crimes in darfur has been established pursuant to a binding decision of the united nations security council which means that even states that are not parties to the icc statute must execute the courts orders and warrants having instead made the request for a warrant public bashir assuming the judges uphold the request can simply refrain from traveling abroad and thus avoid arrest
1323348 my first spontaneous reaction was here we have the explanation for the strange timing of the prosecutors indictment if the evidence is not accepted his credibility will sink as a stone
1323349 preferred a public application rather than a sealed warrant which would have a far better chance of actually allowing bashir to be apprehended and brought to court
1323350 the prosecutor has made it easy for his critics to dismiss him as ill informed and driven by a desire for publicity and has made it harder for the advocates of justice in darfur to pursue the challenge of calling to account those responsible for crimes no less heinous than genocide
1323351 asked why moreno ocampo preferred a public application rather than a sealed warrant which would have a far better chance of actually allowing bashir to be apprehended and brought to court moreno ocampo said that the victims have the right to the truth this i thought was a weak reply
1323352 alex a brief comment on your observation that the prosecutors public application for an arrest warrant against president bashir is still not public more than two weeks after his 14 july press conference announcing it initial requests for the full application elicited the response that the names of confidential sources were being removed and the document would be made public without them in a matter of days on 22 july in theory as the delay has drawn out however icc officials have admitted privately that the application submitted to the icc judges a few minutes before moreno ocampo met the press was a mess packed with errors spelling punctuation and the like that would have to be painstakingly corrected before it could be made public some have suggested that there is a link between the timing of the public application and the ruling by the administrative tribunal of the international labour organisation in geneva www ilo org public english tribunal fulltext 2757 htm just 5 days earlier coverage of the ilo ruling in the mainstream media which has been focused on the indictment of bashir has certainly been minimal

1323381 weiters ist es mir r tselhaft wie man von ausruhen sprechen kann wenn in wien jedes jahr ber 350 millionen euro in die kinderbetreuung investiert werden und hier die meisten kinderbetreuungspl tze in ganz sterreich zur verf gung stehen
1323382 im vp regierten nieder sterreich k nnen nur 2 prozent der drei bis f nfj hrigen so betreut werden dass den eltern vollzeitarbeit m glich ist in wien sind es 64 prozent diese zahl veranschaulicht sehr gut dass es der vp in wahrheit nicht um qualitative flexible kindergartenpl tze geht sondern um reine polemik daran werden wir uns nicht beteiligen denn uns geht es um das wohl der kinder und der eltern

1323385 hier leisten die wirtschaftskammern und deren gr nder services seit beginn der legalisierungsaktion hervorragende arbeit wir haben auch mit dem praxisgerechten leitfaden der alle wesentlichen aspekte der personenbetreuung einfach und verst ndlich darstellt pionierarbeit geleistet

1323391 zahlreiche beispiele bezeugen dass eine 100 prozentige privatisierung gut f r die mitarbeiter ist f r das unternehmen und f r den standort mit der privatisierung der voest oder von b hler uddeholm wurden die ums tze dieser unternehmen gesteigert die anzahl der mitarbeiter aufgestockt und letztlich der sterreichische standort gest rkt

1323400 dies ist offenbar nur gemacht worden um w hrend des wahlkampfes zu suggerieren dass es irgendetwas wie eine rot wei rote l sung sei

1323414 iets geloven betekent niet gelijk dat je een religie aanhangt ik geloof ook dat het morgen koud is is dat dan ook een vorm van religie
1323415 aangezien ik niet geloof in enige zin in het bestaan is deze blog ook zonder zin nihilisme heeft impliciet geen zin en enig ander geloof ook niet
1323416 de voorspellingen voor de verre toekomst zijn gewoon wetenschappelijk aanvaarde inzichten die bewezen kunnen worden niets geloof gewoon wetenschap
1323417 dat er wellicht meer is dan we nu weten betekent nog steeds niet dat het bestaan zinvol is het zou hooguit betekenen dat er nog meer zonder zin is
1323418 of ik gelijk heb of niet doet er niet toe het zal wezenlijk niets aan de situatie veranderen ik laat echter anderen vrolijk geloven wat ze willen als ze maar niet proberen mijn levenswijze daarmee te willen aanpassen

1323435 since dermot has taken over management of our building there have been a series of transgressions on their part
1323436 with all the capital improvements that they have done to our building
1323437 members of the tenants association which began to organize after dermots acquisition of the building believe that the new owners intent is to rid the building of its rent stabilized apartments
1323438 dermot has failed to communicate to us their desire to make certain that we remain as residents in this ever changing neighborhood
1323439 our area has become the manhattan of brooklyn and the location of our building is seen as ground zero
1323440 the building may not be able to pass a required inspection
1323441 well of course its none of our business but we

1323454 i think my form is improving all the time even if i was perhaps stronger four years ago when i won in athens
1323455 its always hard to beat riders like valverde but hopefully hes feeling tired after the tour de france and his form will be fading
1323456 we lost damiano because of his crash but weve still got a strong team with davide rebellin marzio bruseghin vincenzo nibali and franco pellizotti
1323457 its going to be italy against spain but there are also a lot of other strong riders people like frank and andy schleck and kim kirchen of luxembourg
1323458 the olympic road race is a lot like an amateur race nobody has the numbers to control the race and anything can happen its important to really be in the thick of the action and be in the really important attacks
1323459 ive heard a lot about the course and heard the main climb goes up in ramps that should make for some nervous racing with lots of attacks which is exactly the way i like it

1323472 if hed have come id have been thrilled but he hasnt so be it he wanted to stay but it was only a short term deal and it was up to him what he wanted to do
1323473 the olympics is an opportunity to be on the world stage its a huge event and everyone wants to be part of it
1323474 i can understand why the clubs want to do everything to keep their players for the players i just think its a great tournament to be part of
1323475 its great news that brad guzan can now join the club
1323476 i signed a letter of support for him last time when the work permit got turned down i did it this time as well
1323477 its good news for him hes at the olympics right now and well be meeting up with him in a month or so
1323478 this is not a difficult place to come and settle in i dont know too much about him ive spoken to him for a couple of times and ill be interested to find out all about him as well
1323479 we had three really good goalkeepers at wolves i think any club would be pleased to have them on their books
1323480 they are good lads and all three of them have come through the club none of them were bought in it was all in house so to speak and thats something the club should be proud of
1323481 ive got many good memories at wolves when you have been at a club for so long its obviously wrench to be going equally the opportunity to go back to blackburn was so strong
1323482 the premier league is the big thing for me ive been at wolves for almost eight years and there weve flirted with the premier league for just one year
1323483 on top of that with it being a club i played for one i really enjoyed my time with the opportunity was just too good to resist
1323484 there are a lot of things that can work in goalkeeping and cant work bobs work worked for both matt and myself
1323485 i started with bob and we got into a routine coming into games on a saturday we have a routine before we play bob wont be doing it any more so well have to get someone in that can do it
1323486 he has worked so hard with us he comes to every reserve and first team game he was on the phone to me all through the summer
1323487 he stays out there on the training field for hours with us hes worked with me on my kicking i hate kicking its the worst part of my game so i practice it all the time
1323488 trust me theres a lot of running to do to fetch the balls when im kicking them but bobby does it
1323489 it will be fantastic to see jay here again and it will be great if there are two or three first team players as well
1323490 jay has played against us once already and our defenders are still chasing him hes quick and it will be a big test for us
1323491 hes had a few chances and hopefully dave jones will get the best out of him because he has that much talent as we saw at wolves
1323492 jay certainly contributed to the team when he was here and scored some important goals
1323493 he was made available for transfer because he was no longer part of our plans but we wish him well for the future
1323494 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
1323495 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
1323496 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
1323497 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
1323498 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
1323499 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
1323500 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
1323501 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
1323502 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
1323503 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
1323504 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
1323505 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
1323506 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

1323519 the search continues there is a lot of work going on behind the scenes
1323520 some targets get pretty close and then disappear we continue to get closer to the finish line with other targets
1323521 yes i would like a few more bodies in but they have to be of the right quality if you cant get the right quality you just have to keep going
1323522 i would hope there will be a few more coming in before the season starts sometimes the expectations from players advisors are way beyond where we can go and thats fine by me
1323523 weve got a wage structure and the players all understand that its a philosophy i try to have and it wont be broken
1323524 hopefully we will find the right quality in people who want to come and play for our club they will be a part of something that hopefully is going to be successful
1323525 we will keep pushing on with the efforts and hopefully we will bring that quality in
1323526 the season is pretty close to us but at this moment i am just giving then both an opportunity to stake their claim i thought they both did very well again on saturday

1323533 today choose and book has had more than 10 million bookings and the ucl study of 104 patients from a single hospital two years ago does not reflect the experience of most users
1323534 this may be only one hospital with results taken in a transitional period but we believe this could be typical of the national picture
1323535 it is striking that nobody up until to this point has actually asked patients about their experience of the system these results show the reality of whats happening on the ground surely vital when it comes to measuring to what extent this is working or not this study also raises many wider questions such as what patients understand by choice and indeed whether they actually want choice
1323536 any patient receiving routine elective treatment is now able to choose from any nhs approved hospital provider in england
1323537 recent major surveys on patient choice and primary care consistently show the number of patients using choose and book and being offered a service continues to steadily increase choose and book is used for around 50 of all gp referrals to first outpatient appointment 98 of gp practices have choose and book and currently 92 are using it for referrals

1323541 report on instances where the abuse of the right of freedom of expression constitutes an act of racial or religious discrimination
1323542 but this is not a practical solution and it destabilizes the human rights agenda the defamation of religions protects ideas rather than individuals and makes the state the arbiter of which ideas are true it requires the state to sort good and bad ideologies

1323549 from an investors point of view there is going to be an investor strike they will not buy anything where the risk is not transparent
1323550 that transparency applies to a lot of the instruments that were sold over the last two years
1323551 those standards are fairly tough to meet but in many respects the beijing area does so
1323552 im sure im confident the air quality will not prove to pose major problems to the athletes and to the visitors in beijing
1323553 we will evaluate those and should problems arise we may have to take some action
1323554 exaggeration of the problem that has been seen in the media
1323555 to come to a city even though the air quality might be inferior the long term effects should no longer be feared by temporary visitors
1323556 the mist in the air that we see in those places including here is not a feature of pollution primarily but a feature of evaporation and humidity
1323557 we do have a communication problem here once the misconception has become sort of established in the minds of people its not that easy to get the right message through
1323558 if youre raising prices to recover commodity and energy costs and youre raising prices by the exact amount of your cost increases then your gross margin and operating margins will decline
1323559 its just a function of the math because we really dont feel in this environment we could raise prices by more than the amount of our commodity and energy increases
1323560 its just a tough environment and they are in the next fiscal year going to feel the brunt in the recent run up in oil and commodity cost

1323594 if a baltimore city health officer wants to know how were doing for birth defects and birth outcomes its hard to get an answer
1323595 the same goes for many things that are very important such as alzheimers autism and multiple sclerosis
1323596 asthma and heart disease are things we are just beginning to get a handle on
1323597 the original purpose of the cancer data was to track cancer incidence and look for reasons why cancer rates might be higher or lower in different parts of the country
1323598 now theyre used more broadly many researchers are using the data to look at variations in cancer treatment in different population groups for example and to understand the reasons for those differences
1323599 the system really has enabled us to learn quite a bit about the causes and trends of cancer

1323618 the type of player i hope to be ive always hoped to be the third hitter one day
1323619 that shows hes staying on the ball better hes not pulling off
1323620 you have to wait on em when youre facing lefties because they always have that breaking ball equalizer
1323621 based on demonstrated achievement accomplishments and an increasing preference for the use of digital media channels to discover information build knowledge and share insights
1323622 american apparel is a cutting edge brand and its online advertising strategy clearly reflects that
1323623 using social media as the primary vehicle to drive its provocative ad campaigns has helped it build a strong presence among its core audience of young adults
1323624 apparel is one of the largest us e commerce categories accounting for roughly 15 of total online retail sales
1323625 however some of the biggest retailers in the category are significantly underrepresented in the online display ad market
1323626 theres no question that rising gas prices are having a significant impact on the lives of consumers across the country
1323627 our survey shows the extent of the hardships consumers are experiencing as well as the concessions theyre making to off set these costs
1323628 i agree that in trying to bring peace to the continent and sub region we aught to first of all re examine our internal security democracy and the rule of law especially since the essence of democracy is to have respect for other voices
1323629 with regards to the niger delta for instance a number of people are arguing why we carry out peace support operations abroad without getting it right at home we should therefore emphasise more on our domestic problems to send the massage to the international community that we mean well
1323630 if peace must be achieved in the country you have to look at the root causes of war and crises and address them
1323631 challenges of conflict resolution and role of nigeria in regional peace and security
1323632 the strength of nigeria lies in the people and not in oil or other economic resources alone and channel its might to developing and empowering its people it would be difficult for the nation to attain its true status in the world
1323633 a nigeria that is making tremendous contribution to international peace and security can be better appreciated and given its pride of place
1323634 since the multitude of parties involved in conflicts their divergent interests and various patrons has made negotiating a peace agreement more complicated and complex three main lessons should guide the international community engagement with regards to these crises and how to prevent them
1323635 these are that security is a collective responsibility and requires collective action peace and stability demands global solidarity and that there cannot be peace security and development without respect for human rights democracy and the rule of law
1323636 there is no way nigeria can grow into a world power except as a big brother working to help better the lot of less endowed neighbours within the sub region and the african continent
1323637 despite progress made in resolving many conflicts in the world it is regrettable that the most looming and devastating conflicts with regional dimensions are taking place primarily in our continent central africa and the greater horn of africa have particularly been two regions of chronic instability resulting in several interconnected conflicts that transcend borders or specific territories thus making them truly regional
1323638 it is further regrettable that these conflicts have claimed millions of lives left millions displaced and deterred any possible economic growth and prosperity in a continent that is behind others in socio economic development
1323639 i agree that in trying to bring peace to the continent and sub region we ought to first of all re examine our internal security democracy and the rule of law especially since the essence of democracy is to have respect for other voices
1323640 with regards to the niger delta for instance a number of people are arguing why we carry out peace support operations abroad without getting it right at home we should therefore emphasise more on our domestic problems to send the massage to the international community that we mean well

1323671 i was told that the council would install one within seven weeks
1323672 then i got a letter saying i would have to be assessed again and because of a lack of occupational therapists i would have to wait indefinitely
1323673 i have been to see my doctor who says it is affecting my health because i need a proper shower because i have ezcema and it has started to crack and weep
1323674 this is a complicated and difficult case and i very much sympathise with mr hannahs concerns
1323675 my apologies go to mr hannah i hope he understands our situation and is patient while the team arranges a suitable assessment time
1323676 however the occupationally therapy service is a highly popular service improving the independence of some of our most disabled residents which struggles at times to meet that demand
1323677 all cases are prioritised depending on urgency and home assessments are arranged in accordance with that urgency

1323693 quentin represents a far more interesting option as he is a young rh of out of stanford remember the tribes predilection to stanford guys garko guthrie gerut who has battled injury right hamstring then rotator cuff since coming into mlb after cruising through the system his ops by year level and age is pretty impressive 2007 aaa age 24 1 004 2006 aaa age 23 906 2005 aaa age 22 942 2004 aa age 21 976 2004 a age 21 990 this to me looks like a player simply blocked organizationally while producing at every level hes been at up to mlb while his hr totals have never been eye popping he has always had a consistently high obp something the tribe deep thinkers love and has high 2b totals which could translate to hr as he adjusts to mlb pitching quentin did just undergo rotator cuff surgery non throwing arm which will keep him out of action until april so his health concerns would be comparable to choo but if the indians are happy to do the same thing that they did in the bullpen last year let the veterans keep a place warm for the youngsters to assert themselves and they feel that quentin will bounce back from the rotator cuff not a certainty they could find themselves a rh bat to handle lf and possibly buy low on him because of the injury concerns

1323727 o guia final que vamos ter este ano para pensar neles no contexto
1323728 we started to work on ipoki when the firsts gps enabled mobile phones were put on the market we notice that there were some services on the market about geolocation without its democratic internet version open and free first we started creating some location based services like put and get alerts fro users around specific places but then we realize that we need to add social features to our services if we want to make it really massive opened and easy for every possible internet user so we decided to create a social network based on location sharing people share photos videos and a lot of things over the internet and we think that it would be very interesting to share your location in real time with accuracy like some pay services plus social features finally we have added new services to our social network like integrations with twitter flickr or facebook
1323729 i think we work with very cutting edge technology in an early stage today every cell phone has a camera in the future they also will have a gps build in and low cost internet access location based services and social networks could be the next generation of social services in internet we think we are going to be on one of those little links that compose the chain that will join the physical with the virtual in the next web
1323730 we have launched a new integration with qik com to share your location in realtime and send livevideo with your mobile devices all at the same time
1323731 ive tried to do everything i can in order to be a valuable asset for the company and army the first few months into our deployment i emphasized to soldiers that the easiest way to be productive is to improve your foxhole
1323732 so we spent a lot of effort renovating our office and doing carpentry work for the company but then we realized how much more of a benefit we could be if our work was more related to our specific skill set nothing says we cant fix printers
1323733 people enjoy doing what they are trained to do we may not be tearing apart army radios but were still burying our noses in wiring diagrams with the amount of office equipment weve fixed so far im confident our efforts are making a difference

1323796 i went to a customer to sell virtual hosting services

1323800 i went back to that customer a week later with a more skilled technical consultant

1323803 the new exploitability index helps with that problem were going to give predictions on how exploitable each issue is
1323804 its another piece of information another piece to the puzzle
1323805 i think its usefulness will depend on the implementation and how accurate the predictions are but it should help emphasize the need to look at exploitability as one of the factors in deciding what to patch

1323807 we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness

1323817 its just a tough environment and they are in the next fiscal year going to feel the brunt in the recent run up in oil and commodity cost
1323818 the sensation of flavor is actually a combination of taste and smell
1323819 if you hold your nose and start chewing a jelly bean taste is limited but open your nose midway through chewing and then you suddenly recognize apple or watermelon
1323820 so an odor similar to that of your grandmothers pantry might be more quickly associated with your memories of that place than a similar sight which might be more generalized
1323821 theyve done studies measuring the sense of smell in people who have no signs or symptoms of parkinsons then taken the top 10 percent and the bottom 10 percent and followed them for years
1323822 all the people who were ultimately diagnosed with parkinsons later in life came from the group who had smell problems when they were younger
1323823 glp 1 isnt the only hormone acting on the taste system leptin from fat is there as well and glp 1 and leptin seem to act in opposition to each other one is an up regulator and one is a down regulator and the result is some fine control on metabolism thats related to taste
1323824 people who are tasters find other bitter compounds to be more intensely bitter than people who are non tasters they find sweet things to be more sweet hot things to be more hot and they also perceive the fattiness of certain fats as being more intense
1323825 non tasters taste all these things but with less intensity
1323826 non tasters we have evidence that they consume more added fats salad dressings spreads and margarines weve even seen in some studies that non tasters also consume more calories

1323892 how are you going to set up the distribution sites making sure you even have something to hand out finding out when the attack actually occurred so you can start that process having your political leaders have enough confidence in the decision to go ahead and order a massively disruptive response like that

1323944 look at it this way the best team is not always going to win the national title in college baseball
1323945 im not sure a lot of things are going to go our way in the near future but there have been other years where we were decimated by the draft and actually ended up in omaha
1323946 last year we pretty much had four good players coming back but look at how good that team was
1323947 leaders emerge because of their preparation and awareness of what it takes to win college baseball games
1323948 its not forced it just happens i think leake will lead this team because hes very serious about baseball and competition
1323949 i think itll be an interesting but very fun fall
1323950 its going to be a great challenge so our coaching staff must also show consistency
1323951 i think everyone is getting beat up by the draft right now but its just crazy how theres so many guys at both arizona and arizona state that decided to go pro this summer
1323952 its really a two edged sword because you want your players to get drafted however when they sign it leaves you with a few holes to fill
1323953 guilmet and glenn coming back would give us a ray of hope
1323954 both players seem to be far away from signing pro contracts so id be shocked if they decided to sign

1324031 theyre still talking and i dont know how much longer its going to go
1324032 what does it mean it just means that theyre still talking rather than keeping everyone here until we dont know how long as a courtesy to you guys weve decided were just going to try again tomorrow
1324033 you hear that hes in a meeting with mike mccarthy for three hours or whatever or more and so i dont know maybe theres a curveball
1324034 they have to hammer out something i think they have to find some common ground
1324035 every new regulation concerning commerce or revenue or in any manner affecting the value of the different species of property presents a new harvest to those who watch the change and can trace its consequences a harvest reared not by themselves but by the toils and cares of the great body of their fellow citizens

1324040 what you saw in the congress this week was the war dance of the handmaidens of the oil companies
1324041 we are spending all of this time on a parliamentary tactic when nothing less is at stake than the planet the air we breathe our children breathe
1324042 nothing is that important that safety does not come first
1324043 i will step back from my day to day producing work on american idol and will be devoting my time to the new enterprise
1324044 he is an extraordinarily talented producer whose creative contributions to the no 1 show on television have been immeasurable
1324045 after it collided with the trees there was a fire a small fire that erupted into a larger one
1324046 the tail was pretty much intact and thats why i believe those two gentlemen survived
1324047 this is one of those searches that could have gone on for days had we not had the cellphones stuff
1324048 if you are in a remote area getting a connection to a telephone base station is very difficult which means you might lose what little battery life you have left
1324049 sending a text message is actually the most secure way of ensuring you get a message through because the phone will keep looking out for the signal as soon as it gets enough of the signal it will send the message whereas if you try to make a phone call and theres not enough signal you might not get through and if you do get through theres a chance the one youre calling wont be able to pick up
1324050 we offer our deepest sympathies to the families and will be working directly with them and the two seaspan survivors to provide grief and trauma counselling
1324051 these two kids went running past and they both said call 911 the bridge is leaving
1324052 you cant cross theres a 30 foot gap in the road
1324053 a complete waste of the money john mccains contributors have donated to his campaign
1324054 in no way do i think john mccains campaign was racist i think they are cynical
1324055 their team is good at creating distractions and engaging in negative attacks
1324056 john mccain is nudging up in the polls in the race against barack obama why good campaigning effective attack ads
1324057 what the fuck am i going to do in pakse
1324058 im sorry to be offering you money for the service you provide ill just go and hunt my lunch
1324059 although market conditions in the homebuilding industry remain challenging we continue to focus on reducing our inventory and generating cash flow from operations
1324060 i know that somehow theres a release that suggests there was a stall but we havent come to any of those conclusions
1324061 our investigators have been on the site and well be trying to get the wreckage off the hillside today
1324062 we know the weather was suitable for the flight to depart
1324063 however i believe we have the engines and propeller pieces that well be able to examine more closely
1324064 we can tell already that there was power at least in one of the engines and we have to look closer to determine the level of power in the other engine
1324065 hes getting a bit stiffer and sorer as would be expected given the nature of the accident that he had but hes doing fine
1324066 you hope above hope that its going to be your family member
1324067 we were pretty ecstatic when we found out bob was still alive
1324068 theres quite a lot weve lost a couple of bridges quite a few culverts washed out and then of course theres major damage up in the northwest and well also begin the process of assessing damage to private property
1324069 its too early to tell the costs but just based on the damage weve seen up in the northwest its into the millions probably for repairing roads and bridges
1324070 we all hope that weve seen the last of the rain
1324071 water levels are still coming up around the province were still concerned about that and we have flood warnings in effect for the saint john river and were also concerned about water levels over on the miramichi river but i think in a lot of the small rivers weve already seen the peak
1324072 hes never been in a fight and would never hurt anybody ever
1324073 hed only have one article of clothing on him and hed give it to you if you asked
1324074 i just want people to remember him as a good guy he lived life to the fullest
1324075 so it would imply that people who have a mutation in this gene and are susceptible to cancer have inherently regions of their dna which are duplicated or deleted and therefore are unstable
1324076 and that may have something to do with the mechanism by which they develop cancer
1324077 what is also striking is that with each successive generation the cancers tend to occur earlier in age and may also be more aggressive biologically
1324078 so rather than what we have to do now look for everything at every age which becomes an extreme burden on the patients and their families you may be able to say for such and such a person in the family we only need to focus on this tumour type starting from this age
1324079 hope for the future hope that in an lfs family that the legacy of loss will end
1324080 we know cancer to be basically a disease of genetic instability in the cancer cells and all weve done here is use an unusual model to show that that instability is actually present in every cell in every person
1324081 the couch or more generally long term psychoanalytic psychotherapy was for so long a hallmark of the practice of psychiatry it no longer is
1324082 by contrast theres almost no marketing for psychotherapy which has comparable if not better outcomes
1324083 the couch turns out to be an effective 21st century treatment
1324084 if she would not have had that vision test i would never have known
1324085 im so relieved and going to make sure i do everything they tell me to make sure this works for her for life
1324086 how this lens is going to work in a childs eye we dont know weve never done studies
1324087 its an exciting thing in a patient who has had conventional therapy and failed
1324088 mobile dvr has already landed up in the grubby hands of some lucky fellow the self
1324089 he said he wanted to find out if it was as easy in real life to rob a taxi as it was in the game
1324090 we are sending out requests today to outlets and shops to pull the games off their shelves and we will replace them with other games
1324091 we are also urging video game arcades to pull the games from service
1324092 this time bomb has already exploded and the situation could get worse
1324093 today it is a cab driver but tomorrow it could be a video game shop owner
1324094 life can be so smooth and delightful with the 2 year old that is may be quite a jolt when he turns 2 and a half and all too often it becomes tense explosive and rigid two in many boys and girls is an age of rather straightfoward sure uncomplicated functioning two and a half can be a time of difficulty in amny ways and especially difficult when violent demanding explosive emotions take over as they so often do
1324095 basically i agree with you he is a pig and deserves death the system has to consider cruel and unusual punishment i believe that is in our constitution that was the reason for the hold up on executions a few months ago while the supreme court reviewed the lethal injection cases
1324096 oh poor baby rehabilitate him we cant kill him is bs invented by the aclu and people who feel the victims are collateral damage
1324097 un elemento che lega forse in maniera concreta la sciagura aerea del 27 giugno 1980 con la strage alla stazione ferroviaria di bologna costituito dal tipo di esplosivo ritrovato nei rottami dellaereo e quello utilizzato per confezionare lordigno che ha massacrato 85 persone la mattina del 2 agosto
1324098 nessun pezzo dellaereo reca tracce di esplosione lo ripeto questi periti non hanno trovato un solo frammento che fosse esposto ad unazione esplosiva neanche sui corpi delle vittime
1324099 una strage come quella di bologna non si confessa la confessione rende definitivamente certo ci che altrimenti si pu sempre sperare che rimanga segnato dal dubbio perch la strage questa strage per chiunque un fardello troppo pesante da sostenere sotto tutti gli aspetti
1324100 i dont think it is fair to a guy who is 75 yesterdays 75 is not the 75 of the 1950s if you stop screening and treating men at 75 you are going to have a lot more people dying of prostate cancer
1324101 the problem is that we cant tell which ones are really bad
1324102 we could not find adequate proof that early detection leads to fewer men dying of the disease
1324103 at this point we recommend that men make a decision based on their individual risk factors and personal preference
1324104 we know that prostate cancer is a slow growing disease and years ago used to say that 70 might be the cutoff now that the population is aging and remaining healthy we are extending that to 75
1324105 this is another piece of evidence to present to the patient
1324106 age in and of itself is not a definitive determinant of whether you should be excluded from treatment
1324107 what is long sighted vision medical term please this is bedside teaching only use lay man term when youre communicating with the patients
1324108 makcik makcik masuk hospital ni untuk operation apa cataract opacity in the lens of eye atau bahasa mudahnya selaput putih di mata meeting eh
1324109 eh reti tak buat macam yang akak tu suruh nanti kita kalah
1324110 saya minta supaya knkt melihat di knkt itu ada aslinya sehingga bisa dibandingkan dilihat mana yang benar mana yang tidak pasti dia knkt akan lakukan nanti akan diumumkan
1324111 saya kira dalam waktu pendek seminggu paling lama sudah selesai
1324112 jadi kalau dilihat rekamannya itu sebetulnya hampir dibuat mirip dengan transkrip yang sudah ada di knkt dan sebetulnya sudah dipublikasikan secara umum jadi sebetulnya kalau mau lengkap tentang bagaimana kecelakaan itu terjadi kan sebetulnya bisa diunduh download dari website knkt
1324113 tingkat keselamatan itu tidak perlu direkayasa tingkat penerbangan itu harus diusahakan untuk selamat
1324114 rekaman itu belum bisa ditentukan kita semua masih mencari sumbernya dan perlu anda ketahui knkt itu tugasnya menginvestigasi penyebab kecelakaan bukannya mencari pelaku cyber crime
1324115 bagi saya rekaman itu di luar logika sukar diyakini bahwa dalam keadaan luar biasa panik tersebut pembicaraan masih santai saja
1324116 di dalamnya ada cockpit voice recorder yang isinya rekaman percakapan antara pilot dengan copilot dan pilot dengan petugas air traffic control di menara bandara tujuan kemudian flight data recorder yang mencatat kecepatan pesawat posisi pesawat terakhir dan attitude pesawat
1324117 apalagi saat ini kita masih di band dengan penerbangan uni eropa ini jelas sangat memperkeruh dunia penerbangan kita
1324118 jika memang ada keterlibatan orang dalam ya harus berani diusut karena yang tahu rekaman tersebut hanya dephub dan knkt
1324119 a bluegrass band sent into outer space in a giant disco ball spaceship
1324120 but thats because rates are high when rates were low no one called for inflation targeting to be shelved
1324121 but i urge you not to suggest abandoning inflation targeting
1324122 and thus you wouldnt be able to hold the central bank responsible
1324123 we must all do our bit to bring inflation down to the target range in the medium term
1324124 date avi finds out refunding spicy food is even worse than it coming out the other end
1324125 but i tell you dont resist him who is evil but whoever strikes you on your right cheek turn to him the other also if anyone sues you to take away your coat let him have your cloak also whoever compels you to go one mile go with him two give to him who asks you and dont turn away him who desires to borrow from you
1324126 lord my servant lies in the house paralyzed grievously tormented
1324127 lord im not worthy for you to come under my roof just say the word and my servant will be healed for i am also a man under authority having under myself soldiers i tell this one go and he goes and to another come and he comes and to my servant do this and he does it
1324128 most assuredly i tell you i havent found so great a faith not even in israel i tell you that many will come from the east and the west and will sit down with abraham isaac and jacob in the kingdom of heaven but the sons of the kingdom will be thrown out into the outer darkness there will be weeping and the gnashing of teeth
1324129 go your way let it be done for you as you have believed
1324130 the kingdom of heaven is like yeast which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal until it was all leavened
1324131 have mercy on me lord you son of david my daughter is severely demonized
1324132 i wasnt sent to anyone but the lost sheep of the house of israel
1324133 it is not appropriate to take the childrens bread and throw it to the dogs
1324134 yes lord but even the dogs eat the crumbs which fall from their masters table
1324135 woman great is your faith be it done to you even as you desire
1324136 called a little child to himself and set him in the midst of them and said
1324137 allow the little children and dont forbid them to come to me for to such belongs the kingdom of heaven
1324138 good teacher what good thing shall i do that i may have eternal life
1324139 why do you call me good no one is good but one that is god but if you want to enter into life keep the commandments
1324140 all these things i have observed from my youth what do i still lack
1324141 if you want to be perfect go sell what you have and give to the poor and you will have treasure in heaven and come follow me
1324142 most assuredly i say to you a rich man will enter into the kingdom of heaven with difficulty again i tell you it is easier for a camel to go through a needles eye than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of god
1324143 with men this is impossible but with god all things are possible
1324144 behold we have left everything and followed you what then will we have
1324145 most assuredly i tell you that you who have followed me in the regeneration when the son of man will sit on the throne of his glory you also will sit on twelve thrones judging the twelve tribes of israel
1324146 for the kingdom of heaven is like a man who was the master of a household who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard
1324147 they said to him because no one has hired us
1324148 he said to them you also go into the vineyard and you will receive whatever is right when evening had come the lord of the vineyard said to his steward call the laborers and pay them their wages beginning from the last to the first
1324149 when those who were hired at about the eleventh hour came they each received a denarius
1324150 but he answered one of them friend i am doing you no wrong didnt you agree with me for a denarius take that which is yours and go your way it is my desire to give to this last just as much as to you isnt it lawful for me to do what i want to with what i own or is your eye evil because i am good so the last will be first and the first last for many are called but few are chosen
1324151 then the righteous will answer him saying lord when did we see you hungry and feed you or thirsty and give you a drink when did we see you as a stranger and take you in or naked and clothe you when did we see you sick or in prison and come to you
1324152 the king will answer them most assuredly i tell you inasmuch as you did it to one of the least of these my brothers you did it to me
1324153 then they will also answer saying lord when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison and didnt help you
1324154 then he will answer them saying most assuredly i tell you inasmuch as you didnt do it to one of the least of these you didnt do it to me these will go away into eternal punishment but the righteous into eternal life
1324155 my soul is exceedingly sorrowful even to death stay here and watch with me
1324156 my father if it is possible let this cup pass away from me nevertheless not what i desire but what you desire
1324157 what couldnt you watch with me for one hour watch and pray that you dont enter into temptation the spirit indeed is willing but the flesh is weak
1324158 my father if this cup cant pass away from me unless i drink it your desire be done
1324159 sleep on now and take your rest behold the hour is at hand and the son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners arise lets be going behold he who betrays me is at hand
1324160 put your sword back into its place for all those who take the sword will die by the sword or do you think that i couldnt ask my father and he would even now send me more than twelve legions of angels how then would the scriptures be fulfilled that it must be so
1324161 thats the only thing that stops them at least for a few days
1324162 these kids have been kicked out of the other gay youth shelters in the city by breaking rules and curfews were their last hope i cant throw them back on the street
1324163 father was trying to make peace with them but then one of them hit him in the back of the head with a paint can
1324164 he fell to the ground and they kept hitting him
1324165 i think that young men see these striking girls and theyre attracted
1324166 and when they find out they are male they dont know how to handle it and act out in rage
1324167 i have a very lovely psychiatrist who works with me in my offices and his christian background is that he tries to help homosexuals trying to turn away from what they are engaged in
1324168 can you think of anything more vile than man and man or woman and woman and sexually abusing children
1324169 in mcc we welcome all types of people to worship with us and explore a journey of christian discipleship
1324170 have you not read the word of god and teach us now
1324171 no we cant do that because the word of god says this
1324172 but only those who do the will of my father
1324173 do unto others whatever you would have them do unto you
1324174 whatsoever you do to one of these the least of my brethren you do also unto me
1324175 is there so much love in the world that we can afford to discriminate against any kind of love

1324206 jessie worked as a dresser for the show the dollar princess
1324207 further measures in the autumn to help people with housing and through them the housing market
1324208 this news will be welcomed by homebuyers across the country as it will provide some much needed relief to those struggling to get on to or move up the property ladder
1324209 this is the first real sign from the government that it is looking to take practical steps to help spearhead an economic recovery
1324210 if the burden of stamp duty is removed it will create renewed confidence in the housing market helping to halt the current downwards spiral
1324211 if it is true scrapping stamp duty over the short term is likely to entice a surge of buyers back to the market keen to save what could potentially be 1 000s off the value of their next purchase
1324212 however while this is likely to increase activity in what is currently a struggling market we need to see this action coupled with the freeing up of mortgage finance if it is to prove a real success
1324213 a more sensible approach would be to limit this stamp duty holiday to those buyers purchasing a primary residence
1324214 this would ensure that those who really need the help benefit while preventing other from taking advantage of the situation

1324235 the state chapters board of directors has embraced the plan and is looking forward to doing more great things for wildlife than ever
1324236 our volunteers believe it is important to look toward the future of north americas greatest game bird and are excited about having a plan in place to help secure the future of the wild turkey in new york
1324237 these counties are in desperate need of quality brood habitat as much of the area has become heavily forested over the last few decades
1324238 the habitat focus area selected by the chapter was once the go to area for turkey hunters in new york but as with many areas of the northeast mature woods exist where there used to be a patchwork of openings
1324239 the state chapter also identified creating winter food sources as an objective because they understand wild turkeys need standing food sources to survive tough winters
1324240 to help offset the cost of planting food sources for wildlife the state chapter chose to support the nwtfs conservation seed program
1324241 through operation appleseed volunteers plant crabapple trees and shrubs to provide late winter food for wildlife
1324242 these trees and shrubs provide food to wild turkeys grouse deer songbirds and other wildlife during the colder months of winter when the animals really need food and have a hard time finding it because deep snow has covered other food sources
1324243 the plan will be dynamic and adaptable to balance the social needs of people with the biological needs of wildlife and will provide accurate and relevant science based support for wild turkey management
1324244 it will serve as a guiding light for nwtfs volunteers and will help ensure their dollars are spent in ways that will get the greatest good by having the tools needed to make informed decisions when spending their hard earned hunting heritage super fund dollars
1324245 today the cost of even the smallest habitat project requires the resources of multiple partners whose very influence could have far reaching effects on wild turkeys
1324246 for example partnering with those who are improving habitat for the indiana bat in new york which is a threatened species also improves wild turkey habitat by working together project partners can leverage hunting heritage super fund expenditures with endangered species act dollars to do far more work than either group could have done alone

1324253 it warms my heart to also know hes been a member of the nwtf for nearly 25 years
1324254 though hes an avid sportsman who has hunted and fished throughout north american his passion is hunting the wild turkey its reported that some of his most cherished memories afield happened during his successful quest for a grand slam in 1999
1324255 what needs to be stressed most is that he was a really good father

1324278 paul kernan is obviously in consideration so is enda mcnulty brendan donaghy martin ferris and barry shannon
1324279 they were extremely well organised they are very physically strong right up the middle and that is well complemented by their speed on the flanks
1324280 their target men of ciaran lyng and mattie forde tortured down throughout and the work of pj banville out the field was very impressive as well
1324281 you have lyng with his left foot coming in from the right side and mattie forde with his right foot coming in from the right
1324282 both are free takers and redmond barry at number 10 was also hugely impressive against down
1324283 i would also single out their midfield for attention because they controlled proceedings by and large for most of the game
1324284 bar the 25 minutes against dublin they basically havent been beaten this year
1324285 they played a sweeper and got a lot of people back behind the ball
1324286 they will be extremely difficult to break down and were not altogether too fond of leaving ourselves short of men at the back either

1324340 pmpa members are indebted to vic for the support and leadership that he has given the alliance both as a founder member and director and most recently as chairman
1324341 his experience and good judgement have been invaluable especially during recent months as the mortgage sector has been faced with unprecedented challenges
1324342 if pmpa continues in its current format we will look for a new chair or md from the huge talent available in the industry currently someone who can continue to lead the organisation though the current market difficulties for the benefit of members and the wider packaging community
1324343 i have enjoyed every minute of my time in the chair of pmpa even through some interesting and tricky moments
1324344 i advised the board of my wish to retire this post back in may and agreed to wait until now allowing them the opportunity to consider a suitable replacement
1324345 i have every confidence that helen will lead pmpa successfully through the transition to a new chair or md
1324346 whatever the future holds for packagers including the possible emergence of a single packager organisation i believe that the standards set and maintained by the pmpa have established a packager benchmark of quality that will continue to benefit all sectors of the mortgage industry

1324535 as has been widely observed histories of feminism have often been conceived via notions of generation where feminism is positioned as a kind of familial property a form of inheritance and legacy which is transmitted through generations thus feminism and its history have been imagined as following a familial mode of social reproduction despite the dominance of this model it has nonetheless been subject to critique not least because of its reliance on teleological and progressive notions of history judith roof for example has called for new conceptualizations of temporality in an attempt to decouple histories of feminism from a generational model this need to move away from a generational model is also underscored by what commentators such as angela mcrobbie have identified as a dispersal of feminism a broad scale circulation of feminist values in popular culture as well as by the emergence of a certain kind of reflexivity whereby past and current feminist practices are increasingly subject to critique for mcrobbie such developments are understood as part of the articulation of a post feminism in which feminism can no longer be passed on as it is positioned as having already passed away however in this article via an exploration of recent accounts of the passing of feminism it is suggested that what allows for a declaration of this passing is an attachment to feminism as a particular way of knowing as well as to a particular arrangement of the social indeed it will be suggested that recent histories of feminism and commentaries on the state of contemporary feminism are driven not only by generational logics but also by these attachments attachments which lose and fix both feminism and women in time

1324548 garcias proclaimed code of fair campaigning was never approved by the membership and is a smoke screen for political favoritism garcia and nathan fisk are biased and using rose colored glasses when viewing cranks false statements
1324549 garcias behavior is dividing our county party and negatively impacting our ability to unify and help bob schaffer and john mccain win in november therefore the republican club of falcon calls for the resignation of greg garcia

1324557 to suggest that greg garcia had ulterior motives or some hidden agenda to promote one candidate over the others and the lamborn campaign had every right to raise the question i do not believe that for a split second
1324558 if anything he stuck his neck out to be fair

1324728 it is the view of the association that members need not honour do not call requests that originate from the organization in question
1324729 all telemarketers to maintain internal do not call lists and to abide by consumers requests not be called
1324730 there is no prohibition on consumers making such a request through a third party
1324731 a consumer can make a do not call request to an organization even though the consumer does not have an existing business relationship with that organization
1324732 to the extent that these requests are sent to organizations that engage in telemarketing and that are therefore subject to the rules regarding do not call lists these requests would be in compliance with the act and the current unsolicited telecommunications rules as outlined above in short on the basis of the facts as i understand them and have stated above i consider that do not call requests made through ioptout are valid and should be honoured

1324755 madame of cleves has a more joyous countenance than ever
1324756 it is likely she found henry as unattractive as he found her she and the king remained friends and she was close to his children
1324757 as one of the most sweet gracious and humane queens they had had
1324758 maybe after being summarily rejected by the other women he chased and i would love it if they throw in the line about christina of milan not wanting to marry him because she only has one head hell be confidently expecting anne of cleves pretty but not a beauty like anne boleyn to be delighted to get to be his bride and when she is less than enthusiastic his pride gets hurt i doubt that anne of cleves could possibly be as ugly as henry claimed id say that her portrait may have flattered her a bit but that it was essentially a good likeness if you were holbein would you dare to paint one of henrys prospective brides as pretty if she was really unattractive

1324774 after years of inaction and in the face of public frustration over rising gas prices
1324775 we simply cannot pretend as sen mccain does that we can drill our way out of this problem
1324776 make no mistake the oil companies have placed their bet on sen mccain and if he wins they will continue to cash in while our families and our economy suffer and our future is put in jeopardy

1324939 what scared me was my right shoulder and hand would be numb

1325040 my brother hosam and i knew that obama will be a big hit even before he became a candidate we knew the guy would be a celebrity in gaza so we decided to invest the amount of 29 000 to buy obama t shirts from his website and sell them in gaza
1325041 i know on the back of this story obama rivals will present our business as a donation and they will try to use this story to let obama fall but im telling you we bought t shirts

1325043 some young men even bought the t shirts for 60 shekel 17 29 which is a lot to spend in gaza on a t shirt but that is how much gazans like obama
1325044 maybe we sold the shirts for a lot more i cant remember now
1325045 we dont want to cause any damage to obamas campaign

1325320 many people claim that christians are free to employ a variety of practices in worship as long as the means employed are not specifically forbidden in scripture
1325321 we believe that the scriptures contain a general prohibition against all elements in worship besides those which god himself has instituted in other words
1325322 i know how difficult it is to persuade the world that god disapproves of all modes of worship not expressly sanctioned by his word
1325323 in vain do they worship me teaching for doctrines the commandments of men
1325324 of the views generally held by the reformers on the subject of the organization of the church there are two which have been always very offensive to men of a loose and latitudinarian tendency viz the alleged unlawfulness of introducing into the worship and government of the church any thing which is not positively warranted by scripture and the permanent binding obligation of a particular form of church government
1325325 still the change in question is not a small matter it crosses the line betwixt appointed and discarded observances betwixt simple and aesthetic devotion it gets into the region of sensuous and sensational worship it breaks open the floodgates and exposes the church to an inundation of error and change
1325326 what is the biblical alternative to the regulative principle of worship all views of worship principally lead either to rome or to westminster thus that which prevents churches from becoming epistemologically consistent with their romish views of worship is ultimately preference expediency and mere pragmatism not biblical principle

1325374 its the end of the world as we know it
1325375 the trick to achieving orgasm is to put pressure on your clitoris by rotating your pelvis during sex
1325376 good positions for this are with the woman on top or with the man behind and if you tighten your pelvic muscles your orgasm will be more intense
1325377 these positions are also great for hitting the g spot which is around the urethra tissue the part you can feel through the vaginal wall its not miles in like we all previously thought
1325378 another good orgasm tip is to give up on trying to climax simultaneously
1325379 much better to take it in turns so youre not distracted by what the other person is doing thats why a 69er is always better in fantasy
1325380 and stop thinking of sex having a start middle and end you could orgasm from an oral sex session or a quickie against the bathroom wall
1325381 keep your mind in the moment and feel rather than think it will make climaxing much easier if you want more than one orgasm my best tip is to use different forms of stimulation otherwise you get desensitised so orgasm through oral sex then through your g spot
1325382 remember having sex when youre drunk means your senses are dulled and your orgasm wont be as good
1325383 the key to having a great orgasm is to get your mind in orgasm mode way before you take your clothes off
1325384 all orgasms are great thinking of them as brilliant or boring just puts pressure on us the trick is not to strive for something better we all feel orgasms in different ways my advice is to set aside time to explore orgasms on your own its rare to be unable to orgasm through masturbation
1325385 a lot of women think its cheating to do it in a relationship but its not it helps you know what you like then why not try masturbating in front of your partner if you feel embarrassed then ask him to do it first

1325393 the disquisition on my music focuses on the relationship of stable and unstable elements stable elements the central major structuring element of all my music after 1985 is the hexagrams of trichords matrix of 64 collections of 12 trichords it is primarily applied to pitches and or durations although there have been methods of applying the structures to other parameters dynamic instrument group instrument timbre idiosyncratic gestures and articulations unstable elements beyond paramentric control larger aspects of form are achieved through processes that involve randomness shuffle mode in ipod based works random events and random time interval between events in flash based media works between stable and unstable lies the heterogenaity of multiple organizing tempi making parts fiercely independent but also making it nearly impossible to map out consistent harmonic tendencies freedom is the naieve illusion of the amateur in unstable music the heterogony of musical styles usually expressed as vast decade long ripplings of culture the baroque romanticism post modernism the blues ad infinitum are evoked as syncretically integrated microsonic parametric and gestural events in an electronic landscape devoid of illustrative references this is a look at the dna of analog musical style through the cold observer less lens of digital synthesis and signal processing in spite of that there is a lovely vocal coda that provides a further contradictory view of the previous 30 minutes a reminder that we are all biological filters of experience unstable music was my last stand alone work before beginning another huge and unmanageable digital media opera beest opera in progress

1325399 the united states loses four percent of the gross national product due to alloy corrosion
1325400 a network of continuous metal nanoparticles allow the carbon to dissolve and diffuse through the protective oxide scales without the need of a crack or a pore
1325401 by examining the oxide scale we find the metal nanoparticles
1325402 if they are eliminated we can create a more corrosion resistant and longer lasting alloy
1325403 weve raised concerns for years about primates being in peril but now we have solid data to show the situation is far more severe than we imagined
1325404 tropical forest destruction has always been the main cause but now it appears that hunting is just as serious a threat in some areas even where the habitat is still quite intact in many places primates are quite literally being eaten to extinction
1325405 to have a group of animals under such a high level of threat is quite frankly unlike anything we have recorded among any other group of species to date
1325406 among the african species the great apes such as gorillas and bonobos have always tended to grab the limelight and even though they are deeply threatened it is smaller primates such as the red colobus that could die out first
1325407 the work with lion tamarins shows that conserving forest fragments and reforesting to create corridors that connect them is not only vital for primates but offers the multiple benefits of maintaining healthy ecosystems and water supplies while reducing greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change
1325408 drug disasters are literally built into the current system of drug testing and approvals in the united states
1325409 recent changes in the system have only increased the proportion of new drugs with serious risks
1325410 based on our current system the designation of safe and effective on todays new drugs could be replaced with apparently safe based on incomplete information and more effective than a placebo
1325411 speed up reviews for safety have more than tripled the number of black box warnings of side effects or withdrawals after drugs are on the market
1325412 despite recent reforms to strengthen the fdas role in protecting the public from harmful drugs the harm benefit ratio is worsening due to these reviews and relaxed rules that allow companies to promote drugs for unapproved uses
1325413 it is possible that nano particles of precious metals are suitable candidates for catalysts in important reactions in the chemical industry

1325591 when youve been around your military working dog or pet long enough you learn the dogs behavior and demeanor and any changes to it you can feel when something is not right you dont necessarily see it you just feel it
1325592 the morning of july 28 i went in to feed the dogs i knew right away that something was wrong
1325593 he wasnt your average working dog when it was time to work hed work but after duty he wanted to be your pet

1325596 i raised my voice to get fandas attention and goro perked up too
1325597 we give the dogs what they need to be happy
1325598 he could differentiate between that toy and his reward he knows he gets to chew on and play with the reward when he looks for it but during playtime when you dont have the leash hooked up and take him to the training area its all about the big ball

1325602 his involvement with war wounded troops shows the role of a true leader in todays air force
1325603 the most inspiring thing ive seen is the chief taking time from his busy life to guide mentor and care for war wounded troops and their families
1325604 chief page contacts me and my wife numerous times every week in person through e mail and via telephone
1325605 he has ensured that i have been able to focus on healing not on extraneous issues he has proven time and time again to be the ultimate mentor teacher and chief
1325606 hes not only the command chief of the 12th ftw hes a command chief for the entire air force and throughout our sister services
1325607 he asked me if i was still getting out and what he could do to keep me in the air force
1325608 ever since i heard him speak i was thinking about reenlisting and i mentioned to him i had always wanted to teach professional military education he mentioned there was a position available unfortunately they had hired someone else prior to my package making it over but a couple months later the chief was looking for an executive assistant and i was hired
1325609 without a doubt i would work with the chief any day
1325610 if i could go to war with him i would and thats huge for an explosive ordnance disposal guy to say

1325612 and we have complete integration of our emergency operations center incident command structure and command and control were one of the first command posts in the air force to fully integrate
1325613 this means we can quickly respond to incidents affecting the active duty and reserve wings

1325682 she faces a tough challenge from allen who also is well funded and has a base in the portland centered district where he regularly won his house races with 60 percent of the vote or more
1325683 its disappointing that tom allen voted to go on vacation rather than work to address our current energy crisis high gas and oil prices are the most urgent problems facing mainers right now and instead of working to come up with solutions allen voted to adjourn for the august recess

1325690 mccain made signifciant gains at obamas expense among some of what had been obamas strongest demographic groups
1325691 the survey results come as obama fresh off what had been characterized as a triumphant tour of the middle east and europe including a speech to 200 000 germans in berlin that trip quickly became fodder for an aggressive response ad by the mccain campaign that questioned whether obamas popularity around the world meant he was ready to lead the u s
1325692 the mccain camp seems to have turned lemons into lemonade huge crowds and mostly favorable press reviews of obamas overseas trip have been trumped by mccains attacks on obama loss of support for obama among young voters may also be due to his perceived reversals on issues they care about such as the war and government eavesdropping

1325694 their aim is to use simple means to attack the chinese government and turn the year 2008 into a year of mourning
1325695 this is utterly unacceptable any time its particularly reprehensible just days before the olympics at a time when china has promised complete media freedom
1325696 we strongly protest against the violent detention of a reporter who was reporting by fair means
1325697 sometimes the weather reminds me of ripe georgia peaches perfect for savoring
1325698 place the freshener directly at the source of the odor in small places like garbage bins diaper pails closets and the pantry with a little twist you can adjust the disc to the desired level of freshness stick ups are ideal for stopping big odors in small places
1325699 ensure that your life plan as been presented to the lord 2and the lord answered me and said write the vision and make it plain upon tables that he may run that readeth it habakkuk 2 2

1325703 you cant jump the wake of another vessel within 100 feet
1325704 they dont have brakes they dont have air bags they dont have seat belts and once you come off the throttle you lose your steering capability
1325705 so a novice someone who has not operated a personal watercraft if in fact they were heading toward something and they want to change directions one of the primary issues is theyre going to come off throttle and theyre going to lose steering
1325706 its draining on your body the sun the wind the elements the bouncing up and down
1325707 now put yourself on a personal watercraft where you are actually maneuvering that pwc using your arms back and forth and then youre out there for a long period of time
1325708 there are the same stressors a lot of people dont know that and they dont know until its too late
1325709 a lot of the sloughs are narrow and you have no real speed limits on boats
1325710 the delta has a lot of hidden hazards and in these narrow sloughs there is no room for mistakes every place is different and you should get acquainted with the area
1325711 keep it slow know your limits be looking around every blind turn
1325712 when coming up to a blind turn definitely slow down
1325713 were going to be out there in force taking a zero tolerance approach on boating and alcohol as well as stopping pwcs if we see an unsafe act
1325714 we get a lot of people out in discovery bay that are new boat owners from other areas that have no idea what they are doing and they wreak havoc on the discovery bay waterways
1325715 i think it would help if people had to pass a boating class and have a special license to operate a boat
1325716 i dont think people need to be regulated in everything they do in their life but i think people need to be educated and i think they need to take responsibility and do the right thing
1325717 where everybody is off doing their own things and theres a lot of stuff to choose from and everybodys learning and having fun at the same time
1325718 interest initiated learning works well for children with a deep abiding interest or hobby as well as for students with clearly delineated goals
1325719 some say that unschooling results in educational gaps holes in a students knowledge
1325720 and theyre looking for ways to break out of all of the rules that have been set before them and they find themselves saying is this all there is to life is simply following rules and jumping through hoops then this is a fabulous eye opening event for them
1325721 these students are really well motivated have done their homework and done their research
1325722 theyre the type of students who excel when they get on a college campus because they can keep themselves in check and make sure theyre doing well and succeeding

1325727 to understand and explain american exceptionalism like it or not it may be necessary to at least understand why aeroplanes were not used in the civil war why the british couldnt use the train to get back and forth between new york and philadelphia in 1788 and why the jackson democrats kept making such a fuss about the national bank
1325728 nevadas council to establish academic standards was scheduled to meet july 21 to adopt new public school history standards when some attention was drawn to what theyre up to they promptly postponed their meeting for lack of a quorum
1325729 behind all the double talk about replacing fact driven chronological history with a more thematic approach the unmistakable goal is to dumb down our history classes still further
1325730 kind sir i can assure you that no job or law school application has asked any questions about the names and places of american battles of any century more importantly such a view obstructs a constructive conversation about how best to teach history to kids
1325731 i taught american history at unlv for three semesters and i really really did not want my students simply to spew facts at me
1325732 studying history is a means to an end it can provide an opportunity for kids to master a much needed set of skills
1325733 isnt that really what most folks would like our educational system to accomplish
1325734 obstructs a constructive conversation about how best to teach history to kids
1325735 1781 west shore of the chesapeake cornwallis surrenders to washington
1325736 its a story about how easily swayed people can be by hype and spin and how man is a hero and then hes their enemy and then hes their hero again and then hes their enemy in the end
1325737 the american people and the issue of the price at the pump are too important to forget about

1325740 working with this bipartisan group on a solution to americasenergy needs has been a labor of love its exactly what i came to the senate to do
1325741 we have put forth a bill today that focuses on supply conservation and alternatives and i hope this becomes a centerpiece of discussion when we come back in september
1325742 in general short holidays like weekend trips to a european city are becoming less popular probably due to a reduced spending power
1325743 fewer people make city trips which include a flight as these have become more expensive on the other hand city trips which are relatively cheaper than before like trips to london and paris are making some headway
1325744 last year about 1 in 3 heavy offences in the building sector concerned illegal work this year this number has risen to 1 in 2
1325745 these women were killed trying to do their work and improve life in mogadishu by cleaning the streets nothing can justify the deaths of innocent victims of wives and mothers such as these who were working to make ends meet
1325746 i extend my condolences to their families and to all somalis i also call on true somali patriots to use restraint and address their problems through contact and dialogue as preached by their religion and their culture
1325747 after so many years of violence somalis should use this sad time to regain their sense of dignity through working together for lasting peace
1325748 what about the families the wife back home these programmes need to address the family factor otherwise the cycle will continue
1325749 these public meetings in a larger facility are a chance for anyone who lives in oak hill to tell me whats on their mind sound walls the city managers retirement traffic or other issues

1325754 at the moment its a mystery they are keeping her in for tests until they can find out what the problem is
1325755 no one likes to hear or read an accounting of his or her faults most of us would wave off such blunt recital or avert our eyes but wal mart needs to continue to try to listen to what americans are saying about it and we have a responsibility to continue to insist on accountability what wal mart is trying to do really is engage the world understand the world meet its customers and suppliers in a different setting than shelf price to do that wal marters need to travel to routinely get out and hear what people say about them in city council meetings in industry conferences at public forums the transformation of wal mart itself must come from the buildings in bentonville its hq yes but the motivation for change cant be found in the supplier meeting rooms or the streams of sales data no matter how cleverly analyzed the motivation for change will be found in the passion of customers and vendors the ones who like wal mart the ones who dont like wal mart but cant resist the ones who define themselves by their refusal to deal with wal mart the ones who fear wal mart for wal mart to really change it needs to be able to see itself as we see it it needs to see the world clearly it needs to look out
1325756 america like wal mart is neither inherently good or evil
1325757 he has a broken arm broken elbow and minor shoulder damage but he is in good spirits
1325758 he is going to have surgery to correct the damage he says hell be okay and is looking forward to a full recovery

1325765 narvekar has resigned and congress is very much thankful to him for sacrificing for the cause of the party
1325766 he has reached the advance base camp and from there he will be airlifted
1325767 he couldnt make it during the night as he was completely exhausted
1325768 his feet have become swollen and his boots are now tight on him
1325769 hes getting medical assistance at the camp but we want him here as early as possible so he can get better treatment
1325770 since early morning the weather has been very hazy and cloudy theres a visibility problem

1325773 corporatise hockey in india thats the best way to put in place a professional structure
1325774 priorities in training programme should be decided by the coach and not by some bureaucrats
1325775 all the support staff of the team needs to have a proper contract
1325776 one good thing is that indian media is interested in hockey and transparency to the media is very essential
1325777 i think its mischievous because there were some people who did not want my association with indian hockey i started to work in india from december but signed my contract only in march after the chile debacle
1325778 sai kept on deferring the date had chile debacle not happened the contract signing wouldnt have materialised and i would have left earlier
1325779 in march i signed the contract only on the condition that all my arrears would be paid but they paid me only an amount in june they still owe me a lot of money but neither they are answering my mails nor calls
1325780 i dont know how will i recover my money but the indian olympic association is talking with the sai people in this matter
1325781 the reports are the only basis on which i am bargaining with sai but i have submitted all my 10 reports to the fih and till now i am sustaining on the money i received from them
1325782 i took up the india assignment as a challenge as i always knew it would be very difficult but eventually it turned out to be even more difficult than i thought
1325783 i am disappointed to leave but there was no point in staying as advisor when my suggestions were not accepted
1325784 my main problem was putting in place a proper programme you need to have some continuity you need to be structured whatever you do you need to have a system in place which is sympathetic towards local people
1325785 it is pretty clear now that india and pakistan are out of top six first thing they should do is to accept their mistakes and not make excuses and then go about rectifying the grey areas and thats why i was here
1325786 india still has more resources in the game than any other country by a long way but the support for the game is sleeping and dying in some places the hockey administrators now need to revive them
1325787 training sessions in india needs to be upgraded they were still adopting the techniques of 70s they must realise that they will have to cater to scientific methods to compete with teams life australia netherlands and spain
1325788 you cannot coach on anecdotes you need to have some reality but here they dont have a library when i went to rotterdam with the womens team i personally arranged for a video analyst but the sai did not give the approval
1325789 productive english language lessons and computer training should be introduced in the camps which will not only benefit the players but also develop them as individuals
1325790 i had a lot of problems in passing across my messages to the players i even conducted a test in english but the result was very poor so i always wanted an interpreter to pass across my message to them in the correct manner
1325791 my best experience was working with the players after interacting with them i understood that they want more people should realise their potential
1325792 kirsten has been granted leave to go to south africa to be with his mother as she is critically ill
1325793 kirsten will not be available for the third test as he will be leaving from colombo for south africa tonight tuesday there will not be any replacement in his absence
1325794 kevin pietersen now stands at a crossroads in his life as well as his career being england captain will take up more time than he can imagine and he will need to reconsider his whole outlook
1325795 within the game worldwide he has a reputation as being an individual but to be successful a leader must be a giver not a taker to his team fringe players sponsors the public everyone
1325796 the selectors had a decision to make they spoke long and hard about which direction they wanted to go in
1325797 if they wanted a captain for all three formats including twenty20 the list would have been short im not involved in two of the formats i would have liked to have done the test job and to that degree i am disappointed i have not been given the opportunity
1325798 it is a brave decision because kp pietersen hasnt done much captaincy before but i think he has matured a lot in the last couple of years
1325799 we are all very sad michael has decided to step down it is going to take some getting used to someone else being in charge
1325800 kp is a very decisive person and i am sure he will feel he is up to the challenge strauss said
1325801 it is a bit of a step into the unknown because he hasnt captained before but it is a new start for us
1325802 the one thing we dont want is for kevin to change he averages 50 plus in test and one day cricket and he is an unbelievable talent
1325803 he is a bit nervous at first but gets his head down and blazes a hundred that is a measure of the man when you see things like that i am sure he will take to captaincy in the same way
1325804 it is a tough job it is not just about being on the field moving the field about and changing the bowlers around
1325805 the thing is trying to leave it on the cricket field there is a lot off the field as well and i took it home with me from time to time
1325806 if he doesnt score runs at the moment england are well and truly out of just about any competition they need him doing that
1325807 theres going to be a lot of pressure on him now i must admit i wouldve let kevin keep being the number one batsman but who do you give it to in that group
1325808 hell be very aggressive and hell be looking to always take control and be in command of everything that he is doing
1325809 this is a mega project the budget is going to be around 50 60 crore

1325893 were going to do something that the iau did not which is discuss what we know about planetary bodies in the solar system and around other stars and discuss the value of different ways of defining objects as planets and what that means
1325894 if a new consensus emerges it will easily overturn the iau this is not an issue
1325895 if not theyll stick with what theyve got until something better comes along
1325896 ive been arguing pluto for eight years so its another occasion where im arguing pluto this one happens to be a little more formal in its construct so i see it as another day of just trying to tell people teach people about what we now know about the solar system
1325897 when you bring a lot of creative talented people together new solutions can arise that might not have arisen from any one individual
1325898 the collaboration the intersection of ideas has its own way of creating new understanding
1325899 this topic provides the perfect opportunity to teach science as a process not a collection of facts
1325900 we also need to stress the importance of incorporating new discoveries to continually improve our understanding of the diverse objects within planetary systems
1325901 no votes will be taken at this conference to put specific objects in or out of the family of planets
1325902 but we will have advocates of the iau definition and proponents of alternative definitions presenting their cases
1325903 theres a lot of emotion still a lot of room for opinion
1325904 but its conferences like this that are hoping to settle the dust and see what remains standing and see if a consensus can emerge

1325920 we are here to celebrate an unforgettable moment in olympic history
1325921 the decision to award the games to china could not be without challenges we were aware of these although sometimes underestimating some of them
1325922 in the future we need to be more hands on and pro active
1325923 we cannot allow to be hijacked by pressure groups and vested interests
1325924 in my part of the world we were in full boycott mode
1325925 public opinion and political opinion was moving towards an actual boycott of the games and it was only the earthquake tragedy that diverted attention from what could otherwise have been something very very serious
1325926 the games must be read within the context of each nation the ioc and the olympic movement should not be expected to resolve issues outside the games
1325927 we would compromise our mandate and responsibility if we tried to resolve them
1325928 on the 24th of august i hope i can give a glowing endorsement
1325929 the changes that are occurring in china are a microcosm of the changes in the rest of the world

1325936 there is significant support among top mccain advisers that he make a transformative pick who would change the republican party someone who would appeal to moderate republicans and democrats this pick would be someone who like mccain has taken the unpopular stands made the hard calls and stood firm on principle a person who fills that bill these advisers say is joe lieberman
1325937 you know something the republicans dont want to win this election they dont mccain may want to win but these people around him that are giving him this advice they must not want to win this election
1325938 there is a reason the american people the past 100 years elevated only two sitting senators into the white house jfk and warren harding its because they believe most senators adept at compulsive compromise have no political compass and will sell them out
1325939 were mad as hell and were not going to take it anymore

1325947 other ways we help residents relax are through fitness classes pool parties monday night football parties and movie nights

1325949 one way we help residents is through designing programs to help them look at things from a different vantage point for example in one of our past events residents helped blow up hot air balloons and took tethered balloon rides illustrating how different things look when you see them from a new perspective
1325950 this morning as fort some days past it seems exceedingly probable that this administration will not be reelected then it will be my duty to so co operate with the president elect as to save the union between the election and the inauguration as he will have secured his election on such ground that he cannot possibly save it afterward

1326061 there were four palestinians who were issued visas about whom we then received additional information
1326062 we decided that we needed to take a closer and harder look at them in light of the additional information we received

1326065 we have had a 45 50pc increase in repossessions in the last year alone
1326066 to cater for it we have set up two rings for auctions running simultaneously were running about 160 to 170 cars per auction every week
1326067 were getting everything from 5 000 cars to top of the range stuff mercs bmws at the moment we have an 08 lexus ls460 only registered three months ago that would have retailed for 150 000

1326092 you can argue that nobody is ready to be president
1326093 you can argue that even if youve been vice president for eight years that no one can be fully ready for the pressures of the office
1326094 he clearly can inspire and motivate people and energize them which is a very important part of being president
1326095 and hes smart as a whip so theres nothing he cant learn

1326097 since when does your restaurant start giving hot sauced menu items to kids especially toddlers
1326098 if a 4yr old wont eat then because they are hot and they are so hot that they set a 34yr olds mouth on fire then your restaurant should not be offering them up as a kid meal item
1326099 i dont care what the flip it is its hot and it should not be a kids item
1326100 look it doesnt necessarily have to be hot sauce to have a hot sauce on it
1326101 how about you figure out what you should do about it and in the mean time i will be speaking with someone about the fact that your restaurant offered my child a spicy hot menu item and he is only four years old
1326102 miyagi was taken from the film the karate kid and fujiya was the name of a record player
1326103 it just looked really nice written down and it was the only name we came up with
1326104 compromising of integrity morality amp principles in exchange for money tour
1326105 i think in this day and age theres no room for rock stars anymore
1326106 that kind of situation where people put you up on a pedestal and regard you more like a god or something more than just a person that just cant happen anymore were trying to be the exact opposite we want to be everybodys best friend i think people walk away from that experience like they got so much more than just a set of music
1326107 with this band its the first or second takes on nearly all the album
1326108 it keeps the kind of spontaneity that makes the music fresh and alive
1326109 youre always waiting for the next bit of information hoping that next bit of information causes you not to fire
1326110 this was the first time i had a chance to make my own record it seemed like circa was coming up on a break one of the first since the band started in 2004 and everybody in the band felt like they needed it and i didnt feel like i needed it at all
1326111 i had a pretty good list of songs but i dont think i even made an actual list to record until the day before i had practiced stuff and had ideas but there are actually a bunch of songs that i didnt get to record because they werent as developed as everything else
1326112 writing the music with circa is a huge collaboration with five dudes having their say and hands in everything whereas with this i call all the shots
1326113 like if i thought it wasnt good and i wanted to sing it again i did its kind of nice to have something that youre not checking in with anyone else to see if its cool or not its nice to be able to do whatever the f you want
1326114 this stuff is way easier for me than circa stuff i take a less nervous approach to everything than the rest of the dudes in my band do like if i feel good about something thats it i dont second guess it that instinct has gotten so much stronger with doing this project i think i see it meshing and melting into everybody else in circa
1326115 they both asked me if they could come on the tour and i was like f yeah we need a bass player anyway and brendans playing guitar i feel like everybody is getting inspired by everybody else right now its a really good vibe in the circa house right now
1326116 ive gotten better at guitar over the years im still not very good at all
1326117 i think these songs make me move different than circa songs like when i hear circa and the mixture of all those dudes and what theyre doing my body starts going crazy like in the movie weekend at bernies i just start feeling it and i cannot control whats happening to me with these songs its very much the same feeling but its just different types of movement its more low to the ground than it is like trying to reach up to the sky i feel like im more buoyant with circa with this stuff im a little bit more low to the ground

1326120 men only pretend to be feminists when they want something
1326121 my bet is the authorities wont let them out until after the olympics
1326122 not only promote our economy but also enhance all social conditions including education health and human rights
1326123 by continuing to persecute and punish those who speak out for human rights the chinese authorities have lost sight of the promises they made when they were granted the games seven years ago
1326124 the chinese authorities are tarnishing the legacy of the games
1326125 it is a new low for the international community to see all these state leaders going to beijing without saying anything about the repressive environment in which the games are being held
1326126 thousands of people including petitioners who have gone to beijing seeking justice from the government have been swept up in efforts to clean up the city before the games
1326127 they said they were hired by the hospital and surveillance will last for the next four months it is said the olympics are approaching so they worry about us petitioners
1326128 the police come to my place waiting outside and i do not know what they want to do with me
1326129 because of the olympics approaching people like me nothing more than a rights defenders wife are being specially protected by the government
1326130 i think it is dangerous to confuse the idea of democracy with elections just because you have elections doesnt mean youre a democratic country
1326131 the bible contains six admonishments to homosexuals and 362 admonishments to heterosexuals that doesnt mean that god doesnt love heterosexuals its just that they need more supervision
1326132 beware of practicing your piety before men in order to be seen by them for then you will have no reward from your father who is in heaven
1326133 you know im going to check into this whole vampire thing
1326134 did i do this wrong is this a rule i didnt know about
1326135 whatever goes as long as youre not bothering anyone else just do what you want to do
1326136 itll only affect ross if ross allows it to affect him
1326137 had i gone out and entertained the article it would have blew the article out of proportion wherever they got their facts or information from let that be what it is you got your story out thank you very much i bow to it and keep it moving now if you wanna entertain it then youre gonna open up more worms you probably dont want opened up so all ross has to do is keep focusing on his music
1326138 the whole purpose of konvict music was to grab ex convicts felons
1326139 people head in that direction and steer them in the opposite direction just focus on my past and try to contradict whatever it is i might have said or lived and dont focus on the positive things ive done in society in general if you have an article at least balance it out let the people know the good things ive done the schools ive built the kids i feed in africa dont just say he wasnt locked up for three years i dont care if i was locked up for one day its that experience that allowed me to become that person who i am to make a better society for who is listening
1326140 people know what type of dude ross is right now
1326141 they know how thorough of a dude he is now he doesnt have to prove himself to anybody thats what an insecure person would do

1326151 so when eva said she was opening a new branch of beso in the gambling capital of the world victoria had the brainwave of turning it into a place which specialises in food and their favourite game eva will oversee the restaurant while victoria channels her energies into the casino

1326154 people always ask me do you play golf because a majority of sportsmen do i used to play quite a few years ago but to be honest id rather spend four hours with the kids than four hours on a golf course as much as it can be relaxing its a frustrating sport my way of relaxing is listening to music and spending time with the kids

1326161 tonight we have gathered together the soldiers of the herev battalion and their families
1326162 we organized this celebration out of an understanding that the strength of the soldiers comes partly from the support of their parents and family at home without their strong support and understanding of what the soldiers do everyday in their operations and training missions it would be very difficult to preserve the abilities and uniqueness of this battalion i think that the fact that so many people are here on this occasion displays the care and involvement of the parents in their sons as soldiers of the idf
1326163 i think that the battalion is a symbol of pride and sets a good example for the druse community
1326164 druses can serve in any unit and thats something to be proud of but at the same time we must safeguard the battalion i think that today the soldiers have the battalion warm homes and commanders that they can be proud of i want to say thank you to the parents for the education you provided for your children we are proud of your children they are in good hands now and you can feel safe
1326165 relationships between the idf and the families of its servicemen provides one index of the sort of extra military pressures to which the new climate of opinion gives rise

1326310 what is more exasperating than having to pay taxes understanding the constantly changing legislation affecting them yet not fully understanding rights and how provisions work together costs taxpayers significantly every year a mid year tax review with an expert will help you here is why following are some common areas fraught with complex rules that cause taxpayers to miss valuable opportunities to leverage their options and lower their tax bills financial advisors and tax preparers are experts in these areas so you dont need to be call your tax advisor for your mid year review soon to discuss your financial plans and learn how you can save on your next tax return 1 overpayment or underpayment of taxes did you receive a big refund last year if so you overpaid and the government kept your money as a tax free loan while you could have invested it and earned interest did you owe worse were you stuck paying the dreaded rdf alternative minimum tax a mid year review will help determine where you are and allow you to adjust your withholding now to avoid penalties later federal income tax withholding is treated as occurring evenly throughout the year for purposes of the penalty for underpayment of estimated taxes regardless of when the money was actually withheld if you have missed an estimated tax payment or a special event has caused you to need to make estimated tax payments you can increase your federal withholding during the 2nd half of the year and have the additional monies treated as being paid in evenly over the 4 estimated tax quarters rdf 2 saving for retirement iras 401 k s profit sharing pensions employer sponsored plans etc many changes have taken place in the last few years regarding retirement savings plans the plan you originally began with may have been advantageous when you started it but it might not be anymore so much has changed with these plans that its important to review them to see if they are still performing as you intended and to find out if there are new products available that you are not taking advantage of many taxpayers do not have an individual retirement account ira and are missing an opportunity to defray their taxes and save for their own future one of the primary reasons for not having an ira is not starting one begin now even if it is only a few dollars a paycheck the government has increased the amounts ira holders can save and those over age 50 can place additional catch up amounts into their iras 3 medical savings accounts and health savings accounts try comparing your high premium medical insurance plan against a high deductible plan combined with a health savings account hsa you may be surprised at not only which one is less expensive but reap tax savings besides and are you using any available flexible spending accounts through your employer they are another way to reduce taxable income 4 estimated tax payments adjusting these payments now will avoid underpayment penalties at year end see my comment above under item 1 rdf 5 take advantage of deduction bunching some itemized deductions must meet certain thresholds before you can claim them by being aware of these and managing your expenditures to fall primarily in one year rather than spread over two years you may realize significant tax savings this applies to several expenditures especially to medical expenses property tax payments and charitable donations 6 getting married or divorced these life changing events have very significant tax implications a divorce or change in child custody arrangements can mean tax implications in several areas attempting to reach a divorce settlement or filing taxes without expert financial advice will most likely not be to your advantage in light of a situation that i described in a recent post if you have married and you are changing your name i e the wife taking on her husbands last name it is very important that you change your name with the social security administration as the ssa website rdf 7 beneficiary designations powers of attorney wills estate planning are these working advantageously for you do you even have them in place this is the time to get your plans in order and be sure that tax changes have not changed how you intended these contracts to work 8 buying or selling stocks bonds real estate or other investments many tax rules apply to all of these transactions for example a real estate like kind exchange may work to your advantage if youre selling a residence perhaps the exclusion for selling a principal residence applies to you there are capital gains and losses wash sale rules long term gains and losses and a whole array of other rules when it comes to stocks and bonds and dont forget investment expenses count as miscellaneous itemized deductions when used for the production of income handling these transactions wisely rebalancing and making changes are the name of the game with investments your financial adviser is worth his or her weight in gold here time is extremely precious for your tax preparer during the tax filing season i am sure that he she like i would jump at any opportunity to save time during this period if you sell a vacation or rental property or stock that you received through a spin off or merger especially stock that originally came from a bell company or a mutual fund acquired over the years through dividend investment let your tax preparer work up the profit or loss now while he she has the time rather than waiting till next years tax season when time is tight send your tax pro the details and documentation for these types of transactions after they have been completed and give him her something to do during the year rdf 9 financial planning is important when you have children and teens coverdell education savings accounts esas and section 529 plans are two ways to begin tax deferred savings for a childs education children grow up quickly so begin these accounts early and know how much you can add to them discipline yourself to save and you help both yourself and your child self employed parents can hire their children or grandchildren and lower the overall family tax bill the business also may benefit from hiring children under age 18 as their wages are exempt from social security and unemployment taxes paid from a parents sole

1326404 i have been playing in england for four years and think that every year i have improved including the last 12 months at chelsea
1326405 there is always the desire to keep on improving all professionals think that way you have to keep learning and getting better i am sure i will do that my best years are still ahead of me
1326406 i am not taking anything for granted because there are good defenders here like micah richards and richard dunne but i do not see why we cannot all play together and be fantastic for the club
1326407 im not going to announce numbers ill only state that the offer is far from what espanyol is asking
1326408 were in no rush well see what benfica do from here
1326409 i want to turn the page there are new people in charge and the only thing i want is to be calm and to give my best i will only speak about football from now on
1326410 now the new people are in though and i believe that we will all be together and can help each other everything appears to be a lot more positive now
1326411 i would have had to leave quickly because i could not have stayed at the club with people who i did not agree with
1326412 now though i am a valencia player and if i were to leave it would simply because i wanted to try a new experience abroad
1326413 the only way to win back the support of people that booed or whistled me is to play well and then people will forget everything that happened
1326414 i still have a lot of years ahead of me in my career and need to build myself up and develop my right foot
1326415 van der vaart is the first signing and probably the only one
1326416 i am delighted to be able to play for the best team in the world
1326417 weve gone from a well organised well drilled back room staff to one that feels like its been patched together a lot of us wanted to give him paul ince a chance to see how it will work out but so far it is not looking good
1326418 i started this company from scratch without clients at 26
1326419 thats a path thats different than leaving a company youve been a partner at for 20 years and starting an architecture firm i guess you could say fluidly in the sense that its been a sequential process each project opens us up to a new audience weve been able to sort of reverse engineer the theory to it
1326420 the financial landscape has been changing and weve been nimble and able to change with it things are taking a little longer now but i think its for the better theres no way were not going to build something on that site but will it be six months or three years but were holding onto the land i think we can perform really well at that scale the reality is there isnt a lot of opportunity being handed to people in this town ive been very forward about going after it thats a distinction between most of us in town half of our best projects we were developer architect thats been a way to accelerate the firm but its also a logical step so much of being an architect seems to be about being to holistically able to problem solve and create
1326421 isnt it about time some big local developer handed the keys to and his crew
1326422 so if i am elected president i will set this nation on a course to building 45 new reactors by the year 2030 with the ultimate goal of 100 new plants to power the homes and factories and cities of america
1326423 i start off with the premise that nuclear energy is not optimal i am not a nuclear energy proponent
1326424 but i also believe that lifting the moratoria from offshore drilling or oil and natural gas exploration is something that we should place as a very high priority and again i dont want to dictate to the states what they should do but i think that the states can be provided with additional incentives such as a greater share of the revenues than is presently the case
1326425 now the latest scheme is well were going to drill offshore
1326426 hard working american families are suffering from higher gasoline prices john mccain calls on congress to suspend the 18 4 cent federal gas tax and 24 4 cent diesel tax from memorial day to labor day
1326427 i think john mccains proposal for a three month tax holiday is a bad idea
1326428 i further propose we inspire the ingenuity and resolve of the american people by offering a 300 million prize for the development of a battery package that has the size capacity cost and power to leapfrog the commercially available plug in hybrids or electric cars
1326429 in this campaign john mccain is offering the same old gimmicks that will provide almost no short term relief to folks who are struggling with high gas prices gimmicks that will only increase our addiction for another four years
1326430 why dont you make a fence and put pumpkins in front of it
1326431 why dont you just leave me like you did before but dont expect tears this time
1326432 i believe that resolving issues of the past is an insurmountable goal we simply cannot learn to feel good about something that caused us pain

1326459 the cool thing about sherlock holmes was hes actually a very skilled martial artist so its going to have elements of that its not just his deduction and all that stuff its going to be a very action packed version of that to me its really exciting
1326460 i think this records about her trying to find her place in all this shes been gone for quite some time but the voice is still very much a factor so its just a matter of her finding her place in this new industry

1326465 for an actor you always find playing good guys very heavy because the good guy has the responsibility of taking care of his family wives children being good is not easy
1326466 the bad guy is straightforward selfish i like the girl she belongs to me i like his car give to me
1326467 if you find jet li playing the bad guy in china in asia it wouldnt sell in the theatre
1326468 im just guessing but someone must have said to her you better get your act together or else
1326469 she was perfect and shes a really good actress im not just saying that because of the movie but she really happens to be talented and it looks like shes ok now
1326470 i have had a great time shooting with her and when we have scenes together we have a lot of fun improvising
1326471 it makes me mad that people keep comparing me to amy winehouse and dusty springfield
1326472 its just labelling me as something else without any respect for the struggle the determination focus or artistic vision that i have
1326473 its like whoa whats that about why would i want to be someone else because i really dont i just want to be me
1326474 its kind of strange and disheartening to be constantly told who i look like or who i sound like
1326475 is it possible for us to witness a world without america and zionism
1326476 one night two men arrived at the abandoned house on the border between libya and tunisia in which we were waiting to leave for the sea there was some 40 of us and these people who wore uniforms took me away i was taken to a deserted house where they raped me
1326477 when they freed me and i returned to the group i was received by two other women who embraced me and the expression on their faces showed that they had suffered the same abuse
1326478 we left our country on foot the group included some 50 people we crossed the desert of sudan here the men who led the group told us they wanted more money to continue the trip otherwise they said they would leave us to die in the desert some of us had some money and paid them others could not pay and any woman that did not have money was raped in order to be allowed to continue with the group
1326479 is it possible for us to witness a world without america and zionism
1326480 its a popular topic however i havent given really much thought to these soaps
1326481 i skipped 15 episodes and when i returned i found that nothing new took place and so i decided to quit if the media stops all this fuss then the addiction would go away there is no need to force people to stop watching the soaps just give them time and they will quit themselves
1326482 i became curious when these programs were being mentioned in the press and i started watching them i found nothing special there wasnt anything attractive in the stars and what they present is far from reality
1326483 being aggressive in dealing with such cases is just fruitless this imam has not done anything positive the people in the town would simply look for another way to watch the series
1326484 however that has not stopped them on the contrary more dishes appeared on buildings

1326489 our position is very clear at the board meeting we discussed the reports we had received both from the icc security consultants and the ecb security consultants
1326490 there is a working party currently in pakistan being led by the icc president and the icc chief executive it has representatives of fica and the broadcaster
1326491 they are reviewing the security for the tournament we are awaiting their report and we will then give that report to our sectary consultants for separate advice on
1326492 we will convene a board meeting to determine what we decide to do when we aware of what the security position is from those that are right on the ground
1326493 there was an icc board meeting held at which the majority decision was taken that the tournament should be if it could be held in pakistan
1326494 the decision was made we are part of the world governing body and we accept those decisions we then took the view and continue to take the view that we will wait for the security reports
1326495 until we have all that we are not going to make a final judgement but nobody is going to be compelled to do something that they dont want to do

1326497 i think its probably going to be a different style
1326498 its going to be interesting to see how he couples that with his batting and interesting to see how he wins the dressing room over
1326499 that will be the interesting thing hes an unbelievable batsman one of the worlds best and whether that the captaincy hampers his batting or not remains to be seen
1326500 he has had a lot of challenges over the years and he has risen to every one of those so itll be interesting to see if he rises to this one
1326501 i think he deserved all the accolades he got from the job he did for england
1326502 he was always very dignified and very honourable and the way he went out the other day was fantastic even if it was a little sad for a lot of us watching
1326503 but its now a new era for england and it will be interesting to see what kp brings to the job we can only wish kp well in his tenure as captain but maybe it will be better if that starts after the oval test

1326506 first the fed had an opportunity to hike at the end of june and took a pass while not widely expected at the time capital markets were relatively tranquil pre gse meltdown and the equity market could have absorbed a tightening without cratering but conditions have deteriorated since then with the gse backstopped before they could fail and stocks having a heck of a time putting in the bounce in a proverbial bear market
1326507 but for the fed to hike one has to believe that inflation can thrive in a world of not just weak growth but in a protracted global recession
1326508 now the bear market is rolling on to energy commodity and tech stocks
1326509 the size of our second quarter loss reflects the depth and breadth of the collapse of the housing and mortgage markets the continued growth in the number of defaults and foreclosures during the quarter required a significant increase in reserves the distressed markets of california florida arizona and nevada continue to be adversely impacted by declining home prices and reserves for defaults in these states comprised approximately 68 of the increase in our reserves for the quarter

1326530 paul has done a track about how he feels about heather and what was going on with the paparazzi because no one has heard his side of it at all so this will be the first time anyone hears a song relating to that subject its very emotional and a very powerful song
1326531 paul knows heather is a complex person and deeply misunderstood but that she has hardly helped herself by being less than transparent about her life
1326532 la etapa de sustituci n de importaciones para la industria se termin y eso se ve sobre todo en el aumento de 40 por ciento de las importaciones en el ltimo a o
1326533 este es el fin del per odo del d lar alto y estamos en una transici n
1326534 la preocupaci n central de nuestro sector es el incremento de las importaciones de oriente sobre todo de china que aumentaron cerca de 40 por ciento entre enero y junio ltimos en relaci n a 2007
1326535 el incipiente proceso de sustituci n de importaciones est de nuevo amenazado por la penetraci n de oferta extranjera
1326536 la gravitaci n de estas compras crece a un ritmo preocupante
1326537 lamentablemente esa paridad que fue un eje de la estrategia econ mica de despegue se perdi
1326538 ya se empiezan a ver los impactos negativos en las importaciones que en algunos rubros crecieron en proporciones voraces
1326539 pero el ariete que significaba un tipo de cambio competitivo ya es historia desde la devaluaci n de 2002 hasta ahora el valor nominal creci apenas 10 por ciento es pr cticamente un esquema de cambio fijo
1326540 hay un gran n mero de organizaciones religiosas progresistas o de izquierda que han vuelto a la actividad en estos d as ofreciendo una alternativa a sus pares de la derecha
1326541 una teolog a progresista contempla visiones menos tradicionales de lo divino la espiritualidad y la autoridad religiosa as como una perspectiva m s liberal en cuestiones pol ticas
1326542 el n cleo duro de la izquierda religiosa est compuesto por personas que son liberales tanto teol gicamente como en sus ideas pol ticas un patr n asociado com nmente con el t rmino progresista otro grupo importante es el de los conservadores en materia religiosa pero con ideas pol ticas liberales
1326543 el anuncio de tal cosa como si anticipara la desaparici n de la derecha cristiana se ha convertido en una industria
1326544 no tendr n xito por una simple raz n la izquierda religiosa plantea a los cristianos una agenda pol tica y la derecha religiosa se trata de personas creyentes que influencian la pol tica
1326545 la izquierda religiosa no es nada m s que un nuevo envoltorio para espiritualistas no doctrinarios no representa una apelaci n v lida o genuina para la gente de fe
1326546 trabaja para promover y elegir candidatos que comparten nuestros valores a trav s de la movilizaci n de bases elevando nuestras voces en los medios de difusi n y con publicidad paga

1326550 usted sabe que algunas personas consiguen titulares en los medios de prensa atacando las creencias de candidatos a la presidencia con todas las piedras arrojadas a barak obama es dif cil saber qu creer
1326551 creo que cometimos un error al no reconocer el papel que la fe juega en la vida de las personas
1326552 informaciones falsas y enga osas sobre el historial del senador obama en varios temas fundamentales

1326585 so once again i find myself stumped looking for an easy answer when there isnt one
1326586 you need someone else to stay the night with you so that you get better rest
1326587 you are crying a lot today make sure you drink more water
1326588 youre going to have to let me take care of you
1326589 yes sir but we dont bury our patients until theyre dead
1326590 and when the night is cloudy there is still a light that shines on me
1326591 i am so sorry you are going through such a difficult time
1326592 lord grant me the serenity to accept the things i cannot change the courage to change the things i can and the wisdom to know the difference
1326593 if public sector bodies are to cut the number of printers across their organisations and reduce printing they need to invest in document management systems these systems are crucial to achieving carbon neutrality by 2012 as they replace the printing out postage and manual filing of documents with electronic processes for document creation delivery management and storage
1326594 as each printer typically emits 456 kgs of carbon dioxide each year and each tree typically absorbs 13kg of co2 per year an incredible 35 trees need to be saved from destruction every year to offset just one office printers emissions when its also considered that every financial document arriving into an organisation is typically photocopied at least once and an invoice can be photocopied up to eleven times this creates a powerful case for implementing paperless processes
1326595 the financial market turbulence continues but despite this we are strongly capitalised and our investment portfolio remains sound
1326596 the difficult market environment also creates new opportunities swiss re has the execution capability and capital strength to seize these opportunities
1326597 i think its going to be well worse than 33 per cent
1326598 if you look at the futures market its indicating a range right around between 2002 2003 levels when home ownership rates were actually higher but fewer people can qualify for a mortgage because youve got to put 20 per cent down and thats a lot of money for people
1326599 furthermore then youve got to find a bank to lend to you
1326600 those who wait for the lord will renew their strength
1326601 what we have in common is products for practices that want to grow
1326602 we find that smaller practices do want to integrate because they havent got time to spit data into different products theyre interested in how fast they can get up and running how fast you can do the basics and making it scalable so if you want to grow itll grow with you
1326603 we had committed to cch software in the uk and launched a 4 5m investment into it this helped accelerate it
1326604 myob complemented our product line and we got some great people
1326605 because were in fee protection training information and software we can deliver even more to our customers
1326606 firms are investing more and more in software to improve productivity and retain younger talent they dont want to do the drudgery but free up that resource for higher value activity people want everything now as a bundle and our job is finding those right points of integration where information and software meet
1326607 wolters kluwer know about acquisitions and this was the third one for us at myob in seven years we had the pack drill down for what we needed to do we communicated with clients and merged the sales teams very quickly so everyone has one account manager
1326608 were bringing in a lot of merged benefits and customers will have access to the full range of products were able to bring them new technology much more quickly
1326609 the process is seamless a natural transition during which everything will be supported as long as people need support we will not be dropping products and customers will get free like for like upgrades when they choose potentially all the benefits theyll get will be free
1326610 users will continue to use taxpoint until they choose they want to use the go forward product
1326611 we didnt jump on people with the message that we want to sell them more stuff but we have been communicating to users that weve got a bigger product range that already integrates which has created loads of opportunities
1326612 if theyre on taxpoint we dont change their ongoing fee competition kept us close so we knew what each other charges so we dont see any issues there
1326613 theres been a massive discussion around online bookkeeping but small businesses have indicated that they dont care whether its online or offline
1326614 they just dont want to do it what they really want is somewhere where all their invoices and paperwork can go into a magic cupboard and their accountant does it they dont want online documents they want to get rid of them
1326615 were a huge organisation with many developers and global strengths in terms of expertise and resources but we understand that local needs can differ and have a lot of respect for the customer
1326616 part of the internal integration exercise has been to bring people together across the business in product workstreams which means we can share experiences on things both sides have produced
1326617 barack obamas note was approved for publication in the international media even before he put it in the kotel wailing wall a short time after he wrote it at the king david hotel in jerusalem
1326618 obama submitted a copy of the note to media outlets when he left his hotel in jerusalem
1326619 managed the event brilliantly if deceptively getting the double benefit of appearing to be victimized by the invasive israeli press and prayer thieving jew while at the same time leaking out his humble christian plea to the lord
1326620 a relatively slick video appeared on youtube that blended obamas western wall prayer with various church scenes crosses aplenty a dove of peace and a soundtrack based on amazing grace
1326621 our forces are capable of taking over the security in all iraqi provinces within a year and a half
1326622 take over the security portfolio entirely and keep some sic multinational forces only in a supporting role
1326623 within three to six months our need for the american troops will dramatically go down
1326624 if our people return and take back this lost land its a success
1326625 if we are killed trying to do so we have received martyrdom and this will be a great success for us too
1326626 if we are thrown out of kandahar we will go to the mountains and start the guerrilla war as we did with the russians
1326627 yeah just look around you 99 percent of the people here are total hipsters
1326628 these hipster zombies are the idols of the style pages the darlings of viral marketeers and the marks of predatory real estate agents
1326629 and they must be buried for cool to be reborn
1326630 yeah i dont know you shouldnt use that word its just
1326631 no its just well if you dont know why then you just shouldnt even use it
1326632 ok so what are you girls doing tonight after this party
1326633 im dubious of these hypotheses because they always smell of an agenda
1326634 youre not some club kid in new york in the nineties this shit is so hipster
1326635 if you dont give a damn we dont give a fuck
1326636 if only we carried rocks instead of cameras wed look like revolutionaries
1326637 im trying to teach a math lesson and the heavens open
1326638 i kept thinking that it only takes one of them to wet their pants
1326639 it was my second day there and i didnt want it on my conscience but then their uniforms came up over their heads and they started dancing in the rain thats when i knew i had been had by a bunch of four and five year olds
1326640 ill never forget that sight the kids sitting at their desks with their tiny little bodies and their little workbooks and pencils in their underwear
1326641 im missing the children now because im around these boring adults all the time
1326642 every time you volunteer you feel like youve made an impact
1326643 instead of using all the paper in the world youre planting trees and replacing them instead of taking from the country youre actually giving something back i felt like i left my mark by the trees i planted i can go back in however many years time and see how theyve grown as well as going somewhere and taking in all the beautiful scenery im actually helping to make it more beautiful
1326644 all of them were absolutely amazing seeing the maraes in new zealand was fantastic in thailand theres nothing more amazing then waking up to the sound of gibbons in nepal its just the whole culture sitting on the floor eating with your hands trying to do you washing in the middle of the village with everyone watching every place has given me such an amazing set of memories
1326645 i didnt even want to live in the university dorm i never did im so un brave its unbelievable i dont know what happened i guess i just thought if i dont do it now i dont know when ill ever do it it took that leap and shocked everybody including myself and now i just feel like i could do anything
1326646 they cant quite understand why ive decided to spend all my money going around and not getting paid for things my mom was really against it at first she thought i should be out earning money like normal people but now shes really proud of me
1326647 the second time i went back they said dont you want to go somewhere else
1326648 and thats why i went back i felt like i had a responsibility to the children
1326649 after my first volunteer experience i simply couldnt go home and forget everything id seen and done
1326650 you become addicted to travel because when you have done it once you realize the world is not just the country you live in
1326651 they just want to get on with life and get on with each other theyre just trying to do the best they can with what they have it was amazing to learn the language in every country and find yourself having the same conversations with people everywhere you go in nepal we had a beauty day with the women and talked about boys
1326652 when you volunteer you will be moved by how much the people appreciate you spending time with them
1326653 a little piece of your heart a few weeks of your time will be an everlasting memory in the lives of many all i can say is do it once and im certain you will do it again
1326654 in short and simple terms we would be plunged into a depression that would make the great depression of the 1930s in which i spent my childhood look like boom times
1326655 industries would fail banks would collapse government revenues would dry up universities would have to close health care even as limited as it now is for roughly 75 million americans would virtually cease in short something like what the south suffered at the end of the civil war would plague the country
1326656 irans leaders would do well to rethink their gamble and suspend their nuclear program
1326657 barring this the best they could hope for is that israels conventional air assault will destroy their nuclear facilities
1326658 to be sure this would mean thousands of iranian casualties and international humiliation but the alternative is an iran turned into a nuclear wasteland
1326659 id love to see more young people taking action to help the poor and disadvantaged whether thats in your own backyard or anywhere in the world if you decide to choose public service as a career thats phenomenal but you can also make a big difference by volunteering two places to get started are network for good and global volunteer network
1326660 i am my friends pulling me up and making me better

1326678 this is a very significant discovery because of the terrible decline in population of these magnificent creatures to ebola and bush meat
1326679 if these new census results are confirmed they are incredibly important and exciting the kind of good news we rarely find in the conservation of highly endangered animals
1326680 far from being safe the gorillas are still under threat from ebola and hunting for bush meat we must not become complacent about this ebola can wipe out thousands in a short period of time
1326681 it is not too late for our close cousins the primates and what we have now is a challenge to turn this around

1326705 i guess jerry yang didnt come out of the meeting as unscathed as it seemed
1326706 we were surprised at the very high vote counts that were pro jerry yang
1326707 certainly the final results seemed very different from the exit polls
1326708 it seems odd that fewer shares would be voted this year compared to last when theres been such additional scrutiny on the company in the wake of the dealings with microsoft and carl icahn
1326709 the independent inspector of elections certified the results of the election and yahoo accurately announced those results
1326710 yahoo did not participate in the execution of the votes and was not a party to any errors which may have been made either by a voting institution or a proxy processing intermediary acting on behalf of banks brokers and institutions

1326722 the bjp is trying to float the idea that indian polity is bipolar and either congress led upa or bjp led nda would come to power in the parliamentary polls we want to prove that the idea is wrong
1326723 when we are working for the third front how can i talk about any new political equation but if any equation arises then we will see
1326724 the ten parties have rallied on a common platform on the issues of nuclear deal price rise and government turning institutions into political tool the future of the combination i think is optimistic
1326725 re think and reconsider their relationship with these parties and join the combination which is coming up
1326726 these are the political and social forces which can emerge as a potential force to challenge the bipolarity in our polity
1326727 once it is formed we will have a leader we will have a natural leader the biggest party will have a claim for the leadership the issue will be decided naturally

1326732 nie maj krwio erczych zamiar w wobec prezydenta lecha kaczy skiego
1326733 prezydent nigdy nie ukrywa niech ci wobec platformy ale obowi zuje nas wszystkich konstytucja obowi zuj ustawy oraz elementarna przyzwoito i zdrowy rozs dek mog uspokoi wszystkich kt rzy troszcz si o los prezydenta e ani po ani koalicja rz dowa nie maj krwio erczych zamiar w wobec prezydenta lecha kaczy skiego
1326734 jako rzecz zupe nie wyj tkowa i chyba niespotykana do tej pory
1326735 wiadomo by o e ta kohabitacja b dzie naznaczona i temperamentem poszczeg lnych polityk w i ich przywi zaniem do poszczeg lnych partii politycznych
1326736 these shelves are empty because students from the university of entropy took books off the shelf and left them on the table
1326737 public searchers are low in the pecking order but even we have people lower than us
1326738 i firmly disagree that a racial reading of chozicks story is ridiculous and i would counter that any failure on chozicks part to recognize such is just a wee bit clueless
1326739 i think that the knowledge that cia agents have used journalism as a cover puts legitimate journalists in danger
1326740 i guess jerry yang didnt come out of the meeting as unscathed as it seemed
1326741 we were surprised at the very high vote counts that were pro jerry yang
1326742 certainly the final results seemed very different from the exit polls
1326743 the independent inspector of elections certified the results of the election and yahoo accurately announced those results
1326744 yahoo did not participate in the execution of the votes and was not a party to any errors which may have been made either by a voting institution or a processing intermediary acting on behalf of banks brokers and institutions
1326745 capital research global investors asked broadridge financial to double check the votes it transmitted to yahoo on its behalf
1326746 i think jerry yang is still firmly in place until some deviation happens from the plan yahoo has set forth
1326747 these smuggling organizations have only one thing in mind that is to earn profit in total disregard for their clients
1326748 this stuff is all so cool now where can i go to get something for a girl
1326749 why would god email me at work certainly he must know that i pay way more attention to my personal email
1326750 i wonder whos bccd jesus the holy ghost dan brown
1326751 twenty thousand people show up in atlanta twenty thousand people in austin texas we had 15 000 in oakland
1326752 friends of the earth action endorsed barack obama in may in large part because he spoke out against the gas tax holiday gimmick that would have done nothing to reduce our dependence on oil
1326753 thats why its so disappointing to see obama now say he would consider expanding offshore drilling even though he knows it is not a real solution to the energy crisis that is devastating our environment and our economy
1326754 i mean at some point you can say lets compromise but you keep giving away more and more
1326755 this is like a blt sandwich with just the lettuce and tomato
1326756 theres no bacon weve got to have things that really move us away from our addiction to oil and help solve global warming this proposal doesnt get it done
1326757 once we have a new president and more forward thinking members in the house and senate we dont believe we will need a compromise on offshore drilling which will be yet another giveaway to big oil and will provide no relief for hard hit consumers
1326758 we will resist any effort to pay this ransom which george bush john mccain and big oil are demanding in exchange for the release of real investments in clean renewable energy
1326759 sen obamas plan will put america on the path to a clean energy future because it prioritizes efforts that will benefit working families instead of the outdated fossil fuel industries
1326760 sen obama supports creating millions of jobs by investing in the cleanest cheapest and fastest technologies to meet our energy needs and stimulate our economy
1326761 the short term problem is that americans are really hurting on gas prices
1326762 it would just be really foolish of us to be completely ignorant of that fact releasing oil from the reserve would hopefully take some of the pressure off the folks who are feeling pressure who dont want to be for drilling but theyre not sure that they have a choice at this point because of public demand
1326763 congress never makes good policy decisions in the heat of a crisis
1326764 there is no doubt that current oil prices incorporate a substantial political risk premium
1326765 every time bush threatens iran by saying that all options are on the table including the military one oil spikes
1326766 prices would go a lot higher and stay there too if the market really believed that an attack on iran were imminent
1326767 when i have a job a relationship a child whatever it is for you well then ill really be happy
1326768 why are you so happy youve just had an operation you must be on the best drugs
1326769 oh no im not on any drugs im going to heal so much quicker in good spirits
1326770 be who you are fully and completely and you can do and have whatever you want
1326771 be sure to take all knives and bombs with you
1326772 live a good life so the preacher wont have to lie at your funeral
1326773 we believe in america the land of beautiful roads the land of beautiful bikes the land of ice cold beer and a land of beautiful women
1326774 dont change for politicians dont change for the press dont change cause your momma or your wife or your daughter wants you to change because you are the real americans
1326775 ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
1326776 i want us to come home from iraq with victory and honor
1326777 america will remain the last best hope for man on earth
1326778 i want to see a lot of bikes parked outside the polling places of america
1326779 the term used in the letter outlining the agreement is initially and certainly theres absolutely no reason if sinn fein have the mandate why leaving aside this arrangement that as a principle we have the entitlement if we have the mandate to any departmental responsibility
1326780 what we were trying to do in a sensible way was to deal with what are expressed as unionist concerns there are also nationalist and republican concerns i mean can you image a dup justice minister
1326781 so theres a trade off here in a sensible way trying to deal with the sensitivities of the issue
1326782 the united states made sacrifices for south korea during the korean war and helped us live well
1326783 the united states is not our enemy without the u s we will die
1326784 i dont have anti u s sentiment im just anti bush and anti lee myung bak
1326785 were at a very critical moment now for the north korean government to make a decision as to whether or not theyre going to verify what they said they would do
1326786 its one thing to say it but i think its going to be very important for them to understand that we expect them to show us
1326787 obviously wed like to see a greater role for south koreans in afghanistan if the south korean people are willing to move in that direction
1326788 about a year ago people thought iraq was lost and hopeless
1326789 people were saying lets get out of there it doesnt matter to our national security
1326790 iraq has changed a lot thanks to the bravery of people in this hangar and the bravery of troops all across our country the terrorists are on the run the terrorists will be denied a safe haven and freedom is on the march and as a result our children are more likely to grow up in a peaceful world
1326791 and my hope is of course that as they have their security in place that theyre mindful of the spirit of the games and that if there is a provocation they handle it in a responsible way without violence
1326792 i love the art of hip hop i dont always love the message of hip hop
1326793 there are times where even with the artists i love you know theres a message that is not only sometimes degrading to women not only uses the n word a little too frequently but also something im really concerned about its always talking about material things
1326794 while ludacris is a talented individual he should be ashamed of these lyrics
1326795 we tried to look for ideas in every choice that we make in our homes hoping that everyone who goes through it will be inspired to make some change on some level
1326796 some people will walk away and want to do an entire new home or some people will think when they go for their towels next and go for organic linens
1326797 it is happening but the industry needs to do a better job of getting information into peoples hands when theyre looking for it
1326798 i like not making a negative impact on the earth
1326799 its got so much to be said for it because it uses nature and natural materials
1326800 its open you bring the outside in and you can even bring the inside out its a house built for humans its plausible in real life
1326801 the impression that green building has to be modern weird solar ugly
1326802 one of the things thats fundamental to green building is that it can look like anything it can be a regular craftsman house or a cape cod house in new england or an adobe house in santa fe you dont have to change what the home looks like to make it green
1326803 but we hope people will make informed decisions when theyre building when theyre renovating
1326804 once i can see in real time how my behavior translates to my usage i can make changes
1326805 if youre very clever if youre a do it yourself kind of person you can do one room at a time and achieve your ultimate goal
1326806 its no longer a question if people want to go green or not they do
1326807 the london bred estelle said during her set at merriweather post pavilion on saturday night
1326808 i say no im broke i get paid in dollars
1326809 it remains unknown however if higher body fat levels are actually the cause of better outcomes in patients with heart failure
1326810 we believe there is a need for prospective studies to confirm these findings and elucidate potential mechanisms
1326811 it is very very important to put these people on trial as an example to other dictators you cannot abuse people this way and get away with it even 30 years later
1326812 economic growth closely depends on the interaction between new knowledge and a countrys ability to learn
1326813 the handing over of idle land to those who want to make it productive
1326814 when i spoke to him at the scene he was very aware of what he was doing and why
1326815 there is another route to the shop using more minor roads hed been the other way before and said he found it too slow so decided to go on the a27 it probably wasnt the best option
1326816 we advised him very strongly not to go on such a main road again but it remains to be seen what hell do
1326817 i guess jerry yang didnt come out of the meeting as unscathed as it seemed
1326818 we were surprised at the very high vote counts that were pro jerry yang
1326819 certainly the final results seemed very different from the exit polls
1326820 the independent inspector of elections certified the results of the election and yahoo accurately announced those results
1326821 yahoo did not participate in the execution of the votes and was not a party to any errors which may have been made either by a voting institution or a processing intermediary acting on behalf of banks brokers and institutions
1326822 capital research global investors asked broadridge financial to double check the votes it transmitted to yahoo on its behalf
1326823 i think jerry yang is still firmly in place until some deviation happens from the plan yahoo has set forth
1326824 dealing clearly with participants in illegal activities aimed at inciting the division of nationalities such as shouting reactionary slogans distributing reactionary writings flying and popularizing the snow lion flag and holding illegal demonstrations
1326825 the sky above tibet will never change the red five star flag will always fly above this land we can definitely smash the separatist plot of the dalai lama clique completely

1326828 the money of the state shall not be given or loaned to or in aid of any private corporation or association or private undertaking
1326829 for some time it has been the practice of the state to openly notoriously and proudly give away state funds for economic development and other unauthorized purposes
1326830 high taxes enormous debt a rising deficit economic stagnation and a state government dominated by special interest groups and oblivious to the interest of the people as a whole

1326844 the main factor weighing on oil prices is worries about oil consumption being weakened especially in the u s
1326845 sometimes the focus of the market can shift and at this point its focused on some of the areas of weakness in demand
1326846 but some of the issues that caused oil prices to lift have not yet been resolved

1326858 good at times and other times he has to learn things
1326859 hes never done it before so hes learning i think its different for him taking on guards sometimes at that type level hes used to second level sort of situations where he has a little bit more space surprisingly hes accepted it all and hes done a good job of it doing the best he can out there hes still with the first group working hard and i think its different for seeing him in there a 20 number there and a smaller body but hes getting the job done
1326860 hes coming i think the biggest thing is just his attitude
1326861 hes willing to learn hes willing to learn and hes asking questions and you can see the ability he has out here hes running and hitting and physical at times i think what im most impressed about is just his attitude and just his willingness to accept this system
1326862 i cant turn around in the middle of the play tell them what to do thats their area back there
1326863 so they are going to have to get the job done themselves i think they have been so far we havent played any games yet but i think the learning curve is something they have accepted and they know its difficult jonathan wilhite brandon meriweather has taken a more vocal role this year hes communicating out there
1326864 the united states made sacrifices for south korea during the korean war and helped us live well
1326865 the united states is not our enemy without the u s we will die
1326866 i dont have anti u s sentiment im just anti bush and anti lee myung bak
1326867 were at a very critical moment now for the north korean government to make a decision as to whether or not theyre going to verify what they said they would do
1326868 its one thing to say it but i think its going to be very important for them to understand that we expect them to show us
1326869 obviously wed like to see a greater role for south koreans in afghanistan if the south korean people are willing to move in that direction
1326870 about a year ago people thought iraq was lost and hopeless
1326871 people were saying lets get out of there it doesnt matter to our national security
1326872 iraq has changed a lot thanks to the bravery of people in this hangar and the bravery of troops all across our country the terrorists are on the run the terrorists will be denied a safe haven and freedom is on the march and as a result our children are more likely to grow up in a peaceful world
1326873 and my hope is of course that as they have their security in place that theyre mindful of the spirit of the games and that if there is a provocation they handle it in a responsible way without violence
1326874 it is written if we rely upon mother tara sincerely and with strong faith she will protect us from all obstacles and fulfill all our wishes since she is a wisdom buddha and since she is a manifestation of the completely purified wind element tara is able to help us very quickly i hope been carving a lot lately even brought out the vulcan simulator and surfed the lawn as my wife calls it possibly a little wind up here tomorrow better days are coming
1326875 we couldnt get any tickets but we want to feel the atmosphere here
1326876 china is reforming and opening up to build a harmonious society
1326877 im fed up with being a prawn i wish i was a shark then i wouldnt have any worries about being eaten
1326878 hes at home still distraught that his best friend changed sides to the enemy amp became a shark
1326879 no way man youll eat me youre now a shark the enemy and ill not be tricked into being your dinner
1326880 no im not that was the old me ive changed
1326881 overall i would say it is a satisfying performance given the environment
1326882 the sentiment is more bearish now than before as concern over slower u s economic growth is impeaching demand
1326883 we do expect oil prices to trend lower in the longer term
1326884 north shore city is not somewhere people automatically associate with debt family crisis and homelessness but sadly more and more families are affected
1326885 their plight is very hard to witness like the young mum five months pregnant and living in a car with her young son because she had to flee from a violent partner or the family living in a garage because they had no money
1326886 families become homeless for all sorts of reasons and de paul house is there to help them back on the road to a sustainable future
1326887 we are asking everyone on the north shore to hold a take five morning tea between september 23 and 29 so we can make sure our work can continue
1326888 our nation has come to expect the federal reserve to step in to avert events that pose unacceptable systemic risk
1326889 has neither the clear statutory authority nor the mandate to anticipate and deal with risks across our entire financial system
1326890 we should quickly consider how to appropriately give the fed the authority to access necessary information from highly complex financial institutions and the responsibility to intervene in order to protect the system
1326891 so they can carry out the role our nation has come to expect
1326892 we must limit the perception that some institutions are either too big to fail or too interconnected to fail
1326893 if we are to do that credibly we must address the reality that some are
1326894 the bad news is it was expectations of a slower global economy that drove prices lower
1326895 the latest pmi data signaled that the global service sector took a turn for the worse in june with activity and new business declining for the first time in five months and leading to further job losses
1326896 theres a lot of emotion theres a lot of huge volatility and its kind of challenging to figure out how to play here or how to sort through all the emotion if you will and the psychology
1326897 facing the music the fiscal outlook at the end of the bush administration
1326898 the government is making promises to people right now it knows it cant keep and you have some candidates piling more promises on top which are clearly unfulfillable
1326899 its worse because there are a huge number of crises out there that are going to confront the new president
1326900 were looking at a 400 billion deficit this year with the economy in recession or near recession the likelihood is that its going to get worse and the fundamental problem has been that theres very little willpower by republicans or democrats to confront the issue
1326901 fannie mae and freddie mac play a central role in our housing finance system and must continue to do so in their current form as shareholder owned companies
1326902 is important to maintaining confidence and stability in our financial system and our financial markets
1326903 whether for good or for bad its going to happen eventually because the sec is being overcome by a tsunami of globalization
1326904 they say they dont want to hire teenagers they think we arent as responsible
1326905 not all kids want to work but when kids cant find work they stop looking
1326906 the kids who need work the most are getting it the least there are a large number of kids unemployed and underemployed because there are simply not enough jobs for them
1326907 and a comparatively hairless manny ramirez was still unhappy albeit in cleveland
1326908 these developments demonstrated that there had been impairment of a broad range of financial markets
1326909 i really dont think that anything washington does is going to significantly affect chinas domestic energy policies
1326910 china will choose to subsidize or not subsidize fuels because of how it sees chinas own economic and energy interests
1326911 the currency is certainly an important issue but its not just about the currency this time
1326912 the united states and china dont always agree on economic issues
1326913 sometimes we may disagree quite strongly but we keep talking
1326914 when conflicts or problems arise we need to solve them through dialogue and communication and improve mutual understanding to avoid complicating and politicizing economic and trade issues
1326915 weve been asking them to adopt our policies in terms of exchange rates financial deregulation and everything else to follow our model rather than selectively deciding what fits our mutual interests and pursuing that
1326916 if my client is wondering if a pair of socks made in medellin will make it to the u s duty free this time next year they will just go to central america
1326917 this year our focus has been on the olympic games we have been busy organising the olympic games quest for schools so there was no time for other activity but we generally associate ourselves with activities that promote sports it has a very positive fallout
1326918 which indian viceroys son known as neville took part in the london olympic games in 1908
1326919 gay men are what straight men would act like if they didnt want vagina
1326920 he would play this baseball video game and say you know dad your stuffs not very good
1326921 he asked why are the yankees always so good every video game we get theyve got the best team i explained to him that they spend a lot of money on players if a player is really good they try to trade for him usually they have kind of an all star team
1326922 about two months later i was signing autographs he said dead serious why would anyone want your autograph he said youre not any good youre just average
1326923 i said ive been pitching in the big leagues about 10 years ive done this and that he said dad if you were any good the yankees would have traded for you
1326924 the u m players always have said how much they enjoy heroes for kids and the strength and conditioning coach mike barwis said he wants to work with us on this next year
1326925 but this workout is mandatory and all players must attend its coach rods call on that this is his first year at u m and hes doing everything he can to make sure his team is successful
1326926 depressing in there as well becoming the first al pitcher to reach 15 wins lee has won exactly 30 6 percent of the 49 games that the tribe has managed to come out on top arizonas brandon webb 15 4 for comparison purposes has been responsible for 26 3 percent of his teams wins amazing
1326927 its essentially a race between the attackers and the protectors
1326928 give a head start to software providers delivering security features to our mutual customers
1326929 it will save vendors the work of reverse engineering the patch and identifying where the vulnerability is and what triggers the exploitability
1326930 the goal is to give it to them so they can have updates available as close to 10 a m as possible
1326931 besides there are more important things going on like the upcoming presidential election get out and vote it would be great to see history made this time around like seeing americas first african american president go obama
1326932 i believe that politics and sports shouldnt mix and it is best for the politicians to work out these types of issues
1326933 im not so far into it i dont feel i need to be hands on into it
1326934 im giving the maximum donation to obama then it might have been hypocritical this wasnt an announcement it was a reporter doing his job and kpd i think you are simply looking for an argument if you believe that article was in any way slanted towards either of the candidates
1326935 barack obama is the kindest bravest warmest most wonderful human being ive ever known in my life
1326936 boy he can put up a triple double at will im going to vote the way he votes
1326937 as a washington wizards fan theres no way ill ever vote for anyone that lbj would consider
1326938 i believe that politics and sports shouldnt mix and it is best for the politicians to work out these types of issues but if sports can create awareness and shed light on this issue then thats a good thing
1326939 i didnt sign the letter right then and there so now its blown up
1326940 no one heard my side of the story but automatically its lebron didnt sign the letter he doesnt care but for me to try to create awareness of the situation thats going on in darfur and other places for me in the position i am i should speak on it and i am gonna speak on it
1326941 at the end of the day were talking about human rights
1326942 and people should understand that human rights and peoples lives are in jeopardy were not talking about contracts here were not talking about money were talking about peoples lives being lost and that means a lot more to me than some money or a contract
1326943 inflation is still an issue and certainly the first half of the year was a big burden on consumer spending
1326944 consumers appear to be acting rationally in a very uncertain economic environment
1326945 i think the industry should be very concerned anything that impacts the spending power of consumers clearly impacts our industry
1326946 each and every one of the core conclusions of the oig opr report is consistent with and indeed derived from ms goodlings testimony before the house judiciary committee
1326947 you get less house and property for the same price but were willing to make that sacrifice to save on gas prices and commuting costs
1326948 there is a whole confluence of government policies tax spending regulatory and administrative that have subsidized sprawl
1326949 we have been calling continually for greater transparency in the energy futures markets and anything short of full disclosure to the general public fails to meet the definition of transparency
1326950 we understand the need for cftc to process the data it is collecting but it is imperative to share that data with the american public with the utmost speed
1326951 the agency has always been and continues to be committed to market integrity and to market transparency
1326952 include recommendations for improved practices and controls should they be required

1327530 i think those who want to be kept in the dark on the rest will have to work very hard to avoid knowing whats happened because information is so much more pervasive news is everywhere and were not even aware were getting it some of the time
1327531 its on the home page of your computer in your e mail on your mobile phone in elevators on top of taxi cabs on billboards and the sides of buildings you think youre watching a show that has no connection to the olympics and information will scroll across the bottom of the screen we pick up a lot of information through osmosis and i think the only time youre truly aware of just how much is when youre trying to avoid it
1327532 its live on the east coast and in the central time zone which is roughly 81 to 82 percent of all the households in the united states
1327533 historically we have always shown the olympics on tape on the west coast and the majority of viewers have repeatedly told us that the vast majority of them well in excess of 80 percent want to see the olympics when theyre available to see the olympics

1327544 about a year ago people thought iraq was lost and hopeless
1327545 people were saying lets get out of there it doesnt matter to our national security
1327546 iraq has changed a lot thanks to the bravery of people in this hangar and the bravery of troops all across our country the terrorists are on the run the terrorists will be denied a safe haven and freedom is on the march and as a result our children are more likely to grow up in a peaceful world
1327547 and my hope is of course that as they have their security in place that theyre mindful of the spirit of the games and that if there is a provocation they handle it in a responsible way without violence

1327558 here is what you must understand from the time the word goes out to rebuild jerusalem until the coming of the anointed leader there will be seven sevens

1327560 so when you see standing in the holy place the abomination that causes desolation spoken of through the prophet daniel let the reader understand then let those who are in judea flee to the mountains let no one on the roof of his house go down to take anything out of the house

1327817 i respect that theyre here and spent a lot on their homes but on the other hand give me a little bit too

1327823 im pleased to be able to welcome lpr to the tour of britain and am sure that their inclusion will benefit the race as both petacchi and di luca are more than capable of winning stages and possibly the overall too
1327824 like everyone else im also excited by the prospect of seeing alessandro petacchi going head to head with mark cavendish in the sprints which should make each days stage finish unmissable
1327825 having lpr ride the tour of britain adds to what was already a great line up of teams and riders which im sure will make this years race the best yet
1327826 they said that the current low rate the 10 percent bracket for low income americans would have to go up to 25 percent the middle income tax rate for middle income americans would have to go up to 66 percent and the top rate which is what small businesses pay would have to go to 88 percent
1327827 most dangerous and urgent threats this nation has ever faced
1327828 the gas prices that are wiping out your pay cheques and straining businesses to the jobs that are disappearing from this state
1327829 it includes a limited amount of new offshore drilling and while i still dont believe thats a particularly meaningful short term or long term solution i am willing to consider it if its necessary to actually pass a comprehensive plan
1327830 i am not interested in making the perfect the enemy of the good particularly since there is so much good in this compromise that would actually reduce our dependence on foreign oil

1327839 it seems that the market is losing interest in geopolitical and weather induced props and instead is becoming more aware of growing supply demand imbalances

1327865 the arrest of some fatah elements in gaza took place in the context of an investigation into a murderous crime that killed six innocent people but fatahs arrests of hamas supporters and other palestinian citizens were politically motivated and meant to serve the interests of the israeli occupation

1327873 since i was a child i wanted to make an object as something tangible to which people can relate and use painting as a space for depicting those objects
1327874 its about time we are able to adequately exhibit art on line the basic jpg is not a great representation of a painting weve worked long and hard to find a suitable technology to properly present paintings and we believe weve found the perfect answer
1327875 it is important that jpgs are able to be represented in a manner and fashion that allows users to inspect the work at close range and at multiple angles it is also extremely important that the user experience appears seamless that the work can be viewed through a standard browser utilizing commonplace technologies weve been able to achieve both objectives no extraordinary applications or downloads are required just the standard flash enabled browser which is basically any and all of them
1327876 but the technology is only a platform to represent the content

1327901 estrogen treatment is a promising new area for future treatment of schizophrenia and potentially for other severe mental illnesses
1327902 given the acute nature of adjunctive estradiol as a treatment we can only speculate that the antipsychotic effects of estradiol would not be lasting
1327903 future studies could investigate a longer treatment period with estradiol as well as longer term follow up to determine whether the therapeutic effects may be lasting

1327930 as the fight against aids nears the end of its third decade we are still facing a huge shortfall in resources
1327931 the responses to hiv and aids require long term and sustained financing as more people go on treatment and live longer budgets will have to increase considerably over the next few decades in the most affected countries donors will have to provide the majority of the funding
1327932 we dare not let down our guard this is an unforgiving epidemic
1327933 we are going to be in this for the long haul
1327934 every day almost three times as many people become newly infected with hiv as those who start taking antiretroviral therapy

1327943 no secret deal or accommodation kept us out of the city
1327944 as 90 percent of the attacks were against us we thought if we moved out we would remove the source of the problem
1327945 but actually the jaish al mahdi the mahdi army had been fighting us because we were the only obstacle to their total control
1327946 there was no structure in place in the city for units to go back in and start mentoring the iraqi troops
1327947 when the action was launched british forces provided a raft of military support including armor artillery airpower medical and logistic support
1327948 what happened in basra nasiriyah amarah and other areas falls on the shoulders of the british forces
1327949 basra is considered the economic capital of iraq but the british let the militias do what they wanted

1327954 were at a very critical moment now for the north korean government to make a decision as to whether or not theyre going to verify what they said they would do
1327955 its one thing to say it but i think its going to be very important for them to understand that we expect them to show us
1327956 obviously wed like to see a greater role for south koreans in afghanistan if the south korean people are willing to move in that direction
1327957 about a year ago people thought iraq was lost and hopeless
1327958 people were saying lets get out of there it doesnt matter to our national security
1327959 iraq has changed a lot thanks to the bravery of people in this hangar and the bravery of troops all across our country the terrorists are on the run the terrorists will be denied a safe haven and freedom is on the march and as a result our children are more likely to grow up in a peaceful world
1327960 and my hope is of course that as they have their security in place that theyre mindful of the spirit of the games and that if there is a provocation they handle it in a responsible way without violence

1328015 poo and pee dominated a public hearing monday on a new law that prohibits people from carrying certain items if they intend to use them for nefarious purposes
1328016 the law crafted in advance of the democratic national convention was adopted unanimously by the city council
1328017 representatives from some of the groups planning large scale protests during the dnc this month said the ordinance was unnecessary and accused city officials of fear mongering
1328018 they want to distract people from talking about the real issues
1328019 this is a very respectful campaign i dont think our campaign is negative in the slightest

1328021 sen obama told the american people what he thought you wanted to hear i told you the truth
1328022 what sen mccain neglected to mention was that during those 30 years he was in washington for 26 of them and in all that time he did little to reduce our dependence on foreign oil
1328023 after years of inaction and in the face of public frustration over rising gas prices
1328024 we simply cannot pretend as sen mccain does that we can drill our way out of this problem
1328025 make no mistake the oil companies have placed their bet on sen mccain and if he wins they will continue to cash in while our families and our economy suffer and our future is put in jeopardy

1328031 is a political initiative meant to satisfy conservatives in congress who have played to fears about all immigrants being terrorists criminals and living off the dole
1328032 we have no idea to what extent we can enforce our own laws
1328033 the consequences of an open border are smuggling of drugs and human beings into this country
1328034 intensified and mixed anti immigrant racist views with a law enforcement only approach towards immigration
1328035 the main immigration flow has not stopped coming it just shifted
1328036 in other words the same number or more people are crossing the border
1328037 the wall is symptomatic of the fact that the us is not responsive to a rational immigration policy

1328056 its about time we are able to adequately exhibit art on line the basic jpg is not a great representation of a painting weve worked long and hard to find a suitable technology to properly present paintings and we believe weve found the perfect answer
1328057 it is important that jpgs are able to be represented in a manner and fashion that allows users to inspect the work at close range and at multiple angles it is also extremely important that the user experience appears seamless that the work can be viewed through a standard browser utilizing commonplace technologies weve been able to achieve both objectives no extraordinary applications or downloads are required just the standard flash enabled browser which is basically any and all of them
1328058 but the technology is only a platform to represent the content

1328171 sar certamente un impegno durissimo soprattutto per il fattore ambientale questa societ molto amata e seguita in albania quindi il napoli si trover ad affrontare una formazione con degli stimoli incredibili soprattutto perch lorganico composto da moltissimi giovani ed avranno fame di calcio internazionale e sbagliato sottovalutare questo impegno un errore che la nostra squadra non dovr sicuramente commettere lapproccio alla gara diventer fondamentale la storia recente ci insegna che anche squadre meno blasonate sulla carta ti possono impensierire tipo il panionios squadra certamente meno dotata tecnicamente del napoli ma che poi ci ha creato parecchi problemi soprattutto in trasferta per la nostra formazione sar molto importante questo match soprattutto per i pi giovani della rosa che dovranno abituarsi a partite di grande livello capiter in futuro di affrontare squadre pi blasonate e pi attrezzate quindi bisogna farsi trovare preparati ad affrontare qualsiasi situazione ln definitiva il match contro il vllaznia dovr essere trattato con la massima attenzione e non preso sottogamba
1328172 il direttore marino ha rinforzato i reparti dove la squadra riscontrava parecchie difficolt nella scorsa stagione quindi gli acquisti sono stati mirati e soprattutto sono arrivati giocatori di qualit

1328174 certamente sono tre giocatori di grandissimo valore ma io ci starei molto attento ai paragoni anche perch in tutto questo ce un maradona di mezzo e poi giordano e carnevale sono giocatori unici non paragonabili a nessun altro in questo momento

1328180 the combination of both products offers ardene a modern efficient solution useful in todays national retail market installing and using axis network cameras properly is a very powerful added value to any large company we believe ardene chose the right product to do the job
1328181 because of our companys rapid growth rate we urgently needed to put a security system in place in our stores to reduce shrink
1328182 our primary reason for video surveillance is to make the potential shoplifter think twice before stealing in addition the surveillance system offers employees a sense of security knowing that if something were to happen in the store it would be caught on tape and proper action would be taken beyond loss prevention and security we plan to use the system for merchandising marketing staffing etc in fact we believe that most departments can benefit from our surveillance system
1328183 ardene is truly a forward thinking retailer and we are delighted it is using our network cameras for preventing thefts as well as other creative applications such as merchandising and marketing
1328184 we are pleased that its experience has been excellent so far and expect ardene to find similar success as it completes a company wide rollout

1328300 if you want to do business in china jack perkowski is your man in managing the dragon he takes you into the heart of the middle kingdom and shows you the way with insight humor and the kind of practical advice an entrepreneur or a down home tourist needs to navigate this fascinating and often bewildering colossus of a country
1328301 ive just finished managing the dragon which i thought was fantastic i was riveted by it i cannot believe what jack perkowski has accomplished and what an adventure hes had how he lived through it how he has succeeded and how well written his book is it reads somewhere between a novel a how to book and primer on a second business life in a developing country
1328302 i love jack perkowskis book it tells with some bravado and lots of humility the first hand story of a man who dared himself to move to china to seize upon the greatest economic boom of our age perkowski invites us into his world into the blur of business meetings and friendships hirings firings and onto chinas shop floors he reveals what it took to build a world class manufacturing company in a country that like perkowski himself needed to set firm goals but reach them in an environment where the rules and circles of influence shift daily managing the dragon is more than a manual more than a memoir it is a gift from a seasoned friend offering the keys to his wisdom and experience
1328303 managing the dragon is more than a great story about jack perkowski and his courage to move to the new frontier it is a graduate degree in the trials tribulations and successes of starting from scratch in china jack captures the essence of doing business in china and turns it into a very compelling how to guide my experiences in china over the last 14 years validate the accuracy of jack perceptions managing the dragon is superb and will be a must read for any borgwarner executive involved with china

1328429 the commencement of this clinical trial caps six years of international collaborations with world renowned experts working on the development of a new treatment for ra
1328430 this body of work presented over the years at numerous international meetings and published in peer reviewed journals clearly documents the remarkable activity of triolex across several animal models of ra each emphasizing different aspects of the pathophysiology thought to drive the human disease we are particularly excited to begin this trial because triolex without being immune suppressive has consistently performed as well or better than the biologics in these models and works where methotrexate fails
1328431 advancing triolex into rheumatoid arthritis patients represents years of preclinical studies that produced consistently impressive results
1328432 we believe a big breakthrough in medicine would be to deliver a pharmaceutical that has the ability to regulate unproductive inflammation without the side effects of currently approved anti inflammatories given its biochemical structure and signaling pathways triolex potentially represents such a breakthrough product triolex is a stabilized synthetic analog of a naturally occurring molecule metabolized by the body from dehydroepiandrosterone dhea and whose role in nature we believe is to regulate stress inflammatory responses to maintain homeostasis translating our preclinical data into human clinical trials would be a major triumph in our efforts to develop a novel therapy for patients suffering from ra we look forward to a possible renaissance in the use of smarter safer steroid hormones to treat diseases of inflammation and autoimmunity as well as other conditions associated with aging

1328441 it is quite easy to found a community there are always plenty of courageous people who want to be heroes the problem is not in getting the community started theres always enough energy to take off the problem comes when we are in orbit and going round and round the same circuit the problem is in living with brothers and sisters whom we have not chosen but who have been given to us and in working ever more truthfully towards the goals of the community a community which is just an explosion of heroism is not a true community true community implies a way of living and seeing reality it implies above all fidelity in the daily round and this is made up of simple things getting meals using and washing the dishes and using them again going to meetings as well as gifts joy and celebration a community is only being created when its members accept that they are not going to achieve great things that they are not going to be heroes but simply live each day with new hope like children in wonderment as the sun rises and in thanksgiving as it sets

1328547 this is why when we talk about the 4 step plan to success i emphasize the 3rd step your mind tightly closed to all negative influence those negative influences can come from places you least expect friends family and acquaintances many others have a three step plan and do not include this step but i feel that it is as important if not the most important of the steps it is definitely a step that can trip you up most easily as we have become accustomed to listening to the opinions of others especially where friends and family are concerned

1328564 how younger journalists can shape the future of news and storytelling
1328565 it seems fitting to address the terms of engagement under which members of my generation experience information consumption we are coming to professional and personal fruition with the mentality that news is a collective conversation on multimedia platforms not just what i like to call brussel sprouts journalism where an editor at a desk serves up content they think we should read even if we dont want it
1328566 for now people can send comments by e mail and we will post them at end of carberrys column or in separate piece
1328567 we have done and do some hyperlinking but it is extremely cumbersome with our current technology and we lost a full online editor position a few months ago we will be doing more hyperlinking in future and then much more when technology changes

1328578 the idea was to take the letter to habbush and have him transcribe it in his own neat handwriting on a piece of iraqi government stationery to make it look legitimate cia would then take the finished product to baghdad and have someone release it to the media
1328579 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from the cia ever involved in any such effort
1328580 the cia resisted efforts on the part of some in the administration to paint a picture of iraqi al qaeda connections that went beyond the evidence the notion that i would suddenly reverse our stance and have created and planted false evidence that was contrary to our own beliefs is ridiculous

1328724 there is a strong need for collaboration as the organisation is split across 110 countries and each of the 12 regions produces similar projects and products
1328725 the drawback was there was no consolidated space to look at how a project was delivered
1328726 there were storage problems and repetition of information and it was difficult to see what was going on or to share ideas
1328727 user feedback on version 2003 showed it was not a polished product in terms of usability version 2007 fits well with our intranet and it is scalable with electronic records management features we can use in the future
1328728 we learned lessons along the way which fed back into each successive rollout users are very happy as time and effort in completing projects has been reduced and travel cut through digital meetings
1328729 if a collaborative space is not being used effectively it is closed to encourage good practice a project manager can have a new space if they want one
1328730 achieving a unified communications approach is a big driver so there is one place to go to find out what colleagues are doing
1328731 we are also looking to open sharepoint server for collaboration with our partners
1328732 the project cost 750 000 over two years roughly split as 375 000 per year even in this early stage we have started to see positive evidence on our return on investment with reduced travel quicker turnaround of information and better development of larger scale projects
1328733 when it comes to collaboration technologies it needs to take off the brakes and put its foot on the gas
1328734 collaborative technologies such as web 2 0 will happen and if the cio tries to impose a terribly prescriptive strategy he or she will be out of a job
1328735 you have to partner with the business and be able to demonstrate that you can accomplish collaboration better than anyone else and come up with new ideas for technology which are useful
1328736 collaboration is either in your blood or not and it is in mine
1328737 we are using collaboration technologies for effective engagement with our client base recruitment base and internally to talk to each other without having to worry about the distances between us innovation is encouraged within the is amp t department and people are trying out new toys which can be turned into something useful for the business
1328738 many employees would not bother reading helpdesk emails informing them that the server will be down for a time but then they phone up the helpdesk to complain about the downtime we look for ways to be more effective in getting information across and stopping the rubbish coming through
1328739 our rss feeds allow anyone to subscribe to our job advertising and last month 10 per cent of the job applications to our uk web site came directly from our uk rss job feed
1328740 it is a very cheap high availability method of getting information to people who want to receive it they have to subscribe so it means we are not spamming we use feedburner to manage rss feeds but there are many different products available and it is simple to do
1328741 blogs are our window to the world and a method of getting our message across
1328742 they have ensured that harvey nash is not a passive business by steering the company towards becoming thought leaders and almost a news channel
1328743 we measure all traffic that comes through the web site to demonstrate in pounds the value to the business executives can then see where something is working and we can suggest improvements such as using key words in blogs to improve search engine positioning
1328744 if you are starting out you could consider a hosted service and localised technology

1328792 we expect oversupply to hit dubai in 2009 leading to a period of price declines
1328793 while we expect these price declines to be limited to dubai given the level of undersupply in surrounding markets we cannot rule out a contagion effect on middle east north africa property shares prices as investor confidence suffers
1328794 prices have been driven by a combination of genuine demand speculation and most recently escalating construction costs

1328819 once customers are at your web site make it easy for them to navigate ask every single employee to spend time at the companys web site and then take all their feedback and improve what customers are experiencing
1328820 blogs are extremely important to monitor because they are opinionated conversations being conducted its almost overwhelming but monitoring helps
1328821 i nternal measurements may provide a sense of how the business operates but they dont give a true evaluation of customer experience which is companies should implement letting customer input drive priorities decisions and investments

1328849 satcom scientific not only brings us a contract with this near term revenue but also increases valcoms international broadcast presence

1328851 it will be a pleasure to work with such a dynamic broadcaster as buddy winsett
1328852 with the support of vince vellardita and the talented team at valcom our growth potential will be enhanced significantly
1328853 which you rightly figured out has to do something with renting cars it might be a good idea to go inside and ask for details
1328854 i viewed the body on the morning after the hue and cry was raised in the presence of mayor masters and the town bailiffs i am standing on the spot where it lay the site of the burned cloth hall i viewed it clothed and unclothed it was partly burned but i am sure it was killed by the wound i observed in the throat the wound measured a full palms width from side to side and was caused by a knife which if found is therefore forfeit to the royal person and his officers that is me
1328855 and indeed there is no doubt in my mind that the fire could not have caused the death
1328856 after viewing the body i gave orders for it to be interred outside the town so that its vapours could give rise to no danger of the pestilence returning through it
1328857 first i must ask you if the death was felonious was the death felonious
1328858 im a coroner not a sheriff my concern is with the death whether it was felonious or not not with the fire or anything to do with the cloth youll have to wait to present other complaints to the eyre justices
1328859 very good thank you now to my second question was this felonious death from what you already know and what ive told you murder or did the body die by its own hand
1328860 very good now the first part of the inquest is over and we can proceed to the guild chamber for the rest
1328861 i have absolved you or you are absolving yourself through your penance
1328862 i heard that you could not hear mass at your usual time
1328863 its not part of my instructions to him that he should leave you ill have him obey from now on but still my dear you look well
1328864 im glad you look well i was afraid that your burden was making you waste away
1328865 i hope the inquest went well if the town is happy with it and the matters ended therell be less disturbance from them they might even stop trying to fill their empty houses with men from our land if my lord of lancaster took away their charter thered be no problems like murder or burning theyd be under my control if they were under me theyd obey
1328866 its bad enough the country people moving around from place to place as it is if a man can pay half a penny more for labour they all flock to him and other men lose all their tenants ive had troopers out to madeley and apedale this morning and they came back to say that half the men left have gone down towards trentham for better work if half of england had fallen in the sea at the end of the pestilence all would be well as it is well see two empty parishes for every one the death emptied the land will be full of godless lawbreakers they need to obey properly as they did before the death
1328867 im sorry my love but the duke gave me duties as you know you have seen the sheets of parchment he sends me day after day as though im no castle sergeant but a clerk im honour bound to heed what he says
1328868 i hope that the friar that came yesterday brought you some comfort
1328869 i had a few words with him myself he seems a good fellow for all hes in league with the town
1328870 of course i would like to speak to him again its really a matter of whether the town will let him out of their clutches except in time of war theyre only beholden to us to pay the fee farm rent for their charter mores the pity if i were my lord of lancaster id petition the king to have that charter revoked bring that town back under my rule under the castle then wed be sure of keeping some of the countrymen in their parishes as my lord keeps asking of me as though im not trying with all their trade the burgesses are like ticks sucking away at the land they need to learn obedience
1328871 but theyve suffered hard even after the death you know that none better than yourself save god
1328872 and you make war on them by sending your troopers out into the villages to hurt their trade even more than its hurt already
1328873 the arctic may hold 90 billion barrels of oil more than all the known reserves of nigeria kazakhstan and mexico combined and enough to supply u s demand for 12 years
1328874 one third of the undiscovered oil is in alaskan territory the agency found
1328875 amply endowed with indeterminate principles mind numbing cross references institutional redundancies exasperating opacity and inelegant drafting
1328876 lost fostered the idea per se of international organizations with increasing transnational jurisdiction its bureaucracy will be nourished by royalties on mineral extraction and provide a model for similar agencies to assume authority and impose taxes and to inexorably devour american institutions and autonomy
1328877 if americans have learned anything about the united nations over the last 50 years it is that this world body is at best riddled with corruption and incompetence at worst its bureaucracies agencies and members are overwhelmingly hostile to the united states and other freedom loving nations
1328878 the region above the arctic circle also holds an estimated 1 669 trillion cubic feet of natural gas equal to 27 percent of the worlds known gas reserves according to the u
1328879 contributors to the data included the geological survey of canada the u s interior departments minerals management service the norwegian petroleum directorate the cambridge arctic shelf program and researchers in denmark and greenland no russian institutions took part in the study
1328880 but the only excursions offered were to the local mall where a wealth of unaffordable merchandise stared them in the face
1328881 we always knew not to call the law unless you were prepared to be unemployed

1328883 my country right or wrong is a thing that no patriot would think of saying
1328884 they showed two clips of the film to let fans know that this film is in fact being made
1328885 we spend money to come here with our families its an inexpensive place to stay
1328886 if they were to say evacuate then yeah we would do it but otherwise no
1328887 they want to distract people from talking about the real issues
1328888 this is a very respectful campaign i dont think our campaign is negative in the slightest
1328889 would rather lose a war in order to win a political campaign
1328890 sen obama told the american people what he thought you wanted to hear i told you the truth
1328891 what sen mccain neglected to mention was that during those 30 years he was in washington for 26 of them and in all that time he did little to reduce our dependence on foreign oil
1328892 after years of inaction and in the face of public frustration over rising gas prices
1328893 we simply cannot pretend as sen mccain does that we can drill our way out of this problem
1328894 make no mistake the oil companies have placed their bet on sen mccain and if he wins they will continue to cash in while our families and our economy suffer and our future is put in jeopardy
1328895 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
1328896 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
1328897 no lo conozco pero escuch que rudy ulloa el choferata de kirchner anda con 100 palos verdes y lo quiere comprar
1328898 no lo conozco pero escuch que rudy ulloa el choferata de kirchner anda con 100 palos verdes y lo quiere comprar
1328899 rather than disposing of the body it was prepared to be eaten
1328900 one of the arguments is really if you want to punish your enemy killing them is not enough if you can chop them up and eat them and turn them into excrement that is the greatest humiliation you can impose on them
1328901 the amount of evidence is so overwhelming it would be unfair to pretend it didnt happen it is too important to ignore
1328902 it was definitely there its recorded in all sorts of ways in our histories and traditions a lot of place names refer to it
1328903 you will get your english based historians who come out of an english culture who dont understand it and avoid it because they dont understand it
1328904 if you dont understand it youre risking misinterpreting it badly if you try to address it
1328905 if you dont understand the things you are talking about you take one hell of a risk
1328906 very very hard for a pakeha to get it right on these things especially when they dont know how to interrogate it from within the culture and interrogating it from within the culture means interrogating it from within the language
1328907 theres some bloody dead fish you have to swallow to get into government to do the kinds of things you want to do
1328908 once we have gained the confidence of the people weve got more chance of doing more things
1328909 we may be able to do some things we believe we need to do perhaps go through a discussion document process you wouldnt be able to do them straight off
1328910 its not my view its not my private view i simply used loose language i made a statement i shouldnt have
1328911 we would never make a change to that decision without a mandate
1328912 the secret agenda of the national party is slowly unravelling
1328913 he could admit that he has no intention of sticking to the centrist labour plus agenda he is promising new zealanders
1328914 or he can admit that the senior mps around him are very happy to use him to gain power but have no intention of letting him run the show if they are elected
1328915 i saw a picture of myself it looked like it was taken at blacktown station and then i didnt know what to do after that
1328916 i told my parents its not me please believe me
1328917 i told them that it wasnt me i told them to get more hard evidence but they said theyve got all the evidence that they needed thats it
1328918 i was about to break down i didnt know what to do
1328919 police made me think that it was me that id done all these things so in my mind i had to go through it to think whether i really did rape anyone or not thats how much they put it on me
1328920 i had never been to a court before i was just so confused and shocked
1328921 detectives are encouraging children and young people to avoid walking or travelling alone especially if going to and from school
1328922 ksama or forgiveness is one of the main virtues of hindu ethics if mike myers offers a genuine public apology hindus would not only absolve him but might also pray for his success in future movies
1328923 its an experience that makes you wonder if you will ever laugh again
1328924 theyve been keeping the relationship quiet for months and trying to pass each other off as just good friends
1328925 but theyve decided it isnt a fling its for life so they want to make their romance public dina is still working on the date of the party but its looking like towards the end of the year
1328926 police chiefs shouldnt get involved in everyone elses business when it comes to their personal life its inappropriate
1328927 im delighted to be a part of the otago set up and am really looking forward to playing some good cricket for them next season
1328928 playing cricket in new zealand has always been something ive wanted to do as i love the country and otago seemed an obvious destination with such a talented playing list who will be looking for success
1328929 after my experiences playing odi and t20 cricket for england and in the ipl with the rajasthan royals i really feel like i have something to offer otago in terms of leadership and experience
1328930 ive had positive conversations with coach mike hesson and captain craig cumming over the past few weeks so i really cant wait to get out there and meet the boys
1328931 back in the 70s and 80s there was a tactical response group but of course they were never kitted out to this extreme
1328932 there would have been perhaps an improvised army helmet an old type ballistic vest and a remington 870 pump action shotgun not much else
1328933 far more dangerous place than it was 20 years ago
1328934 what we are wearing is a direct reflection of society today i have seen an escalation in violence towards police and a loss of respect for law enforcement in general
1328935 we get called to public disturbances brawls sieges riots protests and demonstrations but we are fully prepared for any other high risk scenario that could possibly come our way
1328936 if its a situation like a redfern or a macquarie fields riot the last thing youre thinking about is the additional weight its never a consideration youre totally focused
1328937 if they are heading out in the full kit its based upon the risk of the threat confronting us at the time
1328938 we had significant intelligence that there were people intent on causing violence and damage
1328939 sanzars current position is that it is a very much a three country expansion of super rugby with south africa involved

1329019 fosta capitala europeana sibiu a cunoscut in ultimii doi ani o dezvolare a structurilor de cazare la cele mai inalte standarde iar brasovul se bucura in momentul de fata de investitii masive in sectorul hotelier la polul opus in sudul tarii gasim cele mai slabe unitati de cazare din punct de vedere al calitatii serviciilor si al bazei materiale din cauza fluxului redus de turisti din zona
1329020 aspectul precar al acestor unitati de cazare este completat de obicei de servicii de proasta calitate rezultat al unui management prost iar o mare parte dintre hotelurile care nu intrunesc standardele nationale se afla pe litoral

1329030 aceste facultati reprezinta doar o formalitate pentru a obtine o diploma cele mai multe dintre acestea sunt particulare iar un an de studiu costa 3 400 de lei
1329031 cei mai multi dintre studenti sunt asistenti care au deja 10 15 ani de experienta in domeniu iar facultatea este o pierdere de timp si o sustragere a fortei de munca in conditiile in care acestia au trecut deja prin materiile care se predau in timpul facultatii
1329032 in prezent din cauza salariilor mici si a conditiilor nefavorabile de munca peste 10 000 de persoane care au terminat o forma de invatamant de profil sanitar nu profeseaza ca asistenti ci au preferat sa munceasca in alte domenii numai anul trecut peste 3 000 de asistenti au plecat sa lucreze in strainatate pentru salarii mult mai mari decat cele din romania
1329033 many digital content goods and services are becoming basic must haves particularly in the sub 35 age group devices like the iphone even in its 3g incarnation are undoubtedly contributing to consumer awareness and usage of mobile music services people who are 15 to 20 today will expect to buy directly with their phones and will drive this market over the next few years
1329034 even though typical transaction sizes will remain in the 3 5 bracket a sufficient number of users will be using their mobiles to buy music games tickets infotainment and the other digital goods sufficiently often to see gross transaction value grow nearly seven fold by 2013

1329043 theres a lot of evidence to support the idea that when kids watch violent media they become more aggressive
1329044 and yet violent media has become easier and easier to access for children so for the movie industry the message is that the 1960s ratings system needs to be updated and made more explicit and relevant to the way movies are being distributed and seen today
1329045 but also parents need to be much more careful about how their children consume violent media
1329046 and in any case the american movie industry rates itself
1329047 so how and why some movies get an r rating while others dont isnt always rational because its like the fox watching the chicken coop and the industry is not going to do anything that limits it from getting as wide an audience as possible
1329048 theres quite a lot of validity to what these researchers are saying
1329049 children are definitely far more able to access this kind of violent material and its potentially worrying but the evidence isnt really there yet that theres a negative consequence
1329050 but there just arent any studies that have shown a direct connection to problem behavior and what the connection is independent of a host of other factors for example children who are more violent in the first place tend to be the ones drawn more to material that is more violent so even the direction of any relationship is not clear
1329051 if you dont come here right now im gonna throw dis ball to your head
1329052 i dont know if we can jump to that conclusion yet
1329053 we need to study this further we do know from two large scale clinical trials that smokers benefited more when they got plavix therapy maybe smoking does something to make plavix work better
1329054 current smoking was an independent predictor of low platelet aggregation
1329055 were trying to get funding for a trial right now
1329056 then we would remove the smoking in half the group
1329057 we would see whether that removal adds support for our observation
1329058 and were definitely not telling people to smoke if they have heart disease
1329059 estrogen treatment is a promising new area for future treatment of schizophrenia and potentially for other severe mental illnesses
1329060 physical inactivity and sedentary behaviors varied widely among children in various ethnic immigrant groups

1329083 seriously deviled eggs i dont need no stinkin recipe for deviled eggs
1329084 oh but you do you need this recipe in fact
1329085 most people who consume alcohol in the united states drink in ways that may increase their risk of the metabolic syndrome and related conditions
1329086 prevention efforts should focus on reducing alcohol consumption to safer levels
1329087 unfortunately few physicians screen their patients about alcohol use or are knowledgeable about guidelines that define low risk or moderate drinking
1329088 children have no control over their family situation so its encouraging to find that the amount of quality time that they have with their parents is largely unaffected by their family arrangement
1329089 more than 80 percent of the dive injuries occurred from a dive height of less than or equal to one meter so that is not the highest dive this is usually from the lowest order or the edge of the pool
1329090 this really suggests the need for increased prevention efforts to lower the risk of diving related injuries
1329091 theres a lot that can be done to make diving a safer recreational activity or sport
1329092 having a lifeguard or other supervision present is really important
1329093 what is most interesting to me as a pediatrician with a mind for prevention is what may also be among the most predictable findings of the study that diving injury peaks substantially during the summer months and that boys are far more likely to be injured than girls
1329094 the summer month exposure will surprise no one males are more affected by nearly all types of injury particularly unintentional injury
1329095 we tend to teach children well to stay in the shallow end when they are small
1329096 we do less of a good job teaching about the risks of diving or marking dive safe zones as they grow
1329097 our long term goal should be to alter our lifestyle accordingly beginning in infancy or early childhood
1329098 instituting a low saturated fat low cholesterol diet in infancy 7 months is perfectly safe without adverse effects
1329099 our review of the literature convinces us that more aggressive and earlier intervention will probably prevent considerably more than 30 percent of coronary heart disease
1329100 studies show that fatty streak lesions in the arteries that are a precursor to atherosclerosis and heart disease begin in childhood and advanced lesions are not uncommon by age 30 why not nip things in the bud
1329101 a concerted national effort might dramatically reduce morbidity and mortality due to three major chronic diseases it would take generations to achieve and it would require an all out commitment of money and manpower to re educate and modify the behavior of a nation is that impossible no we have already shown that even a frankly addictive behavior like cigarette smoking can be overcome eventually
1329102 it rubs the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again
1329103 this is something that is very true in my clinical experience
1329104 the uninsured cant get in to see the doctor they miss medications their blood pressure is out of control and really you see devastating consequences
1329105 these people are going to end up with complications of their illnesses prematurely they will be disabled early they will probably die younger it is a major public health disaster
1329106 longer term there will be expensive admissions to hospitals usually through the emergency department due to diabetes out of control and congestive heart failure because of hypertension
1329107 we found some pretty striking differences when we compared uninsured individuals with one of these seven conditions with insured individuals with one of the conditions
1329108 these are conditions that we take care of in the clinic we know that we can prevent disabling complications or catastrophe if we are able to manage these conditions
1329109 it is interesting that chronic conditions are more common among people with insurance than without but that isnt surprising either people with a chronic condition are likely to place a higher value on their coverage and work harder to get and keep it
1329110 but having insurance is not likely to prove to be a panacea for these folks
1329111 people with chronic conditions who are insured are not doing so well either we do not do a very good job of delivering chronic care in this country for anyone
1329112 furthermore our results demonstrate an important relationship between rem sleep and high bmi and obesity suggesting that the short sleep obesity association may be attributed to reduced rem sleep time and decreased activity during rem sleep
1329113 is much more explicit than any recommendation out there right now
1329114 the time frame is that the benefit if there is any from screening is 10 years
1329115 the average life expectancy for men over 75 years is less than 10 years so screening them can do more harm than good
1329116 there is uncertainty about whether the benefits exceed the harm based on existing evidence
1329117 most of the harms are related to treatment rather than screening
1329118 men under the age of 75 should try to make an informed choice at this time
1329119 the current evidence is not enough for us to know the balance between benefit and harm
1329120 that discussion should occur before screening occurs and should include what the test does and does not mean the consequences of finding cancer and the uncertainty about whether benefit exceeds harm based on current evidence
1329121 will not sit well with oncologists and a lot of people
1329122 as medical oncologists we are always trying to be one step ahead of the cancer
1329123 we are trying to intervene earlier and identify patients who are at risk we always want to intercede to do something
1329124 these patients are very informed and their view will be at odds with the recommendations
1329125 these are not the 75 year olds of 50 years ago these are physically younger people still actively functioning sexually in many cases
1329126 we are starting to make recommendations that some people be screened by the age of 35
1329127 the american cancer society since 1997 has been against mass screening
1329128 but within the physician patient relationship a test should be offered to the patient with the patient informed of the potential risks and potential benefits so he can make an informed decision
1329129 but we are in the process of re evaluating our recommendations for men of all ages
1329130 thank god we didnt have any more kids i never would have been able handle three kids and my husband

1329137 there are too many unknowns in this study to make conclusions about the relationship between cough and cold medicine and altes
1329138 they raised a lot of possibilities but the question is what do you do in follow up
1329139 oh i just adore the new apple line i bought every piece and i also bought a couple pieces from some of the other lines in the store

1329154 this study shows that immunotherapy is safe and well tolerated and could ultimately be beneficial for this high risk population
1329155 we now know that the immune system of patients recovering from chemotherapy is malleable so we just need to find the best immunological approach to exploit this window of opportunity
1329156 many complementary methods are extremely popular among cancer survivors who are spending a lot of their time money and attention on them
1329157 for this reason it is important to determine which are helpful not only for shrinking tumors and extending survival but also for relieving symptoms and improving quality of life
1329158 in general younger more educated and more affluent cancer survivors were more likely to use complementary methods
1329159 people with more advanced cancer were more likely to be complementary method users
1329160 this is not only because ovarian cancer is obviously limited to women and breast cancer is extremely rare among men for example all types of complementary methods were used more often by breast and ovarian cancer survivors than by uterine cancer survivors also women of course
1329161 scientific studies of complementary methods have become much more common during the past few years but there is still a lot of uncertainty about the effectiveness of many complementary methods
1329162 as more studies are done to evaluate effectiveness we will want to know whether men are missing opportunities to use some effective complementary methods that are far more popular in women or whether women use ineffective complementary methods more than men or whether some complementary methods are more effective for women than they are for men
1329163 this study like many before it confirms that cancer patients actively pursue a variety of alternative and complementary therapies usually in conjunction with standard approaches to cancer treatment
1329164 it is not known but it is not thought that these have an impact on cancer related outcomes though many patients report deriving comfort solace or symptom relief with such practices

1329258 we originally looked to the telenav track service as a way to lessen the time that it was taking our team to get their timecards dropped off at the office
1329259 we didnt initially expect telenav track to help us reduce the number of hours being logged out on the field although it may just be a few hours saved each week those extra hours alone are paying for the service time and time again
1329260 like many businesses being affected by todays slowed economy nobile construction was looking for a cost effective solution to better monitor the time being spent on each job wireless timecards are an excellent way for companies with a mobile workforce to monitor how time is being spent as well as eliminate unnecessary paperwork and fuel costs
1329261 in a business where repeat customers are crucial to success telenav track provides the workforce management tools companies need to keep their efforts running as efficiently as possible

1329292 religious convictions about the origin of life are sacred and should be cultivated and strengthened in homes and houses of worship

1329328 what we fail to understand is that if interruptions from our work to deal with the demands others make on us are a waste of time then christs life was a waste of time for when we read the gospels attentively we discover that the story of his life is one long sequence of interruptions the blind bartimaeus interrupts his departure from jericho a woman interrupts his dinner in the home of simon the leper a centurion interrupts his entry into capernaum jairus interrupts his meeting with the crowd the woman with the hemorrhage interrupts his atttempts to get to jairus daughter his disciples interrupt virtually everything even mary interrupts his enjoyment of the wedding the list could go on and on those were not interruptions of course those were precisely the people he came to help the thihgs he came to do when so much of his work consisted of attending to those who interrupted him why should we suppose our own lives to be any different

1329711 the molecular interaction in oxygen revealed by this study is due to the unique fact that oxygens outmost orbital is half filled with two unpaired electrons
1329712 as the molecules are squeezed into smaller volumes at high pressure electrons in the orbital inevitably move about trying to pair with electrons in the neighboring molecules
1329713 the behavior of oxygen at high pressure demonstrates one of the most profound effects of pressure on matter which transforms the colorless air we breath into colorful dense solids
1329714 the drastic change in the appearance of this familiar gas is due to the bonding changes in oxygen induced by high pressure
1329715 this is the first demonstration of how new tools can be used to probe the subtle interactions between atoms and molecules that lead to the formation of entirely new crystal structures
1329716 these new structures may give rise to entirely new electronic magnetic and other physical properties that could lead to new technologies
1329717 when you eat foods containing more than 200 milligrams of vitamin c a day for example 2 oranges and a serving of broccoli your body prevents blood levels of ascorbate from exceeding a narrow range
1329718 at these high injected doses we hoped to see drug like activity that might be useful in cancer treatment
1329719 these pre clinical data provide the first firm basis for advancing pharmacologic ascorbate in cancer treatment in humans
1329720 clinical and pharmacokinetic studies conducted in the past 12 years showed that oral ascorbate levels in plasma and tissue are tightly controlled in the case series ascorbate was given orally and intravenously but in the trials ascorbate was just given orally it was not realized at the time that only injected ascorbate might deliver the concentrations needed to see an anti tumor effect
1329721 nihs unique translational environment where researchers can pursue intellectual high risk out of the box thinking with high potential payoff enabled us to pursue this work
1329722 identified molecular mechanisms involved in the evolution of human cognitive abilities by combining biological data from two research directions evolutionary and medical
1329723 our new research suggests that schizophrenia is a by product of the increased metabolic demands brought about during human brain evolution
1329724 this would mean that we could deliver lower dosages of drugs to specific cells and tissues in the body and actually be more effective in treating the cancer
1329725 the long rod shaped structure of bacteria may help explain why print particles of higher aspect ratios are internalized more rapidly and effectively than lower aspect ratio particles
1329726 if we can design particles that rely on the same mechanisms that nature has perfected for bacteria we may unlock the key for delivering therapeutics more efficiently and effectively to treat and cure disease
1329727 we are delighted to contribute to the important work that professor desimone and his students are undertaking in the field of nanomedicine this work answers key questions about the role of particle shape and size that industry leaders have been asking for some time
1329728 at a time when life saving medications are available to treat persons living with hiv there continues to be a population of hiv positive people who have fallen through the cracks
1329729 frequently their only contact with the healthcare system is during a hospitalization
1329730 we know that not being engaged in care and prevention services is not only bad for the individuals but is also bad for society in that a substantial fraction of hiv infected crack users engage in behavior that transmits the virus to others
1329731 our long term goal should be to alter our lifestyle accordingly beginning in infancy or early childhood
1329732 instituting a low saturated fat low cholesterol diet in infancy 7 months is perfectly safe without adverse effects
1329733 our review of the literature convinces us that more aggressive and earlier intervention will probably prevent considerably more than 30 of coronary heart disease
1329734 studies show that fatty streak lesions in the arteries that are a precursor to atherosclerosis and heart disease begin in childhood and advanced lesions are not uncommon by age 30 why not nip things in the bud
1329735 the weapons for those wars education and behavior modification are the same as those needed for a war on coronary heart disease
1329736 a concerted national effort might dramatically reduce morbidity and mortality due to three major chronic diseases it would take generations to achieve and it would require an all out commitment of money and manpower to reeducate and modify the behavior of a nation is that impossible no we have already shown that even a frankly addictive behavior like cigarette smoking can be overcome eventually
1329737 weve raised concerns for years about primates being in peril but now we have solid data to show the situation is far more severe than we imagined
1329738 tropical forest destruction has always been the main cause but now it appears that hunting is just as serious a threat in some areas even where the habitat is still quite intact in many places primates are quite literally being eaten to extinction
1329739 to have a group of animals under such a high level of threat is quite frankly unlike anything we have recorded among any other group of species to date
1329740 among the african species the great apes such as gorillas and bonobos have always tended to grab the limelight and even though they are deeply threatened it is smaller primates such as the red colobus that could die out first
1329741 the work with lion tamarins shows that conserving forest fragments and reforesting to create corridors that connect them is not only vital for primates but offers the multiple benefits of maintaining healthy ecosystems and water supplies while reducing greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change
1329742 you have thousands of people going to these islands and these tourists need to know that if they get into trouble that they can get the medical care

1329835 we had a hint of this reaction before as a previous study we conducted in 96 patients treated with 300 mg of clopidogrel for elective coronary artery stenting showed that 28 of the responders to clopidogrel were smokers compared with 13 of the nonresponders and another study by matetzky et al has reported that smokers were less often clopidogrel resistant
1329836 we didnt really make much of our earlier observation as it was such a small study but then there was an abstract presented at the acc in 2006 suggesting that smoking appeared to influence the clinical effect of clopidogrel in the credo study with a larger reduction in clinical events seen with the drug in smokers than in nonsmokers and there has subsequently been an analysis of the clarity trial showing a similar observation this gave us the interest to look further at our data set
1329837 although there have already been some data suggesting that smoking may affect the response to clopidogrel our findings show that this can be translated into an antiplatelet effect
1329838 our trial is not a prospective study and while we believe our observations are real they are not enough to base clinical decisions on
1329839 in addition the effect of smoking will probably not be a simple formula as its influence will differ from one individual to another i certainly do not suggest people start smoking to get an increased effect from clopidogrel rather this study highlights the limitations of using a prodrug that needs to be metabolized to exert an antiplatelet effect and suggests that a direct acting antiplatelet agent would make more sense

1329940 sources say that the mets didnt want to risk bringing ramirez and all his baggage into their clubhouse but strangely after the mets had stood pat at the deadline minaya suggested on a conference call that the reason they couldnt make a deal for ramirez was that boston had requested a big league outfielder back that claim must have come from minayas very vivid imagination and appears to have been an attempt to cover for the mets or possibly refrain from exposing their true feelings about a ramirez trade in reality the red sox had called the mets and were told no and that was the end of that
