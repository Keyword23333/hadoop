9380035 i have to be true to that i cant take certain things away i do have a political background im only in england learning this language and building a life in this society because of political reasons why would i deny that
9380036 nobody wants to be dancing to political songs every bit of music out there thats making it into the mainstream is really about nothing i wanted to see if i could write songs about something important and make it sound like nothing and it kind of worked
9380037 i think i was always slightly political but my issues change with whats going on in my life politics is something that ive never been able to discuss with anyone and everyone my life in england for the first ten years wasnt really political it was more about getting an equal shot as the next person i wanted a shot at an education politics came back to me after i went back to sri lanka once i studied and wanted to be a filmmaker i tried to make a documentary on what it was like to be a young person in sri lanka i wanted to make a film that could compare the 19 year olds in sri lanka thats when i came across so much politics

9380042 i think there are poses i will never attain as the week progresses i take each pose one more step the same way i am called to walk with god get me out of the way and take one more step in faith then i have to take a breath from the spirit i have to get rooted and plant myself firmly engaging the muscles of faith i have to bring my limbs into alignment with my middle with christ as the center then i take my focus or gaze to the correct position moving slowly and breathing into the pose not getting ahead of the breath or holy spirit i began to place my shoulder where it should be then i can begin to work my leg and knee into place it is behind my back over my shoulder i reach across with my hand and gently pull the right foot up but pushing the heel away from the hip before i know it i am praising god that my back is straight as well as the right leg the girls around me are cheering their encouragement and cameras are flashing praise god

9380044 total appreciation rates over 300 were not uncommon during the period it was an incredible run fueled by sufficient national gdp growth and low mortgage rates
9380045 but as were seen ultimately the appreciation rates proved to be unsustainable everywhere they occurred

9380047 we learned that the smiths not their real name down the street had to take out a second mortgage

9380068 this is what the lord says do not learn the ways of the nations or be terrified by signs in the sky though the nations are terrified by them for the customs of the peoples are worthless they cut a tree out of the forest and a craftsman shapes it with his chisel they adorn it with silver and gold they fasten it with hammer and nails so it will not totter
9380069 there is no evidence that the first century disciples of jesus observed such a holiday
9380070 three and a half centuries ago the english puritans used their influence within the cromwellian republic protectorate to ban christmas celebrations they asserted quite correctly by their own lights that the 25 december had no biblical connection with the birth of their messiah and that the christmas festival was therefore essentially pagan
9380071 a literary debate occurred which broke out in december 1643 and was to continue intermittently until 1656 despite a few desperate efforts upon both sides to find some scriptural indication of the true date of christs birth a common ground was established almost at once that as there was indeed no objective evidence of when christ was born the feast of the nativity was wholly a creation of later authorities and supported by tradition and not the bible

9380077 that kind of situation impacts the oldest daughter either shes impacted because she has to take on a parenting role so that her mother can pursue her career and dreams or she really is the kids mother and this lie cant be good for her mental health
9380078 many poems have been written to explain how a mothers love can soothe the pain but little has been said about a fathers concern so now i think it must be his turn a fathers love for his offspring is just like that of a solid gold ring no matter what it is unending never breaking though sometimes bending his love is as strong as a mothers although due to his personality it sometimes doesnt show there is no question of how strong or of its lasting however long so no matter if his child is good or bad there is no love stronger than that of a dad
9380079 what is a dad a dad is a person whos loving and kind and often he knows what you have on your mind hes someone who listens suggests and defends a dad can be one of your very best friends hes proud of your triumphs but when things go wrong a dad can be patient and helpful and strong in all that you do a dads love plays a part theres always a place for him deep in your heart and each year that passes youre even more glad more grateful and proud just to call him your dad

9380081 senator mccains choice for a running mate is beyond belief by choosing sarah palin mccain has clearly made a decision to continue the bush legacy of destructive environmental policies
9380082 sarah palin whose husband works for bp formerly british petroleum has repeatedly put special interests first when it comes to the environment
9380083 this is senator mccains first significant choice in building his executive team and its a bad one it has to raise serious doubts in the minds of voters about john mccains commitment to conservation to addressing the impacts of global warming and to ensuring our country ends its dependency on oil

9380124 the only new but absurd suggestion from the mdc was that the cabinet be co chaired by president mugabe and tsvangirai
9380125 zanu pf dismissed the suggestion not just as insolent but also stunning ignorance on how government works
9380126 and stalemate is something that zimbabwean politics is getting more used of as the search for a solution continues as i stated yesterday mugabe has got what he wanted the presidency and soon a cabinet even though his party does not hold the majority in parliament government by subterfuge and force two things which blend in with mugabes and zanu pfs styles quite easily it zanu pf said from its perspective all that remained was for the mdc to append its signature to the document or withhold it for as long as it likes knowing fully well that the process of forming a government would proceed unhindered
9380127 johannes tomana the deputy attorney general is leading this plot
9380128 we are now used to these malicious claims by the mdc they are meant to make their western sponsors happy and tarnish our government there is nothing like that going on the office is independent of the government
9380129 the problem here is that the mdc can only appeal for assistance from the zrp and they are so deep into mugabes pocket that their complaint will be ignored and probably result in the arrest and incarceration of the people who actually make the complaint mugabes zanu pf is returning to its roots by making matobo a no go area and sadly the mdc can do very little about it the pendulum swings and the only people that can reverse the zanu pf influence that they are attempting to lay down are the voters themselves the situation in matobo has suddenly turned tense after news that our local mp has been elected was received and war veterans had already set up bases like what happened towards the june 27 elections

9380139 oh yes but shes a woman she strings whole sentences together yay women women rock
9380140 its been real slow going trying to get people to uproot their lives
9380141 that being said i think the project has still been tremendous these are the best freedom activists in the word that are coming here the moving aspect is a good screening process
9380142 this week for example the free state project has sent a team of people to minnesota for outreach at the republican national convention and ron pauls rally for the republic
9380143 also each year we operate two world class pro liberty events here in new hampshire the porcupine freedom festival in the summer and the new hampshire liberty forum in the winter
9380144 the free state project appealed to us because it represented a real opportunity to work together with a high concentration of people who really valued freedom something that simply doesnt exist in california
9380145 the project only exists to encourage people to make the move and be an activist when they get here
9380146 concord is obviously a good place for politics there is a big mix of non cooperative activists and political activists in manchester in keene we have a larger concentration of non cooperative market based activists
9380147 they are forced to show their hand to show that they are the violent organization of men and women they really are or ignore us and hope we go away
9380148 if they ignore us we win if they arrest us we win
9380149 the more i listened the more the message started to make sense
9380150 i just kind of got hooked on it over the last two years ive come to adopt the messages and principles of liberty into my own life
9380151 people are scared of the judges theyre scared of the police thats the level of fear people have of this government thats designed to protect them
9380152 i dont know if ill be able to get away with it because of the planning boards but ill do it anyway
9380153 ill look at land that the city has said is unsuitable for building and ill build my cob house there
9380154 theres also a possibility of doing something with cheshire tv and ive thought about taking some film classes at keene state college
9380155 im really encouraged by the fact that at least were communicating and sharing ideas behind the scenes
9380156 as far as the organization goes the only success or failure is whether people are moving here or not
9380157 people are moving here and i would call that a success
9380158 yes i smacked my children but ive never hit them
9380159 yes i smacked other peoples children but i never hit them
9380160 i tell he no because i was going to work and i cant go to work high then they ask me if i was a police and i said no and i told them where i work

9380167 the message has come across loud and clear people want car makers to produce cleaner smarter cars that use less fuel reduce climate change emissions and slash fuel bills
9380168 politicians must act on public demand by standing up to the self interested lobbying of the car industry and delivering the tough standards that people clearly want

9380173 snippets of information alone are deeply dangerous they distract us with never ending waves of surface events spreading us ever thinner and obscuring the deeper structures and dynamics that ultimately are shaping these surface events those of us who stay only on the surface swimming in a sea of snippets will ultimately lose sight of land we need books or whatever the digital long forms of content are that will replace the book to help us penetrate the surface and explore the deeper structures and dynamics that make sense of the changes around us

9380181 we dont agree on everything but i respect her passion
9380182 i think the clinton campaign has heightened the sensitivity of women about any kind of implied or inferred slight
9380183 we are not attacking her personally and we are not attacking mccain
9380184 we are attacking a philosophy that has taken this country down the wrong road and the fact that she embraces that philosophy and thats why shes on the ticket is notable
9380185 she seems to have a compelling life story obviously shes a fine mother and an up and coming public servant

9380196 the simplicity of the single stranded tile approach promises to enable us to design ever more complex self assembling molecular systems the work is simultaneously elegant and useful
9380197 one of the greatest challenges preventing advances in new therapeutic options for treating cancer is the inability of anticancer drugs to effectively differentiate between cancerous and normal healthy body cells
9380198 many commonly used chemotherapeutic drugs target rapidly dividing cells but suffer from a relatively low therapeutic index which is the ratio of toxic dose to effective dose
9380199 preferential killing of cancer cells and activated human t cells using zno nanoparticles
9380200 until now no group in the world has been able to produce inherent selective cancer killing ability in nanoparticles
9380201 current chemotherapy drugs typically consist of single molecules and do not provide much room for manipulation of the molecule but nanoparticles can be modified so that certain characteristics like cancer killing attributes can be accentuated because of this we think there is room for improvement in what we have already demonstrated
9380202 oncology is always looking for a magic bullet which can kill only the cancer cells not killing the normal cells this work is a major step toward that
9380203 i think this work will pave the way for more targeted therapies

9380207 they put fred and other people out there up against cars they searched fred for guns and drugs and fred and the officer had choice words with each other the police apparently decided thats disorderly conduct
9380208 he didnt do anything wrong assuming he even had choice words with an officer lets assume that happened at a worst case scenario thats not obstructing justice thats not resisting arrest thats not disorderly conduct its nothing i havent read what police say happened but i imagine as quickly as it happened is as quickly as it will go away at least thats our intent and thats based on the knowledge i have of the facts

9380250 american issues project clearly has struck a nerve inside the obama campaign but even more important is the reaction of the american people who are starting to question why sen obama would have such a close relationship with an unrepentant domestic terrorist

9380262 e n keer in de veertien dagen zon paar uurtjes hulp dat is in feite al veel te weinig u moet ze niet wegsturen en dan vervolgens toch het hele bedrag gaan betalen alles wat die dames doen moet u maar zien als mooi meegenomen en als iets dat u zelf nu tenminste niet meer hoeft te doen
9380263 je kunt het die meisjes ook eigenlijk nauwelijks kwalijk nemen dat ze niets kunnen kijk toen ik indertijd bij de k s a kerkelijk sociale arbeid ditzelfde werk deed kregen wij regelmatig cursussen hoe wij het allemaal moesten doen de mensen wisten nog hoe ze werken moesten en hoe ze met oude mensen moesten omgaan wij hadden eens moeten weten hoe slecht het later worden zou het zijn allemaal leugenaars en bedriegers tegenwoordig
9380264 ja zo deden wij het vroeger bij de k s a ook
9380265 ik heb dat kind al na een uur weggestuurd hoor
9380266 er zijn toch altijd dingen die jullie zelf niet kunnen die je zon hulp kunt laten doen

9380322 it is uncertain whether congress will take the administration up on its request
9380323 some republicans have already embraced the idea with representative lamar smith of texas the ranking republican on the judiciary committee introducing a measure almost identical to the administrations proposal
9380324 recalls a resolution known as the authorization for use of military force passed by congress on sept 14 2001 which authorized the president to use all necessary and appropriate force against those responsible for the sept 11 attacks to prevent future strikes that authorization still in effect was initially viewed by many members of congress who voted for it as the go ahead for the administration to invade afghanistan and overthrow the taliban which had given sanctuary to mr bin laden
9380325 but the military authorization became the secret legal basis for some of the administrations most controversial legal tactics including the wiretapping program and that still gnaws at some members of congress

9380353 russia and turkey have one hundred percent the same approach on the montreux convention we believe that this agreement complies with the needs of the todays world both countries support the full implementation of the montreux conventon
9380354 the countries which are not party to the montreux convention must also comply with it completely
9380355 russias navy is monitoring nato ships in the black sea
9380356 in light of the build up of nato naval forces in the black sea the fleet has also taken on the task of monitoring their activities
9380357 in terms of the tough measures nato is considering for russia possibilities are growing that ankara may end up alienated from the west
9380358 right now bulgaria romania ukraine and georgia want a nato presence to counterbalance russia in the black sea in sum the number of black sea littoral states that do want nato there is bigger than those that do not in fact russia and nato member turkey are the only littoral states that do not want nato in the black sea
9380359 in addition to recent developments in the caucasus bilateral issues will be discussed
9380360 some individual persons are not reading the montreux convention but they are writing it let them read it for gods sake
9380361 the montreux convention is being implemented word for word at the moment there is no situation in the black sea that is contrary to the montreux convention it is that simple
9380362 if the nato ships continue to stay in the black sea after the expiration of the 21 day period then i would like to remind you that turkey would be responsible
9380363 there is certainly no nato build up in the black sea
9380364 its not a common practice to deliver humanitarian aid using battleships

9380381 our differences are not of such a nature as to preclude fellowship with one another as brothers and sisters in christ
9380382 both churches acknowledge and respect the distinctive contributions of the other
9380383 in particular the concern for social justice and divine sovereignty by the presbyterians and the adventists emphases on health and religious liberty
9380384 of tulips daisies and lilies the garden of gods electing grace
9380385 the creative tension between adventist emphasis on personal freedom and presbyterian stress on divine election provided for rich mutually respectful conversation
9380386 with both sides acknowledging appreciatively the importance of the others emphasis through these discussions members of both delegations learned much not only about each other but also from each other
9380387 and the fourth angel poured out his vial upon the sun and power was given unto him to scorch men with fire
9380388 the back feels good no pain im able to work out in a way that i havent been able to do for a long time and im ready to play hockey
9380389 an end time army has one common purpose to aggressively take ground for the kingdom of god under the authority of jesus christ the dread champion
9380390 the trumpet is sounding calling on fire revolutionary believers to enlist in joels army many are now ready to be mobilized to establish and advance gods kingdom on earth
9380391 the pitch and intensity of the military rhetoric of this branch of the global dominionist movement has substantially increased since the beginning of 2008
9380392 one can only wonder how long before this transforms into real warfare with actual warriors
9380393 get busy in constructing a bible based social political and religious order which finally denies the religious liberty of the enemies of god
9380394 such leaders prefer more authoritarian structures where their own word or decrees are unchallenged
9380395 everyone born after abortions legalization can consider their birth a personal invitation to take part in this great army
9380396 as the church begins to take on this resolve they joels army churches will start to be thought of more as military bases and they will begin to take on the characteristics of military bases for training equipping and deploying effective spiritual forces
9380397 in time the church will actually be organized more as a military force with an army navy air force etc
9380398 some pastors and leaders who continue to resist this tide of unity will be removed from their place some will become so hardened they will become opposers and resist god to the end
9380399 i am thinking god why is the power of god not moving and he said it is because you havent kicked that women in the face and there was like this older lady worshipping right in front of the platform and the holy spirit spoke to me and the gift of faith came on me he said kick her in the face with your biker boot i inched closer and i went like this makes kicking motion bam and just as my boot made contact with her nose she fell under the power of god
9380400 i believe were headed to an elijah jezebel showdown on the earth not just in america but all over the globe and the main warriors will be the prophets of baal versus the prophets of god and there will be no middle ground
9380401 theres an elijah generation thats going to be the forerunners for the coming of jesus a generation marked not by their niceness but by the intensity of their passion
9380402 the kingdom of heaven suffers violence and the violent take it by force such force demands an equal response and jesus is going to make war on everything that hinders love with his eyes blazing fire
9380403 a lot of people die for god and theyre not afraid
9380404 like dawn spreading across the mountains a large and mighty army comes such as never was of old nor ever will be in ages to come
9380405 it is a complete misinterpretation of scripture to find in joels army of locusts a militant victorious force attacking society and a non cooperating church to prepare the earth for christs millennial reign
9380406 through cain came all the smart educated people down to the antediluvian flood the intellectuals bible colleges
9380407 they know all their creeds but know nothing about god
9380408 a super race mentality toward the training of their children
9380409 today you can type joels army into a search engine and a thousand heresy hunter websites pop up decrying the very mention of it
9380410 this battle is not a game they joels army warriors will not be on the defense they will be on the offense and the gates of hell will not be able to hold up against them
9380411 maybe cities are just too full of people who are all too busy to embark on a meaningful relationship but the countryside is no better i was intrigued when i visited the

9380416 the story is very pessimistic it has a dark and gloomy texture that japanese movie fans do not find appealing in a comic hero film japanese movie fans expect such films to be fun and action packed for the hero to be attractive for the villain to be loud and outrageous and for the movie itself to be easy to understand and light
9380417 there are a lot of us who emotionally would love to do it
9380418 but its really chris call chris is the kind of filmmaker who just doesnt think about the next movie before he has completely finished the movie he is working on

9380420 the new catwoman will be the absolute opposite of michelle pfeiffer and halle berrys purring creations
9380421 theres been no confirmation about the dvd date and nearest myself and one of the producers can tell there really isnt a date set for the dvd much less a theatrical release plus the weinstein company is contractually obligated to give outlander at least a limited theatrical release
9380422 im very unhappy with the film i never had a chance to do one scene the way it was written or the way i wanted it to be the script wasnt respected bad producers bad partners it was a terrible experience
9380423 david twowy right now is writing the scripts the only question is whether we take a page from the lord of the rings guys and try to shoot the two chapters at the same time there are two more in mind
9380424 everyone knows i love the riddick character and im always working on it
9380425 it just takes five years to make another one because david twohy and i are so precious about it
9380426 our vision will be done with the utmost respect with a continuity to zombies work but also a real evolution of the world he set in place
9380427 lets sit down in a room together and create a show
9380428 the new series of torchwood is hugely bold and promises to be bigger and better than ever the audience is in for an amazing ride this series is one big serial and the most ambitious story weve ever made and weve got plenty of surprises in store
9380429 it would be good to see it in the cinema so long as it is great and fantastic im not against it so long as it never gets in the way of the tv show if it got in the way of the show that would be appalling
9380430 the first chapter of volume 3 villains kicks off moments after shots rang out as the shocking identity of nathans adrian pasdar assassin and the reasons why the texas press conference had to be cut short are revealed immediately throwing peter milo ventimiglia and matt greg grunberg into unexpected uncharted territory
9380431 in the shocking second chapter of volume 3 villains angela petrelli cristine rose confronts her much changed son peter as the bursts of violence around them only hint to the catastrophes to come
9380432 i think this season for sarah is her losing slight control over everything pretty much
9380433 i think theres a slow madness sort of happening in her she feels that everyones kind of out of reach right now
9380434 the new head of hbo felt it was just too dark and too violent and too controversial which of course is kind of the point
9380435 new balance of our humor and character stories with some really interesting sci fi visuals
9380436 cher is an icon but shes no oscar winning actress
9380437 ill add more layers and motivations for the killer ya know by making him white trash
9380438 look at how fucked up we are now imagine how fucked up youre going to be when you get back the second time
9380439 no im serious im gay i got my orders in the mail today saying that i have to report to fort benning georgia in five weeks
9380440 the prime minister was told two hostiles had been spotted with guns on a nearby roof he was rushed back to the compound and local forces dealt with the situation
9380441 we never comment on security matters but the pm always takes the advice of the security forces
9380442 i will end this war in iraq responsibly and finish the fight against al qaida and the taliban in afghanistan
9380443 you see vehicles destroyed by rockets on the side of the road
9380444 the wreckage isnt there for long the army soon removes it to make it look as if they are still in control of the road but they are on the verge of losing it
9380445 if there is a more dangerous job in pakistan i would like to know what it is
9380446 if nato lost control of the pass there is no doubt that other routes would be found
9380447 but they are more difficult and expensive it would interfere with the smooth running of the operation
9380448 there is certainly some enemy action on this supply route
9380449 but it has no impact on our mission in afghanistan
9380450 you used to see a lot of oil tankers that were damaged but the chassis and the engine were fine
9380451 the government is aware of these attacks on convoys in the khyber region and it is one of the reasons why we have had a major military operation there in the past few weeks

9380457 the scary part is how much pakistan has learned from them
9380458 i simply dont believe the french need the chinese to do non explosive testing they have a very strong program and i cant see them exposing it to the prying eyes of the chinese
9380459 i think it is extremely unlikely that china tested a pakistani bomb
9380460 i believed they just wanted to show that they were competent they were very open to me
9380461 well once again ive missed time with family this time it was camerons birthday on the 10th
9380462 now that i have gotten that bullshit 3 day pass out the way we can actually get down to business which consists of something like an entire company of soldiers sitting on a drill floor made for a group of soldiers no where near a company size and sweating my entirely too small balls off for the better part of the evening waiting for the ridiculously early wake up call that will inevitably come and then we can actually get this show on the road i had to do the whole tearful goodbye thing again needless to say that sucked major monkey nuts sorry mom i am back to talking like a soldier my mother brought forth the water works in the driveway today when i got picked up suffice it to say i needed to rehydrate myself after i had left then i proceeded to smoke an entire pack of cigarettes inside of 3 hours my lungs are screaming for mercy as i write this

9380481 that was the best political speech i have ever seen delivered by an american woman politician palin is as tough as nails
9380482 in fact even though the clinton aides could barely conceal their satisfaction when she was chosen the woman who palin upstages most of all is hillary if obama wins the election hillary will have to wait until 2016 to stand again and if he loses palin will be first in line to become americas first woman president

9380492 lo empezamos a ver con peque as empresas constructoras que sufr an el trabajo en cadena de las subcontratas hacen parte de la obra para otra m s grande y si no les paga ellos a su vez no pueden pagar a los trabajadores hoy ya lo vemos en muchos otros sectores
9380493 si el empresario no paga el salario el trabajador ha de cubrirse y acudir a los tribunales presentando una demanda de reclamaci n de cantidad
9380494 puede encontrarse en una situaci n de indefensi n total
9380495 lo peor son las empresas m s peque as confirma tom muchas personas te explican aquello de que yo era amigo del due o y me dijo que me esperara que le hab an fallado varios clientes pero que uno de ellos iba a pagarle en unos d as esa confianza es lo peor porque el due o sabe ya que va a tener que cerrar en unos meses y est aguantando probablemente para intentar blindar su patrimonio personal y preservarlo de la ca da de la empresa por ello lo mejor que puede hacer el trabajador es al segundo mes ir al juzgado
9380496 el trabajador sin trabajo y sin percibir sueldo puede presentar en el juzgado una demanda por despido t cito que tiene una indemnizaci n de 20 d as por a o trabajado
9380497 s lo tienen preferencia de cobro los salarios de los ltimos 30 d as explica tom cuando en la anterior crisis todos los sueldos eran deuda preferente ahora en cambio los trabajadores est n igual que el resto de los acreedores no preferentes
9380498 es frecuente que el juez d la raz n al trabajador y reconozca los salarios que le adeuda la empresa pero que simplemente en ella ya no haya patrimonio para permitirle cobrarlos
9380499 no s el mateix jugar al camp nou que a
9380500 to lose 10 lives in a day is disastrous but our prayers are with them
9380501 we have already built sheds cut firewood and prepared the yaqona for the funeral gathering and we are waiting for the medical authorities to complete their work before the bodies are brought across
9380502 it is so unfortunate and we would like to share the grief with the immediate family members
9380503 we want him out because of some of the things he has been doing
9380504 he is a bad influence to the students sometimes at night he takes some students for rides to places and activities
9380505 it is not ethical and against moral and that is why we want him out
9380506 what he must understand is that he is not an army officer he is appointed by the church and it is important that he communicates with us on how we can improve pastoral work in the camp
9380507 what does he mean by that he has to clarify his position
9380508 the church wants to know what happens in the vineyard a number of soldiers are passing away but he reported nothing to us
9380509 all this time he mr waqairatu has been talking against the military but he doesnt know whats going on in camp
9380510 it must be noted that 70 per cent of the army officers are methodists and we must continue to improve our pastoral work to the full
9380511 this accident has been a very traumatic experience for the children involved and they would be greatly affected by it in such cases children would refuse to be left alone and some would be afraid of the dark
9380512 not talking about it will not make it go away it will make it even harder to forget and get over it they should talk about it so that they can bring themselves to forget about it
9380513 currently the survivors are being treated for their injuries from the accident but we would be getting in touch with them to go through counseling
9380514 sister sulu would be able to help them arrange for counseling sessions he said
9380515 the last couple of nights have been very hard to sleep i can still hear their screams for help
9380516 even the smell of burnt skin i have had to force myself to close my eyes but i can still see them
9380517 i ran after the bus when i heard the tyre burst by then people were already jumping off the bus to save themselves
9380518 some women who were trying to free themselves were already burnt in the process
9380519 i tried my best to fan the flames off those who had jumped i tried my best to rescue whoever i could at that time i helped those i could help
9380520 i tried to help those who were trapped in the bus but as i got hold of them i realised i was pulling their skin off
9380521 thats how hot the flames were i tried to pull the iron bars but it was too hot
9380522 i saw a lady trying to get out of the bus while holding her mobile phone but she seemed trapped in the window
9380523 we have been sitting here thinking of those who died
9380524 when everything turned into panic the woman next to me smashed the glass and got out
9380525 i saw where i was throwing my son to i saw gaberieli soqo standing outside and threw my son to him knowing he would catch him
9380526 i was worried and afraid that something would go wrong when i threw my son out i am so grateful to gaberieli for rescuing him
9380527 i was also on that bus because i had to go for a meeting in suva by the time we left the hospital it was after 7pm and everyone started feeling uneasy
9380528 when we left sigatoka town we started experiencing problems the ladies on the bus started to stand and ask the driver what the problem was
9380529 many of them had that look of fear in their eyes as if to say they were going through that nightmare all over again
9380530 the coral sun bus started making noises as we approached malevu so the driver stopped and got off the bus to check
9380531 i spent weeks preparing researching issues for my public judging and just mentally preparing myself for the role
9380532 most nights i went to bed late just getting myself ready but it has been worth the while in the end because i was part of a group of people that helped raise more than 120 000 and for that i could do it all over again
9380533 i am thankful to have helped the wainikoro community get a mortuary of their very own to spare them the expenses and difficulties of taking the bodies of their loved ones to the labasa hospital
9380534 i owe it all to the lord my family for their tremendous support both in the weeks leading up to the festival and during the week and nasekula villagers who were there in great numbers to cheer me on
9380535 i prayed the lord would give her strength and wisdom when she spoke to the crowd and i was always happy to hear the confidence in her voice and the strength with which she carried herself throughout the week
9380536 thats got to be the best part of the week because we were so bowled over by the warm reception of the prison authorities and the hymns that the prisoners sang for us
9380537 the visit changed my views of prisoners and made me realise they are like anybody else in society and they deserve an opportunity to reform and live better lives
9380538 although i am a civil servant i never really realised how big the government machinery really is but some research made me realise how important government is to the people and society in terms of the services that it provides
9380539 we were told that the budget had been slashed and that the pwd will have to carry out its work with whatever resources it has
9380540 we didnt have a single drop of water i was born and brought up in nadi and i never gone through such an experience
9380541 with a degree of patience the united states can build on a pattern of positive change in iraq that offers it a chance to draw down troops soon without giving up hope for sustained stability
9380542 most americans have a mental image of iraq that is defined by the chaos of 2006
9380543 but iraq today is a very different place than it was two years ago
9380544 sunni insurgents overwhelmingly switched sides over the course of 2007 signing on to cease fires with the iraqi state mostly through the sons of iraq program which now includes over 100 000 participants who provide local security in exchange for legitimacy and financial support
9380545 the shiite militias especially muqtada mahdi army also know as jaish al mahdi or jam have seen their position undermined by a combination of sunni realignment u s and iraqi military pressure the increasing independence of splinter and rogue groups and a backlash against their own parasitic exploitation of the civilians they were ostensibly defending
9380546 the most violent actors iraqs extreme chauvinist sunni groups and aqi have been driven from most of western and central iraq and are losing their remaining urban havens in the provinces of diyala nineveh and salah ad din thanks to a series of offensives by u s and iraqi forces
9380547 but today there is a real chance that u s persistence in the short term can secure a stable iraq and enable major withdrawals in 2010 and 2011 without undermining that stability
9380548 could yet emerge from mesopotamia with something that may still fall well short of eden on the euphrates but that prevents the horrors of all out civil war avoids the danger of a wider war and yields a stability that endures as americans come home
9380549 we had gone past malevu village after leaving the hospital when i heard the engine
9380550 the transmission oil when it finishes you can hear in the engine as we moved a bit further in front the steering wheel became hard to move
9380551 it became more difficult as we went along i parked the vehicle and informed the passengers that there was something wrong
9380552 but as we started encountering problems i could see from the mirror that many of the women were already hitting the windows to test if they could be pushed out
9380553 they were scared and wanted to get out before anything could happen i assured them that i would seek help and get them back to navuevu as soon as possible and that we were not going to continue with the journey
9380554 the auditor general has just finished about eight of these councils reports however during the cabinet meeting interim prime minister commodore voreqe bainimarama and me were discussed how we are going deal with this concern
9380555 there is no reason why we should hide out and from now on i just like you to work with the local government department so that things can improve
9380556 i think it is a question of keeping up to the time
9380557 the local government act is really clear on how the accounts should be looked after
9380558 in may you should complete your statement and in august it should be printed in the papers to show how you have used your funds and that is simply accounting for transparency
9380559 we dont find too much required involvement for the business community in the charter
9380560 we feel the business community as a whole can support the charter and assist in any way possible
9380561 at the end of the day it will benefit the country
9380562 we feel that if the change is too drastic businesses may choose to lay off staff as it may affect the overhead costs for the business
9380563 this will lead to more unemployment and more social upheaval
9380564 we feel nothing much can be done for the current economic strain on businesses
9380565 what would be handy i guess for some businesses would be grants from the government to assist in survival in these difficult times
9380566 in order for that to happen we will need time economic and social growth as well as better management of the issues highlighted in the charter
9380567 at the end of the day the general public needs to wake up and realise they have responsibilities too
9380568 if trade bans are placed it impacts the businesses and ultimately the public
9380569 the strained relationships dont exactly help with aid and investment either

9380572 government has taken keen interest and initiative in providing these services to the ordinary citizens of this country and is optimistic for more of such events in future
9380573 we asked her to explain and she did after taking all that into account the commission decided that she be demoted one level
9380574 given the limited time available students are advised to manage time wisely attend all classes listen attentively to teachers and seek assistance for topics which may appear difficult to grasp

9380589 they were there from when we reached the village and kept visiting us
9380590 they brought flip flops clothes toothbrush tooth paste food we ate every day and had money

9380592 i just want to thank them for what they did for us
9380593 inkk mobile has identified the dilkusha home as a more than worthy cause and we are satisfied that our donation will go a long way to helping and supporting the wonderful work that the methodist church and its staff do at dilkusha

9380595 the vision of the program is that the worlds documentary heritage belongs to all and should be fully preserved and protected for all
9380596 and with due recognition of all cultures and practicalities they should be permanently accessible to all without obstacles
9380597 at a time when we are grappling with our identity as a nation the introduction of the program seems timely as it promotes a sense of citizenship and national pride as well as emphasising social cohesion amongst the various cultural groups in society
9380598 the common causes for environmental issues in the region have been rapid modernisation urban drift uncontrollable level of waste and garbage which are not recycled said mr takeshita
9380599 we need to recycle wherever possible re use as much as we can and we must always try to reduce the waste we dump on the environment
9380600 at the moment the infrastructure is unable to cope with the demand of the growing number of residents in these areas
9380601 the demand for piped water has increased and has been affected by the low water pressure in the area
9380602 we are aware of the problems being faced by the residents and we are trying our best to get water out to them
9380603 areas like nawaicoba get their water from nagado they are prone to low water pressure or intermittent supply
9380604 as for the weekend supply that has all been taken care of on saturday when two water trucks serviced the area
9380605 for water carting there is a set program we follow in servicing these areas if they get water supply today then tomorrow another area gets it
9380606 when one looks at the circumstances leading to the discharge order it is open to the possibility that the state is fishing for more evidence and endeavouring to justify the inherent weakness in the evidence to begin with

9380617 you know theyre intimidating people from even coming to the demonstrations so theyre intimidating everybody not just you know the anarchists or the whatever
9380618 theyre intimidating everybody when this news gets out from coming downtown to engage in even legally and permitted marches and the whole thing
9380619 our job is to take every dangerous item out of their hands so they cant utilize them we have extensive investigative work complete with a number of confidential reliable sources that have worked inside this area this anarchist area
9380620 we know these items were going to be used because we had sources that were working inside this organization
9380621 it looks like the minneapolis police are going to attempt and shut down this house on code violations like they shut down the convergence space in st paul
9380622 we are going to attempt to prevent that were going to attempt to reopen the convergence site you dont get to just remove people from their houses and board them up because the police dont like what youre doing inside there
9380623 when you conspire to do that its an agreement beforehand to do it the agreement itself is criminal its often what they get drug dealers for its often what they get organized crime figures for conspiracy a separate and independent crime

9380629 good or bad before others seed the media with disinformation and distortions as they most certainly will continue to do our people in the field need to tell our story only commanders can ensure the media get to the story alongside the troops we must organize for and facilitate access of national and international media to our forces including those forces engaged in ground operations
9380630 other administrations had made sporadic small scale attempts to build relationships with the occasional military analyst but these were trifling compared with what ms clarkes team had in mind don meyer an aide to ms clarke said a strategic decision was made in 2002 to make the analysts the main focus of the public relations push to construct a case for war journalists were secondary we didnt want to rely on them to be our primary vehicle to get information out mr meyer said
9380631 in a spin saturated news culture clarke argued opinion is swayed most by voices perceived as authoritative and utterly independent and so even before sept 11 she built a system within the pentagon to recruit key influentials movers and shakers from all walks who with the proper ministrations might be counted on to generate support for mr rumsfelds priorities
9380632 revolutionized the defense departments relationship with the media humanizing the bush administrations military effort and restoring respect for people in uniform
9380633 a different person in her role at the defense department might have led to very different result at a critical time
9380634 public affairs guidance pag on embedding media during possible future operations deployments in the u s central commands centcom area of responsibility aor
9380635 people were killed and theyre building on top of their bones
9380636 new orleans has experienced a profound change in who governs schools and a dramatic reduction of parent and local taxpayer control of schools
9380637 50 of them are charter schools privatized management governed by self appointed self perpetuating boards 33 are run by the state department of education through the recovery school district and only five are governed by the elected school board
9380638 there are now 42 separate school systems operating in new orleans
9380639 school policies including teacher requirements curriculum discipline policies enrollment limits and social promotions publicly accountable schools in which parents have methods for publicly redressing grievances are limited to only five schools 5 6 of the total
9380640 but the people down here need the world to understand that its still a tragic situation the rent has tripled the health care system is in shambles we have less access to education for our kids the working class and poor are being exploited while everyone at the top is getting fat off our misery
9380641 we think august 29 should be holy day not a day for business as usual
9380642 the mayor announced to the world that new orleans was open for business but were here to tell you that it is closed for families
9380643 five thousand demolished homes eight thousand new jail beds this is their one for one replacement plan for us
9380644 the front lines in the struggle against displacement and gentrification in the us
9380645 he has a rather lyrical quality which in turn motivates people persuades people that all is not lost
9380646 he uses the english language so beautifully although im not sure thats a prerequisite for a president its certainly a plus
9380647 when russia has a grievance over an issue such as south ossetia it should act multilaterally by consent rather than unilaterally by force
9380648 my message to russia is simple if you want to be welcome at the top table of organisations such as the g8 oecd and wto you must accept that with rights come responsibilities
9380649 we want russia to be a good partner in the g8 and other organisations but it cannot pick and choose which rules to adhere to
9380650 that is why i will argue tomorrow that russia should accept georgias territorial integrity and international mechanisms for addressing these conflicts and withdraw troops to their previous positions
9380651 and in the light of russian actions the eu should review root and branch our relationship with russia
9380652 we are also reflecting on the nato response we must re evaluate the alliances relationship with russia and intensify our support to georgia and others who may face russian aggression
9380653 must add urgency to the work on europes energy agenda
9380654 we must more rapidly build relationships with other producers of oil and gas
9380655 it is very important for the eu now to reassess its relationship with russia and send a very clear message
9380656 i do not think the measures looked at tomorrow should be cheap or quick this requires clear and united and patient firmness over a sustained period of time
9380657 it is wrong that it is now easier for russian citizens to get visas into european countries than it is for georgians
9380658 georgia is a transparent democracy an open society russia is clearly going in the wrong direction in that respect
9380659 i think weve got to make clear our displeasure about the way in which russia has acted outrageously
9380660 but if by doing so in a particular way and with particular language we drive russia into isolation then sulking russia in isolation will be even more difficult to deal with
9380661 and thats why when people talk about expulsion from the g8 and things of that kind i think theyve got to understand what the possible consequences of that would be to the russian governments attitude
9380662 russia has become the aggressor it has gone from claiming to defend russian passport holders in regions of georgia to seeking the break up of the state showing disregard for the principles of modern international relations
9380663 the immediate instinct of the prime minister and i was clear to speak out against aggression to call for respect for human rights and international law and to rally world opinion behind these principles
9380664 put an end to attempts to use the situation surrounding georgia to raise tensions in europe by speculating on non existent threats concerning other post soviet countries
9380665 i think there will probably a tendency for the democrats to do the same thing
9380666 they will assume that her lack of experience on the national stage will put her at a disadvantage and im not certain that will matter
9380667 shes not prepared to be governor how can she be prepared to be vice president or president
9380668 look at what shes done to this state what would she do to the nation
9380669 in this very competitive election for them to go pick somebody who is under a cloud of suspicion who is under investigation for abuse of power it just sounds like a pretty slow start to me
9380670 we need a vice president who can step in if god forbid something happened to john mccain
9380671 i dont think shes someone who is ready for that 3 a m phone call
9380672 for us to get our message out in what the state has to offer to the nation
9380673 when i first heard it i thought wow thats great for alaska then i thought wait what just happened because of course the lack of experience does jump out at you
9380674 you really have to have a high level of respect for gov palin in the sense that she has this real ability to connect with people and suddenly people dont think about health care they dont think about the economy they dont think about whatever else education
9380675 itll be interesting to see if that recipe works on the national stage
9380676 gov palin has proven herself as a bright energetic leader for our state and will bring the same energy to the vice presidency she will serve our country with distinction the first alaskan and first woman on the republican ticket i share in the pride of all alaskans
9380677 i said to walt this cant be happening because his advance team didnt come to alaska to check her out
9380678 were not a very big state people i talk to would have heard something
9380679 it seems almost like a hail mary pass at the end of a football game
9380680 alaskans will now have a chance to have somebody talking about resources our undeveloped resources
9380681 a mixed set of emotions kind of an odd sense of alaska nationalism or pride
9380682 this is like watching a moon landing or something its just something you dont expect to see very often its wonderful
9380683 it was an emotional thing to see the governor walk out with her family and i say wow i work for her

9380685 mahdi army announces keeping up the fight and its rebellion against the order to freeze its activities
9380686 the poor turnout of electors at the registration offices has motivated some politicians and parties to have recourse to sistani in order to correct peoples attitudes
9380687 the peoples lack of confidence in the authorities and the worsening of the crisis in government services are among the main reasons behind the peoples desisting from registering their names at the election offices
9380688 the withdrawal of the multinational forces should be by a defined deadline and in the meantime during their presence there should be iraqi control over legal and operational matters

9380693 jesse never tested positive for a steroid or any other performance enhancing drug

9380695 all the specific details are confidential theres not a lot i can add in terms of details im disappointed but i look forward to having him back
9380696 but at the same time i respect the program the league has in place one violation and there are consequences

9380724 o you who believe fasting has been prescribed for you as it was prescribed for those before you so that you may become muttaqoon the pious
9380725 when the month of ramadaan starts the gates of jannah paradise are opened and the gates of hell are closed and satans are chained
9380726 he who observed the fasts of the month of ramadaan out of sincerity and hoping for the reward from allah he will have his past sins forgiven
9380727 he who does not give up forged speech and evil actions allah does not need his refraining from eating and drinking
9380728 so whoever of you sights the crescent of the first night of the month of ramadaan he must fast that month
9380729 a bedouin came to the messenger of allah sallallahu alaihi wa sallam and reported
9380730 the people were seeking the new moon having sighted it myself i reported to the prophet sallallahu alaihi wa sallam he began his fast and ordered the people to begin theirs too
9380731 fast when it the moon is seen and cease fasting when it is seen so if it is concealed by clouds then complete thirty days of shabaan
9380732 none of you should start ramadaan by fasting a day or two before it except for a man fasting his usual fast then let him fast that day
9380733 fast if you wish and break it if you wish
9380734 do not condemn one who observes fast or one who does not observe it in a journey for the messenger of allah sallallahu alaihi wa sallam observed fast in a journey or he did not observe it too
9380735 you are going to meet your enemy in the morning abstaining from fasting is better for your strength so break your fast
9380736 take the meal of suhoor because there is blessing in it
9380737 the people will not cease to be upon good as long as they hasten in breaking their fast
9380738 indeed there is for the fasting person when he breaks his fast a supplication which is not rejected

9380829 gee john thanks a bunch im flattered really and yes i am a woman and a pro gun and pro choice lesbian single mother and i understand how maverick that seems but dont you think somebody else with any kind of knowledge or experience might be better sure youre right i know i could get you some of the lezzie vote perhaps even some young vote since i teach and a few angry hillarist votes because i have a vagina but do these things really qualify me to be vp sure i lecture in classrooms and have given talks keynotes and even two commencement addresses and yes im a big mouth from jersey whose not afraid to land a verbal punch or two but a debate against joe biden holy crap joe biden im mean if we were discussing the structure of a short story or the pov of character or even whether a setting is a metaphor for life well i might have a fucking chance but john im with you im cant tell a suni from a shia and have no clue where the border of afghanistan touches iraq im afraid ill pee myself right up there at the podium true they make depends for a reason but do ya really think that at this time of the world the nation that im really the right person for this job i mean our national security is at stake our standing on the global stage is at stake i know jack shit about iraq foreign policy the economy ive only been governing classrooms in sarahs case snow for twelve years please dont ask me to do this pick kay or condi or what about olympia even the dems like her not me please john take a nap and think about it
9380830 what do you think i work out to every day i know the whole thing by heart
9380831 making sure that our policies of enforcement dont make it where our drivers cant express themselves
9380832 the fans are definitely more enamored in whats happening and whats going on now
9380833 theyre a whole lot more immersed in the drama of it they really feed off of that
9380834 jared turner nascar erred in placing busch edwards on probation
9380835 i feel really close and a lot of those not so great runs have been self inflicted
9380836 speeding at pocono we had a great car caught the air hose at michigan and had to do a pass through a couple others were stupid stuff that happened so i think that when the chase comes if we make it i feel pretty confident we can put together 10 flawless races
9380837 i feel like i can as a driver i dont know if our 10 flawless races is gonna be enough to win the title or not as of right now it doesnt look like it is because the 18 of kyle busch and the 99 of carl edwards are a little bit faster than we are but theyre gonna have to put together 10 flawless races also hopefully our 10 best races we can put together are gonna be good enough if we can get ourselves in these next couple of races
9380838 ironically enough in 06 if the point system was like it is today we would have made it
9380839 we missed it in 07 by a little bit so im glad that were on our way back to getting ourselves in and i think we can be a tremendous amount better right now than where were at i think we could be third in points or fourth in points if we just got some of those finishes
9380840 there are a handful of them that are just such dumb things
9380841 thats the difference between this year and 06 and 07
9380842 in 06 and 07 we didnt have a fast enough car i said the exact same thing denny hamlin said two weeks ago word for word we dont deserve a chase spot because we werent running good enough to get it we just werent we were just gonna take up space we were gonna take up oxygen being one of the 12 and thats exactly how i felt the last two years

9380846 does anyone in america doubt that kerry has a higher iq than george w bush im sure the candidates sats and college transcripts would put kerry far ahead
9380847 our center of gravity public support is in jeopardy because of doubts that our iraq efforts are on a trajectory leading to success
9380848 the blind boys of alabama yeah theyre really good at what they do theyre not so good at the things they dont do like cover versions of bloc party songs which is probably why they dont do them
9380849 more liberal lies my friends id like to address the myth that the 04 presidential election was close how can you call it close when bush won the popular vote by 240
9380850 when i stood in front of the camera and asked for god to unleash the heavens and drench obama during his acceptance speech i was kind of making a little joke if people took it seriously i regret it but i learned something that i should have already known god doesnt like funny hurricane gustav is going to cause a lot of heartache and im afraid theres nobody to blame but me
9380851 the man is an idiot no hes worse than an idiot
9380852 he might even be in cahoots with howard dean for all i know all i know for sure is that stuart shepard has provided the mainstream media with a good excuse to give less coverage to the republican convention i do agree with shepards conclusion though he is damned
9380853 everybody knows that when i talk god listens and this time i crossed the line and said something that he was simply not amused by the blame is all mine and now im damned as a motherfucker theres no need for me to watch my language anymore you can only go to hell once

9380860 what has happened in singur is unfortunate for west bengal for india and for all progressive indians
9380861 this event will unleash fear and uncertainty in the minds of all investors indian and foreign and ais likely to be a stumbling block in the excellent gdp growth india has demonstrated in the last decade
9380862 it is time that all well intentioned indians stand up and demand a peaceful logical and constructive way of settling the issue of farmland in singur and elsewhere in india
9380863 the economic forces at play in shrinking demand and improving supply facilities may cool down crude oil prices further which would lead to a narrower than estimated current account deficit its a good positive sign for the economy
9380864 what we are seeing in the contemporary indian art market is what is happening in the contemporary art market the world over theres excitement about this brand of art globally its a global market place boundaries are becoming narrower with digital media collectors are forever getting passionate while looking for innovative forms of artistic expression
9380865 top overseas collectors like frank cohen francois pinault and charles saatchi who are known for their western art acquisitions are now fast stocking up indian art and art from diverse countries this breed of collectors are taste makers in their own right this reflects the international society in which we now live
9380866 contemporary art both indian and from other regions is perceived to be more international and avant garde than the other forms this younger generation of artists seem to be connecting more closely with their collectors the collectors identify with these works one finds a thirst and hunger to collect such creations
9380867 he is seen to be at the same level as other western artists gupta maybe is influenced by artists from the west but his technique is unmistakably his own
9380868 the quality of works is the major focus masterpieces invariably fetch higher prices
9380869 this market is still developing and well wait for it to become more commercially viable to hold such an auction
9380870 there is clear evidence that indian buyers are extremely active at sothebys and we believe that these collectors would also be interested in hirst from the corporate standpoint sothebys is completely focused on india
9380871 i dont care about your problem or you as a customer
9380872 as you remember during hurricane katrina we didnt have a system like that in place and it was very difficult for families to locate family members
9380873 i dont know how much were going to sell them for now but the price is going to have to go up
9380874 weve been out of food since yesterday the people outside are screaming
9380875 life is like living in a cloud for us we never know what is going to happen
9380876 every day the situation is getting worse the people are planting and waiting for food when these hurricanes go through
9380877 ceos salaries and benefits are getting fatter and fatter while workers face soaring gas prices foreclosures and rising health care costs
9380878 the employee free choice act gives workers the freedom to form a union so they can earn better wages retirement security and health care coverage
9380879 i may not be perfect but parts of me are pretty awesome
9380880 this is worse than katrina it has the potential to do damage in every part of our city katrinas footprint was 400 miles this footprint is 900 miles and growing
9380881 this could be the most horrific thing that ever happens in this country
9380882 it wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster
9380883 didnt we just go through that and i still owed so i paid with my debit card and said i would get it all straightened out later
9380884 i pledge that tomorrow night and if necessary throughout our convention if necessary to act as americans not republicans because america needs us now no matter whether we are republican or democrat
9380885 all strategic contracts in georgia especially the contract for the caspian pipeline are a matter of survival for the georgian state
9380886 what the americans call humanitarian cargoes of course they are bringing in weapons
9380887 someone in the united states created this conflict to stir up the situation and to create an advantage for one of the candidates

9380899 maps are never value free images except in the narrowest euclidean sense they are not in themselves either true or false both in the selectivity of their content and in their signs and styles of representation maps are a way of conceiving articulating and structuring the human world which is biased towards promoted by and exerts influence upon sets of social relations by accepting such premises it becomes easier to see how appropriate they are to manipulation by the powerful in society
9380900 but well move on were not out of it we have to run good no doubt about that the bad finishes will kill you you have got to win to make up for those
9380901 you hate to gain them that way but at this point well take them any way we can get them
9380902 we were off all night long all weekend long i just couldnt get comfortable in the car it was real finicky to an adjustment but we raced hard and made smart decisions
9380903 we were 240 behind clint coming into this so i guess 30 a night would be great but its hard to pick up 30 points on clint every week
9380904 our mission is to win the championship thats what we run this 60 car for thats what were trying to do so that was a positive night for us
9380905 the opportunity came up to go tour it and so i was all for it
9380906 we did everything from walking through the makeup trailer to go into the autopsy room and the morgue and every bit of it was cool
9380907 i think that is one thing i could do if i could hold my breath long enough
9380908 no probably not its cool to watch it exaggerated on monday nights
9380909 catch me if you can busch outmuscles edwards for nationwide win
9380910 my priority remains signing with the rangers and finishing the job i came here to do two years ago ive spoken with tom renney and have told him that im willing to accept whatever role he thinks is best for the team
9380911 i want to stay in new york because i believe i can contribute but if that door closes ill have some other interesting options to consider
9380912 i dont know if everything is on hold because of mats sundin
9380913 it seems like his situation has frozen teams around the league
9380914 my priority remains signing with the rangers and finishing the job i came here to do two years ago ive spoken with tom renney and have told him that im willing to accept whatever role he thinks is best for the team
9380915 hey ill take whatever i can get from you guys
9380916 government has fired most of the 862 private contractors from dozens of companies working on the railhead project and only a skeleton crew remains
9380917 there is a lot of interest on voinov he talked already to five or six nhl teams
9380918 the next under 18 championships in kazan next april will be very important for him
9380919 we dont know what will happen at the draft because the russian federation has no agreement i think it hurts a lot the russian players because now the nhl teams will probably think twice before drafting russians
9380920 we have a three year contract this is a problem we want to re write it with the club of chelyabinsk but i think that they dont like this idea at least we can talk at least we can ask the permission
9380921 we do consider the possibility for vyacheslav to play major junior in north america
9380922 from there we will see what is the best for him we also must consider that he is playing in the superleague regularly and now on the first line
9380923 the rangers still have some room so why not use it
9380924 memories like the corners of my mind misty water coloured memories of the way we were scattered pictures of the smiles we left behind smiles we gave to one another for the way we were
9380925 im not taking the tardis anywhere near chiswick too risky and as for how im going to get there do any of your employees fancy a road trip
9380926 shes shes been better dreams you know wakes up frustrated when she cant remember weve done our best but
9380927 are you okay what are you and that bloke doing in there anyway
9380928 i was joking wasnt i to even suggest that she could ever think of me that way
9380929 and i do not look fiftysomething in human years despite what one particular person might claim no more than 43 id say if that
9380930 oh i think you could say that you know me very well indeed doctor
9380931 and you say im a doctor you know ive thought that before it just feels right to me to be called doctor
9380932 come with me and youll find out a lot more about yourself
9380933 were we i mean you and i were we involved
9380934 yes we most certainly were now do be quiet and stop bouncing around youre like an out of control yo yo
9380935 but isnt that the room with all that weird stuff in it
9380936 and while youre at it please lie on the bed and position your arms over your head by the handcuffs
9380937 yes im sure the handcuffs will help you remember and if they dont we can always try the whips and chains if youre a good boy i might even let you tie me up next time
9380938 i come here to enjoy a quiet swim and find you here skinny dipping
9380939 i dont remember what happened on zeroc minor as ive told you before
9380940 not really now would you please leave me to my work
9380941 no no i didnt mean that i was thinking maybe since were alone that we could
9380942 because we havent done it in a long time and it might help you by taking your mind off of escape for a little while because we are lovers now arent we
9380943 you thought wrong the first time was necessary to our survival the second time i was intoxicated and i dont even remember it that clearly
9380944 im a time lord and you are a human we are completely different species in a moment of weakness i may have given in to some primal mating urge but that doesnt mean anything you arent attractive to me
9380945 its not your fault ive never been attracted to a human lets stay friends peri
9380946 as i stated before what id really like is for you to think of me as an uncle or a teacher totally platonic and harmless
9380947 oh can i swing on the swings while you watch the sunrise

9380949 steady jo now then young woman you arent quite what i was expecting
9380950 does that mean you know how to get back to your own time then doctor
9380951 doctor this isnt the person who came to assassinate sir reginald last night is it
9380952 who said anything about assassination i just came to find the doctor although not this doctor
9380953 suppose you tell me what you are doing here and when my people began handing out devices that can manipulate the time vortex
9380954 jo why dont you get our visitor im sorry i dont know your name
9380955 i believe you were going to explain your presence here
9380956 gwen says shes picking up some unusual signals on the rift monitor
9380957 did gwen say if there was any indication of what it is
9380958 i dont know much about it im afraid it belongs to jack we programmed it to track your psychokinetic energy and i hoped it would take me straight to you i mean the incarnation of you that i know
9380959 sir reginald thats who you thought id come to assassinate
9380960 last night an intruder broke into the house despite the presence of an armed guard of unit soldiers
9380961 the intruder attempted to kill sir reginald before vanishing like a ghost
9380962 and you thought id come to make a second attempt
9380963 since you suddenly appeared out of thin air and in the very room where the intruder is known to have disappeared so dramatically last night jo naturally jumped to the conclusion that you were here to make a second attempt
9380964 i noticed that when i mentioned unit you seemed to recognise the name
9380965 oh im not a soldier not really im employed as a civilian
9380966 yet you have the military habit of observation and watchfulness i am quite sure you could describe the contents and occupants of this room in considerable detail if necessary
9380967 the description you give of the being who took my future self does not recall anyone that i have encountered so far
9380968 never mind hopefully the next time i jump ill find my doctor
9380969 if i dont ill just keep looking for him until i do find him
9380970 have you eaten lately travelling in the vortex unprotected by a vessel will exhaust you
9380971 well why dont you and jo go and see what is in the kitchen you should take some rations with you apples or pears since theyre naturally high in sugar it would be best not to take soft fruit as it probably wont withstand the pressures in the vortex
9380972 but ive got to get him back you must understand that
9380973 well you know how important the doctor is to earth dont you how he keeps stopping aliens from invading or if they do invade he talks them out of staying
9380974 well then besides if your doctor was in trouble wouldnt you do everything in your power to help him
9380975 i thought so well its the same for me i may not travel with him full time now im working for unit but i still care about him and i know we need him back
9380976 miles and years actually its a bad habit of mine sometimes
9380977 mine too the doctor gets a bit exasperated by me sometimes
9380978 and of course he never does anything exasperating does he
9380979 i knocked on the door of his lab and went in and he told me not today thank you i didnt know it at the time but hed assumed it was the tea lady knocking so i peered around the door feeling a bit nervous because he sounded a bit stern but before i could even begin to introduce myself properly he interrupted me again i sort of hesitated half way between the door and his workbench not quite sure what i should do because the brigadier had sent me to see the doctor and given me a file to show him he was quite focused on his experiment and i didnt really like to interrupt but then it started smoking and so i threw the file onto the end of the workbench and grabbed the fire extinguisher to put out the blaze
9380980 oh not a bit of it he started going on about how id ruined it that it was three months of delicate work completely ruined he called me ham fisted and when i pointed out that the whole lab might have gone up he started talking about steady state micro welding and engineers with nine opposable digits almost as if he was trying to blind me with science of course he wasnt really he just assumes everyone knows what hes talking about all the time he was really quite cross though and when i told him that i was his new assistant he was pretty horrified
9380981 which wasnt surprising i suppose since id just destroyed three months work in one blast of the fire extinguisher so then i tried to impress him telling him i was a fully qualified agent that i know cryptology safe breaking and explosives but he wasnt very impressed he asked if i was trained in fire fighting and then told me he needed a scientist
9380982 over six foot tall and very skinny hes got brown eyes and crazy wild brown hair that he has a habit of ruffling when hes frustrated or thinking
9380983 he usually wears a two piece suit with a shirt and tie and baseball boots and a long brown coat
9380984 thanks for the tea and the sandwich i really ought to be moving on now
9380985 you are welcome good luck with finding the doctor your doctor take care of yourself
9380986 what do you think you are doing standing in the middle of the road
9380987 dr jones what are you doing here in the middle of the welsh countryside
9380988 the same thing i was doing the last time we met
9380989 i take it your presence here means you are no further forward in your quest
9380990 no im not in fact ive just left you at sir reginald styles house on the night you were expecting an unknown assassin to turn up
9380991 i should have recalibrated your vortex manipulator so it only finds me once in any body if i dont your task will take considerably longer since i have spent a fair amount of time on earth you could waste a good deal of time encountering the same body over and over again particularly at this stage in my life
9380992 and very frustrating especially if you were to keep running into my previous self
9380993 hes a foolish little fellow little better than a space hobo
9380994 hows jo i was surprised not to see her with you
9380995 why dont you tell me about your work with unit i would be interested to learn what the organisation is like in the future
9380996 i mean wouldnt it be dangerous for you to have knowledge of their future
9380997 no need for that dr jones if what ive heard is true i should be saluting you
9380998 you did an excellent job of defeating the master im very proud of you proud to have you working as a member of this organisation
9380999 come on lets find ourselves a quiet corner and you can tell me all about this new doctor i missed seeing
9381000 now now none of that sir nonsense you must call me alistair
9381001 i shall be watching your career with considerable interest dr jones i predict great things for you
9381002 is he now hmm well i daresay hes earned it hes a good chap at heart even if he is too inclined to shoot first and ask questions later
9381003 he admitted to me that he was a trifle trigger happy when he first found out about aliens
9381004 we try to use diplomacy before we send in the men and women with guns of course that doesnt always work or events escalate far quicker than anyone can anticipate
9381005 i am glad to hear that diplomacy plays a part
9381006 perhaps lethbridge stewart and the others will learn something from me after all
9381007 its a long drive from wales to london especially in the dark
9381008 so i thought id stop for a meal and a break would you care to join me
9381009 sorry i think i had forgotten what it felt like to be out of my own time
9381010 i am sure you will get used to it again my dear
9381011 ill have to if im to get my doctor back
9381012 that reminds me you had better let me have your travel gadget so i can recalibrate it
9381013 we shall be able to talk more privately in there
9381014 i would like to know more about how you end up travelling with me
9381015 and that gave you the urge to travel in time and space did it
9381016 i thought it was just a one off never to be repeated experience until you the later you that is turned up and chatted me up
9381017 id just left the pub where my brother leos 21st birthday party had been held and he was leaning on the corner of a building opposite grinning at me then he offered to take me on just one trip to thank me for saving his life and so he could road test his new sonic screwdriver
9381018 shes a steady girl even if she does sometimes rush in blindly but she always means well and sometimes she completely ignores my instructions and goes off quietly to do just what she meant to do all along
9381019 but shes gone off to marry some professor and go off exploring in the amazon willy nilly
9381020 you live for centuries were lucky to manage just one most of us
9381021 i know its just that i was not expecting her to go so suddenly
9381022 in other circumstances i might have asked you to travel with me but youve more important things to do
9381023 ive enjoyed talking with you if you speak to jo again please give her my best wishes for her married life thank you for your help and for the meal

9381037 i was contacted by a variety of investigators buffs cranks proponents and detractors alike james oberg a frequent mouthpiece for certain nasa projects and self styled ufo debunker wrote to disparage my story and to ask provocatively since you obviously feel free to discuss top secret ufo data what would you be willing to say about other top secret aspects of the atlas warhead which you alluded to briefly i told mr oberg where to put his misplaced cynicism
9381038 cmon james oberg if you plan to continue writing your skeptical ufo articles under the guise of proper scientific literature please be fair first the omni readership should be aware that not only are you working with nasa but you are a u s air force officer in fine standing as well in fact while i knew you as captain oberg i shouldnt doubt you are now major oberg as a former usaf staff sergeant i can appreciate that and wish to congratulate you if you have achieved a higher rank your consistently skeptical articles are probably making some of your superiors far happier than anything you might write to the contrary
9381039 how sad to see such a poor article on ufos in omnis first issue james oberg is certainly not an objective authority on the subject his article tries to come across as unbiased but even someone with a superficial knowledge of the issue can see that it is laced with distortion and innuendo if ufo update is representative of the type of coverage controversial issues will receive in the future then omni has little to offer a questioning mind

9381042 the committee for the scientific investigation of claims of the paranormal is an organization of people who oppose what they contend is pseudo science csicop contrary to its impressive sounding title does not sponsor scientific research on the contrary its main function has been to oppose scientific research especially in areas such as psychic phenomena and ufos two topics that coincidentally or not have been of demonstrated interest to the u s intelligence community over the decades instead csicop devotes nearly all of its resources to influencing the american public via the mass media
9381043 csicop can accurately be described as a propaganda organization because it does not take anything approaching an objective position regarding ufos
9381044 csicops public stance on ufos is best personified by the late philip j klass head of the organizations ufo subcommittee klass isnt a scientist in fact his education is in electrical engineering after graduation from iowa state university in 1941 he went to work for the avionics division of general electric one of the nations largest weapons and nuclear energy contractors in 1952 klass joined the aerospace trade publication where he has often written about black budget military projects such as those covertly funded by the cia over the decades klass has made a name for himself publicly sparring with ufo researchers and injecting his particular spin on ufos into the mass media at every opportunity not always accurately or with much scientific merit despite his lack of scientific credentials klass has enjoyed remarkable popularity with the news media
9381045 both men have worked with me and gotten to know me through my efforts for hansen whose diligent journalistic investigation of csicop goes well beyond that conducted by any ufo researcher observes
9381046 under cross examination klass had gone from claiming the government cant keep secrets to saying that it can it must and even that his own publication had been complicit in keeping government secrets klass did not appear very happy about the course this conversation had taken and he soon reverted back to his initial claim that ufos did not exist a charitable view of klass is that he is simply a zealot another of those for whom scientific dogma supplies the reassuring psychological bedrock that others find in religious fundamentalism when confronted with evidence that calls into question his core beliefs klass responds as any fundamentalist would by rejecting the evidence thus his duplicity can be accounted for by human nature one does not need to resort to more conspiratorial explanations
9381047 klass also has many of the qualifications one would expect in a deep cover propagandist
9381048 we are meeting in secret with a congressional committee if these meetings were public it would prove
9381049 look im not a bigot i just have serious religious convictions tm and they compel me to do things i can still play canasta with the people whose lives im committed to screwing up because really i like them but we have ideological differences i think theyre evil sinners who need to be legislated against so that they dont corrupt the children tm and they think theyre perfectly normal human beings like me who deserve all of the rights i have see just friends who disagree on a few minor points im still a nice person right right

9381081 winning in overtime is a mentality and its all about who wants to put the ball in the back of the net first
9381082 i am very confident with our team in overtime and i think we are strong mentally and physically
9381083 the player that feels confident and wants the game in their hands is the one that steps up and lindsay stepped up and put that ball in the net like a champion
9381084 they tell you not to mess with something that works and i put it right there
9381085 i was extremely proud that we had the opportunity to play everyone for the second consecutive game

9381094 weatheractions solar based forecast indicators suggest that gustavs power as it hits the us coast in the coming day or so is likley to be lower than current predictions of standard meteorology and the track a bit further west
9381095 the important thing about katrina was that on the day it made landfall our solar magnetic based forecast factors indicated an increase in storm power which partly negated the loss of power which occurs anyway as storms hit land
9381096 irrespective of solar or other natural factors katrina which was a category 3 as it hit land not the higher vales often claimed was really an engineering and poor infrastructure caused disaster presented later by polticians as a consequence of alleged man made climate change gustav may turn out the same way because work on levees is insufficient however the good news for new orleans is that it might well be less bad than current standard meteorological expectations the authorites are still right to evacuate as a precaution especially in view of questions about levees however it may be that in future with further advances in forecasting science long medium and short range more precise landfall tracks may be predicable so less people will have to move out in the face of landfalling storms

9381389 without urgent action we risk sleepwalking into an energy dependance on less stable or reliable partners
9381390 the players look forward to it and i think everybody in the state looks forward to it
9381391 we are disappointed by cus decision as we believe the series ultimately belongs in denver
9381392 however in light of cus decision to play the 2009 game in boulder we believe we owe it to colorado state university our alumni fans students and the city of fort collins to bring the 2010 game back to hughes stadium
9381393 i have a lot of fond memories at invesco right now hopefully many many more
9381394 this is the big show the dance just walking out of the tunnel and looking up and seeing the bronco head in the end zone its just a surreal feeling
9381395 you can see two ways as far as an opener you can get one that maybe is a little easier than going out against a bcs school but this is a perfect game to play this is as good a setting as there is in college football and it would be a shame if we ruined it
9381396 this is a time when we have to do away with our party politics and we have to act as americans
9381397 we are working with the delegations financial people finance committees many other concerned individuals to do what we can to raise money for various charities that operate in the gulf coast region
9381398 our thoughts and prayers are with those on the gulf coast and we hope for the best for all those affected by hurricane gustav in the coming days we are also prepared to show the world the results of more than two years of planning for the republican national convention sundays announcement does not change our intent to host a safe and successful convention
9381399 im happy to report to you that the coordination and the work thats being done at all levels appears to be excellent
9381400 i have every expectation that we will not see the mistakes of katrina repeated
9381401 we are going to march into the arms of police whatever they are going to do is all right with us
9381402 we both planned to do this if we could make it this far
9381403 we want to make it very clear we are pro soldier and anti war
9381404 i can lock up my house and scream about it or i can come here
9381405 its pretty clear that the point is to get organizers out of the picture
9381406 well take any delegate that would like to go back
9381407 the mccain campaign has assured me this is the first priority
9381408 im trying to get my family out of there and stay here for the week
9381409 as important as this convention is the safety and welfare of american citizens is the no 1 priority so everything is being adjusted but not canceled
9381410 i just felt nervous having them there in this storm and me not being there
9381411 the message to the people of the gulf coast is this storm is dangerous
9381412 theres a real possibility of flooding storm surge and high winds do not put yourself in harms way or make rescue workers take unnecessary risks
9381413 theres a lot of preparations that have gone in in anticipation of this storm
9381414 i think we are showing that we are ready for this storm i cant stop the damage from happening and we cant stop the storm from coming in what we can do is be ready as possible making sure were ready the states are ready and the local communities are ready
9381415 everything they need from the federal government to prepare for what all anticipate will be a difficult situation
9381416 theyve made it through great challenges in the past and theyre going to make it through this one
9381417 need to understand that in a storm of this size there is serious risk of significant flooding
9381418 going to be in some ways more challenging than katrina

9381420 mann darabaka 3ala khaddaka el ayman fadorr laho el aysar
9381421 checking in and getting ready to go through this again with him
9381422 this is probably the case with almost any emergency which is as soon as you make contact with the enemy the plan starts to suffer some alterations
9381423 going to be in some ways more challenging than katrina
9381424 will test parts of the levee that were not tested during katrina
9381425 but there are still a lot of vulnerabilities this could be a a much worse storm hopefully it wont be but the possibilities are definitely there

9381427 you have to prepare for the worst sometimes and hope for the best
9381428 that particular group wasnt here to express any first amendment rights they were here to kind of wreak havoc and cause some damage downtown and thats why we took the swift action
9381429 i was calling my wife and telling her i think im going to be arrested
9381430 i saw a line of police three deep and we saw all of them putting on gas masks
9381431 other than the one main instance we didnt have too many problems
9381432 youve got to throw a lot to the groups themselves that made it happen this way
9381433 we were told by the courts and by the police that we could not march to the pepsi center and lo and behold there we were at the pepsi center
9381434 but it is bad for californias environment and it will be bad for the california taxpayer
9381435 its never a good idea to push through controversial legislation that will require the taxpayers to borrow billions of dollars while the legislature struggles with a multi billion budget deficit in the last days of the session
9381436 this almost always results in the generation of poor public policy
9381437 this state has billions of dollars in unmet safe drinking water waste water treatment water conservation and watershed restoration needs
9381438 and yet this bond provides relatively paltry funding for these more pressing needs while proposing billions for dams that would only benefit a few
9381439 the states own water plan shows that dams are the most costly and one of the least productive water strategies available
9381440 the bottom line is that taxpayers are being asked to foot the bill for dams when californias 100 billion dollar agribusiness industry can well afford to pay for the facilities on their own
9381441 the ag industry has not offered to pay a cent for these costly and questionable projects
9381442 if it is placed on the statewide ballot voters should resoundingly reject it
9381443 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
9381444 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
9381445 remained on 692 screens and fell just one tenth of a percent from last weekend grossing 3 00 million and taking its total to 12 78 million
9381446 i never said that this is what ive been saying all along
9381447 the beauty of arsenal today is to see the transformation of these talented young men into world beaters right in front of our very eyes
9381448 they the board have to maintain their collective nerve under external pressure from the media and red amp white
9381449 you have to be the most naive twat ive ever come across you c nt
9381450 eboue is a powerful skillful player i just think there is an element who sees him as an obstruction to theee oh so the vilification starts as an attempt to get him out the way

9381698 dr senge what would you like to say to christian pastors to a group of christian pastors
9381699 well i was in a bookstore the other day and i asked the bookstore manager what the most popular books were he said the most popular books right now were books on eastern religions so i want to know why that is the case in america
9381700 dr senge why do you think this is the case
9381701 i think its because christianity currently presents itself as a system of beliefs and buddhism presents itself as a way of life
9381702 my husband has moved out i just wanted you to know that so it isnt awkward that hes not there
9381703 evidence of self centeredness resulting in the destruction of long good marriages and real flesh and blood families
9381704 i dreaded those gut wrenching moments when i first realized again that my husband was having an affair that he would not end it and that my life was crumbling all around me
9381705 the sick in my heart sick to my stomach deep sighing kind of pain i was feeling was something i had never experienced
9381706 i wanted to tell him i hope your penis turns black and falls off and you get some terrible disease
9381707 none of us in the radical women support group were perfect wives
9381708 tried everything to make him give up his girlfriend and come back to the family
9381709 i was so upset about how this divorce would affect my christian influence that i wanted to make sure people knew that i tried everything to keep our marriage together i wanted them to know that i think marriage is a sacred trust that cannot be dissolved lightly
9381710 i went from an utterly heartbroken despairing condition to bitterness and rage and finally to a place of joy hope and happiness
9381711 waste precious time trying to convince people about how terrible your ex husband was or is
9381712 the latest development in the socialized church is its service as a welfare agency the negro in his religious development has not yet gone so far as the white man in divesting christian duty of spiritual ministration and reducing it as a mere service for social uplift but he gradually realized the necessity for connecting the church more closely with the things of this world to make it a decent place to live in in other words if man is his brothers keeper the church the important institution in the community must be the keeper of other institutions if it would build in men christian character it must influence the more or less direct control of the forces in the community which prevent the attainment of such an end if men are to be saved they must be saved for service not merely for their refuge at the last hour the church then must not let a man destroy himself and accept him when he is no longer useful because of the loss of physical and mental power through depravity but by preaching the gospel of prevention it must save man from himself
9381713 hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth
9381714 thus saith the lord for three transgressions of israel and for four i will not turn away the punishment thereof because they sold the righteous for silver and the poor for a pair of shoes that pant after the dust of the earth on the head of the poor and turn aside the way of the meek and a man and his father will go in unto the same maid to profane my holy name and they lay themselves down upon clothes laid to pledge by every altar and they drink the wine of the condemned in the house of their god
9381715 wherefore have we fasted say they and thou seest not wherefore have we afflicted our soul and thou takest no knowledge behold in the day of your fast ye find pleasure and exact all your labours behold ye fast for strife and debate and to smite with the fist of wickedness ye shall not fast as ye do this day to make your voice to be heard on high is it such a fast that i have chosen a day for a man to afflict his soul is it to bow down his head as a bulrush and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him wilt thou call this a fast and an acceptable day to the lord is not this the fast that i have chosen to loose the bands of wickedness to undo the heavy burdens and to let the oppressed go free and that ye break every yoke is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry and that thou bring the poor that are cast out to thy house when thou seest the naked that thou cover him and that thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh then shall thy light break forth as the morning and thine health shall spring forth speedily and thy righteousness shall go before thee the glory of the lord shall be thy reward then shalt thou call and the lord shall answer thou shalt cry and he shall say here i am if thou take away from the midst of thee the yoke the putting forth of the finger and speaking vanity and if thou draw out thy soul to the hungry and satisfy the afflicted soul then shall thy light rise in obscurity and thy darkness be as the noonday and the lord shall guide thee continually and satisfy thy soul in drought and make fat thy bones and thou shalt be like a watered garden and like a spring of water whose waters fail not and they that shall be of thee shall build the old waste places thou shalt raise up the foundations of many generations and thou shalt be called the repairer of the breach the restorer of paths to dwell in

9381737 while many community sites provide a piece of the puzzle you should be able to start at and either find the information youre looking for or find a link to a site that gets you to it
9381738 the eyes of all look to you and you give them their food in due season you open your hand satisfying the desire of every living thing
9381739 the chances of infection spreading are more because of this
9381740 ramadan will provide an opportunity for the spread of the disease if we do not take measures now
9381741 because many will use the mosque pond for ablutions and those fasting will also be drinking more water the message that water needs to be covered has to be repeated often
9381742 when they brought him here his platelet count had gone down to 26 000
9381743 but after supportive therapy that included injecting fluids intravenously to prevent dehydration and a lot of rest his platelet count increased to 70 000 and his fever has also gone down
9381744 dengue is a self limiting disease in 80 percent of cases people do not develop any symptoms even for those who develop haemorrhagic fever it is curable if people come for treatment at an early stage and dont wait till they are on their death bed
9381745 if the platelet count is monitored and the patient transfused in very dire cases then there is little to worry about
9381746 because of pre existing problems especially if a person is suffering from other chronic or debilitating diseases
9381747 apart from four general wards that can accommodate dengue patients we have 250 medicated mosquito nets and a ward exclusively for dengue patients if there is an outbreak
9381748 fortunate to be married to a man who earns nearly 20 000 rupees approx us 266 a month as a draughtsman
9381749 we owe over rs 6 000 about us 78 now and cant afford to pay it back
9381750 ramadan is approaching in a few days everyone expects a generous feast at sehri the pre dawn meal that starts the fast and at iftar when the fast ends at sunset and i just do not know how to manage
9381751 consumption increases in most households during ramadan everyone spends more
9381752 many buy almost double the usual amount of rice and flour
9381753 sometimes even at the sunday bazaars set up by the government to provide items at controlled rates to people you have to stand for hours to buy a single 20kg bag of flour
9381754 atta wheat flour will be sold at a fixed price of rs 300 about 4 per 20kg bag in ramadan
9381755 lift the illegal ban on inter provincial movement of wheat
9381756 we usually do a roaring business in ramadan but now we are suffering losses because few can afford to buy one roti at rs 7 about nine us cents a piece it cost only rs 5 6 5 us cents a few months ago
9381757 yes and the way is hard and you will be old before you reach the end of it but the end will be better than the beginning
9381758 mother we are not afraid for you are near and no harm can come
9381759 this is a better day than the last for my children have learned so much and are now passing these traits on to their children
9381760 you will always walk with us mother even when you have gone through the gates
9381761 we cannot see her but she is with us still a mother like ours is more than a memory she is a living presence
9381762 shes not prepared to be governor how can she be prepared to be vice president or president
9381763 look at what shes done to this state what would she do to the nation
9381764 its just ridiculous the thing looks like a dog pound
9381765 even if you only put dogs in there people will be complaining about it i think you ought to have the red cross and amnesty international come take a look at this thing
9381766 can ever hope to reach a person at the entrance
9381767 both journalists and lawyers in addition to protesters have been detained and arrested even though not a single violent or criminal act has occurred
9381768 id shape gur clarified sugar cane and some herbs into a ball and put it inside the vagina after two days id replace it with a ball of misri sugar crystals and remove it after five days
9381769 we were not educated and followed whatever was passed on to us
9381770 if these kits are made cheaper still and made easily available in the market this would further help ensure adherence to hygienic practices
9381771 in the past i would never allow my clients family to take her to doctors i would consider difficult cases a challenge to my expertise i never realised that some infant deaths could have been prevented
9381772 its their husbands who do not want to adopt any family planning methods
9381773 they get married young have too many children and thus many die of bleeding
9381774 we need to understand the important role of the tbas
9381775 this loss of food is equivalent to a loss in water
9381776 another 10 to 15 percent is discarded during processing transport and storage in richer countries production is more efficient but waste is greater people toss the food they buy and all the resources used to grow ship and produce the food along with it
9381777 the attention now because of the global food crisis has shifted towards improving food production while no one is paying attention to address the losses and wastage already taking place
9381778 distribution and access to food is a problem while at the same time many people in many parts of the world over eat
9381779 people have access to more money and diets that include meat and milk
9381780 much of the future increase will be fed to animals to satisfy the demand for meat today some 650 million tonnes of grain nearly 40 percent of global production is fed to livestock and this may reach 1100 million tonnes by 2050
9381781 for example 500 to 4 000 litres of water are evaporated in producing one kilogram of wheat depending on climate agricultural practices variety length of the growing season and yield
9381782 however to produce one kilogramme of meat takes 5 000 to 20 000 litres mainly to grow animal feed in terms of the energy content of food approximately 0 5 m3 of water is needed to produce 1 000 kcal of plant based food while for animal based food some 4 m3 of water is required
9381783 agriculture in countries in central south and south east asia which are largely dependent on river water for irrigation will be hit by a projected drop in river levels an estimated 1 4 billion people already live in areas where there is not enough water available to meet all needs from sectors of society let alone the need of aquatic ecosystems

9381789 i cannot leave with my house in this state even though i will lose a days wages
9381790 most structures in shanty towns are poorly constructed unsafe and at risk of a collapse especially in hostile weather
9381791 in my neighbourhood six funerals took place this weekend six men most of them young were killed in the blasts some were the sole wage earners for their families they leave behind small children and elderly parents others i know have been injured
9381792 the 6 000 rupees some us 85 he brought in each month enabled my sister a widow to survive she was saving to marry off her daughter the government has promised compensation but this does not take away the grief of a woman who has lost her only son
9381793 air strikes and military operations in the bajaur tribal agency and other areas

9381798 when a disaster strikes a community the mcram envisions pre trained teams of enumerators dispatched as soon as possible to collect the information necessary to plan an initial response
9381799 since data is collected electronically on pdas it can be analysed within days so un agencies and their partners can quickly begin the work of bringing relief to affected people
9381800 pakistans experience during the 2005 earthquake and the 2007 floods showed the importance of quickly and accurately assessing the needs of affected people to coordinate relief and rehabilitation efforts
9381801 we hired three big vans each costing rs 1 000 about us 14 per trip and reached lower dir safely
9381802 there were women children and even the elderly not everyone can afford a vehicle they had left their homes with nothing just the clothes they were wearing
9381803 militancy has increased and we are forced to accept their version of sharia islamic law on the other hand the government which is allied with the usa is also not bothered by our plight
9381804 my tv channel wants me to send footage of what is happening in bajaur but im scared stiff many people i know have been beheaded by the taliban on the mere suspicion of spying
9381805 we started walking from our village around midnight and reached the camp around 10 the next morning
9381806 because somebody needs to feed the animals or they will die
9381807 between 18 and 20 women and children sleep in the classrooms that are 8x6 metres while the men sleep outside on the adjoining verandahs
9381808 yes there is an acute shortage of water in most of these camps as we dont have storage tanks to cater for so many people
9381809 there has been an increase of children suffering from malaria and many are complaining of diarrhoea as well
9381810 these people are used to roti unleavened bread but we are providing them with rice and lentils and they cannot adapt to this change of diet
9381811 now for the first time we have no buffalo just a few chickens and goats i am very sad but we simply cannot afford to keep one
9381812 we simply cannot manage to keep our buffalo especially through the months when it is not giving milk
9381813 it is difficult to keep a buffalo people can no longer afford it also families have been selling off any asset they have because they need the money and a buffalo sells for rs 80 000 about us 1 230 or more
9381814 of course this means people are getting less food than before children now must depend on milk bought at the market and we can buy only when money is left over
9381815 my horse kiran eats 16 20 kg of choker chaff from wheat each day a kilo of choker that cost rs 8 10 15 us cents now costs rs 20 30 us cents a kilo it is impossible to manage i fear the day may come when i can no longer manage to keep a horse and then what will i do
9381816 life is hard up here in the mountains we hardly earn at all through the winter months because there are no tourists and the roads are snow bound now the rise in food prices makes it very difficult to keep our horses fed and if we cant keep them there will be no income
9381817 my two children are so far being fed three meals a day but i worry the day may come when i can no longer offer them even the lentils and roti wheat flour bread we currently live on
9381818 mothers and wives who eat less so husbands and children can be fed
9381819 sometimes i manage with just a few bites because that is all that is left

9381831 i am determined my children will be vaccinated against polio and all other diseases
9381832 at home my wifes family and even my own opposed giving children the drops so there were many difficulties for us
9381833 this year the problem is more acute as we face accessibility problems in areas such as the tribal areas and swat due to the law and order issues there almost no work has been done for the last eight to nine months
9381834 we have hired local people who administer drops in troubled areas they are available there full time then people can get children vaccinated at their convenience without waiting for a fixed date
9381835 many mothers have no idea diarrhoea can make vaccines ineffective they need to be educated since diarrhoea is endemic

9381842 without this all the campaigns and the money spent are an exercise in futility
9381843 even the honorarium of rs 150 about 2 per day for each team member does not keep them motivated
9381844 no one is willing to take up this arduous task for such a pittance young teenagers are volunteering but they cannot convince parents to get their children vaccinated

9381856 i can see how the person she is today was formed in the experiences we shared growing up working hard studying hard having parents who wanted more for us than what they had and always being reminded that in this country of all countries those things are possible
9381857 he and my mom poured everything they had into me and craig it was the greatest gift a child can receive never doubting for a single minute that youre loved and cherished and have a place in this world and thanks to their faith and hard work we were both able to go to college
9381858 from their lives and mine that the american dream endures
9381859 his family was so much like mine he was raised by grandparents who were working class folks just like my parents and by a single mother who struggled to pay the bills just like we did like my family they scrimped and saved so that he could have opportunities they never had themselves
9381860 all too often we accept the distance between the two and settle for the world as it is even when it doesnt reflect our values and aspirations but he reminded us that we know what our world should look like we know what fairness and justice and opportunity look like

9381895 electricity providers are hampered by state rules that prohibit the creation of a statewide database showing customers payment histories if there were one providers could see which customers are big risks despite pleas from some providers the state has not created a rule allowing a statewide database because of concern that it could place anunfair burden on some customers especially lower income households

9381897 i just saw it up in the air and i was thinking this is the perfect opportunity
9381898 so i just decided to step out there and try it i almost tried one last friday but i would have kicked the girl in the face so i decided not to but this time i went for it
9381899 then you have a look at the four goals we scored and there wasnt a scrappy bad goal in the bunch so to win the game with a bicycle kick its just fantastic stuff i cant remember arkansas last bicycle and i cant remember the last time i was involved in a 4 3 game either

9381902 looking at the 4 3 score i cant fault the backline for any of those goals
9381903 sometimes sports are like that i think these past couple of games our team has had to deal with some funny things happening at the end of the day should we have put more into the back of the net yes we missed a couple from inside a yard but we scored four came back from being down a goal fought through some strange things happening on the field and at the end of the day we certainly earned that win
9381904 i thought we played soccer friday night but didnt compete
9381905 i thought today that we played soccer and competed at the same time thats a nice difference to see

9381938 these data suggest that telmisartan confers a modest benefit when added to other proven therapies
9381939 in view of the drugs tolerability and effect on cardiovascular endpoints telmisartan could be regarded as a potential treatment for patients with vascular disease or high risk diabetes if they are unable to tolerate an ace inhibitor
9381940 arbs that have been studied in coronary disease are safe but possibly less effective alternatives in patients with intolerance to ace inhibitors although data are too limited to reach definitive conclusions the clinical effect of arbs seems less robust than that of ace inhibitors
9381941 we learn 10 of what we read 20 of what we hear that good ol listening 30 of what we see 50 of what we see and hear 70 of what we discuss 80 of what we experience 95 of what we teach others
9381942 this confirms what weve been seeing for a couple of decades in observational studies
9381943 there is a benefit of omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids for heart failure patients
9381944 there are few treatments we have in medicine that affect total mortality in patients
9381945 just a handful of treatments affect total mortality even a small move percentage wise is a very important effect
9381946 heart failure is a very high risk condition it is absolutely critical for patients whether it is a prescription medicine or modification of diet or a supplement that they consult their physician
9381947 the drug was well tolerated it indicates that heart failure in and of itself should not be reason to start a patient on a statin
9381948 but it closes it partly maybe another statin would have a benefit it definitely makes us question the benefit of statins in heart failure but it doesnt close the door completely

9381981 fisicamente non si poteva fare di pi siamo stati puniti eccessivamente
9381982 non credo che ci siano state grosse mancanze ha esordito
9381983 sono le sorprese di inizio campionato quando ci sono squadre non al top che trovano squadre pi preparate come il bologna oggi spiega dobbiamo fare tante cose per ora inserire giocatori nuovi limpressione che ho avuto che questa squadra possa fare ottime cose
9381984 si davvero bene sostiene il mio ottimismo deriva soprattutto dalla sua prestazione
9381985 non c bisogno di ridere per essere ottimisti un ottimismo interiore abbiate fiducia
9381986 si pu lavorare ma va gestita meglio la fase difensiva per evitare continui ribaltamenti aggiunge il tecnico rossonero dobbiamo essere pi bravi a negare lo spazio per le ripartenze
9381987 ci sono giocatori con caratteristiche tecniche e caratteriali diverse ognuno d quello che ha ma tutti lavoriamo per un obiettivo comune ovvio c chi sta pi o meno bene a inizio campionato
9381988 non posso essere soddisfatto quando non si vince per solo la prima partita si pu recuperare lavorando abbiamo una grande squadra
9381989 nessun problema ho giocato tanto al centro quanto a sinistra
9381990 dobbiamo continuare a lavorare oggi abbiamo giocato bene la seconda parte abbiamo avuto occasioni da gol ma sfortunatamente non le abbiamo sfruttate ripeto dobbiamo continuare a lavorare duramente
9381991 e lanno in cui vado pi forte e negli ultimi tre ho sempre fatto il mondiale spero non ci siano problemi
9381992 e lanno in cui vado pi forte spiega considerando che negli ultimi tre ho sempre fatto il mondiale spero non ci siano problemi
9381993 ero messo bene per provare a fare la volata poi ai 400 metri quando s spostato bennati il gruppo s un po appallotolato e mi sono trovato indietro sono dovuto ripartire quasi da fermo e ho speso tanto per tornare a ruota di bettini restando l fino ai 100 metri poi lho superato ma se anche avessi fatto tutto alla perfezione non credo sarei riuscito a battere valverde quando partito sembrava bolt
9381994 sono venuto in spagna con lintenzione di arrivare fino a madrid poi decideranno i tecnici cosa sar meglio potrebbe essere che se vengo convocato da ballerini vada a casa qualche giorno prima
9381995 stoner veloce ma non mi andava via questanno non abbiamo mai mollato
9381996 a un certo punto ho anche pensato ad agostini oggi lho visto prima della gara lho visto sorridente ho avuto il uso appoggio e ho vinto
9381997 ero partito bene ma purtroppo pedrosa mi aveva superato e avevo perso tempo stoner andato forte ma non mi andava via io tenevo un buon passo poi lho visto scivolare e cos sono sei vittorie
9381998 abbiamo 75 punti di vantaggio vuol dire che finora siamo stati veramente forti non abbiamo mai mollato e soprattutto abbiamo tenuto sempre la testa alta anche nelle difficolt sottolinea rossi questanno mi sono detto che per battere stoner ci voleva il miglior valentino ho provato a tirarlo fuori con varie scelte ma non sei mai sicuro di trovarlo penso di averlo trovato e sono contento
9381999 stoner stava spingendo io stavo andando pi o meno come lui e voleva darmi un altro tirone ma se noi siamo a posto non siamo tanto pi lenti di lui magari stoner ha provato a spingere un po di pi ed caduto anchio ho avuto in quella curva delle avvisaglie lasfalto era un po scivoloso
9382000 oggi sono venuto a vedere un mito vivente che valentino in argentina mi devo alzare troppo presto per poterlo seguire sono stato alle olimpiadi dove ho visto ginobili messi e bryant mi mancava di vedere dal vivo rossi non sono stato proprio uno sportivo ha poi ammesso quando caduto stoner gli chiedo scusa ma stato pi forte di me sono venuto qui per veder vincere rossi e ce lho fatta sempre di pi nella storia sono contentissimo
9382001 mi sono imbarazzato ha raccontato a fine gara con un sorriso cos il pesarese della yamaha io avrei perlomeno dovuto baciargli il piede se lui mi ha baciato la mano con cui apro il gas avrei dovuto davvero fare altrettanto col piede pi famoso del calcio lui mi ha detto che io faccio la differenza ma penso che maradona stato il personaggio che ha fatto davvero la differenze nello sport pi famoso al mondo
9382002 trovarmelo allimprovviso in griglia di partenza ha commentato valentino rossi in un momento di massima concentrazione spero di avere il modo di incontrare maradona con calma e di potergli parlare a lungo e in relax
9382003 tifo per valentino e per la yamaha ha detto il difensore reduce dal pareggio con la sampdoria la difesa dellinter ha ballato a genova pu capitare di subire
9382004 al mondiale andrei da titolare da riserva anche da autista
9382005 ho giocato dazzardo ha spiegato il toscano di casalguidi compaesano del c t ballerini fra gli attaccanti ero il pi controllato pensavano che toccasse a me inseguire chi scattava ma io mi giustificavo dicendo che avevo gi vinto ai 400 metri partito lungo bosisio perch davanti cera ancora ratti io ero in terza o quarta ruota sono uscito ai 200 e mi sembra ho vinto bene
9382006 certo sta meglio di tanti altri e sta confermando la sua buona forma
9382007 so che non mi potr andare sempre cos bene le vittorie rendono la vita pi difficile ma intanto me le godo
9382008 sto bene ma una corsa a tappe quella che mi manca per fare il salto di qualit
9382009 tutto bene tranne che sono andati via quelli che erano rimasti indietro in discesa

9382086 i was on a mission to close the gap on the ford team but got on the wrong part of the road on a long left hander and spun
9382087 i wasnt able to make up the gap to mikko i thought it was over that wed lost the chance but then it all changed and we were leading again
9382088 this was really a difficult rally changing all the time with some strategy coming in too
9382089 i needed to win but im not happy for what happened to mikko because he was doing really well and it was a good battle but its a race and these things happen sometimes
9382090 i was really confident we were going to win but what could we do
9382091 we had a slow puncture that dropped us to third but im not going to let this knock my confidence i know we can win rallies the season isnt over yet so we just have to go flat out again next time
9382092 we want to win not get fourth im sorry but were not here for fun we have to improve our speed

9382098 i cant even think about having another baby right now the boys take up so much of my time
9382099 theyre in england with me at the moment and thank goodness ive got my mum and my dad to look after them for a bit
9382100 life is busy in la because brooklyns got football romeos got gymnastics and cruz has break dancing plus they have school commitments they start school again next week so we all have to go uniform shopping now
9382101 it also means a lot to wayne if you ask him what he finds special about being married hell say its the fact that i took his name and weve now got the same surnames
9382102 its nice and ive got used to it now ive been practising signing my new signature
9382103 at first i was like oh my god ive got a husband it felt quite strange but now im made up with it
9382104 loads of people ask me if i feel different now im married and i dont very much the one thing that is different though is the extra commitment it feels special knowing that hes mine and im his in marriage
9382105 our wedding was such a special day and its still so fresh in our minds were only just getting our pictures back now and were waiting for our wedding video so the newlywed feeling is going to go on forever
9382106 there will be immigration people there and were all undocumented
9382107 today i read on a blog that i went to the doctor and he said i was overweight and i cried and went to planet blue because i was blue and bought 6 pair of size 0 jeans
9382108 my doctor says i am right on target with my weight gain have not been to planet blue in at least two years love my maternity jeans they have stretchy tops it is awesome
9382109 carrying a child is the most inspiring emotional amazing experience of my life my weight and my pant size are the absolute last thing i am concerned about i am only concerned with having a healthy pregnancy and a healthy baby
9382110 as far as he could go in the united states as possible
9382111 odds are its a boy but well be happy with either sex
9382112 were just hoping for a healthy baby but theres a chance for a boy odds are positive
9382113 it would have been nice to do it on our terms
9382114 ive lost count of the number of times they scream at each other normally when they have had a drink its become a weekly event
9382115 it usually starts late at night all hell breaks loose with them shouting and screaming the neighbours must be sick of it by now
9382116 they love each other dearly but that passion also makes their relationship very stormy
9382117 we all thought seans recent arrest would be the final nail in the coffin for the marriage but no matter how many times georgina leaves she always returns all their friends hope things settle down
9382118 i opened the door and saw brendan and just said oh no its the lothario
9382119 my girlfriends were all saying to me you know who he is dont you
9382120 they asked me if he was standing there with a rose between his teeth when we met but i told them he was wearing a leather thong i had no idea they would pair us up
9382121 i dont think theres going to be any time for sex
9382122 im in bits after training i can barely walk up the stairs when i get in let alone get jiggy with anybody
9382123 so nothing is going to happen until after ive finished

9382126 the unrestrained greed of the us leadership and global zionism is gradually leading the world to the edge of a precipice
9382127 if i am asked if i wished a number of things would go differently well i would say i wish i was a millionaire and then id wish for nothing wishes are dreams
9382128 the truth is that this team can get a lot better and they are not where they want to be at the moment they are around 60 70 percent where we want to be and we know we can get better the more we play together
9382129 there are things we need to work on at the moment and we need to get that better in the months that come for instance we still tend to go off our feet too much and we have too many one off runners
9382130 our chase on our own kicks isnt very effective at the moment and we need to do more to put the opposition under pressure
9382131 robbie may say its a cocktail but we all know how nice a cocktail is you enjoy drinking it and while things went well for us in the game we believe in what we do and we know we will have to work hard but we also know precisely what we can do
9382132 the tri nations isnt over its a one off encounter one game that can make their season good whether they can do it remains to be seen
9382133 its a big like when you touch a flame and you get burned you dont generally go back there
9382134 i am immensely worried about the ultimate destiny of a lot of food manufacturers in this country
9382135 globally we are seeing the growth of the majors and unless we are able to build a food manufacturing business in australia that is sustainable then ultimately the global manufacturers will take the power base
9382136 my reading is that many of the smaller suppliers have been probably been squeezed out of the industry and that leads me to a concern over the next 10 or 15 years in that its a cycle that comes and goes
9382137 who knows in 10 or 15 years time there may be a handful of global manufacturers that win back that power base and thats a frightening thought
9382138 consideration of the need for legislative reform in relation to creeping acquisitions is an election commitment and the release of this discussion paper is an important step in ensuring that all the issues can be examined
9382139 i am immensely worried about the ultimate destiny of a lot of food manufacturers in this country
9382140 i look forward to each of them making a positive contribution to the law in their new capacity
9382141 i sought expressions of interest and nominations undertook extensive consultations and i appointed a high level panel to assess candidates and recommend suitable candidates to me
9382142 this new process for judicial appointments can give the public confidence that the appointments were made on merit
9382143 i look forward to each of them making a positive contribution to the law in their new capacity
9382144 we can start to get into the black and still be ahead
9382145 these are investments in the future so it doesnt necessarily mean pain
9382146 we can turn those investments around into profits and still be cleaning up our act
9382147 we can start to get into the black and still be ahead
9382148 i dont think the other lenders need to be magicians they just need to do the right thing by families under pressure and pass on any cut if thats decided by the reserve bank
9382149 if the reserve bank cuts rates this week therell be absolutely no excuse by any lender for not cutting rates none at all
9382150 there have been changes in the cost of funding in recent times and they will have an impact over time so over time the banks should be coming down over and above any cut in the reserves rate

9382189 many emergency preparedness procedures and personnel are in place now and active to best prepare gulf coast residents schools churches and businesses and to respond to the expected damage
9382190 we encourage christians nationwide to pray care and share now and in the coming days galations 6 2 says bear one anothers burdens and thus fulfill the law of christ the bible says a lot about preparedness and response
9382191 in all times we turn to the lord psalm 32 34 offers several biblical perspectives to address fears and anxieties many are now experiencing gods sovereignty over all ministers to us greatly in all times the world as we know it will some day end lets be found faithful hopeful and trusting in the biblical worldview that says we have an eternal hope that surpasses all understanding
9382192 lets bear the burdens through prayer that many in the south are experiencing right now
9382193 pray that water temperatures wind and rain will be subdued by gods hand to protect many from great damage
9382194 pray that arrangements to secure properties and make school business family and life decisions relating to temporary relocation go smoothly and are wise
9382195 pray that their buildings will be secure but more importantly that christians there will maintain a strong christian witness to the community and responding groups
9382196 we are aware of many christian military and emergency management groups already deployed to the region to be in place with personnel and supplies pray for strength and that unique opportunities to share the truths of jesus christ will occur for the many christians in these groups
9382197 we encourage christians to reach out to those you know in any way possible and connect with your christian church denominations and ministries to donate funds services and supplies that they outline
9382198 one example of a need already being met is that of 500 generators needed for portable showers already on hand

9382237 i got married at 14 only because i wanted to get out of there

9382240 they just didnt want to let us in so we stood there watching to see if they would let anyone else in
9382241 they all stood there with us to back us up
9382242 and then we came back the next day which was sunday and stood there until 2 or 3 in the afternoon when they finally decided to let us in
9382243 acknowledge again and explicitly that this nation remains engaged in an armed conflict with al qaeda the taliban and associated organizations who have already proclaimed themselves at war with us and who are dedicated to the slaughter of americans
9382244 this seems like a final push by the administration before they go out the door
9382245 we have been at war with an unconventional enemy whose primary goal is to kill innocent americans
9382246 is trying to stir up again the politics of fear by reminding people of something they havent really forgotten that we are engaged in serious armed conflict with al qaeda
9382247 but the question is where is that conflict to be waged and by what means
9382248 as sept 11 2001 recedes into the past there are some people who have come to think of it as kind of a singular event and of there being nothing else out there
9382249 in a way we are the victims of our own success our own success being that another attack has been prevented
9382250 reaffirm that for the duration of the conflict the united states may detain as enemy combatants those who have engaged in hostilities or purposefully supported al qaeda the taliban and associated organizations
9382251 i dont want to face another situation where we had the sept 14 resolution and then attorney general gonzales claimed that that was authorization to violate fisa

9382257 on the seventh day god finished his work that he had done and he rested on the seventh day from all his work that he had done
9382258 thats easy for you to say pastor you dont work in the real world
9382259 can i trust god to provide for me if i rest as he commands
9382260 observe the sabbath day to keep it holy as the lord your god commanded you six days you shall labor and do all your work but the seventh day is a sabbath to the lord your god on it you shall not do any work you shall remember that you were a slave in the land of egypt and the lord your god brought you out from there with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm therefore the lord your god commanded you to keep the sabbath day
9382261 all the days of my life i cease from my evil works and yield myself to the lord to work by his holy spirit in me
9382262 neither shall there be mourning nor crying nor pain anymore for the former things have passed away

9382284 whoever performs an obligatory prayer allah will reward him with seventy prayers worth in this month
9382285 and who so ever prays a lot during this month will have his load lightened on the day of measure
9382286 he who recites one verse of the holy quran will be given the rewards of reciting the whole quran during other months
9382287 o people indeed during this month the doors of heaven are open therefore ask allah not to close them for you the doors of hell are closed so ask allah to keep them closed for you during this month shaytan satan is imprisoned so ask your lord not to let him have power over you
9382288 and im proud to be supporting frank murkowski hes a man thats not afraid to take some licks he might not win awards for his charisma but alaskas gonna need frank in 06
9382289 this heres a spectacle that might warrant a moments consideration
9382290 my health club is the international house of pancakes because no matter how big you are there will always be someone there who weighs at least a hundred pounds more than you will ever weigh
9382291 i have a hard time seeing how her qualifications stack up against the duties and responsibilities of being president i expect her to stick with simple truths when asked about continued american troop presence in iraq she said she knows only one thing about that i paraphrase no one has attacked the american homeland since george bush took the war to iraq
9382292 shes not prepared to be governor how can she be prepared to be vice president or president
9382293 i have a hard time seeing how her qualifications stack up against the duties and responsibilities of being president i expect her to stick with simple truths when asked about continued american troop presence in iraq she said she knows only one thing about that i paraphrase no one has attacked the american homeland since george bush took the war to iraq
9382294 shes not prepared to be governor how can she be prepared to be vice president or president
9382295 id never heard of this product until you posted but i do know bishop anders personally and ill tell you something hes the real deal he cares about his list and his customers success he wouldnt sell junk he doesnt promote anything he hasnt personally looked at lets see others make that claim he will deliver what he says he will in the sales letter so if you like it buy it

9382300 vi har s krat dna fr n tre brottsplatser och har annan stark bevisning i de vriga fallen
9382301 to begin with we need to understand what type of product a designer has in mind
9382302 will designers use analog as well as digital components will they implement the design on ics or on board level products will they implement algorithms in hardware software or both
9382303 traditionally someone would code the algorithm in c vhdl or verilog however implementing the design is an iterative process and every change requires extra simulations to re verify filter performance
9382304 the algorithm interacts with upstream and downstream processes so you must know how algorithm behavior affects overall system metrics you dont have access to tools for that type of analysis when you code algorithms in low level languages
9382305 you use an abstract model not only to weigh tradeoffs and what if possibilities but to make your end application more portable
9382306 you might implement something on a dsp chip today and move it to an arm processor in a few months in such a case you can easily go back to the model rather than try to wade through thousands of lines of implementation specific c or hdl code
9382307 because you know the model is functionally correct the code you get out is in a sense correct by construction
9382308 many of the engineers we work with develop new algorithms or implement algorithms in new ways
9382309 they create models in c or c because they need to refine them and reuse the code often the engineers realize their algorithms will not run on a dsp chip so they have started to move to an fpga or an asic so they need to convert c c code into hardware which is what catapult c does
9382310 software engineers who create algorithms think in a sequential manner because they expect their code to run on a processor
9382311 a hardware engineer will think more about parallel operations and the physical resources an algorithm will use
9382312 but the designer must describe that arrangement in the systems architectural behavior
9382313 you can design it with one multiplier accumulator mac and perform operations sequentially in four clock cycles a possible bottleneck figure 2a or you could use four multipliers in parallel to perform all operations in one clock cycle figure 2b
9382314 often catapult c finds memory bandwidth problems in a design rather than bottlenecks at adders multipliers and other elements
9382315 when you optimize bandwidth at one place it can catch up with you somewhere else
9382316 if you need to write only one 16 bit coefficient you must use a 32 bit read modify write operation that takes extra time
9382317 matlab generally provides the highest level of abstraction for algorithm prototyping and exploration
9382318 developers can synthesize everything in our library into architecturally optimized rtl code our blocksets support high precision fixed point math and a floating point override simulation mode so developers dont get bogged down with quantization underflow and overflow as they start to create algorithms developers can then explore and tune fixed point settings to achieve the algorithm behavior they need
9382319 when you start to quantize standard algorithms they can become unstable
9382320 so designers must understand the tradeoffs involved with moving from floating point to fixed point math when developers work with an abstract model they dont have to create one for each type of math which simplifies testing
9382321 our tools will automatically add registers as needed at the architecture level so the rtl will meet timing on the target device
9382322 then you can take the rtl code through standard logic synthesis and place and route steps to implement your design in hardware the key is the automatic architecture optimization for the target device
9382323 our software handles many details automatically and report results to engineers
9382324 the report could indicate the tools chose an xyz configuration for a fir filter based on design constraint and automatically figured out how many pipeline registers to use based on a sample rates entered in the model
9382325 if a circuit goes beyond the capabilities of a device you can try different folding values that tradeoff serial vs parallel implementations of operations then you can determine which folding value best meets timing requirements and also minimizes device area
9382326 we help them consider system level costs versus device costs
9382327 many times functional blocks on a dsp chip reduce the need for separate external components that add cost engineers should look at overall costs not just the cost of a dsp chip
9382328 then engineers should think about how much flexibility they need
9382329 if you plan to change functions codecs or algorithms fully programmable dsp chips make more sense
9382330 one engineer may need reference software while another might need specific algorithm libraries
9382331 engineers can get codecs from a third party license other ip from another source and combine them with our tools and libraries you dont have to build everything on your own to create a good product
9382332 our layered software structure lets you use only the pieces of dsp code you need perhaps a dsp bios
9382333 users also can take our drivers and optimize them for their application or they can remove unneeded functions
9382334 developers work their way up from the bios level to what we call codec engine a framework that supports concurrent execution of multiple channels and codecs
9382335 it lets developers set up their program so if it breaks it will stop so they can examine data in log files to determine what happened
9382336 perhaps an interrupt occurred randomly or noise on a signal line caused an unexpected action or a bus overload
9382337 then you can turn to an fpga to complement a dsp chip
9382338 an fpga can implement a special video multiplexer or i o devices not yet available in a dsp chip or you might need some extra image processing in a signal chain
9382339 they want vendors to take them most of the way to their final product so we offer hardware evaluation boards software tools debug and development software device drivers and several operating systems for our parts our designer community includes engineers who want to continue using operating system xyz who use open source tools and drivers or who want to concentrate efforts on product features
9382340 we offer those standard algorithms as an immediate jumping off point for customers who know exactly what they want
9382341 a few customers will buy many of our development boards and put them directly in their end product
9382342 how do we increase future performance and maintain hardware compatibility
9382343 they choose a dsp chip that runs out of mips after they have loaded all their code into it
9382344 they should look for a dsp chip family that includes single core low power devices all the way up to multi core high performance ics that gives them a get out of jail free card
9382345 designing high performance dsp hardware using catapult c synthesis and the altera accelerated libraries
9382346 using a catapult c based flow to speed implementation and increase flexibility
9382347 i didnt experience this tragedy but i have a daughter who at certain times in her life has had difficulties in her relationship with the world and i too tried to stay by her side with energy and affection even lying to her in order to make her happy ive poured into this film everything i know both good and bad about being a father

9382372 has sufficient resources and appropriate operational capacity to carry out its functions effectively
9382373 mugabe fumed he said no ways he could not become the prime minister
9382374 fully aware that we won the march 29 election we could have demanded nothing but outright victory
9382375 but we reached a position where we said it was important for cohabitation with zanu pf for the sake of the country
9382376 i said yes mugabe can remain the commander in chief of the armed forces i also didnt object to mugabe heading the national security council
9382377 we hoped this would show we were genuine in the quest to find an agreement to establish a transitional government that rebuilds confidence in zimbabwe and ensure there is food jobs and justice for zimbabweans
9382378 i pointed out we could not have a ceremonial prime minister it would have been unprecedented
9382379 mugabe wanted to me to be responsible for solving the problems he created yet he didnt want me to have the full authority to carry out that task the other problem was how could i be asked to sort out the mess economic problems when the person mugabe who created it in the first place was in charge of the cabinet
9382380 he refused to share power he opened parliament now he is talking about appointing a cabinet this goes against the spirit of the talks
9382381 tangible commitments by government to remove the bureaucratic security financial and other restrictions to effective humanitarian operations
9382382 this suspension is hereby lifted for all pvos ngos registered in terms of the pvo act chapter 17 05
9382383 the lift therefore characteristically excludes organisations operating in areas such as transitional justice human rights governance and democracy it also does not recognise the inseparability of civil societys social economic cultural political and civic responsibilities
9382384 reform the pvo act and other repressive pieces of legislation
9382385 there is need for confidence building mechanisms to allow stronger cooperation between the state and civil society
9382386 this should include the retraction of unfounded statements by public officials accusing all ngos of politicising humanitarian assistance in support of the mdc and western imperialism

9382399 resulting in a shooting injury to the head and he later died in hospital
9382400 as they drove he yevloyev was shot in the temple they threw him out of the car near the hospital
9382401 he was discovered there and they quickly put him on the operating table which is where he died
9382402 at the present time agreements are being prepared for providing support and help economic social humanitarian in the wider meaning of the word and finally military
9382403 stop well short of any action that might escalate into a damaging tit for tat sequence of economic and political sanctions
9382404 europe can do a lot starting with sending a mission of civilian monitors which would lead to an international peacekeeping mechanism that would replace the presence of russian troops
9382405 i expect that europe will support our territorial integrity and will say that it will never recognise these illegal actions
9382406 i do not know for sure what will happen in brussels tomorrow but i know that it is the beginning of major process
9382407 russia today is more isolated than it ever was during the existence of the soviet union
9382408 for everyone thinking they can ride this storm out i have news for you that will be one of the biggest mistakes you can make in your life
9382409 looting will not be tolerated we have doubled the police force and doubled the national guard looters will go directly to jail
9382410 some people say they are based more on political concerns after the fallout from katrina rather than a real sense of danger
9382411 i hope and pray we will be able to resume some of our normal operations as quickly as possible

9382424 energy is the single largest cost incurred at telecom sites especially in the developing world
9382425 grid power is largely unreliable especially in the remote areas and operators are heavily dependent on diesel generator dg sets power from a dg is not only expensive but also causes high levels of carbon emissions leading to global warming

9382431 only the colour red was forbidden we used it just for the blood

9382437 so if a prominent seforim seller like zundel to whom chabad is like a red kerchief for a raging bull although no longer under his ownership chosses to advertise on a chabad site like col just so that lubavitchers and their centers should shop there this is cause of muted celebration
9382438 watch for any changes in our accounting if i need i can start depreciating the software and maintain earnings growth for years on flat revenue
9382439 microsoft paid over 4 million to make pancerzewski go away an amount that presumably wouldnt be paid out without the office of the president the trio to which ballmer belonged signing off on it
9382440 systematically and deliberately excluded hundreds of millions of dollars from their publicly reported financial statements in order to smooth income and conceal volatility
9382441 we should do all we can to smooth our earnings and keep a steady state earnings model
9382442 i believe we should do all we can to smooth our earnings and keep a steady state earnings model
9382443 microsoft agrees to refrain from accounting violations in sec settlement
9382444 less prone to raise issues of possible legal improprieties which could threaten or embarrass microsoft or its management
9382445 i can confirm that the sec has contacted charlie pancerzewski and that charlie has cooperated with the sec
9382446 the cfo to whom charlie was reporting his concerns about illegality was the biggest advocate for the very illegality that was going on
9382447 looters will go directly to jail you will not get a pass this time
9382448 you will not have a temporary stay in the city you will go directly to the big house
9382449 i was worried about the kids we just couldnt stay
9382450 the army corps of engineers informs me that while the levees are stronger than theyve ever been people across the gulf coast especially in new orleans need to understand that in a storm of this size there are serious risks of significant flooding
9382451 my message to the people of the gulf coast is this storm is dangerous

9382459 a blog has a life for its own it should not go to the point where is it getting boring a blog is about honesty egalitarismus neutral support and has no predictable success we have a duty to our readership but should not feel guilty if not blogging for some weeks
9382460 blog could enhance or damage your carrer it always about benefits and risks
9382461 we make some vast assumptions on blogging e g that its bad for our career i think only natural scientist are worried about their career not scientists from art or humanities quite a challenge is that faculty and dean never heard of blogs and its use for educational purposes
9382462 as part a part of the thinking process blogging should be accepted in the science community but should not be too perfect
9382463 passionate lay person groups out there are in need of better access to science for example patient health advocates environmental change groups healthy ethics groups these groups need our help to go on we have a responsebility to get facts out
9382464 liberals havent had an original idea since the day bobby kennedy died
9382465 my view of partisanship is like jfks principle is more important than party and party loyalty sometimes represents too much
9382466 if im still alive in the next three months we can talk
9382467 again that opens up a whole other can of worms which is people instantly expecting it to be one to one swing controls and i dont know if wed be able to get it to the pinpoint accuracy that a game with this level of design requires
9382468 so youd have to make gigantic surfaces you can swing onto rather than really tight skill based areas and that would shift more toward casual and bionic commando has never really be a game for casual players its one of those ideas on paper thats like yes the wii controller will work with bionic commando but when you actually try to design it out its like maybe maybe not i dont know
9382469 ive only heard internally what people have said and i dont think everybody is sold on it 100 percent

9382529 this is a time when we have to do away with our party politics and we have to act as americans we have to join the 300 million other americans on behalf of our fellow citizens its a time for action so were going to suspend most of our activities tomorrow except for those absolutely necessary
9382530 tomorrows program will be business only and will refrain from any political rhetoric that would be traditional in an opening session of a convention
9382531 we must redirect our efforts from the really celebratory event of the nomination of president and vice president of our party to acting as all americans
9382532 i pledge that tomorrow night and if necessary throughout our convention to act as americans not republicans because america needs us now no matter whether we are republican or democrat he said

9382561 on my first day back to school in 7th grade i stepped in dog poo and tracked it onto the bus coming home
9382562 the price is just too high and were too comfortable
9382563 four 20 something transplants discuss what it felt like when they first moved to new york and how theyre gradually adjusting to their adopted city
9382564 for those subway riders who get off before the last stop the end is just a sign on the train whats there anyway it turns out there is often mystery lonesomeness and beauty
9382565 the waves kind of deteriorated but a couple times i saw rob getting waves down the beach
9382566 i stayed at the same place that i did last year
9382567 i ate at the same place i tried to keep the same routine and new jersey has always been good to me
9382568 im just so stoked to be able to do this at home
9382569 i leave for california tomorrow to do a bunch of contests but its so sweet to have a good result here
9382570 there were peaks up and down the beach like stomach to waist high but it was hard to find a wave in the final it was so bad pretty much straight close outs on every wave there werent that many waves ridden at all
9382571 my heat started out slow and i only had two four point rides but then i got those two good lefts andino said
9382572 i got that one left and went straight up five times and got the nine most of the guys were only getting two turns in but my waves had a reform and i was able to get better scores
9382573 ive been surfing lowers and riviera at home so this is a different approach to surfing but the small waves fit my size and my boards
9382574 i paddled out on the north side of the contest area and got a wedge off of a hole in the sandbar
9382575 i was able to sit there and caught a few good ones and tried to do as many turns as possible
9382576 the waves are small but ive been surfing even worse waves all summer so im used to it
9382577 i sat down the beach in my heat because there was a northeast wind and i knew there was a left id be able to get its important to separate yourself from the pack on days like today when there arent many waves because it gives you a better chance of getting good scores
9382578 its sick being able to surf with all of these good guys at your home break
9382579 i placed 2nd many times in my career but to eventually win a big event is just amazing
9382580 it was one of the smallest contests in a long time but a win is always a win and i am stoked i finally got the boys to hold me up in the air and get that feeling at last it was a tough contest kind of nerving testing with the tricky waves all weekend
9382581 i could have surfed better but there was not a lot of options out there and i just got that good wave
9382582 i manged to get a few turns together for this 8 00 point score and in these conditions i knew there would not be many more good enough waves
9382583 i was not really into it when the year started and i did not want to put any pressure on myself
9382584 with these two good results i guess i will start thinking of the possibility to make it back on the dream tour but i would need a couple of big scores still i will see how things go
9382585 i was so excited to make another final after the one in florida in january but the waves were tricky and it was not an easy heat
9382586 phil macdonald got that one excellent wave and with inconsistency of the swell there was not much i could do i am still stoked
9382587 i have had a great year so far and this result will hopefully get me closer to the asp world tour
9382588 i am looking forward to the next event because it can be pretty consistent and i love surfing big waves in general i cannot wait to get through all this and make it to hawaii where i love to surf it will a close finish but i am defintely ready for it
9382589 the conditions were very hard to surf and i tried hard but someone has to win and this time it was not me
9382590 i havent been in the semifinals of a 6 star event for years and it will be a great confidence boost for the next events
9382591 i won the event several times in pantin and i am stoked to head there with that result unde rmy belt
9382592 what europeans are currently achieving on tour is just great and to see aritz aranburu among the asp top 45 is a great motivation it took time but it seems like we are definitely there and ready
9382593 i have had a tough year so far and i am slowly coming back and getting the feeling right
9382594 i did good at the beginning of the leg in newquay and this second result is definitely big for my confidence i was close to getting through that one so i am disappointed but i will take it for sure
9382595 i felt at home here staying with tiago pires and his family here and this week was great for my confidence
9382596 we have been helping eachother a lot and tiago gave me some advice to deal with the waves and the peak here it took me to the quarterfinals so i am pretty happy
9382597 god make me as rich as ghetto churches with a different message
9382598 the price is just too high and were too comfortable
9382599 i am a creative planner brand and social media consultant based in bangalore india this blog is a scribbling pad for my thots and ideas on
9382600 we were really appreciative that andy did the right thing and contacted the proper agencies to find out what options he had to deal with his situation
9382601 some people might have taken the boat out in the ocean and dealt with the problem in other ways
9382602 he built this boat in 1928 right here in the monterey boatworks which he ran from the mid 1920s until he died in 1956
9382603 that boat is basically the last of its kind around here there just isnt anything like it on monterey bay anymore
9382604 theres no question the gen pershing is a floating museum and its a testament to the boatbuilding abilities of the siino family that its still a working boat
9382605 weve got a marine geneticist who likes to use it for his research
9382606 we also enjoy taking it out for whale watching and things like that
9382607 when i got back from new orleans there were 30 some nests on the boat
9382608 the next time we went out there a couple of weeks later there were about 70 you take 70 nests holding two eggs each and figure theres a mother and father there for every nest that makes for a lot of birds our whole boat looked black
9382609 i can envision several days of pure clean up work
9382610 then well have to scrape it paint it grind the decks down the whole boat will have to be pressure washed and blasted then re primed
9382611 when we blast that stuff off we might end up blasting right through the roof
9382612 we dont know if the cabin roof will be any good after this
9382613 if we just shoveled that stuff overboard it would literally turn the water around the boat into a huge white oily mess
9382614 he falsified the entire thing in order to obtain the identification in a different name other than his true name
9382615 the government has the duty to safeguard the credibility of any sort of identification thats obtained through them
9382616 were happy with the intelligence that weve gathered and information thats come to light through the course of the investigation
9382617 apparently we helped because we help with these things sometimes
9382618 were not talking about something catastrophic but we could see a much bigger response in terms of sea level from the greenland ice sheet over the next 100 years than what is currently predicted
9382619 weve never seen an ice sheet disappear before but here we have a record
9382620 for planning purposes we should see the ipcc projections as conservative
9382621 we think this is a very low estimate of what the greenland ice sheet will contribute to sea level
9382622 as we continue to find genes that interact with each other and with environmental influences in this complex chronic disease we are building the foundation for personalized treatments tailored to a patients genetic profile
9382623 we will resequence the gene regions we have identified to pinpoint the causative mutations in these genes
9382624 we strongly suspect one gene will provide a compelling target for drug development given whats known about its biology
9382625 although the gene variants we found may have a stronger signal in pediatric ibd than in adult onset ibd we do not believe them to be limited to varieties of the disease that begin in childhood
9382626 as we better understand the complex gene interactions in ibd we may be able to diagnose patients by their genetic profile to predict who will better respond to anti tnf drugs
9382627 if better knowledge of the disease pathway enables pharmaceutical companies to develop anti tnf drugs in pill form the medications will be easier to deliver as well as more customized to each patient
9382628 were excited about this and were actively moving forward toward clinical trials
9382629 thats just an example of the power of these microfluidics automation technologies that one or two people working together can actually screen very large numbers of compounds
9382630 big pharmaceutical companies have very large teams and a lot of infrastructure were trying to reinvent the whole process
9382631 clemizole does have the potential to be part of a cure because the idea is not to use it on its own but as a cocktail component
9382632 neither jeffs group nor mine could have done this on our own
9382633 it was enabled by both of us bringing our pieces to the table the questions he was asking and the technology we developed
9382634 telomerase is an ideal target for chemotherapy because it is active in almost all human tumors but inactive in most normal cells
9382635 that means a drug that deactivates telomerase would likely work against all cancers with few side effects
9382636 once we found that the gene from this organism expressed the protein in the quantities we needed we were able to move quickly
9382637 for the first time we can see how telomerase assembles at the end of chromosomes to initiate telomere replication
9382638 ive always been interested in understanding on a molecular level the function of protein nucleic acid assemblies and using that information in the treatment of human disease
9382639 telomerase because of its important role in cancer and aging was an obvious target for me
9382640 it required a lot of perseverance and effort but we really wanted to do this
9382641 wer ohne gui auskommt sollte die variante ohne gui bevorzugen
9382642 spurs are a good team with good quality and they played well they had five players in the middle and they touched the ball well
9382643 the fast and the slow the old and the bold
9382644 serious adult diseases like colon cancer breast cancer heart disease high blood preasure and senility are closely connected to the intestines
9382645 this gene is crucial to the daisy chain of signals that run between body fat and the brain
9382646 it likely plays a pivotal role in how much we as humans eat and whether we have offspring
9382647 leptin tells the brain that times are good your body is full and that it is not necessary to eat more at the moment
9382648 controlling appetite and reproduction together provides a big evolutionary advantage
9382649 if there is no food the brain believes the body should not reproduce because without body fat a babys growth in the womb could be stunted and without food to replenish the bodys energy reserves there will be nothing to feed the offspring
9382650 leptin works remarkably well to give the brain a good indication of how much food has been eaten 99 9 percent of the time it balances food intake with energy use
9382651 the problem is that no machine works 100 percent of the time and that slight bit of inefficiency can lead to extra body weight
9382652 try to make a way to make sure the brain signals are being heard
9382653 their hormones and blood sugar resembled that seen in humans with these disorders
9382654 we dont study infertility but we put two and two together
9382655 we knew leptin is the critical hormone for regulating body weight and that it is also very important for regulating reproduction
9382656 this suggests that half of the dose of torc switch is enough to cause problems in leptin signaling in the brain and it may be that subtle mutations in torc1 in humans could be responsible for an inheritable risk factor for gaining weight
9382657 torc1 is regulated by phosphate handling enzymes called kinases and kinases often make for very good drug targets
9382658 manufacturing operations were restarted at our laurel facility on regular shifts tuesday morning aug 26 with the remainder of our 3000 plus work force
9382659 we began an immediate testing and hiring program to replace transformer production employees who may not be returning to work we anticipate being fully staffed within one week
9382660 we need to keep this defendant until the charges are resolved
9382661 ice has reportedly booked dozens of rooms in hotels on the gulf coast
9382662 perhaps even more worrisome are the reports that the federal court in hattiesburg is being readied for a response similar to the response to the raid in postville
9382663 staff and local leaders are working quickly to identify possible targets educate workers and assemble a team of attorneys
9382664 what happened in postville was an absolute travesty of justice that must never happen again
9382665 ice must assure that any future enforcement actions are conducted in a humane manner and that detainees are permitted their constitutional rights to due process and to legal counsel
9382666 i think postville was a huge embarrassment because of the criminalization of workers
9382667 the union uses the tactic of saying immigration was coming and the members of the union would not be taken
9382668 is an attempt to drive a wedge between immigrants african americans white people and unions all those who want political change here
9382669 when i was a child one of my greatest fears was that heaven would be boring there would be no surprises and no growth in knowledge with accompanying increase of joy
9382670 im staying right here bro said a shirtless mathene seconds before donning a t shirt for visitors
9382671 ive stayed behind through all of them and im staying now
9382672 i guess they just decided nothing would work so they didnt nothing
9382673 i had some water on one end of my house but none on the other side i think i have an uneven floor
9382674 when theres a hurricane some guys like to hang out by the fence
9382675 im not going to listen to the fear and hype said the former owner
9382676 im going to wait and see what happens i might go ill decide at the last minute
9382677 dale scott cant miss those types of calls he said that torii hunter got a finger on home plate as he slid past the first time a finger thats what made me just walk away
9382678 a 10 tax on beer has also been lifted though a duty of 10 remains on drinks containing more than 30 alcohol
9382679 i received a phone call from buyer on friday august 29th at about 11 30am he expressed his desire to not complete the purchase of the home at
9382680 why were the press ready to report it when we were going on a protest march about our scout hut being demolished but wont print anything now its to be allowed to stay
9382681 tell us again granddad about how you used to have electricity every day
9382682 dont you dare be ill we cant possibly afford a doctor
9382683 when a patient walked into my office saying the world was too grim to be borne i treated him as a sick man he was right of course and saw life clearly but he was ill in the immunological sense having lost certain basic defences that keep us sane
9382684 shes just so charming and 5 god damn curtainclimbers hanging onto her body one 4 months old and one with downs syndrome her child from god who she saved from the abortionists murderous coathanger and yes she is a christian a fundie freak and shes pro life except when it comes to blowin away teenagers in iraq and afghanistan or us airstrikes killing 40 or 50 innocent men women and children in one of those unnecessary invasions and occupations always the children get it in war at least the us forces are considerate enough to blow away the kids with the parents a part of george w
9382685 mccains a repugnican joke so why not put a punchline on the joke i think mccain shoots blanks like his bombs were blanks when he was shot down over nam he cant trot out a kid whos not an old man by now so now he has this alaskan housewifes kids and joke of a husband to trot around with him all over the usa i think this fool thinks by picking a good christian chick from alaska hes safe in terms of picking up rightwingo and dumbocrat racists housewives who dont want a knee grow in the white mans house unless hes going there as a houseboy or a waiter mccains so nutty and has so many arms up his ass pulling his strings hell probably blow up before november from the look of his pale skin he seems to be now almost on the verge of a brain blowout similar to the one uncle teddy kennedy recently suffered one last chivas regal on the rocks uncle teddy yep you want to bet me mccain will get shot out of his blue sky before the election oh it will be a juicy campaign a lot of wicked racist barbs will be hurled around by rudi mussolini and uncle joe lieberman who are heading up the john mccain obama attack committee our advice to captain john call obama a pigfucker john let him prove hes not a pigfucker but then hes got karl rove advising him so i imagine karls already told him to use the pigfucker move what a bunch of ignorant and very foolish and dangerous white men mrs pallen is just a joke to them so thats all ive got to say about them fools and fools will vote for them and since all americans may be fools the winner is president john mccain even if he loses the popular vote hell win the election by stealing the votes in ohio again ohios still one of the dumbest states in the union
9382686 hey you creeps john mccain and mrs pallen are topnotch folks just the kind of folks that come to mets games and hey marvelousmarvbackbiter you baseball ignoramus look what your stupid yankees are doing and then check out my mets you havent been saying much about the great game of baseball this year plus you shithead you havent mentioned that under a real manager manager jerry manuel the mets are kicking baseball ass were in first place oh no we lost last night and the god damn phillies won ok so jerry manuel is not really a red white and blue american baseball image like me hes still a better manager than that black arrogant willie randolph you know the only thing you can criticize me on now is that i dont speak spanish youve got me there sometimes i feel like when i make fun of one of our many spanish speaking fans i dont think they catch on because they cant speak english like when i called one just joshing a pepper belly the other day jesus i got cussed out good though it didnt hurt my feelings because i couldnt understand one word those motormouthed bastards were saying im a lot of fun if you can understand me your baseball pal mr met go mets
9382687 hey mr met you little peckerhead you better watch your ass or youll soon be tossed into the foundation of the new citibank stadium sealed over and replaced with senor met adios meester met
9382688 so once again it appears that the people of the gulf coast louisiana and new orleans in particular need our prayers
9382689 i used to keep it with my photos but now i keep it in my strongbox
9382690 its where i keep all my important stuff my marriage license my birth certificate the last time i looked at the article was when i signed up for social security and i needed my birth certificate
9382691 to us james was the baby in the box for 40 years
9382692 we want to hear the details of how he was found hopefully this can provide him some closure
9382693 he runs back to the car and says mom theres a baby in the box
9382694 im sorry its just very hard for me to think about that
9382695 as soon as we walked in and said we just found an abandoned baby two nurses came running toward me and took him from me
9382696 i called the next day to ask about his condition but they wouldnt tell me because i wasnt family
9382697 as fast as we found you we lost you just as fast
9382698 james became a part of us the day we found him
9382699 they told me i already had too many kids i told them i had five children i told them that was ok it would be like throwing one more potato into the pot
9382700 who raised him how was he raised does he have a good life is he a father does he have a job
9382701 when we used to still live in manteca hed drive by the site and tell the kids thats where i found that baby hes been so excited
9382702 if it wasnt for gloria we wouldnt never have found james
9382703 its not likely that there will be any update until probably monday after some initial treatments and therapy
9382704 you see one of the guys go down and you hope hes all right
9382705 chris is a tough guy i hope its not serious you hate to see a guy of his caliber laying on the ground
9382706 i may have rolled it or planted wrong a play or two before
9382707 something just didnt feel right then i think i felt a pop but the x rays are ok so well see how it feels in a day or two
9382708 as i handed the ball back he didnt even grab the ball
9382709 i didnt know what to expect didnt know what he did he went down and he was in some serious pain
9382710 hes our guy it would hurt to not have him but weve got lots of guys behind him that can do well
9382711 chris told me to just make sure to hold onto the ball
9382712 this is a time when we have to do away with our party politics and we have to act as americans
9382713 i have every expectation that we will not see the mistakes of katrina repeated
9382714 we are working with the delegations financial people finance committees many other concerned individuals to do what we can to raise money for various charities that operate in the gulf coast region

9382733 concerns were raised for the safety of those in the building and the walls of the house had begun to lean in towards where search and forensic teams were working

9382739 we are shocked absolutely shocked its not the sort of thing that occurs in a country district like this

9382746 ive just discovered that people dont always say what they mean so how do you know how to trust language
9382747 when i made the woman she had to be special i made her shoulders strong enough to carry the weight of the world yet gentle enough to give comfort i gave her an inner strength to endure childbirth and the rejection that many times comes from her children i gave her a hardness that allows her to keep going when everyone else gives up and take care of her family through sickness and fatigue without complaining i gave her the sensitivity to love her children under any and all circumstances even when her child has hurt her very badly i gave her strength to carry her husband through his faults and fashioned her from his rib to protect his heart i gave her wisdom to know that a good husband never hurts his wife but sometimes tests her strengths and her resolve to stand beside him unfalteringly and finally i gave her a tear to shed this is hers exclusively to use whenever it is needed
9382748 the beauty of a woman is not in the clothes she wears the figure that she carries or the way she combs her hair

9382750 it goes without saying but john is an all time great safety one of the leagues classiest professionals and his elite play speaks for itself as has been the case in other situations i would not rule anything out down the road

9382804 oh my sister is in the room with me someone else called i fell asleep i went out i forgot my phone my cell died
9382805 well i already know what question i wanna ask do you guys mind if i dont pull a jewel out of the bag and ask it
9382806 our original intention when creating this site was to make a resource for bloggers but in the short time since weve launched it has become much more than that
9382807 you can see how the outer bands of hurricane gustav are encirculating the very wide core of this potentially disastrous storm
9382808 de la part de tous les repo men amp nsbp bush tu vas nous manquer
9382809 confidence is a result of actions at the minute our actions are making us competitive in most afl games we play in
9382810 this is all we know were going to play the hottest team in the afl and we speak about them as the benchmark team the way they go about it their effort their consistency so thats where were trying to get to
9382811 its the biggest challenge in football but were excited to be trying to improve our football on a big stage and thats our aim
9382812 unfortunately he did his acl we feel for sean i cant imagine what hes feeling at the moment
9382813 its not the first shocker liam has had in his career and it probably wont be his last
9382814 we were going nowhere we had to do something to inject a bit of go and a bit of oomph i think we did get that spark
9382815 tonight showed that weve got a few good options up front and it will make lawries job really hard for the next game in a few weeks
9382816 we scored some very nice goals but overall coming to queensland and winning 4 2 not many teams do that
9382817 even in the third quarter there and the last quarter the boys were endeavouring and they were trying things
9382818 they were trying to generate run and movement and we just couldnt get any flow whatsoever we couldnt make anything work for us today
9382819 we were completely outpointed st kilda fixed up adelaide good and proper last week and adelaide have shown their formline was pretty good so we were playing a side that was in pretty good nick
9382820 every player that represented our club today had that best intention to give them a good send off it just didnt pan out like that we didnt play well enough
9382821 i know theres a lot of emotional players in the rooms afterwards that really do admire the four boys that are retiring
9382822 the performance wasnt good but the four guys that played today that are retiring have done themselves proud and been wonderful people for the essendon footy club and thats what its about
9382823 we knew it was a mathematical possibility but i certainly dont get up and bounce out of my house and think lets win by 100 points
9382824 i come to afl games knowing that if you dont compete hard and dont chase and tackle you get embarrassed very quickly so to be frank that was the furtherest thing from my mind until it became a mathematical possibility
9382825 andrews going to take some time to reflect on whats happened
9382826 hes still committed to playing cricket at the highest level
9382827 how he goes about doing that and how it plays out i dont know whether it means india i dont know
9382828 hes had success there and is a very good player of spin and that is important
9382829 hes not going to be built up with pressure with the spinners where its dot ball after dot ball which is going to be important when we get to india
9382830 hes an integral part of the team a great guy to have around
9382831 but we need him 100 per cent committed to the team and im hoping he can sort out any issues hes got going on in his head and we can have him back asap
9382832 we want to allow him to demonstrate he is committed to doing all those things you need to if youre to be part of the worlds best cricket team
9382833 i would like to say thanks for the many messages of support that i have received over the past day or so i appreciate your best wishes
9382834 ive been asked to think about what is important to me and i will take this time to do that

9383007 people are moving to massachusetts from elsewhere because of the robotics companies this is seen as a place where robotics is happening
9383008 and the extraordinary intelligence of the workforce to re humanize and revitalize american manufacturing
9383009 theyve taken some of the mystique out of robotics for investors
9383010 if one or two other robotics companies are successful i think that will make robotics much more mainstream for vcs in terms of an area where theyre willing to invest

9383022 my parents only helped me buy a car because they want me out of the house
9383023 i guess all folks who self identify as environmentally conscious are interested in cars that the public perceives as green
9383024 we can find the most visited and searched for green automotive brands
9383025 auto shoppers have indexed more green than the average internet browser since gas prices began rising at record rates in february
9383026 have added to their online budgets year over year and at an increasing rate as the market has declined
9383027 the power of information has empowered the consumer and taken some of the negotiation muscle away from the retailer

9383031 this represents an investment not only in kentuckys economy but also in the future of this country
9383032 the long term security and economic health of this nation depends in part on its ability to become energy independent this plant and the vehicles its designed to produce could be an important part of that strategy
9383033 then they will have to go back to 8 people in a broken down toyota
9383034 the bush administration says that the new law is necessary to protect the country against terrorism but there s nothing in the law that prevents the government from monitoring the communications of innocent americans
9383035 the intelligence court should not be deciding important constitutional issues in secret judicial opinions issued after secret hearings at which only the government is permitted to appear
9383036 bgp has far fewer potential attackers fewer necessary defenders is a much less agile attack and is way easier to monitor forensically and indeed with companies like renesys is being monitored forensically but so what it can work and when it does it can do much of the same damage we were afraid of via dns

9383042 no allegations are made that these two isolated comments created a foreseeable risk of severe emotional distress that the distress from mariners comments was severe enough that ti might result in bodily harm or that any severe distress was related to these specific comments
9383043 in fact the number of polar bears has risen dramatically over the past 30 years
9383044 our fear is that extreme environmentalists will use this tool the esa to eventually curtail or halt the north slope production of very rich resources that america needs
9383045 polar bear populations have not been increasing for the past 30 years and thats a well known fact
9383046 there is currently no way to drill for oil in polar bear seas without imperiling the polar bears
9383047 polar bears that come into contact with spilled oil will become coated with oil will attempt to groom themselves to remove it and will almost certainly die
9383048 mccain has said many times that policy must be based on sound science
9383049 we will see a difference from the past eight years

9383051 the mood around the offices of townhall com is sort of like that of christmastime
9383052 everyone is ecstatic the pick was perfect and the execution flawless you can tell this is a good pick by the way conservatives love it and by the way liberal blogs hate it
9383053 it was a deeply substantive speech full of policy detail full of people other than the candidate centered overwhelmingly on domestic economic anxiety
9383054 what he didnt do was give an airy abstract dreamy confection of rhetoric
9383055 if the rove republicans thought they were playing with a patsy they just got a reality check
9383056 i may not agree with all of his policies but i think his message of hope for our country means more
9383057 its hard to imagine there are people in this country that can not at least feel inspired by obama even if they do not plan to vote for him
9383058 ive said it before months and months ago i should say it again tonight this is a remarkable man at a vital moment america would be crazy to throw this opportunity away america must not throw this opportunity away
9383059 it doesnt matter what we do drill research alternative energy raise cafe standards in 2018 well still be using oil
9383060 even if we discovered a magic source of clean renewable energy tomorrow wed still be using a lot of oil because transitions of that magnitude take time
9383061 from a democratic perspective he made the argument for government something we havent heard in a while
9383062 moved into ample detail on what he wants to do with the economy and made the case for a failed bush mccain foreign policy
9383063 ive been looking for the details for a while and while not a wonky speech there was enough there there to hang your hat on
9383064 and perhaps most importantly he defended himself and put the screws to the republican party for the failure of the last eight years on the question of being ready to be commander in chief obama answered the question with a clarity and passion i havent seen from him yet
9383065 i was simply shattered by it now im going to buy a ticket for 1500 shekels and i dont care that hes old his songs are real and will always be relevant
9383066 i have town hall meetings all over the country all of the time and i know how people are hurting
9383067 i dont think americans are too concerned that my father in law was able to achieve the great american success story they want to stay in their own homes
9383068 first of all i think a lot of them know i spent 51 2 years in a lot of anxiety and pain
9383069 and i didnt have a kitchen table and i didnt have a chair
9383070 i was just talking to some people in ohio where they continue to lose jobs they continue to lose their homes
9383071 ive got to give them a specific and strong plan of action
9383072 in difficult times weve had a bush administration and voters want change
9383073 ive got to make a convincing case that i represent the right kind of change based on my record and outlining a strong agenda
9383074 sure i do sure i do and its a documented fact that it was the dnc that went after me first and the 527s political groups and the unions
9383075 but the fact is people should have a sense of humor
9383076 let me say sen obama made a choice about iraq and he chose to say the surge wouldnt work he said it would fail he got the nomination in large degree by going to the far left of his party on iraq
9383077 i chose the path which was least popular im not questioning his patriotism im questioning his judgment and i will continue to question his judgment and his qualifications to lead
9383078 what i hear from everybody i know is that i dont talk about it enough
9383079 people keep saying to me talk about it more we need to hear your personal story how you made a choice for your country when you refused to come home early i think that sen obama has a great story to tell and certainly i dont begrudge him telling it
9383080 theyre not going to speak theyre not going to do any politicking or campaigning theyre just part of our family and its appropriate for our family be there
9383081 both of them are on duty so theyll be leaving right after the convention is over back to their duties
9383082 sure im nervous particularly given the fact that sen obama is probably the greatest speaker of our time
9383083 all of you do holy mackerel look at those eyes theyre like beacons
9383084 thats what i keep trying but its a losing battle
9383085 by the way you know what i found out today
9383086 youre not gonna believe this they went back and showed me my irish lineage and his and they said were related
9383087 the bad news is that means im related to cheney
9383088 im taking the corn and getting the hell out of here im not giving anybody this corn
9383089 yeah firing respected officers on behalf of her family monegan and for supporting an opponent in an election campaign the wasilla police chief and library director when she was mayor and installing cronies
9383090 oh oh sarah fans this came out and will be hitting the airways soon sarah supposive new baby is really her unmarried daughters and not her own mccain will be doing a redo soon
9383091 yea freida sarah is change alright a nice fresh face to take away 30 years of gains for women and a real possibility of teaching the fables in the bible to our children in schools
9383092 she stands up for what is right and doesnt let anyone tell her to sit down
9383093 sarah palin is the one we have been waiting for
9383094 the pace was just as frenetic this year we ventured to such remote places as australias arnhem land an aboriginal homeland on the northern tip of the continent the yolngu tribe rarely hosts visitors and we were the first television crew granted permission to film there we also spent time in matmata tunisia where george lucas shot star wars and from there traveled into the blazing hot sahara desert despite the challenges of shooting a doc series on location in such far flung places the results are terrific
9383095 it all starts with a song astral media is thrilled to be able to support the canadian radio star project that will tour successful songwriting experts across our country to show aspiring songwriters how its done and help them develop their careers our belief is that this project will be another significant step in maintaining a vibrant canadian music industry
9383096 based on the evaluation of evidence the four funded schools are clearly delivering good quality training and their graduates are highly satisfied
9383097 from our perspective the whole deal is how does the government help you get back up without getting in the way
9383098 theres a gigantic gigantic difference between john mccain and barack obama and between me and i suspect my vice presidential opponent
9383099 who said that who said that would you say that again for my wife
9383100 oh i tell you what would you make sure jill hears that
9383101 you know what i mean i just want to make sure she hears that i havent heard that in a long long long time and hanging out with this lean young looking guy is making me feel pretty old you know what i mean
9383102 i thought i was in pretty good shape til i hung out with this guy you know what i mean
9383103 but look folks let me end with on a serious note here on a serious note i was a pretty good football player man
9383104 we oughta talk a little bit after this okay but look on a very serious note
9383105 why is there no mention that sarah palins daughter in fact may be trigs mother
9383106 in his introduction of sen barack obama d ill just now on the rooftop of the toldeo public library sen joe biden d del commented on the pulchritude of alaska gov sarah palin sen john mccains newly named running mate
9383107 joe biden the statesman has been a champion for womens rights
9383108 the serious concern about these emails is that they were prohibited from being released to the public due to executive privilege even though todd palin was copied on these same emails todd palin is not a member of the executive branch nor is he even a government employee todd palin is a member of the general public
9383109 the presidency is not an on the job training and obama has no experience
9383110 well i happen to be a business owner and a conservative am i evil
9383111 the association estimated a 12 billion would need to be invested to develop the 2 200 megawatts of power but added the cost of generating electricity would fall to acceptable levels by the time commercial projects were up and running
9383112 the bush administration says that the new law is necessary to protect the country against terrorism but theres nothing in the law that prevents the government from monitoring the communications of innocent americans
9383113 the intelligence court should not be deciding important constitutional issues in secret judicial opinions issued after secret hearings at which only the government is permitted to appear
9383114 if tyranny comes to this land it will be in the guise of fighting a foreign enemy
9383115 those that would give up either freedom or liberty for security deserve neither freedom nor liberty
9383116 mike you said it brother dont these a holes aclu have really important things to do other than harass those that protect our country if it was up to me i would outlaw them
9383117 you shouldnt worry about their wire taps if you have nothing to hide
9383118 it is more important to let 10 guilty people walk free than imprison an innocent

9383126 the students need to know there are alternatives to the military
9383127 are we going to pursue litigation i think its pretty clear that the school board isnt giving us any choice to do anything else
9383128 at one time hundreds of people worked there there was hope now its empty there are just no jobs

9383140 we have an odious opponent that the criminal justice system is able to identify and indict and convict theyre not a goliath dont treat them that way

9383145 oh my america as i type this i am watching peter ackroyds programme about the thames and i have just been stirred by a shot of the memorial at runnymede celebrating freedom under the law i have been a lifelong admirer of the american dream one that has delivered freedom and properity to unprecedented number of people and has in the last century unselfishly spent blood and treasure to liberate the europe from which its ideals and principles spring in large part thats why magna carta struck such a chord the barbarians who currently hold power in america have junked more than 200 years worth of freedom under the law in an obsession to avenge the unbearable hurt of 9 11 if the founding fathers could see what is being done in their name at guantanamo with its travesty of legal process they would surely weep the monument that moved me to write this was paid for by american lawyers they owe it to their nation to redress the wrongs now being perpetrated
9383146 it carries significant legal and public policy implications for mr

9383148 you will understand me when i say that my middle high german was my life it was all i cared about i was a scholar a specialist then suddenly i was plunged into all the new activity as the university was drawn into the new situation meetings conferences interviews ceremonies and above all papers to be filled out reports bibliographies lists questionnaires and on top of that were the demands in the community the things in which one had to was expected to participate that had not been there or had not been important before it was all rigmarole of course but it consumed all ones energies coming on top of the work one really wanted to do you can see how easy it was then not to think about fundamental things one had no time
9383149 the dictatorship and the whole process of its coming into being was above all diverting
9383150 to live in this process is absolutely not to be able to notice it please try to believe me unless one has a much greater degree of political awareness acuity than most of us had ever had occasion to develop
9383151 and one day too late your principles if you were ever sensible of them all rush in upon you
9383152 once the war began the government could do anything necessary to win it so it was with the final solution of the jewish problem which the nazis always talked about but never dared undertake not even the nazis until war and its necessities gave them the knowledge that they could get away with it the people abroad who thought that war against hitler would help the jews were wrong and the people in germany who once the war had begun still thought of complaining protesting resisting were betting on germanys losing the war it was a long bet not many made it
9383153 if the combined law enforcement of minneapolis saint paul ramsey county and the state of minnesota can pull over and impound a vehicle and home used to teach organic gardening and sustainability one has to wonder what it is our government really fears after all we seek to teach people that the real meaning of homeland security is local food fuel and energy production for that we have had our lives stolen by government men with guns
9383154 while i understand that the world we live in is not as it should be i strive to live and teach in a way that shows the world how life could be what i dont understand is why i cant get dressed for an evening out with friends in my own home without armed men stealing my life out from under me
9383155 we believe that any solution that is not accessible to the poor and urban areas is not a real solution for the future
9383156 the recalculation probably worked in our favour but we batted really well but i asked the boys to do a job and they have done it today winning becomes a habit and when you start winning game after game after game you learn how to win
9383157 andrew is playing some of the best cricket of his career
9383158 i know owais would come good he proved what a good player he is he delivered today and played some fantastic shots
9383159 the dressing room is down we pride ourselves on our results but there are some positives to take out today we are learning from our mistakes and we have some young players learning about international cricket
9383160 flintoff has been unbelievable he has proved he is a good player and he adds balance to the england side he is a world class performer

9383173 setting up the booth for left 4 dead the night before the show opening at the penny arcade expo pax 2008 at the washington state convention amp trade center in seattle
9383174 its always a good day to shoot zombies but at this point we had played the same pc demo of left 4 dead about three thousand times now
9383175 it wasnt until the second level of the demo that valve finally showed me something new
9383176 so the bad news is that left 4 dead got bumped back a couple of weeks but it is coming this november 20 on both platforms finally
9383177 the level began in an abandoned railway car that was being used as a safehouse
9383178 the biggest problem with the console version of tf2 is that we had kids with dial up connections saying i can host a 16 player server
9383179 in a nutshell 360 controls were fine graphics were okay and i think left 4 dead has a lot of potential in the console market which sku will sell more copies if i was a betting man ill go with steam and the pc
9383180 left 4 dead still continues to impress and at the level it is at right now we have a conteder for game of the year and the game isnt even finished yet
9383181 if you are looking for the best game to come out this year and next youve found it

9383237 andrew is playing some of the best cricket of his career
9383238 i know owais would come good he proved what a good player he is he delivered today and played some fantastic shots

9383240 flintoff has been unbelievable he has proved he is a good player and he adds balance to the england side he is a world class performer
9383241 ive nowhere to go and no way to get there
9383242 go to a shelter and get stabbed and cut and go hungry ill take my chances
9383243 everything i own is in this house and i aint giving them up
9383244 im a carpenter and i have no way of getting my tools out if i lose them i cant make a living i have to protect them
9383245 i was in indiana the day katrina hit and i got back to devastation it was sick i cleaned shit up off the streets for months
9383246 and i saw a few dead bodies it was fucking nasty it hurt the heart every day
9383247 i dont want to sleep elbow to elbow with 40 000 people i like being by myself
9383248 my phone is dead so i cant call for help i say my prayers every day
9383249 shes really fussy today she knows theres something changing of course im worried but i feel safe because the hotel has taken a lot of precautions
9383250 we call this from good times to gustav we were in st petersburg when we first heard it was very reminiscent of three years ago and what happened with katrina we kept our eyes on it and it became clear its coming close to home now we pray
9383251 we have friends who are not leaving they have five cats and they choose to stay i think theyre foolish because you dont know what the storms going to do but thats their decision our greatest fear after katrina is can the city recover from another one there are still areas today which dont look very different from the way they did after katrina the population is only two thirds of what it was
9383252 we thought we were going to be put in straitjackets just for getting on this flight
9383253 people who decide to stay in new orleans are in the insane category its mad loony you dont know whats going to happen it isnt safe you can have all the supplies in the world but maybe no electricity or gasoline for a long time
9383254 i dont know what to imagine after last time but i think the government has better plans to keep people safe this time there are no shelters in the city so we shouldnt see another cnn superdome siege anyone who stays back has no one to blame but themselves
9383255 i remember seeing two people meet in wal mart for the first time since katrina and how emotional they were everything is before katrina or after katrina new orleans was always the city that care forgot we were happy go lucky and didnt spend time worrying that went to the wayside with katrina because terrible things happened there wasnt that comfortable feeling any more that everything will be all right
9383256 anyone who stays behind is brave some will have no means to leave and wont have been identified by the authorities other will be obliged to stay like red cross workers and some just dont want to go i think its a lie about there being no shelters its a strategy to discourage people
9383257 after everything people suffered last time anyone who doesnt leave now thats crazy
9383258 what we do from here is critical were lucky to have that opportunity
9383259 the tri nations isnt over both sides are capable of winning it
9383260 its a one off encounter now and in one game both sides can make their season good
9383261 a test loss is a test loss i am not too concerned about the numbers to be frank it hurts to lose by one you can chase the statistic all you look the fact is it was a belting
9383262 these boys are feeling it and if that serves us well then thats good
9383263 i wasnt here in the past so i dont really know if he had a lack of dedication in the past
9383264 i mean i know what i read and i know what circulates in nfl circles
9383265 but when we sat down coming here we said were going to give this guy every benefit of the doubt and hes got to show us that he is dedicated and hes done everything that weve asked him to do and we feel very good about our decision to extend him
9383266 you guys see it out there we see it out there
9383267 hes done an excellent job in the weight room the meeting room hes come out there and hes jumped out at us on tape he looks good in the preseason so everything weve seen since we got here hes done everything weve asked him to do
9383268 to come back and clear my name is important to me
9383269 hes shown us that he can play so we didnt want him to make the free agent market

9383305 sir it was not so much the fear of striking hidden rocks as the fear of that hideous whiteness that so stirred me
9383306 this is a charge that police use for preventive detention
9383307 it requires that no actual criminal act be committed and borders on criminalizing political advocacy
9383308 this gene is crucial to the daisy chain of signals that run between body fat and the brain
9383309 it likely plays a pivotal role in how much we as humans eat and whether we have offspring
9383310 leptin tells the brain that times are good your body is full and that it is not necessary to eat more at the moment
9383311 controlling appetite and reproduction together provides a big evolutionary advantage
9383312 if there is no food the brain believes the body should not reproduce because without body fat a babys growth in the womb could be stunted and without food to replenish the bodys energy reserves there will be nothing to feed the offspring
9383313 leptin works remarkably well to give the brain a good indication of how much food has been eaten 99 9 percent of the time it balances food intake with energy use
9383314 the problem is that no machine works 100 percent of the time and that slight bit of inefficiency can lead to extra body weight
9383315 try to make a way to make sure the brain signals are being heard
9383316 their hormones and blood sugar resembled that seen in humans with these disorders
9383317 we dont study infertility but we put two and two together
9383318 we knew leptin is the critical hormone for regulating body weight and that it is also very important for regulating reproduction
9383319 this suggests that half of the dose of torc switch is enough to cause problems in leptin signaling in the brain and it may be that subtle mutations in torc1 in humans could be responsible for an inheritable risk factor for gaining weight
9383320 torc1 is regulated by phosphate handling enzymes called kinases and kinases often make for very good drug targets
9383321 as we continue to find genes that interact with each other and with environmental influences in this complex chronic disease we are building the foundation for personalized treatments tailored to a patients genetic profile
9383322 we will resequence the gene regions we have identified to pinpoint the causative mutations in these genes
9383323 we strongly suspect one gene will provide a compelling target for drug development given whats known about its biology
9383324 although the gene variants we found may have a stronger signal in pediatric ibd than in adult onset ibd we do not believe them to be limited to varieties of the disease that begin in childhood
9383325 as we better understand the complex gene interactions in ibd we may be able to diagnose patients by their genetic profile to predict who will better respond to anti tnf drugs
9383326 if better knowledge of the disease pathway enables pharmaceutical companies to develop anti tnf drugs in pill form the medications will be easier to deliver as well as more customized to each patient
9383327 telomerase is an ideal target for chemotherapy because it is active in almost all human tumors but inactive in most normal cells
9383328 that means a drug that deactivates telomerase would likely work against all cancers with few side effects
9383329 once we found that the gene from this organism expressed the protein in the quantities we needed we were able to move quickly
9383330 for the first time we can see how telomerase assembles at the end of chromosomes to initiate telomere replication
9383331 ive always been interested in understanding on a molecular level the function of protein nucleic acid assemblies and using that information in the treatment of human disease
9383332 telomerase because of its important role in cancer and aging was an obvious target for me
9383333 it required a lot of perseverance and effort but we really wanted to do this
9383334 as we continue to find genes that interact with each other and with environmental influences in this complex chronic disease we are building the foundation for personalized treatments tailored to a patients genetic profile

9383348 this is the mother of all storms and im not sure weve seen anything like it

9383399 all senator obama has had to do is talk thats all he does
9383400 shes vetoed legislation shes taken on corruption and in her party and won she took on the oil companies and won she administered a budget successfully
9383401 is the least experienced candidate for president in the last 100 years
9383402 i mean hes never run a city hes never run a state hes never run a business hes never administered a payroll hes never led people in crisis
9383403 is a little bit like opening a door and letting some fresh alaska air into washington
9383404 i think here he wanted to send the message get somebody fresh somebody really who represents the other america outside of washington where people dont care whether you have an r or a d after your name they just want you to get something done to help them deal with the problems they have

9383406 i think frankly the democratic party has done a disservice to women by trying to hold women hostage to the issue of roe v wade
9383407 the truth is the most important issue to women all the polls say this is the economy women are not single issue voters yes there are some women for whom the issue of reproductive rights trumps everything else but the truth is most women are not that way
9383408 she risked her political career to take on the special interests in her own party she took on the oil companies shes like mccain mccain wants to change this campaign from change to from left to right he wants to make it im going to clean out the stables
9383409 do people want a risky president the pluses and minuses are huge in this pick and thats why were talking about it
9383410 senator mccain has already indicated that it would be inappropriate to have celebrations that things have to be scaled back
9383411 we are 1 000 percent better prepared today than we were before katrina
9383412 we have the full resources of the federal government prepositioned supplies and equipment communications equipment and the resources of the united states military already on the scene helping to evacuate sick patients from hospitals
9383413 so we are as ready as you could possibly be what we have to hope and pray of course is that the storm does not go beyond the capacity of the levees to protect new orleans and the rest of the gulf coast

9383523 my father had nothing he and my mother sold everything they had to raise 10 000

9383526 and then rush to support her on ethics abuse we dont know if that was the case for now all we know is power was abused
9383527 she is more of the same and if you talk to alaskans especially the alaskan press youll actually see what people think
9383528 why do you think the mccain campaign announced on a friday before the convention
9383529 thankfully we have obama who seems to be more diligent and thoughtful with his decision making a vp vetting committee working for several months assembling groups of experts together in common purpose and listening to them international trips to get the real word on the ground outlining exactly what policies we can expect to see with him as president etc this is the kind of deliberate judgment we need going forward
9383530 yes obama being the reasonable man that he is choose someone who would bring reinforcement to one of his weaker attributes experience biden has 36 years in the senate and the vice president is the president of the senate tiebreaker
9383531 so what exactly is wrong with being a woman and supporting a woman to become president

9383539 the alaska national guard is alaskas component of the united states national guard and comprises the alaska army national guard and the alaska air national guard the constitution of the united states specifically charges the national guard with dual federal and state missions in fact the national guard is the only united states military force empowered to function in a state status those functions range from limited actions during non emergency situations to full scale law enforcement of martial law when local law enforcement officials can no longer maintain civil control the national guard may be called into federal service in response to a call by the president or congress

9383549 palins mother in law faye palin told a new york daily news reporter that she didnt agree with sarah on everything and hadnt yet decided how she would vote
9383550 im not sure what she brings to the ticket other than shes a woman and a conservative well shes a better speaker than mccain
9383551 i am up to the task of course of focusing on the challenges that face america
9383552 and i am very pleased with the situation that i am in when when you consider the situation now that alaska will be in

9383556 do people seriously think russia is going to send a fleet of row boats over to alaska to attack us
9383557 obama should be far more qualified than palin since he was born in hawaii it borders far more countries than alaska does including china north korea russia as well as multiple allies
9383558 i beg to disagree with any candidate who would say we cant drill our way out of our problem
9383559 its a good thing everyone isnt a self centered sociopath like you wed be in a much worse of position
9383560 we were all given packets with volunteer information and 12 phone numbers of registered voters we were asked to see how many calls we could make before the speech started to see if people were planning on voting for obama and to invite them to watch the acceptance speech on cnn i was a good soldier and made all 12 calls when i turned in my sheet i was rewarded with a cool little obama pin with the big dipper in the background nice
9383561 when youre hand picked by a man to win votes simply because you are a woman that doesnt count and it doesnt break any kind of ceiling
9383562 after extensive news coverage about all this nasty behind the scenes scandal troopergate which is definitely not squeaky clean palins approval ratings fell to 67 still high but a far cry from the 90 number thats being thrown around so glibly by the republicans today alaskans are quickly becoming disillusioned once again
9383563 i and all alaskans will be interested to see how this whole process unfolds this is definitely a gamble for mccain and in my humble opinion a gift to obama and to joe biden who just got thrown a big hunk of red meat for the vice presidential debate
9383564 until somebody answers for me what is it exactly that the vp does every day im used to being very productive and working real hard in an administration we want to make sure that that vp slot would be a fruitful type of position especially for alaskans and for the things that were trying to accomplish up here
9383565 she is also sueing the federal government over listing the polar bears as a threatened species
9383566 shes favored the trans canada proposal that will run the pipeline through canada in effect shipping us jobs over the border

9383572 successfully getting the votes of the majority of only 670 000 people
9383573 also the 147 000 votes absolutely destroyed the competition by over 20
9383574 he absolutely thinks she is the best thing thats happened to alaska in all of those years
9383575 but bear in mind that the 90 approval rating came from one of the most conservative and reddest of the red states out there

9383616 elections are short term efforts revolutions are long term projects
9383617 the notion of a rigid separation between church and state has no basis in either the text of the constitution or the writings of our founding fathers
9383618 the tired assertion of a separation of church and state has no historical or constitutional basis neither the language of the constitution itself nor the legislative history reveals any mention of such separation
9383619 through perverse court decisions and years of cultural indoctrination the elitist secular left has managed to convince many in our nation that religion must be driven from public view
9383620 the notion of a rigid separation between church and state has no basis in either the text of the constitution or the writings of our founding fathers
9383621 the founding fathers envisioned a robustly christian yet religiously tolerant america with churches serving as vital institutions that would eclipse the state in importance

9383633 it is compulsory for every developer to have a police permit to do rock blasting because it involves explosive devices like bombs and they must have at least one worker who is an explosives expert
9383634 within half an hour there was second blasting and this time i was outside the house while my father was in the kitchen
9383635 the earth shook under my feet and when i turned to look at the quarry and saw rocks flying towards my house i took cover behind the wall and within a few seconds my house was hit
9383636 my father was in the kitchen an indonesian worker who was fixing the lights in my house was injured on his head and hands he said
9383637 we were lucky that no one was staying in the house when this happened we want the quarry to be closed to stop the blasting once and for all
9383638 we are not interested in a temporary solution but a permanent one my house does not look stable now he said
9383639 we will only be happy if the blastings are stopped completely we fear that our houses will collapse one day because the foundation will be affected by the frequent blastings he said
9383640 can the developer ensure us that there will not be rocks falling on our houses from now on
9383641 the only solution i see is for the blastings to be stopped permanently he said
9383642 we had an adjuster to take the reports from the residents who can claim the damage from us we are also keen to solve the problem immediately

9383646 marine biologists diving at bikini have returned with glowing reports
9383647 but thats not to say everything is peachy with former nuke test sites radioactive fallout and the dizzyingly complex study of it depends on factors such as microclimates local geography wind altitude of detonation size of the bomb and environmental conditions on the ground like soils rock type and vegetation there are places in the pacific you dont want to go and probably cant thats why theyre off limits the same is true for parts of the nevada test site and other detonation locations

9383656 there have really been few attempts to explain to people what electronic music is really about
9383657 sometimes the effort the attempt to try to create something can be just as interesting as the end result
9383658 techno is a music of ideas of trying to make something of the future future music music of a type of transition something between two points
9383659 i wasnt trying to conclude something whether i was a good dj or a bad dj or whatever it was made with the objective of documenting what a dj does
9383660 or even with someone elses track taking the information from the parties that i do watching the people then bringing that information back to the studio and composing tracks in relation to other peoples or something of my own looking to see what is available and what is missing actually
9383661 memorized every track and every part of every track is memorized so i can grab literally any record and make it fit

9383669 the notion of stolen elections is something we assign to third world countries but not this beacon of freedom and democracy that we like to view ourselves as
9383670 american elections have become like a game of russian roulette every time you go to the voting booth
9383671 both of the major political parties have a serious case of shortsightedness
9383672 this is a battle about election integrity and thats what i think uncounted is about but democrats are under the impression that by talking about election integrity its going to keep people away from the voting booth and lower voter turnout thats bizarre
9383673 i assumed we would see a repeat of the 2000 election and a long fight but kerry conceded pretty quickly
9383674 i was sure the media would then begin to look into these irregularities that took place particularly in ohio with the exit polls i remember sitting in my favorite coffee shop reading the new york times and looking for a story but there was nothing just complete silence i thought i had to look into this as a citizen because it just didnt seem right
9383675 i think this is a documentary that takes a 30 000 foot view of this issue of election fraud and explains why people should be concerned
9383676 we grew up believing in this dream of what this country is supposed to be and i think people are offended that they are being disrespected that their vote is being disrespected
9383677 as this is one of the most important elections in our nations history premiering this thought provoking documentary is not only timely but necessary viewing
9383678 the notion of widespread voter fraud is itself a fraud evidence of actual fraud by individual voters is painfully skimpy
9383679 the reality is our vote is not protected and its likely that the 2008 election results will be manipulated even worse than in 2004 and 2000
9383680 a set of assumptions concepts values and practices that constitutes a way of viewing reality for the community that shares them especially in an intellectual discipline

9383684 while many websites cover medal tallies and country standings we turn our cameras 180 degrees to show national pride fan support and local color along with great sports photography
9383685 we want to provide a sense of what its like to be at the games through pictures and personal stories direct from beijing
9383686 the olympic games captivate people everywhere and enable the worlds best athletes to showcase their talents
9383687 dating back to the first modern olympic games in athens in 1896 kodak has been there to help capture and preserve the history while also supporting the athletes were proud to play that role again in beijing
9383688 the olympic games have played a major role for kodak historically helping us to showcase our products innovations and services
9383689 we are culminating a long fruitful relationship with the olympic movement and look forward to a successful program at the beijing 2008 olympic games
9383690 as we complete the transformation of kodak it makes sense for us to take a new direction
9383691 digital technology changes everything including the way we market our products and services
9383692 our new business strategy requires us to reassess our marketing tactics as well and adapt them to changing market conditions and evolving customer behavior
9383693 salespeople said that accounts that didnt used to return their calls were suddenly calling them
9383694 the olympics completely changed the way people looked at us
9383695 i believe that it must be the policy of the united states to support free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressures
9383696 the constitution is nothing but a god damn piece of paper
9383697 be not intimidated nor suffer yourselves to be wheedled out of your liberties by any pretense of politeness delicacy or decency these as they are often used are but three different names for hypocrisy chicanery and cowardice

9383704 they chose a place that is literally one mile above the american people
9383705 we have an opportunity to take one of the primary tools that past prime ministers in the country have used like a club they have gone to the people before their five years were up and every political party has suffered from that i think the parliament of canada has suffered from it this is the first prime minister who is willing to give up that huge tool in his tool chest
9383706 i think that common sense is having an election every four years and not on the whim and call of the prime minister
9383707 it improves governance by removing power from the prime ministers office and devolving it to the people as it should be
9383708 as i indicated we have passed bill c 16 on fixed election dates through the house of commons never again will the government of the day be able to play around with the date of an election for its own crass political motives
9383709 the increased electoral fairness through bill c 16 will ensure that elections occur once every four years not when the prime minister chooses to call them
9383710 we have seen for an example very important democratic reform initiatives such as fixed election dates which is bill c 16 it passed and has come into force it states that the third monday of october 2009 will be the date for the next general election unless of course by some strange occurrence the combined opposition determines that it wants to have an election before that date that was the first initiative that we brought in to try to ensure canadians that there would be some consistency and regularity in the timing of federal elections

9383714 new york marketwatch weve all heard the panic banks arent lending theyre teetering on the edge of collapse the government cant afford to bail them out you cant trust what banks say about the quality of their assets
9383715 not good indeed but are the columbian banks of the world really going to be the end of the u s banking system are we going to see massive failures will the taxpayers be forced to bail out the system is it time to put our money in the mattress

9383764 i basically dont like electronic music i like to compose it im just not a big fan of it
9383765 his conversion in a sense is a relinquishing of the need to control the rejection of what he called an antisocial bent
9383766 thanks for sharing such lively genuine conversations about the work of real psychiatrists
9383767 feeling like i am in a friendly mental health discussion group with other fun witty professionals how providers talk shop amongst themselves
9383768 wonderful blend of information and humor feels like friends a little nerdy a little goofy interesting and loveable
9383769 winning combination of likeable mildly argumentative and almost always interesting personalities often laugh out loud funny
9383770 explorers dont leave fellow explorers lost we want to find out what happened to our friend and colleague no more and no less
9383771 while i feel hes under our nose here hes in an area thats extremely hard to get to its the vertical terrain its the dark terrain and its the trees the vegetation
9383772 if that aircraft didnt go straight down and kind of angled in under a stand of pine trees its going to take someone physically walking upon that scene to find it
9383773 its hard to believe in this day and age that someone could disappear like this until you go up in an aircraft and look at how rough the terrain is its absolutely amazing

9383782 whats not to like about a woman who guts her own moose
9383783 we do not favour sanctions on the whole and only resort to them in extreme circumstances but if required we could pass the relevant legislation
9383784 any sanctions would hurt the european union first of all much more than russia
9383785 russia wants to be an equal partner but the partnership should not be the kind of partnership between the horseman and horse but of two equal individuals
9383786 the situation is very difficult and we must be firm on our position in offering a line defending of course territorial integrity of georgia
9383787 when russia has a grievance over an issue such as south ossetia it should act multilaterally by consent rather than unilaterally by force
9383788 my message to russia is simple if you want to be welcome at the top table of organisations such as the g8 oecd and wto you must accept that with rights come responsibilities
9383789 the dangerous spiral of violence over georgia must be stopped
9383790 we need a strong and sensible european role to allow a return to reason and responsibility
9383791 someone should first tell me what a sanction against russia could be
9383792 particularly in such a serious political situation it is necessary to show a bit of common sense
9383793 be sure your wipe yourself enough if you walk around soiled youll not only get a rash but everyone will call you names and not want to play with you just because you smell

9383848 we have built a system we cannot control most of us in order to have a house and car a refrigerator and so on must sacrifice our time and our own lives in exchange we are constantly under the pressure of time we have created a society in which the rich become richer and the poor become poorer and in which we are so caught up in our own immediate problems that we cannot afford to be aware of what is going on with the rest of the human family or our own planet earth in my mind i see a group of chickens in a cage disputing over some grains of seed unaware that in a few hours they will be killed
9383849 booooppp this is just a test of the emergency broadcast system had there been a real emergency
9383850 before she can answer my older sister pipes up that i look like one of our great aunts i feel a momentary zing within me at her comment and then it disappears my sister in law muses out loud about my lack of resemblance to my parents or sisters i say nothing
9383851 its too bad she doesnt look like anyone in the family
9383852 i still smile when i say it or think about it
9383853 its simply part of who i am not the whole of who i am

9383872 babe ruth if i couldve got it in my bag but i dont think i couldve got away with it
9383873 i feel better than i have in past years at this point
9383874 weve had our backs up against the wall a lot lately and even more now
9383875 im not getting it done and thats all there is to it
9383876 this is the time when i should be winning ballgames im letting a team down big time its just frustrating im not doing my job i know how precious every win is right now
9383877 i just misread it got a bad jump and couldnt recover
9383878 well work with the government to end the reign of terror from right wing paramilitaries
9383879 nobody really believes that campaign rhetoric is the same as applied policy
9383880 i wouldve landed my airplane at the nearest air force base and come over personally
9383881 yet on the issue of new orleans its still unclear how different mccain and bush actually are
9383882 the senator wont present his own plans for recovery at least not today
9383883 johnny depp jams on guitar to raise money for childrens charity
9383884 i thought a 66 or a 65 would be a great round
9383885 starting this year i decided to tell myself something similar to what vijay told himself last week that im a great putter and that im a lot better than people think and people write
9383886 so today was a good reflection and if you look at my putting stats for the year im one of the great putters on tour
9383887 its time to step it up and give a little kick on my butt and join them so ive been working on that
9383888 lets see how we do at the end of the year
9383889 we played one game and it was a big game we got a few big games left
9383890 i think tech finished 11 3 and i think they won the conference last year
9383891 just talking to your players you cant quit after one game
9383892 but then we still have to prepare for the season
9383893 we still have goals to reach we still have a chance to go to the acc championship and the national championship
9383894 the biggest thing with all the negative publicity and rightfully so based on the performance is ive got to talk to the team not to believe it
9383895 what a great asset thank you for all your hard work and diligence
9383896 i like the fact that you show all races keep up the good work
9383897 in a medium that is usually muddled with lazy arguments and poor grammar your writing breaks through with a clarity that makes us all say
9383898 i read your site every day keeps me focused and honest
9383899 youre blog has inspired me to start my own thank you

9383903 i love your blog one of the few very few i will read all the way
9383904 our compliments for your blog we like it a lot
9383905 weve got send a message and kids have to learn
9383906 were aware of lamarrs situation and are disappointed anytime one of our players is accused of wrongdoing we take a strong stance against drinking and driving and will thoroughly investigate this situation brown said
9383907 following the completion of the legal process we will do whats best for the university lamarr and the team one thing we have really prided ourselves on in our program is our family atmosphere and this will be handled within our family
9383908 we did what we did because it was a pretty easy call said brian barnhart indycar series president of competition and operations
9383909 he had a tremendous run out of turn 12 and helio crossed over almost the entire width of the track to impede the progress of the car behind him
9383910 youve got to give them credit coach gary pinkel said
9383911 but a lot of stuff with us was blown coverages thats something we have to fix quick hopefully it takes us just this one game
9383912 ive been doing this 30 years so you enjoy winning pinkel said
9383913 am i kind of glad theyre disappointed yeah we learn from them we evaluate and if we won by a landslide wed have done the same thing
9383914 the fourth quarter we made a lot of mistakes missouri end stryker sulak said
9383915 guys made some big plays but theres still a lot of stuff to work on
9383916 you hear all the horror stories from that year but when you think about it it was really something special we went through
9383917 it wasnt anything we signed up for but to be a member of that team im proud of that and the way we hung together i feel like this team can handle the exact same things and be successful
9383918 openers are always tough but when you have a coaching switch as ucla did it makes it especially tough for us tennessee coach phillip fulmer said
9383919 it will be a process of adjusting and learning throughout the game both teams will have to adjust as the game moves along
9383920 its going to be a heck of a lot of fun he said
9383921 getting the national spotlight on monday night football two quality teams it doesnt get much better than that
9383922 we certainly understand the stature of their program and the challenge that lies ahead of us neuheisel said
9383923 were eager to find out where we are were aware we have a formidable foe in an sec mainstay like tennessee
9383924 we know were going to have play our level best to be in the game but thats exciting if you choose to look at it that way i think you give yourself a better chance of actually pulling it off
9383925 the unknown in this deal is how fast our offense responds to coach chow and how fast their offense responds to their new coordinator neuheisel said
9383926 and the two new quarterbacks that will be of interest
9383927 i was in a similar situation at san diego state where i was the third quarterback and three games into the season im in there he said recalling how injuries sidelined the aztecs first two quarterbacks two years ago
9383928 the first game i started was at byu so i know what to expect
9383929 guys are stepping up not just at quarterback craft said
9383930 a lot of linemen got hurt and guys stepped up weve been moving guys around and everybodys been improving
9383931 i think this group has a little chip on its shoulder feels like its been cast off as also rans the bruins coach said
9383932 i think theyre anxious to show that were more than that
9383933 i think shes going to help me with all americans
9383934 i think that the response that were getting from men women young old because they want us to change america they want us to change it theyre sick and tired of business as usual and inside the beltway kind of thing
9383935 84 percent of the american people think the country is on the wrong track
9383936 have four years to learn at the foot of the master
9383937 a choice between one candidate who has been tested and one who has not who would do a better job at national security who do you feel safe with
9383938 palin has traveled outside the usa twice once to ireland and in 2007 to germany and kuwait
9383939 i feel good to be here staying in the division so not really much of a difference as far as guys you are going against and i just feel good to be here to be wanted and i am just looking forward to doing some good things on this defense
9383940 coach spags has done a good job here mcdougle said
9383941 he really gets after it and kind of put his own niche on kind of the defense that we were running there in philly it is good for me because there is a lot of movement which allows for guys like me a chance to kind of move and get after the quarterback a little bit
9383942 the democratic party made their convention green so in response ive been running a microwave full of styrofoam cups nonstop for 72 hours well the convention is over so its time to turn off the microwave huh it mustve all evaporated well i guess we all learned that you can irradiate a styrofoam cup for three days straight with absolutely no consequences take that environmentalists youre the same people who told me i shouldnt dump my a man size styrofoam cup comes around the corner and attacks him aauuuuugh auuuughh giant styrofoam cup no no how can i kill you how can i kill you auuugh get back get back pulls out a giant sweet n low packet ill open it goodnight everybody well see you next week in st paul
9383943 hillary left 18 million cracks in the highest hardest glass ceiling in america
9383944 you hear all the horror stories from that year but when you think about it it was really something special we went through
9383945 it wasnt anything we signed up for but to be a member of that team im proud of that and the way we hung together i feel like this team can handle the exact same things and be successful
9383946 we want an agreement to end the israeli occupation and establish an independent palestinian state with jerusalem as its capital
9383947 president abbas told olmert that we will not be part of an interim or shelf agreement
9383948 either we agree on all issues or no agreement at all
9383949 you are a man of peace you should meet people of peace
9383950 the most critical issue that threatens the whole peace process now
9383951 high tension towers were twisted and down roofs blown off entire towns schools destroyed and in palacios even the baseball stadiums walls were gone
9383952 its a double edged sword and its either your co workers or your family
9383953 some of us are much stronger than others i know several officers who were fired they were damned good officers
9383954 the superintendent has done everything possible to ensure the officers will stay in and hes confident none of them will leave
9383955 short of another katrina our community is confident the force will take care of our needs
9383956 those problems are not indicative or reflective of the force as a whole
9383957 the force as a whole is doing a good job
9383958 i have a lot of admiration for the police that stayed
9383959 i couldnt tell you what i would do in that scenario not knowing where my family is
9383960 you cant perform your job if youre worried about where your family is regardless of your occupation
9383961 i figured instead of spending my off day on the beach id go to new orleans and get my stuff out of there
9383962 with the hurricane coming i wanted to make sure i had something to come back to it was a hectic 24 hours packed up everything in my apartment
9383963 the atmosphere was kind of hectic the airport was pretty packed
9383964 the lines for people who were just buying tickets that day were pretty long there were a lot of people taking just one bag and going to family nearby and hopefully they would come back to something
9383965 we can activate an e mail list of a couple million people who want to give back
9383966 i think we can get tons of volunteers to travel down there if it becomes necessary
9383967 a big storm like this raises bipartisan concerns and i think for john to want to find out whats going on is fine
9383968 the thing that i always am concerned about in the middle of a storm
9383969 is whether were drawing resources away from folks on the ground because the secret service and various security requirements sometimes it pulls police fire and other departments away from concentrating on the job
9383970 im assuming that where he went that wasnt an issue were going to try to stay clear of the area until things have settled down and then well probably try to figure out how we can be as helpful as possible
9383971 nearly 1 million barrels of daily oil production is now shut down the last time this happened was in november 2005 after hurricanes katrina and rita in addition 2 75 billion cubic feet of daily natural gas production is now shut down
9383972 to discover a cluster that is so distant yet so big was quite lucky
9383973 2xmm j083026 524133 the most x ray luminous cluster at redshift 1
9383974 now explain this gap between high school graduation and college apparently you arent very good at making plans for the future are you
9383975 met many wonderful people who work for the federal government out of a sense of service to their country
9383976 unfortunately there is also a sizeable and growing number of federal employees who undermine the agencies they serve by failing to show up to work i believe the american taxpayer deserves better
9383977 little more than a collection of numbers surrounded by innuendoes and loose extrapolations
9383978 no agency is going to let employees rack up hundreds of hours of leave without permission without taking some action
9383979 the same key drivers of the industry are our own challenges talent business environment and new sites for expansion
9383980 our inability to meet these challenges can seriously affect our competitiveness
9383981 these are centuries old traditions and i will continue to defend them
9383982 only those who indulge in immoral acts should be afraid
9383983 turn that effing thing off this is your kids big day never to be repeated be here
9383984 would i have felt the same way if it was a working mom in another situation say a mom with a baby in a rebozo selling at a market
9383985 worked to pass every one of our nations civil rights laws
9383986 i will ask stephen harper face to face to explain why he is in such a rush to violate the spirit of his own legislation i will ask him to explain why he wants to break his word yet again
9383987 the prime minister wants to see if we have common ground he has no vision to address the climate change crisis has no plan to re invigorate the canadian economy which is teetering on the brink of a recession and his only new policy this summer has been his cuts to canadas vital cultural communities
9383988 i would willingly stand at street corners hat in hand asking passersby to drop their unused minutes into it
9383989 modern civilization is so complex as to make the devotional life all but impossible
9383990 canadians are gearing up for an election although they werent sure they wanted one they seem mostly accepting of the idea that there will be one as the parties approach the starting gate it seems clear that the conservatives are stronger than the liberals in the west but the liberals are comparatively strong east of manitoba canadians show good levels of confidence in the conservatives on taxes and defence but like the liberals more on social issues and the environment for the liberals to win they need to draw soft ndp bq and green party voters be vigorously competitive on economic issues and play up environmental and possibly foreign policy differences as well taking into account the debate south of the border on world affairs for the conservatives to win they need to illustrate convincingly why they are a better choice for the economy and taxes and make the case that they offer more appealing leadership the outcome may ultimately rest as it has in the last two elections on the question of whether the campaign is highly polarizing and if so whether the polarization serves to galvanize and grow even by a little bit the conservative support pool and whether it results in the migration of green and soft left voters towards the liberals
9383991 my advice for the liberals tie the environmental green shift message in with a wider platform and plan for the economy
9383992 more than 200 000 have left the new orleans area edmonson said
9383993 the message to the people of the gulf coast is this storm is dangerous
9383994 theres a real possibility of flooding storm surge and high winds therefore it is very important for you to follow the instructions and direction of state and local officials do not put yourself in harms way or make rescue workers take unnecessary risks
9383995 in light of these events i will not be going to minnesota for the republican national convention im going to travel down to texas tomorrow to visit with the emergency operations center in austin
9383996 this is a system that scares every western air force
9383997 they are saying if you dont stop meddling in our sphere of influence this is what we are going to do
9383998 do you like my mug it holds a lot of vodka
9383999 okay daisy lets go find you a cup with two people on it so we match
9384000 do you know how much it means to me the way you make me feel like i could soar the heavens gathering shooting stars place them in a bouquet in a rainbow studded jar
9384001 lets not have any quarreling between you and me or between your herdsmen and mine for we are brothers is not the whole land before you lets part company if you go to the left ill go to the right if you go to the right ill go to the left
9384002 south east and west all the land that you see i will give to you and your offspring forever i will make your offspring like the dust of the earth so that if anyone could the dust then your offspring could be counted
9384003 you pick first and ill take whatever you dont pick
9384004 do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit but in humility consider others better than yourselves
9384005 most of the time you should consider others feelings when talking or doing
9384006 be sure your wants and desires are met as long as you dont trample over others to get there
9384007 all men are created equal and you need to treat all men as your equal
9384008 do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit but in humility consider others better than yourselves

9384218 paul has some future in terms of his ability from a size speed standpoint
9384219 is he there yet no but hes got the kind of talent we want to hang onto right now
9384220 jamal should be good to go in the next day or so if jamal were gone for an extended period of time you would basically see jerome take over the first and second down type plays and jason would probably stay in the role he has now which is a third down back and a special teams guy
9384221 when jamal is healthy it takes 15 to 20 carries to really get to a point where you maximize what he can do when that happens it is difficult to get a second or alternate runner a lot of touches jason is a third down back and special teams guy if something were to happen to jamal it would be kind of a committee type thing with wright and harrison
9384222 to delete line 9 actually that annoys me i would like if the oireachtas debates online explained a bit more

9384226 its labor day weekend so we paused to think about work then we started thinking about people whose work attracts the suspicion dismissal or loathing of the general public
9384227 we are looking at how to face inflationary pressures and growth problems
9384228 im not top fit but i need to do everything to be top fit fight every point
9384229 im really happy to win three rounds in three sets i hope i will be fit and feeling good for the fourth round
9384230 without a stronger society there wont be a police to defend against crime
9384231 serve to denounce crimes and promote a culture of participation and denunciations
9384232 we are very satisfied with the result of this meeting we believe its an important step
9384233 the president read each of our demands and promised what he could promise and explained his answers to other points
9384234 in the first set she played quite solid i was the one who was all over the place i couldnt find my rhythm in these conditions and she took advantage of that
9384235 i stayed calm and composed and knew i had to do something to change that in the second set i did the smart things and i cruised through the second and third set
9384236 by winning a grand slam i would regain the number one ranking again its something i want to achieve again
9384237 it would be nice to come back to the number one spot
9384238 it would be great if i can do it we will see what happens
9384239 i have been injured right now i finally do not have any problems
9384240 little by little i feel like im getting better every day
9384241 i feel the shots a lot better than i did at the beginning of the tournament thats my goal get my game together by the end of the tournament
9384242 the second set i got a bit more defensive even though i was hitting the ball it wasnt going well she kept coming in and forcing play she was just better than me
9384243 im getting better each day im improving on my fitness
9384244 i can push off better little by little im putting the pieces together im bringing my game to the next level i believe in myself
9384245 monty only managed to leave a voice message i could sense he was disappointed but he wished me well and wished the team well
9384246 ive been watching these guys through the summer ian is a very determined guy i love his attitude and what he did at the open that back nine he played with the intention to win and had that emotional feeling
9384247 maybe i should have gone to play gleneagles but i stuck by my word looking back at the time i made the right decision for me but it was so difficult to choose the right thing to do and its obviously been a very difficult decision to try to get across
9384248 i think i will bring my best game excitement flair and the passion that i always play golf with
9384249 i think i will be a strong asset to the team ive been looking at the points list every single week since the open and i thought the only scenario that would put a spanner in the works was darren playing well
9384250 ive been watching paul play and he has been playing absolutely the best through the summer
9384251 i was waiting for the putting to turn around that has been very important he has an extremely good record in the ryder cup and going back the walker cup
9384252 obviously i am disappointed that i wasnt selected but i have dealt with much worse and it will make me all the more determined to make the team that will play in wales next time
9384253 there was a qualifying period and i didnt make it automatically so you will not hear any sour grapes from me i couldnt have tried any harder and i devoted myself to the european tour to give myself the best possible chance but although i have won twice this year it obviously wasnt enough
9384254 i fully respect the captains decision and i would like to wish him and his team all the very best for valhalla i will be supporting them from wherever i am
9384255 depor won and congratulations to them but we should have defended better for both of their goals
9384256 we were poor going forward and know we have to improve
9384257 with the quality we have in the team we are going to score goals
9384258 on a personal note it was a double boost as i made my debut and got a goal
9384259 im optimistic we were unlucky it was a strange and unusual match but i think they are the surprise of the day
9384260 i dont think we were missing much in the team we attacked for 90 minutes and were punished by the two chances bologna had we could have been more compact and together but from a physical perspective we couldnt have done any more than that
9384261 the result was fair because we werent able to close out the match but a draw at a difficult ground is not a big drama
9384262 im not super happy but the team didnt play badly
9384263 im shutting my shutters but then im going to drink
9384264 im opening the porch bar until it gets too windy im anxious but im staying
9384265 the challenge seems to be that people arent listening or they are listening and deciding to stay
9384266 they were out walking their dogs this morning and have no intention of leaving
9384267 most are people of means they have generators they have security they got guns god bless them
9384268 im all american but my family history is palestinian so we are used to evacuating
9384269 latinos are fearful that by being taken to shelters they will be turned over to immigration officials
9384270 often people along the way like shelter workers take to being ice agents and turn people in
9384271 we didnt have enough people to go into the neighborhoods where we know latinos are living
9384272 we put out word on two spanish radio stations which is the best we can do
9384273 weve gotten lizards birds dogs cats bunnies and even a pig
9384274 we even had an english mastiff so big we needed to order a special crate
9384275 the tracks go through the levees and they are going to be closing the flood gates behind us

9384277 botelho fue abandonado junto a su contador pedro pereira melho tambi n brasile o a pocos kil metros del pueblo paraguayo bella vista norte en la frontera con la ciudad brasile a bela vista del estado campo grande
9384278 porque desean anular el juramento del ex presidente nicanor duarte pero hicieron jurar a un senador no electo alberto grill n
9384279 porque grill n no fue elegido senador ni mucho menos proclamado pero la mayor a de legisladores que apoya a lugo lo convirtieron en senador activo
9384280 ni la menor duda de que lugo quiere cerrar el parlamento
9384281 con decretos al estilo hugo ch vez rafael correa y evo morales
9384282 lugo no s lo se sac la careta sino el cuerpo entero al soltarse de boca y decir la semana pasada que eventualmente podr a llamar a una consulta popular
9384283 es senador electo porque la justicia electoral y la corte suprema de justicia resolvieron que deb a jurar los de la apc no protestaron en su momento el poder judicial interpreta la constituci n

9384289 autumnal nothing to do with leaves it is to do with a certain brownness at the edges of the day brown is creeping up on us take my word for it russets and tangerine shades of old gold flushing the very outside edge of the senses deep shining ochres burnt umber and parchments of baked earth reflecting on itself and through itself filtering the light at such times perhaps coincidentally the leaves might fall somewhere
9384290 the lovely warm feeling of satisfaction resulting from enthusiastic reviews
9384291 suddenly you find youre out there walking in a storm

9384295 obama put his country first when he picked biden mccain put his campaign first

9384311 federal officials say nearly 600 suspected illegal immigrants were detained in a raid on a manufacturing plant in southern mississippi making it the largest such sweep in the country a spokeswoman says more than 100 of those caught up in mondays raid on howard industries were released based on humanitarian concerns mostly because they have children most of the rest were transferred to a federal immigration and customs enforcement facility in jena la nine 17 year olds were transferred to the custody of the office of refugee resettlement
9384312 matthis chiroux is the kind of young american us military recruiters love
9384313 im not sure what she brings to the ticket other than shes a woman and a conservative well shes a better speaker than mccain
9384314 people will say she hasnt been on the national scene long enough but i believe shes a quick study
9384315 im still leaning toward obama i think sarah has been really good for our state and it would be wonderful to see her in the white house but shes on the ticket with mccain and i cant vote for mccain
9384316 if it was her running for president thered be no question in my mind
9384317 the republicans right now are about big business and big oil i dont see sarah as a staunch republican in that way
9384318 i recently got a playstation 3 from my wonderful girlfriend and one of the reasons i wanted one was for its great possibilities of being a media center
9384319 i just thought that he had worked so hard and i was trying to think of a way i could do something for him
9384320 along with our exhibitors we will bring the fascinating world of interactive games from the trade fairgrounds to the city and beyond the city limits with gamescoms innovative concept we can have all target groups participating actively ranging from the intensive players to the occasional players
9384321 it was to be expected that the leipzig trade fair would try to keep the topic in its 2009 programme as well by announcing its date but they will have to do it without the industry for the most part the lead trade fair will take place in cologne in 2009 and beyond
9384322 from leipzig we are bringing the clear message that the games industry will be exhibiting in 2009 in cologne at gamescom we have met with broad approval and the industry is looking forward to gathering in cologne whatever happens in germany in 2009 outside of cologne cannot claim to represent this sector
9384323 the general visitors area at gamescom is the hotspot and starting point for action events and entertainment we are developing it at the moment piece by piece in dialogue with the games industry so that we can offer all target groups from intensive players to occasional players to newcomers in terms of pc and video games an optimal programme at the premiere both at and beyond the trade fairgrounds in doing so new conceptual approaches will ensure that the event character can be perceived by all target groups
9384324 party on with these smart stainless steel wine clips each attaches to a plate to hold your drink firmly in place leaving you to concentrate on the food and fun
9384325 another feature we havent seen before that all tvs should have is half mute which lets you quickly turn the volume down without completely muting it
9384326 i am extremely pleased we worked very hard and it is a fantastic result
9384327 these saucers can float into buildings seeking out the enemy or be used to track roadside explosives they will save lives and be an asset on the front line
9384328 things are going on well we will be carrying out software and system testing by september and the e auctioning of tea will commence from november
9384329 we could have implemented the e auctioning solution much earlier but for durga puja festivities in west bengal
9384330 deforestation has to fall more and the conditions for sustainable development have to improve
9384331 if you see something you dont understand you have to ask why
9384332 and mickey gets cuter because walt disney makes more money that way
9384333 evolution has been the focus of a lot of debate in our state this year
9384334 if you read the newspapers everyone is arguing is it a theory is it not a theory the answer is we can observe it we can see it happen just like you can see it in mickey
9384335 i can see that theres no way i came from an ape
9384336 is this really what they want us to teach for the next 10 years
9384337 i dont think we have this great massive change over time where we go from fish to amphibians from monkeys to man
9384338 we see lizards with different shaped tails we dont see blizzards the lizard bird
9384339 we also failed to include astrology alchemy and the concept of the moon being made of green cheese
9384340 i can do this until the end of the semester and i can only assume that it will work the same way each time
9384341 bryce what is it called when natural laws are suspended what do you call it when water changes into wine
9384342 it cant tell you whats right and wrong it doesnt address ethics but it is not anti religion science and religion just ask different questions
9384343 cant test it cant prove it cant disprove it its not a question for science
9384344 but there is scientific proof that there is a god
9384345 over in turkey theres a piece of wood from noahs ark that came out of a glacier
9384346 if i could prove tomorrow that that chunk of wood is not from the ark is not even 500 years old and not even from the right kind of tree would that damage your religious faith at all
9384347 and science is not based on faith i dont expect you to believe the scientific explanation of evolution that were going to talk about over the next few weeks
9384348 i still dont have a good feeling on how well any of them are internalizing any of this
9384349 its maybe the size of a dogs jaw or a cats
9384350 i think a big reason evolutionists believe what they believe is they dont want to have to be ruled by god
9384351 thats why people stand strong with christianity because it teaches people to lead a good life and not do wrong
9384352 ill watch the discovery channel and say ooh thats interesting
9384353 but theres a difference between thinking something is interesting and believing it
9384354 homo sapiens appeared in africa 200 000 years ago based on fossil and dna evidence
9384355 the fossil evidence of hominids alleged human ancestors is extremely limited
9384356 but theirs is a longer hand because monkeys live in trees all the time and their arms are very long
9384357 but this is happening over millions of years with humans if im lucky i might see four generations in my lifetime
9384358 then whatever we evolved from where did it evolve from
9384359 how does our hand go from being that long to just a smaller hand
9384360 individuals with small hands will have more children while those with bigger hands will disappear
9384361 but if we came from them why are they still around
9384362 just because a new population evolves doesnt mean the old one dies out
9384363 if the environment is suitable a species can go on for a long time
9384364 well good luck little birdies you might have to be on your own
9384365 the democratic party if elected on november 4 2008 will deliver health insurance to every man woman and child

9384367 lablit is all about encouraging the use of realistic depictions of science and scientists in realistic fiction
9384368 its a wonderful venture and a topic of the most resonant importance
9384369 to have two people that are new to the program account for over 50 percent of the goals is a really good sign
9384370 being a freshman i didnt even expect to get in a lot this year but to score two goals in my first home game is a great feeling
9384371 breeding or nature of upbringing was according to my birth and the nature of my sex
9384372 mir kommt es immer vor als benutzten die forensiker aus new york v llig andere ger te als die aus den anderen serien um damit exakt die gleichen dinge zu tun warum ist das so
9384373 das ist doch klar das new yorker kriminallabor hat nat rlich die modernste ausstattung und besten leute der welt wissen sie ich sehe das so mein team ist das beste das es gibt
9384374 ich bin mit dem film zu den filmfestspielen von cannes gefahren dort wurde er zum ersten mal vor publikum gezeigt
9384375 nicht direkt ich habe eine liste mit vorschl gen f r vornamen und nachnamen abgegeben und dann hat serienerfinder anthony zuiker daraus den rollennamen zusammengesetzt mac ist der name meines sohnes wir haben ihn nach dem bruder meiner frau benannt der 1983 gestorben ist ich hielt das f r einen guten namen
9384376 wir spielen viel f r unsere truppen auf amerikanischen st tzpunkten im ausland und ich habe festgestellt wo ich auch hinkam dass die menschen sagten schau das kommt lieutenant dan da konnte ich die band auch gleich so nennen jetzt wissen die leute wenigstens schon vorher wer kommt
9384377 es ist ein hochwertiges produkt und hatte eine gro e chance auf erfolg angesichts des erfolgs der anderen beiden serien dachte ich wenn ich fernsehen mache dann ist das die serie die wahrscheinlich hervorragend beworben und gute einschaltquoten erreichen wird was der fall ist die serie ist gut geschrieben au erdem steckt auch hier produzent jerry bruckheimer dahinter und deshalb wusste ich die serie w rde gut laufen und sie tut es
9384378 ich war nicht auf der suche nach arbeit beim fernsehen aber als ich das angebot erhielt bezog ich verschiedene faktoren in die berlegung ein regelm ige besch ftigung und die arbeit am wohnort meine kinder sind jetzt in einem alter in dem ich nicht lange von zu hause weg m chte es hat so viele vorteile ich opfere die freiheit viele verschiedene charaktere zu spielen im kino oder am theater aber im moment ist mir die stabilit t wichtiger das wissen einen regelm igen job zu haben
9384379 ich hab nicht viel davon gesehen aber ich kenne william petersen der in der ersten serie mitspielt und ich hatte ausschnitte daraus gesehen mehr nicht als ich dar ber nachdachte in csi ny mitzuspielen hat mir anthony zuiker ein paar komplette episoden geschickt die ich mir dann angeschaut habe
9384380 ja ich fands sehr interessant und bruckheimer gibt der serie diesen coolen kino look es hat mir sehr gut gefallen
9384381 wir haben ja echte tatortermittler am set wenn ich was wissen will frage ich die als ich kopfgeld mit mel gibson gedreht habe habe ich etwas zeit mit ein paar tatortermittlern verbracht und ich erinnere mich noch an vieles was sie mir erz hlt haben aber ich bin nie an einen echten tatort gegangen und habe mir leichen angeguckt das ist nichts f r mich
9384382 ja tu ich aber unsere serie ist noch neu und kann sich entwickeln und solange es sie geben wird werden wir diese charaktere erforschen das ist das gute an einer serie es gibt immer eine neue episode in der n chsten woche und wenn sie erfolgreich ist hat man immer die gelegenheit neues auszuprobieren und das werden wir ber die jahre tun
9384383 komisch dar ber habe ich auch gerade erst nachgedacht vielleicht f hre ich ja irgendwann mal bei csi ny regie aber im moment konzentriere ich mich auf meine arbeit als schauspieler wenn ich eines tages eine gute story finde die ich im theater oder kino umsetzen m chte dann werde ich das tun aber im moment ist mir die serie wichtiger
9384384 the state of the unions in 2008 a profile of union membership in los angeles california and the nation
9384385 it shows that despite an extremely hostile environment unions can grow
9384386 in a very real way los angeles and california continue to serve as strong growth engines for organized labor nationally
9384387 the labor movement here is in much better shape than in much of the rest of the country if this years nationwide increase proves to be a lasting trend historians will look back and see the leading edge of that growth here in the west
9384388 one component of this growth is recent union organizing like the service employees international unions successful security officer campaign here in l a but the regions unionization rates are affected by many other factors
9384389 if jobs are lost in nonunion sectors due to an economic downturn as weve seen recently in residential construction for example that can lead to an increase in the unionization rate if other things are stable
9384390 this age variation reflects the fact that unionized jobs on average provide workers with substantially higher wages than do nonunion jobs
9384391 higher wages are typically associated with lower turnover which generates an older workforce over time and unionized jobs offer more job security than nonunion jobs which further reduces turnover and adds to the increase in the average age of unionized workers
9384392 whereas decades ago the archetypal union member was a blue collar worker with limited education today mid level professionals are much more likely to be unionized than anyone else especially in sectors like educational service and public administration which both have relatively large numbers of college educated workers
9384393 i think thats when the campaign for national office began
9384394 i am pleased to see senator obama acknowledge the huge potential alaskas natural gas reserves represent in terms of clean energy and sound jobs
9384395 the steps taken by the alaska state legislature this past week demonstrate that we are ready willing and able to supply the energy our nation needs
9384396 over the next five years we should also lease more of the national petroleum reserve in alaska for oil and gas production and we should also tap more of our substantial natural gas reserves and work with the canadian government to finally build the alaska natural gas pipeline delivering clean natural gas and creating good jobs in the process
9384397 we in alaska feel that crunch and are taking steps to address it right here at home
9384398 this is a tool that must be on the table to buy us time until our long term energy plans can be put into place we have already enjoyed the support of alaska senator ted stevens and it is gratifying to see senator obama get on board
9384399 only 3 of 10 military age are eligible to join the service

9384405 i will say it again it comes down to respect mccain met with pumas and wasnt asked but came on his own he knew pumas were not republicans and wanted to hear what the issues were wanted to listen and kept his word say what you want but the man is a maverick he will go where others wont or dont dare and he wants to hear from all americans not just those in his party
9384406 joe biden has a mouth on him but there is no reason to dislike sarah except she just put a knot in the tail of obama i think this woman is the real deal someone refreshing new and not a washington insider tehy are already putting out lies about her and the gay community i be totally confident if she would have to become president she has five children and is the govenor of alaska and says we have plenty of resources in alaska why do we have to go to the saudis and beg them she my kind of woman
9384407 unbelieveable aas will vote for obama because hes black its the same thing annoymous sarah palin is a real american woman we can all relate too we dont know squat when it comes to obamas sketchy backround is he or is he not a real american wjere is his birth certifcate the real one what about his multiple citizenship sarah palin has been a govenor and has executive experience what obama has is talk sow hosts and movie stars if i want a movie star for president ill go to the movies when ben alfac tells me who i shoul vote for what about maddonna a real live slut who is backing obama hell she has screwed half the world thats a ringing endorsement for obama his campaign is so bought and paid for he is tring to buy his way into the white house it wont work obama we dont want a president who is bought and paid for by celebraties thanks but no thanks
9384408 you bunch a twits dont get it do ya we are voting jsm get over it we will kick your ass in november sarah palin will get rid of the corrupt washington politicians like kennedy kerry and all the rest of the sheeple that follow them thay arent democrats they turned into republicans somewhere along the way
9384409 blah blah blah if you are so concerned about womens reproductive rights vote dem downticket mccains nominations would have to be approved face it the swooning ignorant young women who fell for con man obama are the ones responsible for safeguarding their rights or not as it suits them
9384410 ive actually seen the interview you cite and misrepresent you have been tagged as a spreader of lies and misinformation
9384411 youve been tagged as a spreader of lies and misinformation
9384412 my job is to comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable
9384413 how could david have cut his left wrist using a dull knife with his weak right hand
9384414 i am number three and you also are on it
9384415 hypothetically if you are ever at your wits end promise me that you will seek help
9384416 i dont see the relevance i would never take any life let alone my own

9384419 i will have a battle force when i leave ganymede
9384420 do you think i would trust your safety to some transport pilot
9384421 it is i who should be flattered my lady you would choose to accept my invitation an old sailor like me does not frequently have the opportunity to escort such a beautiful woman
9384422 first youre anything but old and second i find it hard to believe you have not escorted your share of beautiful women
9384423 new korea control this is spyder 454 request departure clearance

9384425 its almost time for your mom to make dinner and i have to meet gabe
9384426 you flatter me but i will be forty in a few months and for a fighter pilot that is old
9384427 yes but soon they will not let me fly the fast ones anymore it is much more enjoyable than standing on the bridge of a frigate giving orders to a helmsman if i am chosen to command a battle force i will make the fighter carrier my flagship so i can get as much flight time as i can before they determine im too old
9384428 dont you see you dont have a choice in this
9384429 we all have choices campbell but why you chose to include me in your foolishness is beyond me
9384430 we were both chosen to do this she was too
9384431 the loss of her sister does not bode well for the empire

9384437 the earthers are an empire unto themselves though they bow to the sword and star they believe they are an independent entity and we have let them believe that we would not have survived a century ago without them and the empire was too divided then to impose our will on them my mother knew it and knew neither would survive a war so earth was allowed some autonomy in return for an infusion of fresh blood
9384438 for twenty thousand years the only job they had was putting down insurrections too big for the galactic patrol to handle look at what happened in the coup a century ago yung hii the navy was surprised and nearly destroyed by the rebels had it not been for admiral yar and commander hanton why do you think 12 th force has been in the solar system for a hundred years because it was hantons unit and he was a friend of earth and if we brought 12 th back and replaced it with another the earthers would take it as an insult
9384439 earth has to be dealt with gently for our relationship with them is built on symbols such as 12
9384440 watch her watch gia tan as if your life depends on it if i didnt know otherwise i could believe she had something to do with mia kims death
9384441 it is not all state dinners and ceremony and i hope you realize that the empress closed her eyes again
9384442 you can stay with me tonight and go back in the morning
9384443 youre drunk why dont you go to your room and get some sleep
9384444 i didnt think you were that type of man gabriel
9384445 do you force all the women in your life to please you
9384446 you probably have internal bleeding and theyll probably have to remove them if you dont get medical treatment you will probably die
9384447 im sorry you have to go all the way back to sedona
9384448 but its only twenty minutes to sedona and the suite is nicer than my home
9384449 my folks live in peoria district so im heading over there tonight its just a local tram ride away from here
9384450 it keeps the parents at arms length too and the jobs in the summer help pay the extra cost
9384451 do you think eg is only relying on the people who are watching me they probably have my room bugged and the suite at noahcorp too ellingson probably bugged that before he gave it to us
9384452 i couldnt sleep in a place where i thought people were watching me
9384453 i have nothing to hide so i figure i can put up with it until they get tired of watching
9384454 you can use my room if you want to get away from them ill be at my parents this weekend
9384455 thats nice of you alex but i dont have much need of privacy these days
9384456 just take it and give it back to me on monday

9384458 yeah i got spore just then walked upto the shops did some browsing i saw it then got it now im going to install
9384459 so um the webpage or whatever is just something you do for fun do you have a real job
9384460 well that is our job we dont technically get money for you
9384461 shes not prepared to be governor how can she be prepared to be vice president or president
9384462 look at what shes done to this state what would she do to the nation
9384463 parts of the roofing of the terminal were torn away and several of the large windows were broken
9384464 the members of the presidential party had seen from the air a preview of the city water over 3 4 of the city up to the eaves of the homes etc
9384465 people were walking along the bridge where they had disembarked from the boats that had brought them to dry land many of them were carrying the barest of their possessions and many of them had been sitting on top of their houses waiting for rescue squads to retrieve the families and carry them to dry land
9384466 most of the people inside and outside of the building were negro
9384467 at first they did not believe that it was actually the president
9384468 he watched the stream of evacuees who had been rescued by boat from the rooftops of their houses and were now on foot carrying whatever possessions were left
9384469 it could be a pimple an infected follicle or it could be
9384470 yeah i know you said that but i only hear what i want to hear and right now i want to hear you say mensa
9384471 it appears that air canada may no longer be carrying life jackets on their flights anymore because the weight of all these life jackets are increasing the costs of fuel so how do they plan on dealing with the possibility of landing on water the seats of the plane will serve doubly as floatation devices hell the plane will be a wash anyway so why not
9384472 air canada is no stranger to complaints though remember the time there was the woman who was expecting the remains of one of her family members to be aboard an air canada flight how it was only after she had gotten to the airport that she was informed that the dead person had been bumped from the flight because a live paying passenger had come up at the last minute
9384473 jennifer of all the people i know this shit only happens to you stories happen to you no one else this sort of thing just wouldnt happen to any of the rest of us

9384476 we struggle against the common enemies of man tyranny poverty disease and war itself
9384477 if what you say is true no matter where you say it its still the truth
9384478 not a sound is heard except the measured tread of the sentinels for we are on the eve of a great battle perhaps the battle that is to make the bloodiest picture in the book of time
9384479 you wont find him all is chaos in front our troops are breaking and running
9384480 mournful was the sight of long rows of fresh graves containing the killed on both sides
9384481 had too violent a temper and was too much addicted to the common southern habit of free indulgence in strong drink
9384482 there was bloody evidence in every direction that the slaughter had been great
9384483 neither the one side nor the other had removed its dead and there they were blue and gray in their starkness lying here singly and there literally in rows and heaps i passed more than a thousand of them it was morbid and many lay as though they had consciously stretched themselves out to sleep but here were also many exceptions with features repulsively distorted by pain and hatred
9384484 public already familiar with black and white pictures that told a story
9384485 sidestep our language barriers and create stories that can be universally understood
9384486 looking for similarities among these artists you find that many share a contrasting use of black and white dark and light with a dash of yin and yang most also share a connection through choice of materials from wood engraving to leadcut to linoleum printing these artists have chosen a medium with a process beyond the immediacy achieved of putting pen to paper there is a unique quality to these print images that is arresting and iconic its as thought the art were announcing a rally and needed to be read as easily on a lamp post as seen in a book
9384487 school days are really long we eat lunch and then theres more to do
9384488 fear for his life and the safety of the people in the room

9384593 you would feel she has the same values as you having a child with down syndrome and being the governor and she calls herself a hockey mom i was impressed shes very pretty and seems very smart i hope it works out
9384594 the fact that shes a working mom will send a message to america that you dont have to choose children over career
9384595 i thought he gave a great speech to be honest i cant turn my eyes from him when hes on for a 41 year old getting divorced woman hes a hottie i thought he laid out a phenomenal plan and finally told us a lot about himself

9384644 a very important demographic in this election is going to be the politically independent woman 15 of whom in our latest survey are undecided
9384645 in the final analysis this election will be about obama vs
9384646 this contest is likely to be very close until the weekend before the election then the dam may break and support may flood one way or the other
9384647 youll find that youd have been a far more popular novelist if youd gone in for more explanation and generally made matters a bit clearer
9384648 who has always portrayed an innocence in everything shes done
9384649 we may be seeing the first woman president as a democrat i am reeling
9384650 that was the best political speech i have ever seen delivered by an american woman politician palin is as tough as nails
9384651 the vice president is a heartbeat away from becoming president so to choose someone with not one hours worth of experience on national issues is a dangerous choice
9384652 if john mccain thought that choosing sarah palin would attract hillary clinton voters he is badly mistaken
9384653 the only similarity between her and hillary clinton is that they are both women on the issues they could not be further apart
9384654 experts in astronomy have studied collapsing stars for years the phenomenon of hypernovas is very rare but extremely destructive since they morph themselves into light swallowing black holes meanwhile experts in the automotive industry have been watching their own collapsing star or more appropriately collapsing pentastar in chrysler some analysts believe that the venture capitalists at cerberus bit off more than they could chew when the firm purchased the troubled automaker last august now faced with a depressed truck market and a four cylinder lineup that just isnt selling the way it should be in our 4 a gallon gas world some fear that chrysler will implode like a hypernova with its brands and pieces swallowed by other industry giants that is not a fear of tom lasorda chryslers vice chairman and president insists that cerberus is committed to the company and believes it can be profitable thanks to a future portfolio of energy efficient vehicles built not just by chrysler but an international alliance of partners as well of course thats easier said than done to get to that point the company must slog through the next couple years of retrenchment like every other manufacturer hear how he believes chrysler will circumvent this crisis as he joins john mcelroy for an exclusive one on one interview from the management briefing seminars in traverse city michigan
9384655 what the mind can conceive and believe it will achieve
9384656 its really sinister to use advertising on your own children like that
9384657 this chasm which examined marketing and advertising studies conducted between 1992 and 2006 and looked at foods and beverages marketed to blacks vs
9384658 the biggest fuck you to a client in the history of advertising
9384659 my point is that we dont need to accelerate the appreciation of the renminbi the dollar will not weaken very much and may get stronger as happened in august
9384660 this makes appreciation of the chinese currency against the dollar less necessary
9384661 this is a time when we have to do away with our party politics and we have to act as americans
9384662 i have every expectation that we will not see the mistakes of katrina repeated
9384663 we are working with the delegations financial people finance committees many other concerned individuals to do what we can to raise money for various charities that operate in the gulf coast region
9384664 im happy to report to you that the coordination and the work thats being done at all levels appears to be excellent
9384665 i pledge that tomorrow night and if necessary throughout our convention we will act as americans not as republicans
9384666 i thin sen obama if they want to do down that route in all candor she has far far more experience than sen obama does
9384667 was a community organizer when she was in elected office he was in the state senate and voted 130 times present he never took on his party on anything she took on a party and the old bulls and the old boy network and she succeeded
9384668 i think we can activate an e mail list of a couple of million people who want to give back
9384669 im trying to get my family out of there and stay here for the week
9384670 i will not be going to minnesota for the republican national convention
9384671 of course this is a time when we have to do away with party politics and we have to act as americans
9384672 were going to suspend most of our activities tomorrow except for those that are absolutely necessary
9384673 we are looking at how to face inflationary pressures and growth problems
9384674 i have championed reform to end the abuses of earmark spending by congress
9384675 in fact i told congress i told congress thanks but no thanks on that bridge to nowhere
9384676 if our state wanted a bridge i said wed build it ourselves
9384677 the window is now while our congressional delegation is in a strong position to assist
9384678 the money thats been appropriated for the project it should remain available for a link an access process as we continue to evaluate the scope and just how best to just get this done
9384679 this link is a commitment to help ketchikan expand its access to help this community prosper
9384680 i think were going to make a good team as we progress that bridge project
9384681 she was asked about the bridge and she supported it
9384682 how could she have foreseen that she would be at this point now everybody is surprised by this development
9384683 of course when you become governor things come into much sharper focus than when you are a candidate
9384684 then she is forced to pay very close attention to the fiscal realities of it
9384685 take off our republican hats and put on our american hats
9384686 reaching out our hands and our hearts and our wallets to the people who are under such great threat from this great natural disaster
9384687 we can activate an email list of a couple million people who want to give back
9384688 i think we can get tons of volunteers to travel down there if it becomes necessary
9384689 right now we have a horrible storm bearing down on the gulf people should be more concerned about that than a political campaign and that is the way we are going to let the chips fall
9384690 several states including missouri texas and new mexico are preparing to and have accepted a lot of evacuees
9384691 there are millions of meals and millions of liters of water pre staged as well as a lot of blankets and cots
9384692 this is a point of national concern i think everybody of good will has great empathy and sympathy for people in new orleans
9384693 most religious people are praying for people in new orleans there is no political connotation to this whatsoever this was just poking fun at jerry falwell and the nonsensical thing he had said several years ago
9384694 i dont believe in a god thats vengeful i believe in a god thats compassionate
9384695 a storm is not a partisan event and that is what theyve done i am outraged
9384696 never again never again will a disaster of this nature be handled in the disgraceful way it was handled
9384697 i pledge that tomorrow night and if necessary throughout our convention we will act as americans and not as republicans
9384698 everything they need from the federal government to prepare for what all anticipate will be a difficult situation
9384699 i have every expectation we will not see the mistakes of katrina repeated
9384700 im shutting my shutters but then im going to drink
9384701 im opening the porch bar until it gets too windy im anxious but im staying
9384702 the challenge seems to be that people arent listening or they are listening and deciding to stay
9384703 they were out walking their dogs this morning and have no intention of leaving
9384704 most are people of means they have generators they have security they got guns god bless them
9384705 im all american but my family history is palestinian so we are used to evacuating
9384706 latinos are fearful that by being taken to shelters they will be turned over to immigration officials
9384707 often people along the way like shelter workers take to being ice agents and turn people in
9384708 we didnt have enough people to go into the neighborhoods where we know latinos are living
9384709 we put out word on two spanish radio stations which is the best we can do
9384710 weve gotten lizards birds dogs cats bunnies and even a pig
9384711 we even had an english mastiff so big we needed to order a special crate
9384712 the tracks go through the levees and they are going to be closing the flood gates behind us
9384713 i obviously dont want to torture any prisoners there is a long list of areas that we were in disagreement on
9384714 and waterboarding was advocated by the administration and according to a published report was used
9384715 the first thing we would do is rein in spending
9384716 looters will go directly to jail you will not get a pass this time
9384717 you will not have a temporary stay in the city you will go directly to the big house
9384718 i was trying to get situated at home i was trying to get things so it would be halfway safe
9384719 youre torn do you leave it and worry about it or do you stay and worry about living
9384720 theres really no place to go all the hotels are booked up to little rock and beyond
9384721 if we flood again were goners i dont think were coming back
9384722 i think for people who havent left they really are die hards because theyre taking their lives in their hands
9384723 i cant see any reason why a person staring down the barrel of a category 3 or category 4 hurricane would want to see if they can try to outfox mother nature thats taking an awful risk with yourself and your family
9384724 i sent my son out with a camera and said go take pictures of our backyard
9384725 we really dont have the luxury of sort of trying to evaluate the politics of this kind of situation
9384726 i think we take it as it is and right now we have a horrible storm bearing down on the gulf people should be more concerned about that than a political campaign and i think thats the way were going to let the chips fall
9384727 the pillow biting will never ever stop cracking my shit up
9384728 the creation of or experimentation on human embryos for research purposes
9384729 protect a womans freedom of choice because government should have no say in whether or when a woman embraces the sacred responsibility of parenthood

9384755 life is like art you have to work hard to keep it simple and still have meaning
9384756 the situation in new orleans has to take precedence over whats happening here said baric suggesting that it makes sense to change
9384757 when you get a personal and intimate feel for whats going on down there its hard to be selfish
9384758 i think it would be wrong if it didnt sap some energy because people are going to suffer when the hurricane hits
9384759 how can you be happy and celebrating when something like that is going on
9384760 theres star power there but for california im not so sure
9384761 i dont think it really hurts that george bush isnt here this is about john mccain
9384762 if i were running for president i wouldnt want to be running on someone elses coattails
9384763 we think well have the convention but we just dont know
9384764 must read for those interested in the national political scene from the center right point of view
9384765 we have a greater sense of what the base is thinking and their position on various issues than what you might get from someone who is living inside the beltway
9384766 must read for those interested in the national political scene from the center right point of view
9384767 im going to deliver the latino vote to barack obama
9384768 they can just shorten it and do away with a lot of the speeches the balloons just do the nominations ackerman said
9384769 we just have to do the right thing the democrats got a full shot at tv with their convention and wed like that too but its more important to take care of the countrys needs
9384770 they should be monitoring things and directing federal emergency relations said
9384771 i think a lot of work has gone into this convention and there are a lot of people who have spent a lot of money to be here said coronado who arrived at the convention last night
9384772 if they postponed it for a day i think that would be ok
9384773 from everything ive heard and read about her shes a tough lady and she very conservative and i think that helps him with the conservative base he told me this morning from sacramento where hes dealing with the state budget crisis
9384774 shes a woman and in this particular scenario being a woman as going to be a plus i think that it was a smart move he got the woman and he gets the very conservative person and i think he gets a fighter
9384775 i think shell be able to hold her own being a governor of a state whatever size has a lot more responsibility that being a senator
9384776 i back obama because he called the iraq war a mistake from the outset this war is poisoning this society and culture making it sicker and sicker obama is the antidote i feel confident that he will end the whole sorry adventure because he opposed it from the start
9384777 i am tired of the entitlement culture of the bush administration all his life bush felt entitled by his family ties and was indulged and bailed out of all his misadventures he has behaved in the exact same way in the oval office impervious to the consequences of his actions and or anyone who doesnt share his opinions i served in the navy at the same time as john mccain even deployed with him and he always behaved recklessly with impunity secure in the knowledge that nothing would happen to him since his father and family were navy gentry i am afraid he would carry that sense of entitlement and freedom from accountability straight into the white house i dont feel that way about the democratic ticket
9384778 i back barack obama because of my l9 year old grandson hes in the service now and will deploy to iraq soon he doesnt agree with me he backs mccain because his big issue is anti abortion but i will vote for obama and biden because they will not waste his or other soldiers lives in adventurism and swaggering abroad
9384779 i think that if we want to live in the 21th century we have to vote obama
9384780 i feel that barack obama respects me and values my opinion
9384781 i was a republican until three years ago a lifelong republican but it suddenly occurred to me that this administration had ruined everything it touched from the war and all its sorry consequences to fema to the justice department there arent many agencies in the federal government unaffected by scandal or incompetence i am voting for obama because i think he is competent and will lead a competence revolution in washington dc
9384782 i served in the navy at the same time as john mccain even deployed with him
9384783 if you really want to know where you came from and happen to believe the word of god that you are not a descendant of a chimpanzee this is what the word of god says i believe this version
9384784 those that die without christ have a horrible horrible surprise
9384785 do you believe were in the last days after listening to newt gingrich and the prime minister of israel and a number of others at our gathering i became convinced and i have been convinced for some time we are living in the last days these are incredible times to live in
9384786 the purpose for the united states is to glorify god this nation is a christian nation
9384787 god will not be mocked i dont care what the aclu says god will not be mocked i dont care what atheists say god will not be mocked i dont care whats going on in the nation today with so much horrific rebellion and sin and things that take place god will not be mocked judgment day is coming where do you stand
9384788 just giving in a little bit is a disastrous thing you cant serve both man and god it is one or the other
9384789 uh you say the convention is in st paul since were already in minneapolis why cant they just have it here what state is st paul in anyway

9384794 im here well i mean i was here already omnipresence being what it is but here in the revealing myself to you sense of here you follow me anyways here to offer you a choice in a moment the ball will be kicked off and auburns season is going to begin you are going to be able to choose the ways in which auburn excels tonight
9384795 tonight you can see auburn be above average in all facets in the passing game the running game defensively special teams
9384796 in each of these ways auburn will be sound and functional but they will not be outstanding they will win by 34 points 48 14 this is your first option
9384797 is that the passing game will struggle and i do mean struggle at times it will look like the quarterbacks and receivers spent their last month on the practice field playing canasta and pinochle instead of the game of football
9384798 but in exchange auburn will be completely dominant in all other aspects of the game
9384799 in short in every facet aside from the passing game auburn will look every bit as good as you the auburn fan had been hoping they would since burns scored against clemson last new years eve they will win by 34 points 34 0
9384800 this is your second option you can take either this scenario or the all around above average one i described for you earlier and you will see it play out before you choose
9384801 i cant have everything besides passing be awesome and the passing game also be awesome or like at least be mostly good if not awesome
9384802 ok well i guess ill take the dominance and bad passing over the above average stuff
9384803 i mean spread or not under tubby auburns always won with defense and the running game so if both of those things are totally and completely kick ass that should make up for the passing thing right its not like weve been the second coming of 80s byu either of the last two seasons anyway and thats with a running game thats been pretty good i guess rather than balls out excellent if it ends up that good this year hell screw the forward pass this is the sec god its about the run its about like getting 10 more yards out of a punt so your d has that many more yards to wok with its about 11 guys to the ball defense and smacking people in the mouth and beating lsu 7 to freaking 3 god i will totally take the dominant running game and defense over the decent passing game thats my choice
9384804 youre sure auburn cant throw the ball around a bit and still shut those other guys out

9384835 mccain favored palin for months and that it reflects a deliberate focus on reform and change
9384836 starting last spring the inner circle met regularly with mccain to review and discuss an initial list of about three dozen possible choices
9384837 discussions strengths and weaknesses of all the candidates he asked a lot of questions and listened didnt tip his hand to too many of us he was very insistent that this process often wounds people and we were to stay very quiet
9384838 enthusiastic republicans dont see the choice of palin as affirmative action despite her thin r sum and gaping absence of foreign policy knowledge because they expect republicans to put an underqualified

9384892 the mbtas attempts to silence these students were not only misguided but blatantly unconstitutional
9384893 the judge today correctly found that it was unlikely that the cfaa would apply to security researchers giving an academic talk
9384894 a presentation at a security conference is not some sort of computer intrusion its protected speech and vital to the free flow of information about computer security vulnerabilities silencing researchers does not improve security the vulnerability was there before the students discovered it and would remain in place regardless of whether the students publicly discussed it or not
9384895 the only thing keeping the students and the mbta from working together cooperatively to resolve the fare payment card security issues is the lawsuit itself
9384896 the mbta would be far better off focusing on improving the mbtas fare payment security instead of pursuing needless litigation

9384915 if anyone can be a publisher then anyone can be a journalist
9384916 and if anyone can be a journalist then journalistic privilege suddenly becomes a loophole too large to be borne by society
9384917 journalistic privilege has to be applied to a minority of people in order to preserve the laws ability to uncover and prosecute wrongdoing while allowing a safety valve for investigative reporting
9384918 the simple answer is that there is no simple answer
9384919 if you love wealth more than liberty the tranquility of servitude better than the animating contest of freedom depart from us in peace we ask not your counsel nor your arms crouch down and lick the hand that feeds you may your chains rest lightly upon you and may posterity forget that you were our countrymen
9384920 i have championed reform to end the abuses of earmark spending by congress

9384936 by justice a king gives a country stability but one who is greedy for bribes tears it down

9384938 i have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character
9384939 since reconciliation is at the heart of the gospel and since the gospel transcends the barriers of race ethnicity and culture and since the church is the most inclusive community on earth the local church is a community of hope in a fragmented world in malaysia the church has the task of not only proclaiming the message of reconciliation to all malaysians but of embodying the concrete implications of that message in its community life so that malaysians of all races can look at a local church community and see the gospel fleshed out in a racially reconciled group of people who can work worship and witness together

9385045 the pitch and intensity of the military rhetoric of this branch of the global dominionist movement has substantially increased since the beginning of 2008
9385046 one can only wonder how long before this transforms into real warfare with actual warriors
9385047 get busy in constructing a bible based social political and religious order which finally denies the religious liberty of the enemies of god

9385050 as the church begins to take on this resolve they joels army churches will start to be thought of more as military bases and they will begin to take on the characteristics of military bases for training equipping and deploying effective spiritual forces

9385056 the kingdom of heaven suffers violence and the violent take it by force such force demands an equal response and jesus is going to make war on everything that hinders love with his eyes blazing fire
9385057 a lot of people die for god and theyre not afraid
9385058 like dawn spreading across the mountains a large and mighty army comes such as never was of old nor ever will be in ages to come

9385214 fue una de las metas empezar bien jugar siempre de local para buscar el triunfo se ha conseguido y en los partidos de visitante tambi n hemos buscado el triunfo hay que ir paso a paso y ver los partidos uno a uno con tranquilidad con la t ctica que nos impone el tuca pero no hay que bajar los brazos ni confiarnos
9385215 uno como delantero se desespera cuando no caen los goles pero sigue buscando porque son rachas que suceden con uno que metas yo lo hab a comentado regresa la confianza y la seguridad de que vas a tener el gol y las tienes que meter

9385255 the immense respect that ive long held for the organization has been only heightened over the past couple of weeks i am going to keep all options open and look forward with excitement to see what the future brings
9385256 it goes without saying but john is an all time great safety one of the leagues classiest professionals and his elite play speaks for itself
9385257 as has been the case in other situations i would not rule anything out down the road
9385258 i have no regrets about my time thus far with the patriots
9385259 the immense respect that ive long held for the organization has been only heightened over the past couple of weeks i am going to keep all options open and look forward with excitement to see what the future brings
9385260 11 of those contributors are must reads for me 33 pages for 125 bucks is a non starter at my house sorry team artcomix i know ive disappointed you terribly
9385261 alan ive said it before and ill say it again no one gives a special shit about what you buy or dont buy get over yourself and move on
9385262 and the editor wanted to do an on site press check so he had to fly to singapore
9385263 still im not the only one who thinks kramers ergot is special special art spiegelman has stated that it is in an experimental sense a successor to raw and a collection particular suited to the new century when art comics become increasingly detached from anything like a narrative and approach the old abstract expressionist art for its own sake i concur with spiegelman even if i dont happen to enjoy reading ergot all that much page per page readers my age rooted in the comics of the 1940s 50s our devotion revived by the undergrounds are likely to feel that way and not change our tastes much we can still appreciate
9385264 its a one off even if the book is a huge success and sells out quickly the amount of work involved the logistics of the project are way beyond a workload we can handle so there wont be another issue of
9385265 needless to say we have to distinguish between too long and brilliant
9385266 my point then was not that anne cleveland was a lost seminal genius of cartooning but quite the opposite she was a talented and somewhat successful female cartoonist whose name had been completely lost to the sands of time in the great lost era between rose oneill and julie doucet and how women of her level of achievement were almost always lost to the sands of time leaving those who come behind to have to reinvent the wheel over and over again
9385267 so heres a question why did we spend the last three decades absorbed in the lives of the most boring people in canada
9385268 this is genuinely a big final event for me i really took the title seriously i wanted it to sum up not only everything ive done over the years in superhero comics but also call back to the other crossovers we have a murder investigation like identity crisis the red skies and the monitors from crisis on infinite earths the time distortions of zero hour and lots of parallel earths i had to accommodate all these things but at the same time like i said im trying to push them to become something weve never seen before but which will probably seem very obvious once it becomes clear once we get into superman beyond and the last three issues of final crisis its an all out onslaught on the very basics of the superhero genre and indeed the idea of story itself
9385269 i have sympathy for some of wowios employees especially the editorial director kristin ellison because two years ago i was in her shoes stuck between a crowd of hungry wronged freelancers and a failing red ink soaked company the next time i actually speak to her instead of just e mailing her my message is going to be simple get out now in fact thats probably good advice for anyone involved with platinum studios properties in any capacity
9385270 that during the times of the most savage pain she held the comics in her hands because they comforted her he told me that he read to her at night from them from archie digests a bald old man acting out all of the roles and finishing every punch line i can only imagine how much joy that gave her amid her anguish
9385271 the main problem with comic books is distribution thats where the creativity needs to be applied it will be interesting to see how the new publisher owned comic shops d amp q fantagraphics picturebox pan out stores like these as well as forward thinking traditional comic shops can become friendly markets for comic books thats still a pretty thin market though itd be great if there was a website that specialized in marketing these kinda books indie comics minicomics etc
9385272 superman the character inspires hope as opposed to batman who inspires fear

9385278 nos hemos obsesionado con la belleza y la fuente de la juventud y me entristece la forma en que las mujeres se mutilan en busca de eso veo a mujeres incluidas las mujeres j venes que se estiran esto o que se recortan lo otro es como una cuesta resbaladiza de la que no se puede salir es una locura lo que la sociedad le hace a la mujer

9385281 this is a system that scares every western air force
9385282 back georgia and ukraine for nato membership and youll see the s 300 to iran it is a very powerful bargaining chip and a major deterrent to us actions in the region moscow is playing very strategically on americas obsession with iran
9385283 iran certainly thinks it has a deal and the israelis believe that a deal has been reached but that they can still block it
9385284 if tehran obtained the s 300 it would be a game changer in military thinking for tackling iran that could be a catalyst for israeli air attacks before its operational
9385285 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
9385286 moved ahead in the negotiations at a pace much faster than the african nations could handle
9385287 the nightmare scenario of crops being transported out of fortified farms as hungry locals look on
9385288 the investors hope to be able to bypass any potential trade restriction that the host country might impose during a crisis
9385289 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
9385290 we really dont have the resources to rescue you after this
9385291 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
9385292 get out of the line of fire or we will shoot
9385293 get out of the line of fire or well shoot you
9385294 it makes me think about monday should i go to the convergence am i being watched i wonder if ill be safe there when you see something like that it makes you wonder all these things
9385295 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
9385296 its not even really a metaphor for slavery slavery is whats going on
9385297 i would truthfully say that angola prison is a sophisticated plantation
9385298 cotton is king still applies when it come to angola
9385299 allows inmates to be trained in work habits and allows them to develop marketable skills in the areas of farming animal husbandry vegetable meat and milk processing
9385300 the warden says it takes good food good medicine good prayin and good playin to have a good prison
9385301 in the conventional plantations slaves were given just enough food clothing and shelter to be a financial asset to the owner the same is true for the louisiana prison system
9385302 prisoners worked out in the field sometimes 17 hours straight rain or shine
9385303 theyd tell you the officer was always right no matter what
9385304 neither slavery nor involuntary servitude except as a punishment for crime where of the party shall have been duly convicted shall exist within the united states
9385305 prisoners can be forced to work for the government against their will and this is true in every state
9385306 i would have more faith in that amendment if it werent so clear that our criminal justice system is racially biased in a really obvious way
9385307 i dont have any illusions that this is a simple process
9385308 many people are apathetic about what happens in prisons it would be very difficult but i would not suggest it would be impossible
9385309 many black inmates viewed farm work under these circumstances as too close to slavery to want to participate
9385310 theyve got a lot of land to bury a lot of prisoners
9385311 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
9385312 he has to remain in prison until the new trial takes place
9385313 how can louisiana continue to imprison a 61 year old man after a federal judge has ruled that he shouldnt have been convicted in the first place
9385314 the state needs to move forward albert must be released
9385315 the mandate for release had been issued and i still remained on death row though i had no more conviction
9385316 i myself had to petition the state district judge and demand the constitution be followed and i be removed from death row some lawyers wont fight for their clients and the client has to fight for themselves like i did
9385317 say you were arrested in 1993 and the statutes mandated that you serve 75 percent of your sentence say the statutes were changed and or new statutes created so that the law mandates inmates serve 85 percent of their sentence by the time your release parole date is near the statutes have been changed again and since you were convicted so long ago and have been incarcerated through several changes in legal statutes no one remembers how the original law worked
9385318 punishment for crimes committed 35 years ago for political beliefs for religious beliefs and for leadership qualities are not legitimate penological interests
9385319 the attorney generals second in command john sinquefield who is helping to preside over the decision to continue fighting the case is implicated in some of the wrongdoings referred to in the magistrates june report
9385320 as a convicted homosexual i always struggled to get basic human rights in texas
9385321 we had 48 government approved beds in the state for sex offenders and thats been cut to 28 so he wont ever get one of those
9385322 the number one single point for environmental degradation in the united states at that time and still today was agriculture soil erosion the types of chemical fertilizers they were putting in the sprays my goal was to change what we were doing with agriculture it didnt matter to me if it was one acre at a time or 10 000 acres at a time
9385323 it is disappointing that these types of lawsuits are attempting to override the usda and regulate the organic industry and retailers with their own beliefs about what constitutes an organic product
9385324 the consolidated complaint was filed a few weeks ago and now it is our turn to file and respond to this complaint
9385325 so it is moving through the legal process and has yet to be resolved
9385326 we helped organize the lawsuit by reaching out to people who would be potential plaintiffs
9385327 in some cases the law firms contacted us and asked us for a lot of data and some we helped connect with potential plaintiffs
9385328 we had every retailer in the country calling us saying can i get some organic milk from you thats how that whole thing started for us
9385329 there are not enough farmers left in the united states less than 2 percent of the population to have any clout in washington or the marketplace
9385330 now after you get done with the primaries in iowa where all the candidates in both parties are kissing the rear end of the ethanol lobby youre not going to hear much about farming anymore
9385331 we could see that if aurora was successful they could eventually drive family scale farmers out of business
9385332 we have a perfect precedent for this the conventional dairy industry the organic dairy industry was founded as an alternative to this
9385333 we have 3 800 acres of organic pasture at our farms
9385334 additionally weve participated in the conversion of more than 50 000 acres with neighboring farmers people we buy feed from people we lease pasture from thats 50 000 acres of american farmland that would otherwise be treated with pesticides and chemicals
9385335 our whole mission is to make organic milk more affordable and more accessible to more people so its not an elite beverage you can only afford to buy if you shop at whole foods
9385336 some of the activists say we dont like large scale we dont like big guys
9385337 so maybe theyre part of the problem were not part of the problem believe me
9385338 were not even going after the government organic certification because as far as were concerned its meaningless
9385339 its expensive and its a lot of paperwork and red tape and we would rather spend our money and time cementing our relationships with our local people if we wanted to sell our beef or our cheese in the new york delis or in new york restaurants we would have to be certified organic because they dont know us
9385340 our philosophy is that horizon milk and these other organic milk companies that are big are better than non organic
9385341 i can tell exactly how my food is grown i can ask the tough questions and i can get a straight answer you can go to the grocery and you can buy organic but you really dont know
9385342 i dont even like dealing with the government on that deal
9385343 it isnt the expense its just the headache of having to keep track of everything and then at the end of the day its still your word that its organic or not
9385344 and the other thing is we grow conventional corn too and then we rotate our ground with that we do use chemicals on that on our vegetables we dont use anything
9385345 just a big headache you end up throwing away more than you actually sell everything has to be sized and sorted the perfect size if they were picking out a certain sized potato theyd throw everything else away really a waste were a real small operation compared to a farm that supplies for the grocery stores
9385346 well theyre actually coming out of our backyard gardens theyre saying i really enjoy this i want to develop it as a lifestyle and they need some way to sell well even whole foods cant possibly handle that small amount of produce from a 2 acre farm but a farmers market these people will learn the skill and now were seeing the farms expand to 20 acres 40 acres
9385347 the vast majority of processors with labels are buying from family farmers
9385348 moving commodities from coast to coast and shipping commodities across the seas only works with cheap oil and the whole monoculture management practices only work with cheap petrochemicals not only to run our tractors but for the soil amendments and the pesticides
9385349 it used to be cities were ringed by farms and well end up with that again
9385350 when we had the opportunity back at horizon to start a big organic dairy in idaho where we were going to impact 50 000 or 60 000 acres by the feed that we were buying and so forth i said great thats a big chunk of agriculture that were changing
9385351 well some of the activists began thinking thats too big thats scale you cant really do it on that scale and we proved that you could do it were proving here today that you can do it
9385352 theres a higher authority in this country than the usda
9385353 green giant report http www cobizmag com blogs asp action blog amp blog 11 email this page
9385354 thats the magic moment when you get to connect two different worlds
9385355 many locals never dreamed someone in the us would care enough to come here
9385356 a lot of them dont know how to manage people throw in a whole other culture socioeconomic class language they didnt know what to do
9385357 for some you have to pull about 14 teeth to get them out of there
9385358 it is hard to be separated but when the americans come it makes us feel like we are with them
9385359 its interesting to see where people come from so you can relate better
9385360 when we come back it makes them want to work for us
9385361 my motivation was we dont have to make all the same mistakes of the past
9385362 having them on dairy farms is new i thought so lets start from the beginning
9385363 one of my employees unbeknownst to me was building a bakery back home
9385364 i had no idea when i walked into his village that first evening i was beside myself i could have been helping him to be a business person
9385365 when you first come you realize immediately why they left
9385366 and then 10 minutes later you realize why they all want to come home
9385367 a good neighbor a very nice neighbor for ten years he has never caused a problem
9385368 im a jehovahs witness so i dont give a crap about republicans or democrats
9385369 they look through materials and copy materials but you are not arrested
9385370 if you sue later the court thinks it wasnt a big deal because you were not held very long
9385371 they cannot raid a news office without a subpoena but they did this is journalists work product
9385372 police are targeting people who are here to protect free speech rights
9385373 numerous items were recovered no persons were arrested the search warrant was a part of an ongoing investigation regarding serious criminal acts
9385374 this investigation pertains to actions of the rnc welcoming committee
9385375 the raids and arrests are unacceptable and should be condemned by everyone who stands for peace and justice
9385376 the actions by the st paul police are an attempt make people afraid to take a stand against the war and the republican agenda we denounce authorities attempts to suppress free speech and remind everyone that the march on september 1 11am at the state capitol is a permitted rally and march people from all walks of life should feel confident that the march is a safe place to protest the war
9385377 a criminal enterprise made up of 35 self described anarchists intent on committing criminal acts before and during the republican national convention
9385378 these acts include tactics to blockade and disable delegate buses breaching venue security and injuring police officers
9385379 this is sending the wrong message regardless of how you feel about these people they had a right to be there
9385380 im really ticked off the city is perfectly capable of taking care of things
9385381 if they had found anything that could have been used to commit a crime they would have arrested somebody
9385382 unless they come up with anthrax or weapons of mass destruction i think they came up short
9385383 this is a charge that police use for preventive detention
9385384 it requires that no actual criminal act be committed and borders on criminalizing political advocacy
9385385 the police may claim that the raid was executed according to protocol however the violence inherent in this action may only be a hint of the violence to be expected on monday and beyond and is only a hint at the violence perpetrated daily by the police
9385386 by looking for items found in any twin cities house like jars paint and rags this attempt to portray us as criminals and destroy our credibility has already backfired as evidenced by the masses who have come to support us
9385387 the two greatest obstacles to democracy in the united states are first the widespread delusion among the poor that we have a democracy and second the chronic terror among the rich lest we get it
9385388 the phones in the coalition office are ringing off the hook as people are calling in for details of the protest and to report what they are doing to bring their family members friends and neighbors out to say no to the war and occupation of iraq
9385389 city council county board i think special meetings are in order to consider whether to continue local support of the police state conspiracy to intimidate and stop people from gathering and expressing their views
9385390 all freemen have a right publickly to remonstrate the abuses of power in the strongest terms to put their neighbours upon their guard against the craft or open violence of men in authority and to assert with courage the sense they have of the blessings of liberty
9385391 yes we can cast blame and help at the same time
9385392 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
9385393 this is an important milestone toward securing a future for the sumatran elephant and tiger
9385394 to ensure the commitment is effectively implemented we must redouble our efforts to eliminate poaching and illegal settlements within this special forest
9385395 tesso nilo is still under serious threat from illegal activities but if we can protect the forests there it will give some of sumatras most endangered wildlife the breathing room they need to survive
9385396 and while we greatly appreciate this precedent for more protection from the indonesian government there are other areas on sumatra that need safeguarding for the sake of its wildlife its threatened indigenous peoples and to reduce the climate impacts of clearing
9385397 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
9385398 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
9385399 at no moment did spanair indicate that it was its intention to substitute the plane
9385400 informed the airport of the possibility of replacing the aircraft but eventually decided to stick with the aircraft that crashed
9385401 after an initial evaluation of the detected glitch and the estimated time for its repair maintenance technicians decided that it would not be necessary to switch planes as it was a minor repair that would take no more than 15 minutes
9385402 were adding a little something to this months contest as you all know first prize is a cadillac eldorado anybody want to see second prize
9385403 just remember one thing my son no one is bigger than the club the club will be here long after you go us supporters aint mugs well not too many to end if you dont want us and our club aint big enough for you then f ck right off
9385404 were very lucky in the band in that we have two visionaries david and nigel theyre like poets like shelley and byron theyre two distinct types of visionaries its like fire and ice basically i feel my role in the band is to be somewhere in the middle of that kind of like lukewarm water
9385405 can you hear me tommy trinder johnny haynes dodi fayed wolfy smith your boys took a hell of a beating
9385406 each season there is a team that goes into freefall and gets sucked into the relegation scrap losing becomes a habit like winning and if we aint careful that team could be us
9385407 clearly my words have gone to the highest level expect him gone in may
9385408 as a spurs supporter of no half measure i will continue to support jol hughton the squad and the entire club to the best of my ability and at all times
9385409 i hear glenn hoddle has found god that must have been one hell of a pass
9385410 white hart lane was always a place where i felt i belonged
9385411 even now when i go over to my mothers house and dig out the old tracksuit tops i wore it makes the hair stand up on the back of my neck i like to think i am part of a special family i am no longer connected with the club on a daily basis but im delighted with every win and sad about every defeat
9385412 any player coming to spurs whether hes a big signing or just a ground staff boy must be dedicated to the game and to the club he must never be satisfied with his last performance and he must hate losing
9385413 bill did so much for his beloved spurs that we must never let his legacy fade he must be our inspiration as we strive to ensure that a new era dawns here at white hart lane
9385414 oh dear its f cked is what ive always taken it to mean i do have o level latin now theyve stuck up a literal translation in large letters to dare is to do the words just stand there on their own not making much sense
9385415 when gazza came to the spurs training ground for the first time got the ball went round 8 players as if they were not there and then smashed the ball into the net just to see him play like that made the hair stand up on the back of your neck everybody stood there and applauded him
9385416 we will not be pushed around by a bunch of north london yobbos
9385417 the worst thing spurs ever did was get rid of keith burkinshaw they never replaced him
9385418 when youve finished playing football young man which is going to be very soon i feel youll make a very good security guard
9385419 if someone wants to give you a bum steer on who were after then so be it if you want to know ask me because i have a list of players we want and robbie keane isnt on it
9385420 the biggest regret of my whole football career was leaving white hart lane in 1970 my interest in football weakened after that i was heartbroken
9385421 i know more about smalz herring than i do about football
9385422 the trouble with christian gross is that no one had heard of him the communication wasnt brilliant and as captain i decided to explain to him how things worked and what the players liked and were used to i do not believe he listened to a word i said
9385423 always had a bit of time make a little bit of space look up bang and you know he could put it on a postage stamp from 40 yards mmmmmmmmm
9385424 the great fallacy is that the game is first and last about winning its nothing of the kind the game is about glory its about doing things in style with a flourish about going out and beating the other lot not waiting for them to die of boredom
9385425 i was sitting just a few feet away from david pleat at the world cup hes a nice fellow but the man is mad certifiably eye spiningly mad
9385426 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
9385427 i want to get involved in writing emails to members of congress urging them to cut off funding for the war and other things but if i do that wont i end up getting put on a
9385428 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
9385429 if present at all was very small and statistically non significant and may simply be a healthy user artifact that they were unable to identify
9385430 while such a reduction in all cause mortality would have been impressive these mortality benefits are likely implausible previous studies were likely measuring a benefit not directly attributable to the vaccine itself but something specific to the individuals who were vaccinated a healthy user benefit or frailty bias
9385431 over the last two decades in the united sates even while vaccination rates among the elderly have increased from 15 to 65 percent there has been no commensurate decrease in hospital admissions or all cause mortality further only about 10 percent of winter time deaths in the united states are attributable to influenza thus to suggest that the vaccine can reduce 50 percent of deaths from all causes is implausible in our opinion
9385432 the healthy user effect is seen in what doctors often refer to as their good patients patients who are well informed about their health who exercise regularly do not smoke or have quit drink only in moderation watch what they eat come in regularly for health maintenance visits and disease screenings take their medications exactly as prescribed and quite religiously get vaccinated each year so as to stay healthy such attributes are almost impossible to capture in large scale studies using administrative databases
9385433 but you also need to take care of yourself everyone can reduce their risk by taking simple precautions
9385434 wash your hands avoid sick kids and hospitals during flu season consider antiviral agents for prophylaxis and tell your doctor as soon as you feel unwell because there is still a chance to decrease symptoms and prevent hospitalization if you get sick because flu vaccine is not as effective as people have been thinking it is
9385435 the healthy user effect is everywhere you dont want it to be
9385436 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
9385437 to meet and help run the iranian backed special groups
9385438 we strongly denounce this action against one of the high ranking officials at the commission and who played a major role in the commission work and making it a real force that supports national reconciliation in iraq
9385439 he is from the mahdi army and he is also with chalabi and probably chalabi thought through him he could win some of their support
9385440 the freeze of the mahdi army is still valid until further notice
9385441 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
9385442 the cayman trough may be a lost world that will give us the missing piece in a global puzzle of deep sea life
9385443 the deep ocean is the largest ecosystem on our planet so we need to understand its patterns of life
9385444 deep sea exploration has also given us new cancer treatments and better fibre optic cables for the internet both thanks to deep sea creatures
9385445 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
9385446 it is a shame no country could be given a satisfactory total score
9385447 the baltic sea is influenced by a multitude of human activities regulated by a patchwork of international and national regulations and authorities
9385448 what the baltic sea needs now is political leadership that can look beyond national or sectoral interests and take an integrated approach to solving the problems
9385449 her persistent efforts to unite groups and encourage cross border discussions on the future of the baltic sea
9385450 we now have an opportunity in the area of sea use management with two current processes on the european level
9385451 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
9385452 i want the brutality excessive force the harassment that the moberly police department puts on these young people to come to an end
9385453 i just want him home i just want him to go home
9385454 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
9385455 about an hour and a half ago 20 to 30 heavily armed police officers surrounded the house
9385456 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
9385457 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
9385458 because of the large deformation signals from the dike intrusion we needed to do some detailed detective work to prove the existence of this slow earthquake
9385459 we used state of the art insar satellite data to constrain the dike source and that allowed us to demonstrate the existence of the slow earthquake motions recorded by the gps stations on kilaueas flank
9385460 a dike intrusion could be seen with the seismic monitoring network the tiltmeters and the gps network but these slow earthquakes can only be seen with the gps network
9385461 these slow earthquakes are an interesting phenomenon that has only been studied within the last decade and were still trying to figure out how they fall into the bigger picture of earthquakes says cecily wolfe also an associate professor in higp and another co author
9385462 theyre definitely a part of the earthquakes cycle and trying to understand how they relate to other earthquakes and how they may be generated and triggered will give us greater insights into how predicable earthquakes are
9385463 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
9385464 this was probably due to aerosols in the stratosphere spewed by the august 7th eruption of the kasatochi volcano in the aleutian islands
9385465 and the ones im seeing now in the netherlands look much the same the smoke of the alaska volcano seems to be moving around the globe
9385466 the colors tonight aug 30th were about as vivid as i have ever seen
9385467 the sky was white at the horizon and turned yellow orange red purple blue then finally black up high
9385468 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
9385469 acknowledge again and explicitly that this nation remains engaged in an armed conflict with al qaeda the taliban and associated organizations who have already proclaimed themselves at war with us and who are dedicated to the slaughter of americans
9385470 this seems like a final push by the administration before they go out the door
9385471 we have been at war with an unconventional enemy whose primary goal is to kill innocent americans
9385472 is trying to stir up again the politics of fear by reminding people of something they havent really forgotten that we are engaged in serious armed conflict with al qaeda
9385473 but the question is where is that conflict to be waged and by what means
9385474 as sept 11 2001 recedes into the past there are some people who have come to think of it as kind of a singular event and of there being nothing else out there
9385475 in a way we are the victims of our own success our own success being that another attack has been prevented
9385476 reaffirm that for the duration of the conflict the united states may detain as enemy combatants those who have engaged in hostilities or purposefully supported al qaeda the taliban and associated organizations
9385477 i dont want to face another situation where we had the sept 14 resolution and then attorney general gonzales claimed that that was authorization to violate fisa
9385478 i do not believe that we are in a state of war whatsoever
9385479 we have an odious opponent that the criminal justice system is able to identify and indict and convict theyre not a goliath dont treat them that way
9385480 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
9385481 he has a decisive role in avoiding any possibility that his core team is supporting and promoting this
9385482 to secretly record the telephone calls of the president of the supreme court is something from a totalitarian regime
9385483 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
9385484 acknowledge again and explicitly that this nation remains engaged in an armed conflict with al qaeda the taliban and associated organizations who have already proclaimed themselves at war with us and who are dedicated to the slaughter of americans
9385485 it is uncertain whether congress will take the administration up on its request
9385486 some republicans have already embraced the idea with representative lamar smith of texas the ranking republican on the judiciary committee introducing a measure almost identical to the administrations proposal
9385487 recalls a resolution known as the authorization for use of military force passed by congress on sept 14 2001 which authorized the president to use all necessary and appropriate force against those responsible for the sept 11 attacks to prevent future strikes that authorization still in effect was initially viewed by many members of congress who voted for it as the go ahead for the administration to invade afghanistan and overthrow the taliban which had given sanctuary to mr bin laden
9385488 when people dont have much money they cut on big stuff and buy things that make their lives a little bit better like consumer electronics
9385489 the overall market in 2008 is not very good and europe is even worse
9385490 we are seeing people are more sensitive to promotional deals but have not seen signs of consumers turning to third tier brands
9385491 were not planning to subsidise this exchange rate swing at all well either find ways of reducing the costs still further or we may have to adjust prices upwards
9385492 we have not seen an impact on consumer spending yet
9385493 i see prices for blu ray devices to come down more and more before christmas
9385494 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
9385495 we have to make sure the focus is on the south on gustav make sure that all of the resources are there and that anything that is done with regard to the convention doesnt take anything away from that and is done in a serious way
9385496 senator mccain has already indicated that it would be inappropriate to have celebrations that things have to be scaled back
9385497 it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster
9385498 i think that we are far far better prepared than we were the last time
9385499 because shes a reformer and she thinks outside the box the way my husband does
9385500 you know washington is just a quagmire its a mess right now and both of them have been serious reformers
9385501 alaska is the closest part of our continent to russia so its not as if she doesnt understand whats at stake here its also about making decisions and be targeted in what she thinks she has a great mind and she has a very serious direction in where she goes
9385502 and also remember alaska is the closest part of our continent to russia so its not as if she doesnt understand whats at stake here
9385503 you know theres a national tragedy called poverty happening in our country right now but that didnt cause them to change the convention
9385504 to correct man for his behavior that does not fall in the parameters of the word of god
9385505 these five research papers have had the most influence on me as a trader

9385510 permanent repeal of the estate tax would reduce revenues by almost 1 trillion between 2012 and 2021 the first ten year period in which its costs would be fully felt with the economy slowing and deficits returning and with far larger deficits projected for future years there is increasing recognition that estate tax repeal is unaffordable
9385511 under current law the estate tax rate has already fallen to 45 and the exemption level is scheduled to rise in 2009 to 7 million per couple making the 2009 estate tax parameters permanent as an amendment to the budget resolution offered by senator max baucus would do would itself be quite expensive reducing revenues by about 500 billion over the 2012 2021 period or about half as much as repeal but going beyond 2009 law to the kyl proposal would add about 250 billion to the ten year cost and more than 300 billion if interest costs are included all of this additional cost would go toward tax cuts for the 3 in 1 000 estates large enough to owe any tax under 2009 law those valued at more than 7 million per couple
9385512 search warrants for 2 of the 3 raided houses listed only one name apiece each of individuals not present at the houses and thus not arrested
9385513 between 2002 and 2005 protests were held in many cities worldwide often coordinated to occur simultaneously these demonstrations against the war were mainly organized by anti war organizations many of whom had been formed in opposition to the invasion of afghanistan in some arab countries demonstrations were organized by the state europe saw the biggest mobilization of protesters including a rally of 3 million people in rome according to the french academic dominique reynie between january 3 and april 12 2003 36 million people across the globe took part in almost 3 000 protests against the iraq war

9385521 he covers issues of interest to all aboriginal peoples from around the world not just native americans
9385522 i do not feel we should forfeit the traditional rights and privileges of the natives of our islands for a mere thimbleful of votes in congress that we the lovers of hawaii from long association with it should sacrifice our birthright for the greed of alien desires to remain on our shores

9385528 i want to engage them and make them sit up
9385529 boys often have to read books they dont really like they dont get to choose what they want to read
9385530 we know a great deal about the reading interests of teen and preteen boys
9385531 appeal to boys because the fun overtakes the challenge of reading
9385532 boys can overcome the challenges of what might otherwise be a difficult read if the material appeals to them

9385542 it would appear that bryans may be taking part in unofficial discussions for the benefit of troops under the auspices of education officer
9385543 bryans idea is that the world ought to be divided into two parts
9385544 that germany should be given a free hand in europe and that the
9385545 i am not sure that this is a very desirable point of view to publish at the present time
9385546 bryans is a talkative and indiscreet fellow who is in possession of a story which he delights in telling and which if told publicly would be likely to cause embarrassment to the foreign office
9385547 although there seems to be a good deal to be said for locking him up to prevent him airing his views to all and sundry i understand that if this is done it will inevitably involve his bringing up the question of his contacts with the foreign office and the facilities afforded him to go to italy

9385580 and i regularly hear from them we use the word partner rather than wife or boyfriend etc i see us as being well a bit more modern
9385581 i had a brief exchange with a gay female reader who said our heterosexual imagery doesnt give her role models sexuality is such a big part of peoples lives and i think gay women will still need lesbian publications to get those role models
9385582 people fall into the trap of thinking that only lesbian magazines will be of interest to gay and bisexual women
9385583 they also read titles aimed at straight women such as red cosmopolitan elle decoration style publications including id dazed super super pop and gossip mags such as heat

9385614 a channel once known solely for airing and re airing old movies has more x factor than hbo thats got to sting a little
9385615 we wanted to start commissioning scripts that would stand up next to the movies but allow us to attract a new audience
9385616 we want to shoot drama cinematically and tell big screen storylines but over a number of hours we went out looking for smart complex and challenging scripts which is kind of the opposite direction to the way tv is moving these days but we really had to prove ourselves and it was hard to get the scripts initially
9385617 they deserve the credit for having the stomach to go with a cast of mostly unknown actors they bought what they liked there were no focus groups no testing they said this is the kind of show we want to watch

9385629 theres a real possibility of flooding storm surge and high winds do not put yourself in harms way or make rescue workers take unnecessary risks

9385631 theyve made it through great challenges in the past and theyre going to make it through this one
9385632 need to understand that in a storm of this size there is serious risk of significant flooding
9385633 i think we have plenty of opportunity to get people out in time its those who are choosing not to get out that concerns me
9385634 going to be in some ways more challenging than katrina

9385642 this is probably the case with almost any emergency which is as soon as you make contact with the enemy the plan starts to suffer some alterations
9385643 going to be in some ways more challenging than katrina

9385649 perch una cosa abbia un senso ci vuole una scena ci vuole unillusione un minimo di illusione di movimento immaginario di sfida al reale che vi coinvolga che vi seduca che vi ripugni
9385650 viene da ludus che significa gioco in atti opposto a iocus che significa il gioco in parole cio lo scherzo si tratta perci di una parola che affonda le radici in uno stile di pensiero tipico della romanit arcaica la quale privilegia lazione anzi un tipo particolare di azione rituale dotata di efficacia pratica il modo di pensare romano imperniato sullesperienza del rito inteso come azione dotata di effettualit e di obbligatoriet giuridica

9385653 il corpo e gli organi interni delammalata costituiscono limmaginario teatro
9385654 la tecnica del racconto mira dunque a restituire unesperienza reale in cui il mito si limita a sostituire i protagonisti
9385655 il quadro del mondo uterino tutto popolato da mostri fantastici e di animali feroci
9385656 sono dice linformatore indigeno gli animali che accrescono il dolore della dona in travaglio ossia le doglie stesse personificate
9385657 la cura consisterebbe nel rendere pensabile una situazione che in partenza si presentava in termini affettivi e nel rendere accettabile alla mente dolori che il corpo si rifiuta di tollerare
9385658 affermare la volont di esserci come presenza di fronte al rischio di non esserci
9385659 grazie al mito viene sostituito dallo sciamano in un insieme in cui tutto ha una ragione dessere
9385660 la relazione fra microbo e malattia esterna alla mentalit del paziente in una relazione di causa ed effetto la relazione fra mostro e malattia interna a quella stessa mentalit una relazione fra simbolo e cosa simbolizzata fra significante e significato lo sciamano fornisce alla sua ammalata un linguaggio nel quale possono esprimersi immediatamente certi stati non formulati ed altrimenti non formulabili

9385688 when debra schaefer goes to work gates and doors lock behind her for eight hours she is unable to leave if something catastrophic were to happen there would be no escape but the psychological impact of her incarceration every working day isnt something she dwells on she wears a kevlar armoured vest to protect her from shanks spikes and knives it is heavy and she finds it uncomfortable but she knows it could save her life but violence does not frighten her she was never a dainty girl what scares her is infectious disease debra knows that at any moment someone might spit on her or throw urine and faeces over her there is a protocol for such assaults there are eye wash stations and an assaulted officer is taken to hospital to be checked out clothing is bagged for evidence and the inmate responsible could have up to two years added to her sentence for those on death row or serving life sentences what is there to lose in venting their frustration at those who watch over them but women like debra have choices they get to go home every day to their families they dont have to be there so why are they

9385695 much has already been written about the activities of stephensons then secret british security coordination bsc outfit which included ian fleming and no l coward among its high society agents
9385696 to be as engaging as possible a bright and breezy presence at table and encourage confidences from those in the know
9385697 i think he liked to show them off to my father
9385698 why are christians living just like the rest of the world
9385699 in spite of the renewal movements proud claims to miraculous transformation the polls showed that members of the movement divorced their spouses just as often as their secular neighbors they beat their wives as often as their neighbors they were almost as materialistic and even more racist that their pagan friends the hard core sceptics smiled in cynical amusement at this blatant hypocrisy the general population was puzzled and disgusted many of the renewal movements leaders simply stepped up the tempo of their now enormously successful highly sophisticated promotional programs others wept this alas is roughly the situation of western or at least american evangelicalism today with their mouths they claim that jesus is lord but with their actions they demonstrate allegiance to money sex and self fulfillment
9385700 a scalding indictment of what isnt being said behind the pulpits
9385701 evangelicals may have some good biblical theology about the body of christ where there is neither jew nor greek black nor white but if they do not work out this theology in practice such that white evangelicals welcome black neighbors and work to end racist structures then the whole thing stinks
9385702 today unfortunately many people despise christians not for their unswerving obedience to christ but because of the hypocritical disconnect between jesuss teaching and our actions but precisely because jesus expected his followers to live so differently from their neighbours he could say that they would also be salt and light preserving and even changing a corrupt immoral world
9385703 it is easier for a camel to go through their eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of god
9385704 neglected widows from the greek speaking minority they appointed seven deacons their greek names indicate they are all from the greek speaking minority to take charge of all the widows
9385705 tried to roll back several decades of toleration and stamp out christianity
9385706 the godless galileans christians feed not only their poor but ours also
9385707 those who belong to us look in vain for the help that we should render them
9385708 slick marketers have offered eternal salvation as a free gift if you can just say yes to a simple formula eternal security no future payments just simple verbal ascent deal specified nothing about life change
9385709 he formed a new community of forgiven sinners he challenged the rich to share with the poor he rejected the way society marginalized and neglected lepers disabled folk and women he rejected the popular jewish revolutionaries of the time who were calling for armed rebellion against rome
9385710 sin is both personal and social so overcoming evil demands both personal and structural transformation
9385711 the prophets make it perfectly clear that we sin both by lying stealing and committing adultery and also by participating in unjust legal and economic systems without doing what god wants us to do to change them
9385712 if we grasp the new testament understanding of the church then we realize that the modern evangelical reduction of christianity to some personal privatized affair that only affects my personal relationship with god and perhaps my personal family life is blatant heresy the church is a new visible social order it is a radical new community visibly living a challenge to the sexual insanity the racial and social prejudice and the economic injustice that pervade the rest of society
9385713 too often now when people join a church they do so as consumers if they like the product they stay if they do not they leave they can no more imagine a church disciplining them than they could a store that sells goods disciplining them it is not the place of the seller to discipline the consumer in our churches we have a consumer mentality
9385714 in a german school a class of teenagers sits bored
9385715 i have a grandfather who was really supportive of hitler
9385716 he said when i was your age i was leading a division in russia and i have very left wing parents so as part of the third generation after the second world war it is something i really want to explore
9385717 but life is not like in the movies everyone lies good guys lose and love does not conquer all
9385718 it hasnt been so long since ive forgotten what its like
9385719 i have to leave him im not happy im getting worse and its him i was better before i met him
9385720 when eric left i thought i had no hope but i pushed through anyway to get through every day by any means necessary and if that meant taking anti depressants or drinking on an empty stomach or having yet another night of meaningless sex with someone i would normally not want to talk to for more than five minutes or all three at the same time if it got me to the next day without throwing myself under the 6 train or drinking a drano martini or slashing open my throat while i tried to make dinner well then thats what i did and then i began to come to to come back to life only to discover it was too late to discover that i really was already dead and now i am the ghost of a perfect stranger because if i had known what was waiting for me in seven years what i would become i would have killed myself without hesitation knowing it was the right decision
9385721 i have to leave him i have to i have to
9385722 not just levees but gated levees for promoting replenishment of sediments
9385723 to watch it happen its really hard not knowing what is going to happen

9385725 it is kind of like losing your identity overnight everything changed you have no phone credit cards dont work the people you know are scattered

9385761 i wonder how much of loneliness is caused by our lack of real community in this country an older woman said to me that it was very difficult while she was raising her kids all the mothers were home and spent time together daily now she said no one is home and it is no fun any more it seems to me
9385762 that this is true that most people are off at work all day every day then when they come home they have no interest in anything other than seeing their own family or watching television
9385763 i think the way our society is set up with everyone off at jobs forty plus hours per week with americas emphasis on the individual our innately selfish natures take over and we simply dont want to deal with other people

9385915 from the state government a new package of 100 million over three years to deal with some of the pressures in health and education in transport and other services in communities like this

9385940 i stand in solidarity with the jerusalem declaration and statement on the global anglican future
9385941 i was just thinking this gustav is proof that there is a god in heaven
9385942 to have it planned at the same time that it would actually be on its way to new orleans for day one of the republican convention up in the twin cities at the top of the mississippi river
9385943 americans just want to be left alone our enemies are determined not to leave us alone but our media our intellectuals and the democratic party are trying to soothe us and assure us that we dont actually have to fight anybody we can win just by sitting still and being america

9385950 owen is a good player and always scores a lot of goals for england

9385952 i would like to live in melora creagers head even if just for a little while
9385953 i have accepted mr wilsons resignation from his position as national revenue critic and as a member of our national caucus effective immediately
9385954 i will collaborate fully with elections canada and do whatever i can to help expedite its investigation into the allegations
9385955 i have instructed the liberal party of canada to provide whatever assistance they can to elections canada as it reviews the allegations
9385956 w as kicked out of the liberal caucus for allegations of financial and legal improprieties
9385957 i want to thank all of my fellow republicans as we take off our republican hats and put on american hats
9385958 and we say america were with you the time for action is now
9385959 a big storm like this raises bipartisan concerns and i think for john to want to find out whats going on is fine
9385960 the thing that i always am concerned about in the middle of a storm is whether were drawing resources away from folks on the ground because the secret service and various security requirements sometimes it pulls police fire and other departments away from concentrating on the job
9385961 im assuming that where he went that wasnt an issue were going to try to stay clear of the area until things have settled down and then well probably try to figure out how we can be as helpful as possible
9385962 i may be broke but i am not flat busted
9385963 were going to make sure every child in america has a world class education
9385964 we cant compete against china and india when theyre producing more engineers than we are
9385965 you walk into the classrooms in china all those kids are paying attention
9385966 if parents dont parent and turn off the tv set and instill in their child a thirst for knowledge we will not succeed
9385967 i will not be going to minnesota for the republican national convention said bush who instead will travel to texas on monday to coordinate government efforts he will travel to san antonio where state and federal officials are pre positioning relief material
9385968 i will not be traveling to louisiana tomorrow bush said
9385969 have taken the storm very seriously and are working very proactively
9385970 theres a gigantic gigantic difference between john mccain and barack obama and between me and i suspect my vice presidential opponent well theres obvious differences
9385971 who said that who said that would you say that again for my wife
9385972 i havent heard that in a long long long time
9385973 and hanging out with this lean young looking guy is making me feel pretty old you know what i mean
9385974 i thought i was in pretty good shape til i hung out with this guy
9385975 champ when you get knocked down get right back up
9385976 this is a point of national concern i think everybody of good will has great empathy and sympathy for people in new orleans
9385977 most religious people are praying for people in new orleans there is no political connotation to this whatsoever this was just poking fun at jerry falwell and the nonsensical thing he had said several years ago
9385978 i dont believe in a god thats vengeful the south carolinian said
9385979 a storm is not a partisan event and that is what theyve done i am outraged
9385980 yeah i guess in some ways mccain says in an interview airing this evening on nbc
9385981 but the fact is you know i just returned from a briefing down in jackson miss the president was on along with mr paulison the director of fema and homeland security secretary chertoff and but this this is an overwhelming thing
9385982 and lets hope and pray that its not gonna be so severe as mississippi gov barbour said were praying for the best and preparing for the worst but look this is just one of those moments in history where you have to put america first
9385983 they are taking it day by day a white house spokesman says
9385984 country first celebration of its presidential nominee to a nation call for community service
9385985 i know republicans and democrats will respond accordingly with generosity with assistance and with volunteering everything they have to make sure that this blow is softened as much as possible mccain tells nbcs brian williams in the interview airing on the evening news
9385986 i think theres a number of ways its gonna be different mccain says
9385987 one is of course coordination between the government state and local authorities its much better in louisiana and its much better in the states that are covered
9385988 the four states governors texas louisiana alabama and mississippi are working closely together mccain says
9385989 theres still i think not as much communications equipment as we want theres still not enough search and rescue capabilities although were trying to fix that its not perfect
9385990 but i think that its dramatically different than it was in response to katrina he says
9385991 and in some ways if you look at some scenarios this could be worse
9385992 well what were gonna have to do is probably convene just for an hour or two strictly for business he says
9385993 approve the rules approve that the things that are required by law and by tradition for us to go through
9385994 but frankly i think thats gonna be difficult but i think we can but monday night certainly its its all about america
9385995 yeah were jamming you know all possibilities and all scenarios mccain says
9385996 i hope that by that time we will have had significant recovery efforts in movement and but i well have to just really judge it day by day but for now everything political on hold
9385997 i have no knowledge of that mccain says in the nbc interview
9385998 look the close relationship i have with my beloved friend joe lieberman ill tell you the last words he said to me before i made the selection he said john i want you to do whats best for this country and ill be at your side
9385999 i completely disagree the candidates wife said in an appearance this morning on abcs
9386000 and i know my husband does too she is heavily experienced in what she has done
9386001 you know she the experience that she comes from is with what shes done in the government mccain added with a certain geography lesson meant to underscore palins national security bearings
9386002 im offended by barack obama saying that about my husband
9386003 the american dream making a fortune as a beer distributor in phoenix and making her his heir
9386004 my husband was a navy boy his father and mother were in the navy i mean theres nothing elitist about that
9386005 you know something im a mother i can do it

9386055 so the point that i was making at the time was that the political dynamic was the driving force between that sectarian violence and we could try to keep a lid on it but if these underlining dynamic continued to bubble up and explode the way they were then we would be in a difficult situation i am glad that in fact those political dynamic shifted at the same time that our troops did outstanding work

9386057 the past is a rich resource on which we can draw in order to make decisions for the future but it does not dictate our choices we should look back at the past and select what is good and leave behind what is bad
9386058 we see eye to eye on a lot of stuff
9386059 she is an excellent pick most of the people in the state are shocked and pretty jubilant

9386078 what our players need to understand what our fans need to understand what everybody needs to understand its one game
9386079 and we need to keep playing better and we need to improve and our players need to have the focus to improve and remember how they got where they got rather than think we can just show up now and beat whoever we play because we have a tendency to think that way around here instead of kicking peoples like were supposed to
9386080 hes an odd fit in kansas citys 4 3 defense as a 62 238 pound defensive end theres a chance the coaching staff will try him at strong side backer

9386092 there have been rumors of force sensitive activities in that area perhaps even a jedi master am i simply supposed to sit on this information
9386093 if i said come with me you would wouldnt you
9386094 wasnt the reason that we agreed on this arrangement was so that dustil would never be put in danger and there would always be at least one of us with him
9386095 fire away youre not hurting my feelings youre preaching to the choir

9386102 georgias dean of politics and journalism hopes former gov roy barnes will come rescue georgia from chronic incompetence and apathy
9386103 those are the kind of things that maybe we would melt down on in the past maybe something bad would happen people would flatten out when you respond to adversity like we did tonight thats the sign of being a good competitor
9386104 prime minister ehud olmert on sunday met with the parents of
9386105 mr younger does that mean if the us electorate supports a lawless government which pre emptively attacks a member un state iraq which has not committed any attacks against and bombs and destroys much of that member un state we the us electorate all get whats coming to us

9386107 mike jefferson and danny amendola who were signed to the practice squad today should be active for sundays game at cleveland unless the team signs another wide receiver
9386108 i was supposed to screen cross of iron last night but we cancelled because it was unsafe so im gonna screen it tonight instead is that alright
9386109 i dont know how much longer i can do this
9386110 i dont know if what im doing has any value or not
9386111 im screening films but no ones coming except a few of the displaced people staying in the theatre the people whod usually come are either glued to their televisions or getting drunk someplace
9386112 a group of muhajiba veiled and therefore devout muslim girls staying here wanted to come to one of the european films we were screening the other night
9386113 i explained to them that theyd probably see some things they were uncomfortable with sexual intimacy and so forth they insisted they wanted to come in i dont blame them im sure theyre bored senseless
9386114 so the movie starts they sit through it for the first half hour then one girls father comes in sees whats on the screen and yells at her to come with him so all the girls get up and leave
9386115 come on look the needle is still above the e
9386116 what have we won the country is in ruins over 1000 people have been killed the israelis are still in our country i wish someone would tell me what we won i want to celebrate too
9386117 sorry about the disappearing act ramzis a bit freaked out because they announced that the new recruits are being deployed in south lebanon
9386118 nobody knows anything for sure the defence ministry announced the new recruits are going down that means ramzis going down now some cabinet ministers are kicking up a stink so they made the call before they know for sure
9386119 ultimately the people of israel are to blame for their states failure to implement a just peace with the palestinian people and to make a just land for peace settlement with the states of syria and lebanon
9386120 utah has the best non bcs talent in the country
9386121 the collection of letters a mere eighth of his surviving epistolary output and who knows how much was lost and destroyed reproduces all these effects it is charming enraging funny touching baffling but is also unexpectedly substantial a sort of apologia pro sua vita though old trouper that he was he firmly embraces the pros mantra never apologise never explain the tone is startlingly different from the demure and polished tone of the published books this is partly a matter of orthography partly of typing oddly enough both the staccato dot ridden style and the misspellings give the book a huge propulsive energy and immediacy that is to me more congenial than the more kempt style of the rest of his oeuvre and counteracts the frequent pomposity and sententiousness he is revealed as altogether quirkier and madder than one had realised
9386122 its likely that a sizeable portion of the population has never seen a dirk bogarde film
9386123 coldstream wrote the actors definitive biography and has now completed the picture with these letters or rather partially completed because bogarde was famously private in a time when the word was synonymous with homosexual for such an honest man his writing is seamed with the frankest opinions it is uncomfortable to be aware of his public denials concerning his life partner tony forwood former husband of glynis johns but this was an act of self preservation as a rank star he was making three films a year and became britains most popular actor at a time when the government was conducting a series of high profile gay prosecutions he was intelligent enough to be careful so no letters of any frankness survive
9386124 at his best when he is writing excitedly about working with visconti or
9386125 but more often they are claustrophobic and self absorbed he makes the usual expat complaints about how england is going to the dogs being taken over by jews arabs japs nig nogs socialists etc and his interest in the wider world is zilch
9386126 he told dilys powell in 1989 letters i think unless they are brilliant can be a bit of a bore and mine are not brilliant amusing perhaps light and loving but they aint intellectual quite and not that amusing either
9386127 i have decided to give the movies a rest he says a sentiment rephrased frequently i detest the work and most of the time i detest the people the fact that i have been chosen by
9386128 i hate the work now honestly during my fifth simulated orgasm on the film with liliana cavani in rome the night porter i suddenly wondered what the hell i was doing at 53 with my back on the floor my flies undone being straddled by beloved miss charlotte rampling
9386129 we were or rather i was as president informed long before that we were to award prizes to commercial films and players not to art subjects or players who are un known generally this must be a family festival not a political one so much for my personal brief coupled with the vague suggestion most delicatly sic put that john huston had been promised the palme dor for under the volcano albert finney best actor and jacqueline bissett sic not half bad but not good enough was to be best actress
9386130 finally the festival organisers were appalled when we voted best actor to two brilliant spanish gentlemen alfredo landa and francisco rabal and helen mirren best actress sent them into a sort of foaming fit who is she they cried what film is she in the final announcements made by me in frog on the stage to an audience of 3 000 on the final night were recieved sic with cheers and shouts of joy they were quick to catch on that 25 million dollars does not nescessarily sic mean a good film has been made the reverse have you seen the bounty by any chance
9386131 your mother did not train you right kid youre already pretty much giving away that shes there the smart thing to do would have been to pretend youd never heard of the name and then strike up a casual conversation with me
9386132 the benefactors dead im trying to restart the order here
9386133 dustils kids you know and some other troops ive been hiding around worked well into the system got it done
9386134 take that as a its about time ive been as bored as poo doo over here
9386135 im not going on an away mission dash and you know it
9386136 you were the one that said the order was all you had and that it was worth fighting for theyre all a lot of jedi have
9386137 haal would have wanted you to stay and fight it out
9386138 out of all the people i know i thought i could at least count on you theres safety in numbers aish
9386139 you know who hes been coming after id just b putting other people at risk
9386140 to think i actually wanted to be friends with dustil look where it got me
9386141 it got you somewhere great dash and you know this wasnt dustils fault
9386142 yeah i know but that doesnt change the fact that he died fighting and youre going to run from it all
9386143 just one that makes everything else youve ever said not stack up anymore
9386144 ryloth haal had some family up there im going to stay with
9386145 never met a sith before who left even a mark on me
9386146 alright got some kolto and gauze but you might want to have a surgeon take a look at that nose
9386147 the koltoll heal it up but without setting it it could heal crooked mess up your sinuses
9386148 i could look up the address might want to stuff your nose with gauze itll hurt and suck to sleep like that but itll keep your nasal passage open
9386149 busted my ribs too i think but id probably know if they were broken
9386150 well it also involved climbing out of a window in leather pants
9386151 not really a child friendly story but lets just say that leather doesnt have a lot of give to it
9386152 how bad will my sinuses be if i dont go
9386153 if they heal wrong think about breathing through your mouth permanently
9386154 my naan tried to put me in this traditional alderaanian dress once
9386155 so the one was to squeeze all the air out of you lungs and push your rack up to your chin but what were the other two for decoration
9386156 the surgeon might want to talk you into letting him shave the bump off the tip of your nose
9386157 um come with me maybe nita needs a check up or something
9386158 if its a legit hospital theyre not going to harvest your organs when youre not looking afraid of getting lost on the upper levels
9386159 i dont have another appointment for a few hours so we can get it out of the way
9386160 make sure she doesnt have the chandrilan flesh eating bacteria at least
9386161 always a good thing to catch early or the denabian shrinking flu for all we know she could have been six meters
9386162 it shouldnt the people who tend to need the er cant tend to afford where were going
9386163 your feet are going to be cold little girl and ketchupy
9386164 huh guess i should put a lock on the underwear drawer now too
9386165 did you find out about the daycare situation yet a proprietor at the art gallery recommended one but i dont think theyd appreciate the underwear hiding and her affinity for putting green fingerpaint on the wall at the montessori upper level school
9386166 i kind of like taking her with me to jobs shes a good icebreaker
9386167 depends on if youre using her to pick up chicks
9386168 i like her coming over too only work three shifts besides
9386169 shes learning enough on her own like how to climb a cabinet and get a paint stain in places that she shouldnt even be able to reach
9386170 itd be interesting to watch them face off after some wine tasting
9386171 they like to throw really bad insults but once in a while theres a fight its always quickly handled i think i like it better on courscant
9386172 theyd probably trip over their formal wear before anything good started
9386173 thats what would make it entertaining all the glove slapping and prissy crap
9386174 our destinies are guided by the force conspiracies imaginary or otherwise are meaningless
9386175 are you staying on dxun are you going home soon if you are staying you should go on a hunt with us
9386176 ill stay for a while i guess if i go hunting i wont have to gut anything will i
9386177 yeah you can gut if you want i have knife to borrow
9386178 riding boma out in jungle like drexl with no wings
9386179 neither with cannock tastes like trash we look for corrs boots in cannock
9386180 hes just trying to show off he doesnt know how to beast ride
9386181 if you want to ride a boma ori or corr can show you the best
9386182 are you looking for ollie or did you want a tour of the camp i havent seen you doing much youre free to explore as long as you dont piss mandalore or my mother off you should be fine
9386183 and or with three little boys and a little girl she has the most children in the camp youll feel her coming
9386184 maybe kaya should stay with you show you around and keep you away from maii
9386185 i have to take my nephew to lessons but come by the big bunker on the far side of the hill if you need anything terree is my wife she can probably cook some troch food if you dont want rahk
9386186 im not the best at all the words but im better than rou
9386187 our sister vala is the best because she knows how to write in basic too
9386188 he didnt just call me an idiot or something did he
9386189 i bet you guys do more around here than kill things or hope for boma to show up
9386190 this isnt coruscant i just dont want to get lost and eaten by cannocks i guess
9386191 did you want to go climb one of the roofs and watch rou get beaten up hes doing hand to hand training today
9386192 which roof has the best view if you want i mean would he get mad if we watched ill try not to laugh
9386193 the one next to the communications station has a good view just tell him he did very well if he sees us hes good natured and will believe it
9386194 just stay close and follow me ill take you through the back
9386195 theres scads of milk here should we take some with us
9386196 they destroyed it in two minutes millions of dollars wasted
9386197 the planes came around 12 45 so most people were at lunch fortunately two people were killed indians and two injured if they had come an hour earlier or later it would have been a massacre you see
9386198 we dont look to anyone we have christian employees and muslim sunni and shia all we did was do good work
9386199 how many tons of explosive did it take to blow this up here
9386200 when you include casual labour drivers those who provided sand for production many more people benefited from this company
9386201 you laugh because youre alive you cry because everything is finished
9386202 the people who work in the fields here are in terrible shape
9386203 with the roads bombed they cant get their produce to market
9386204 what good would any of it do this war is bigger than any of us
9386205 its not that the israelis had a trap that hezbollah walked into
9386206 but there was a strong feeling in the white house that sooner or later the israelis were going to do it
9386207 its possible that sather is holding out as long as possible on shanahan in order to retain no 14 as an option to fill a hole if the blueshirts shed a group of wingers that would include petr prucha in order to create cap space for free agent center sundin possible but is that likely
9386208 we are ready and we will resist for a very long time if the israelis think they can dislodge us quickly
9386209 we have succeeded in killing 200 or 300 or 400 who is counting of the 1 000 fighters of hezbollah
9386210 war is nothing more than the continuation of politics by other means
9386211 war is nothing more than the continuation of the lack of policy by other means
9386212 they could have stopped after two or three days when all the world agreed that hezbollahs provocation justified an israeli response when nobody was yet doubting the capabilities of the israeli army the operation would have looked sensible sober and proportional
9386213 with the proper bribe one can do anything in lebanon
9386214 whats the deal with the fruit whats wrong with it
9386215 theyre not buying fruit these days theyre saving their money for the vegetables

9386240 i figured the israeli military is always calling our phone lines with recorded
9386241 so i went onto some of the irc internet chat rooms and tried to find an
9386242 but i guess the program recognized my internet connection address as coming from lebanon because i didnt even get a chance to write anything they kicked me out directly
9386243 how did they kick you out the program closed on you
9386244 no they kicked me out and a box appeared on the screen saying shit listed
9386245 these stupid foreigners they think were completely backwards dont they
9386246 they dont know that you can just ask any lebanese mother which
9386247 would someone please send them a message before they come next time patricia ward said
9386248 this suggests that house prices will remain relatively resilient in the near term rather than fall sharply however a significant rebound in house prices also currently seems unlikely
9386249 and now ladies and gentlemen watch me saw this lady in half
9386250 the israeli butchery show thanks to american self delusion indulgence and weapons technology
9386251 when iran and syria push the remote control button on the 12th of july and send that robot patrol of israeli soldiers near the blue line for us to act like were capturing it wed better have those stuffed people corpses ready to go because all those gullible international journalists are going to show up
9386252 bush blair relations resemble clinton monica relations arab rulers are fornicating with foreign occupiers
9386253 two of the arab worlds beautiful daughters jerusalem and baghdad are in the hands of these foreigners these occupiers and nothing can be done by the arab rulers because they are in bed fornicating with the foreigners who are occupying and using these beautiful arab daughters as they will
9386254 you know i dont want to embarrass any particular arab ruler but once i spoke to a prince i told him there were three british newspapers on sale for 100 million pounds the daily express the sunday express and the daily star three important newspapers why dont you buy them i said you could make a foothold for a decent point of view on the arab world if you were to buy these newspapers he could have bought them but he didnt have the courage to buy them hed rather spend the money on other things you know in london there is enough money thrown onto the roulette tables of londons casinos by arabs which could buy media in america and britain and transform the landscape
9386255 i think every weekend has been pretty steady sales have been pretty much the same throughout the weekend and every weekend this summer
9386256 we do see some tourists come in from bordering states like ohio and illinois but primarily a lot of people from michigan traveling up north
9386257 we opened june 6th and since the first day weve had people basically beating down the door
9386258 overall weve made probably pretty good sales this summer and the rumors arent true about people not traveling as far because weve had people from all over come visit the store
9386259 weve had a lot of customers from the chicago area and a lot of downstaters ive met a ton from the detroit area some from grand rapids

9386262 we may be seeing the first woman president as a democrat i am reeling

9386264 many job opportunities are located not just at mine sites but in queenslands beautiful coastal and hinterland towns and cities where workshops and service centres are located
9386265 we had not thought to recruit in the us but it is a logical market for us as american workers are well trained and skilled
9386266 potential to introduce dangerous foreign object damage fod to flight hardware areas and can cause personnel injury if the metal clips are installed improperly

9386329 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
9386330 is they have some investment properties and stuff its not as if he lives in 10 houses thats just not the case the reality is they have four that actually could be considered houses they could use

9386343 but first and foremost most germans are still sceptical about pretty much anything that comes out of the us and here comes the interesting part deep inside germans actually want to like the us
9386344 chris kaman has never lived in germany he does not speak german and his only connection to germany consists of some ancestors who emigrated from germany to the united states nearly a century ago
9386345 no other regulatory agency has a program with such a potentially devastating effect on consumers ability to seek their own remedies
9386346 im hearing nothing but rave reviews for this selection from republican quarters and a touch of relief
9386347 as one staunch conservative friend wrote me a suddenly interesting election
9386348 we respect the womens vote and that is clearly not the case in the democratic party
9386349 to be as engaging as possible a bright and breezy presence at table and encourage confidences from those in the know
9386350 i have the facts and apparently i must educate mr manzullo since he took office in 1992 he has had a clear record of supporting unfair trade with china and corporations who avoid taxation and ship jobs overseas
9386351 he says he wants to support manufacturing and he will give you a long list of tiny accomplishments that he believes proves his support of working families but the second we turn our backs mr manzullo is voting to ship our jobs overseas and giving companies that do it a tax break enough is enough the families struggling to make ends meet in our community deserve better they deserve the truth
9386352 my opponent has never run a business and its clear he doesnt understand how important manufacturing is to this district if we want new jobs then we cant suffer any more of don manzullos empty rhetoric and do nothing policies
9386353 there are a lot of things that are different between now and what we faced in 2005 when katrina came ashore weve had three years to put together a plan that never existed before

9386364 if any man would come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me for whoever would save his life will lose it and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it for what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world and forfeits his life
9386365 whoever wishes to come after me must deny himself take up his cross and follow me for whoever wishes to save his life will lose it but whoever loses his life for my sake will find it what profit would there be for one to gain the whole world and forfeit his life
9386366 if any want to become my followers let them deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me for those who want to save their life will lose it and those who lose their life for my sake will find it for what will it profit them if they gain the whole world and but forfeit their life
9386367 if anyone wants to be a follower of mine let him renounce himself and take up his cross and follow me for anyone who wants to save his life will lose it but anyone who loses his life for my sake will find it what then will a man gain if he wins the whole world and ruins his life
9386368 if any of you want to come with me you must forget yourself carry your cross and follow me for it you want to save your own life you will lose it but if you lose your life for my sake you will find it will you gain anything if you win the whole world but lose your life elaine t said

9386370 usually people will sit and play for a while and the house will get its money back

9386399 it is deeply disturbing that a department as shambolic as the home office already faces such problems as a result of the economic downturn it is patently not equipped to cope why havent they prepared for this
9386400 now we see that the consequences of gordon browns complete mismanagement of the economy will not just hit hard working families in the pocket but will also threaten their security and safety across the board labour are failing in their duty to ensure the welfare of the british public
9386401 we do not normally comment on leaked documents but this is draft advice that the home secretary has not cleared and has not been sent to number 10
9386402 it is however appropriate that the home office considers the effects the economic climate may have on crime and other policy areas
9386403 when the chancellor put this budget together he wasnt expecting to lose 2 7bn but im sure when he re jigged his numbers he will take account of this extra money
9386404 however what we need to bear in mind it could be good news for the economy
9386405 taxpayers with another 60 in their pocket may well go out and spend it that could increase high street profits

9386413 i think in ketchikan theres still quite a bit of concern about the palin administration
9386414 number one we dont think were nowhere and number two when she campaigned in ketchikan she was supportive of the project
9386415 she hasnt communicated with us or spent any time with us the people who helped get her elected are shocked
9386416 shes alienated a lot of the republican base here in ketchikan
9386417 im not sure what she brings to the ticket other than shes a woman and a conservative well shes a better speaker than mccain

9386481 we should all be proud of governor sarah palins historic nomination and i congratulate her and senator mccain
9386482 while their policies would take america in the wrong direction governor palin will add an important new voice to the debate
9386483 we send our congratulations to gov sarah palin and her family on her designation as the republican nominee for vice president
9386484 it is yet another encouraging sign that old barriers are falling in our politics while we obviously have differences over how best to lead this country forward gov palin is an admirable person and will add a compelling new voice to this campaign
9386485 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency governor palin shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade the agenda of big oil and continuing george bushs failed economic policies thats not the change we need its just more of the same

9386487 this is the first real sign the tide is turning
9386488 if you are coming into university with not very good qualifications and do an arts degree at a low ranked university you are not really doing yourself any favours
9386489 but you are under the impression that if you have a degree youre really employable
9386490 i didnt see it university could be massively useful but my tutor said youve kind of got to go so you may as well pick something that vaguely interests you
9386491 the programme is targeted mainly at those who made a decision not to go to university because of the debts they would incur
9386492 having a workforce with graduate level skills has never been more important to economic success
9386493 there are also nonfinancial benefits for graduates who tend to have better jobs and healthier lifestyles be more involved in their childrens education and be more tolerant and active citizens
9386494 we must act urgently to improve our childrens performance in maths and encourage those with aptitude to go on to study it
9386495 literacy and numeracy in the primary years are crucially important to ensuring all students participate in education and make a positive transition to work and learning in adult life
9386496 students who do not achieve the minimum standards in literacy and numeracy are least likely to stay on through secondary school or to end up in further study and employment
9386497 few people claim to understand the dynamics of the clinton vote

9386505 who got the win t m gl v ne pretty ho hum right well fans like us will remember that down the stretch in 2006 the gentleman who started games a day after john maine did was steve trachsel only he didnt start that day
9386506 gl v ne took his spot messed up the nlds rotation and trachsel gave the mets two miserable playoff starts
9386507 when the chancellor put this budget together he wasnt expecting to lose 2 7bn but im sure when he re jigged his numbers he will take account of this extra money

9386511 this gene is crucial to the daisy chain of signals that run between body fat and the brain
9386512 it likely plays a pivotal role in how much we as humans eat and whether we have offspring
9386513 its an extremely interesting observation weve known for a long time that if you havent got any fat as a girl your periods stop and if you give leptin the periods start again
9386514 is this concrete all around or is it in my head
9386515 yeah thats because we have a slightly higher rate of education

9386517 is this concrete all around or is it in my head
9386518 oh my god if i could work with aaron spelling that would be the best thing ever
9386519 it is hard to imagine palin playing the same sort of role that modern vice presidents like gore bush cheney or mondale played
9386520 these are centuries old traditions and i will continue to defend them
9386521 only those who indulge in immoral acts should be afraid
9386522 dont make a fuss over the nuclear bombs in toronto theyre mostly non muslim anyway this is a centuries old tradition
9386523 we may be seeing the first woman president as a democrat i am reeling
9386524 that was the best political speech i have ever seen delivered by an american woman politician palin is as tough as nails

9386529 im personally even surprised he got such a good spot
9386530 that just goes to show the influence or importance brownback has been to the mccain campaign
9386531 its a philosophical position for the party that were fighting to get the party to embrace
9386532 right now theres conflict among conservative christians about just how much mccain reflects their values
9386533 yes it can be done but only with a 4 pin xlr i think not sure about two 3 pin xlrs
9386534 jordans move to thaw relations with the palestinian islamic resistance movement hamas following nine years of estrangement has raised eyebrows as to the timing and the motives behind this tactic

9386541 is this concrete all around or is it in my head
9386542 i think the question i most frequently get asked as a painter is why do you choose to paint the things you do probably the most truthful answer is that i dont know i dont know why i photograph the things i do i dont know why i chose to photograph my subjects in a certain way under certain lighting conditions i dont know why some photographs appeal to me as painting subject matter more than others what i do know is that i dont start out with an idea or theme or concept and then strictly adhere to that throughout i know that my work isnt a direct response to a political social or environmental issue i know that i dont have a conscious ideological agenda or feel strongly about the way art should be made or the future of art that isnt to say i cant speculate after the fact and wonder whether i chose to paint something because of a personal association or because of some cultural influence or because of the way the neurons in my brain have been hardwired or because certain colours may appeal to me more than others at certain times depending on my mood those types of things may help to explain the existence of these paintings to some degree but its still speculation and hardly definitive the truth is that i just dont find the question very interesting it doesnt matter to me why i paint the things i do and i dont think that is an anti intellectual or anti conceptual statement i simply suspect that why i do what i do has a lot less to do with a rational logical thought process than experiential factors like chance luck coincidence intuition instinct belief habit emotion feeling taste or fashion amongst others maybe that makes my position moderately irrational but i dont mind that label its not that i reject logic and reason entirely i think they have their place but it should be ok to say i dont know when asked why thats probably not a very interesting answer but maybe the answer is determined by the question
9386543 is this concrete all around or is it in my head

9386553 we must redirect our efforts from the really celebratory event of the nomination of president and vice president of our party to acting as all americans
9386554 but theres very little doubt that we have to go from a party event to a call to the nation for action action to help our fellow citizens in this time of tragedy and disaster action in the form of volunteering donations reaching out our hands and our hearts and our wallets to the people who are under such great threat from this great natural disaster
9386555 because america needs us now no matter whether we are republican or democrat

9386558 ive got to tell you ive talked to barack i think he understands the issue much better than before
9386559 i am one of those guys who likes my guns to be honest with you
9386560 he told me flat out im not taking your guns away and dont let anybody tell you that i will
9386561 this campaign does not need to be about fear this guy is not going to take away your guns
9386562 tester also said that obama has an edge over mccain with hunters because the democrat will do a better job of protecting public lands and open space
9386563 sportsmen have been stereotyped as concerned with one issue guns but if you listen to sportsmen as i have over the years we hear a different story
9386564 democrats are all about conservation they are all about preservation i think thats a huge opportunity
9386565 reinstating the assault weapons ban so that guns do not fall into the hands of terrorists or criminals
9386566 dont tell me we cant guarantee the right of law abiding americans to own ak 47s while keeping them out of the hands of criminals
9386567 america were with you america were going to care for these people in their time of need
9386568 the situation along the gulf coast our thoughts and prayers are with the families in the region
9386569 were in very good hands with gov bobby jindal and president george w bush taking care of things at home
9386570 we thank the good lord that he is our governor today especially
9386571 of course this is a time when we have to do away with party politics and we have to act as americans
9386572 were going to suspend most of our activities tomorrow except for those that are absolutely necessary
9386573 we must redirect our efforts from the really celebratory event of the nomination of president and vice president of our party to acting as all americans
9386574 theres very little doubt that we have to go from a party event to a call to the nation for action

9386578 het is de laatste dag voor de start van het schooljaar traditioneel is er dan minder opkomst maar de zon heeft ons dit jaar gered
9386579 tijdens de optocht die dit jaar in het teken stond van de gastronomie bleef het droog bij de start scheen de zon volop wat later kwamen wat sluierwolken voor verfrissing zorgen maar druppels hebben we gelukkig niet gezien de temperatuur bleef ook zeer aangenaam we zijn blij dat we onze toeristen zo konden uitwuiven
9386580 over het algemeen was er moeilijk een lijn te trekken in dit seizoen
9386581 voor de ene was het seizoen goed voor anderen veel minder de attracties zagen veel volk passeren de verhuurders van strandzetels de verkopers van boules en roomijs zagen hun inkomsten met elke regendruppel uitblijven we kunnen zeker concluderen dat de dagjesmensen zijn weggebleven we hopen nu op een goed najaar
9386582 het is gewoon fijn om goed te spelen zo simpel is het
9386583 i would dread the day that sen obama takes the oath and became commander in chief
9386584 well in fairness to gov palin lets do the same analysis as to sen obama hes basically graduated from law school went on to be a community organizer and a law professor went to the u s senate and began running for president essentially the day he arrived
9386585 i think what he was looking for is a partner to tell a story about what he wants to do in washington
9386586 alaska is the closest part of our continent to russia so its not as if she doesnt understand whats at stake here
9386587 alaskas geographic location certainly contributes to governor palins experience since she has dealt with trade and economic issues as a result but it is only one part of her overall experience
9386588 alaska is the closest part of our continent to russia so its not as if sarah palin doesnt understand whats at stake here
9386589 mcsame lost this election on aug 29th the day he chose palin as his running mate
9386590 if mccain can do five chin ups and sarah explains to me the importance of abkhazia in the georgia crisis i will send them 100 and vote for them
9386591 women and children or strap bombs on to them so they can go out and
9386592 we cant drill our way out of this amp we could never affect the price of oil anyway the demand is too great
9386593 public school principals must have an ma to administer a school and oversee the education of your children ms palin has a ba in journalism clearly not equipped to administer our nation should sen mccain become unable to fulfill his duties and what are the chances of that why did ms palin accept the veep call this says something about her character
9386594 it is time to let the other side have a try

9386673 that was the best political speech i have ever seen delivered by an american woman politician palin is as tough as nails
9386674 the official barack obama site thats supposed to be defending him against smears
9386675 if mrs palin a conservative mother of five ever doubted that landing on a national presidential ticket would open herself to the harshest of spotlights and smear tactics she also awoke this morning to utterly unfounded internet rumours that her fifth child born in april with downs syndrome was actually her 17 year old daughters
9386676 yet the surprise choice of mrs palin has had an extraordinary impact on the presidential race with the campaign of barack obama scrambling to discover more about her as it calculates how best to go after only the second women to be chosen as a vice presidential nominee follwing geraldine ferraro in 1984 thick dossiers had been prepared on mitt romney and tim pawlenty the men widely believed to be the final frontrunners but the file on mrs palin is wafer thin

9386717 to find unite and transport children impacted by hurricane katrina to their parents legal guardian or next of kin
9386718 the devastation caused by hurricane katrina has revealed the best and the worst about our great nation it has revealed a great economic divide that exists among our citizens while it demonstrated as well the capacity of the majority of our citizens to be compassionate and even heroic during times of great need
9386719 it also exposed the demons of some who will use any opportunity to prey on the weak
9386720 the national center for missing and exploited children has reported that over 1 000 children have been displaced by this storm that means they are not with their parents or guardians and in this amendment we provide 10 million for that effort
9386721 we also provide 9 million to support domestic violence victims impacted by the storms we all heard of the reports of sexual assaults in the aftermath of hurricane katrina and we will support those victims who have not been moved to new shelters

9386736 while this may be his running mate america knows this is john mccains agenda
9386737 weve been told for the last few months that experience is what matters most in the next white house
9386738 but mccain is picking someone whose experience is little to nothing or at best unknown she might be able to pick up that experience i hope she does but right now thats her weakest suit
9386739 so far as suburban woman go this will not help mccain at all theyre pro choice and anti gun
9386740 i cant imagine the obama team will spend their time on palin theyll spend their time with their negative ads attacking mccain and bush
9386741 you always have to be careful not to rally people to her side by attacking too much
9386742 i think the public pretty much accepts the fact that they played pretty dirty and that sexism played a role in the primary
9386743 hey who knew there were so many white guys on milwaukees city council
9386744 president bush and vice president dick cheney will not attend the gop convention in st
9386745 you dont wish for it but it shows mccain dealing with a surprise a big event that has consequences on people
9386746 its redemption for the republican party on the competence issue the convention ends up being about john mccain showing the best way to serve a cause greater than yourself
9386747 a whole series of obama ads now in the dumper
9386748 this is mccain doing the right thing showing leadership and
9386749 hes deciding how to handle this and bush is irrelevant
9386750 the contrast between mccains responsibility and the fanatical followers in the temple of the lord obama wont be lost on everyday husbands and wives trying to meet their own responsibilities
9386751 reminds everyone of katrina which was a disaster for the gop
9386752 it doesnt allow them to put forward a message contrary to obama because everyone is focused on the hurricane
9386753 plain and simple one of the most unprofessional childish and inexcusable performances ive ever seen from a politician
9386754 governor you cant say this but i will lyda green is a cancer and a b
9386755 the governor called senator green to explain that she does not condone name calling in any way and apologized if there was a perception that the comment was attributed to the governor
9386756 plain and simple one of the most unprofessional childish and i
9386757 i dont think anyone should harp on this woman but she needs to be vetting in the media absolutely
9386758 barack obama and john mccain had one major test of their judgment
9386759 john mccain chooses someone who is a mayor of a town of 7 000 people then was elected governor has been governor of a state for 18 months a governor of a state that has half the population of franklin county and yet she is going to be a heartbeat away from president
9386760 on the other hand in his first exercise of good judgment barack obama chose joe biden john mccains 26 years in the u s senate certainly hasnt helped him build good judgment

9386767 i loved coke i never did a lot just a little bit at parties
9386768 but what ended it for me was when they caught klaus barbie the butcher of lyon in the early 80s he was hiding in south america and living off the proceeds of being a cocaine baron and i read that in the paper and all the cards fell into place and i saw how my little sniff of cocaine at a party had an absolute direct route to this fucking horrible man in south america
9386769 until that moment i had never grasped the full horrifying structure of what brings coke to our parties in britain

9386780 we expected to see evidence of big improvements since our last investigation but weve been sadly disappointed with so many of us buying our foods at these supermarkets their collective behaviour can heavily influence the nations eating habits despite their claims the supermarkets all still have a long way to go to help customers choose and enjoy a healthy diet
9386781 these retailers have shown a real commitment to more responsible retailing and making their customers health a priority although more work needs to be done across the sector to curb unhealthy food promotion
9386782 one off snap shot in one english city last march
9386783 misleading comparisons to unfairly criticise retailers records on encouraging healthier food choices
9386784 customers will have seen for themselves the current high profile price war centred on fruit and vegetables
9386785 its six months out of date contains a number of inaccuracies and is a largely subjective assessment
9386786 we include frozen and tinned fruit and vegetables supermarkets could discount what is there and we did not find they were doing so a spot check like this is totally fair we set out to replicate what it is like for a normal shopper
9386787 if any of the european countries wants to serve someones narrow political interests then go ahead we cannot stop them but we think as they say in such cases you have to look out for number one
9386788 in the light of russian actions the eu should review root and branch our relationship with russia
9386789 we need a strong and considered european role to return to reason and responsibility
9386790 i expect that europe wont give up faced with this dirty attempt at aggression
9386791 its up to russia to make a fundamental choice in this respect
9386792 we risk sleepwalking into an energy dependence on less stable or reliable partners
9386793 the credit crunch has shown that while we now have a global economy that is more integrated than ever before from which no national economy is insulated we do not have adequate means of managing it other than as nations or regional entities
9386794 in the next 20 years the world economy will double in its size and wealth and we have a great opportunity to win new business new jobs and prosperity for britain
9386795 there is a risk of a downturn increasing the appeal of far right extremism and racism which presents a threat as there is evidence that grievance based on experiencing racism is one of the factors that can lead to people becoming terrorists the relationship to radicalisation is complex but there is a possibility that a downturn will increase the pool of those susceptible to radicalisation
9386796 i dont think the others realised shaquille had been stabbed at first they thought he had just been punched
9386797 theres a row of georgian houses surrounded by estates its where different gangs meet up on saturday there were a few strong words followed by a commotion i looked outside the boy was down but conscious he was stabbed near my house but dragged himself along to collapse outside his home his family his mother and sisters were with him the ambulance was there within 10 minutes
9386798 the two bodies were found close to one another and the body of another dog found nearby the dog has also been subject of a post mortem examination which revealed it too had been shot
9386799 its anyones guess but it seems that the people he owed money to are big companies and i cant see them behind something like this
9386800 maybe he just flipped because the pressure of it was too much for him
9386801 although it is now being treated as a murder we are keeping an open mind as to the circumstances leading up to the incident
9386802 police continue to work around the clock to establish the facts on what happened at osbaston house that morning
9386803 it is hard to grasp exactly what has happened and it is clearly going to be some time before everything is revealed but today we pray for the fosters and their family and friends who must be devastated by the events of early last tuesday morning
9386804 not to be overwhelmed by the uncertainties of last week
9386805 we are shocked absolutely shocked its not the sort of thing that occurs in a country district like this
9386806 everybody is stunned we want to support the people involved its very sad
9386807 theres a lot happening in the next two years everyone in qualifications and testing is aware that there are a lot of changes happening we need to make sure it is a reliable process and inspires confidence
9386808 the fact that there has been an operation failure in the tests this summer has affected confidence in the system
9386809 we have to identify which risks could raise problems and which bits could be severe we have to tackle this to inspire confidence
9386810 this choice of biden is disappointing because he is the creator of the idea of dividing iraq
9386811 we rejected his proposal when he announced it and we still reject it dividing the communities and land in such a way would only lead to new fighting between people over resources and borders iraq cannot survive unless it is unified and dividing it would keep the problems alive for a long time
9386812 such a person if he would assume the vice presidency post would not serve to improve iraq usa relations
9386813 the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
9386814 one who is not your friend will want you to remain neutral irresolute princes to avoid present dangers usually follow the path of neutrality and are mostly ruined by it
9386815 and whats happening throughout iraq is enough to make americans of either party proud
9386816 faced with a determined enemy hell bent on bringing america to her knees in mesopotamia american military will its adaptability and might are carrying the day
9386817 i challenge anyone to walk the streets of fallujah baqubah samarra or elsewhere in iraq and tell the locals that their city their neighborhoods have not been al qaeda battlefronts
9386818 every samarran i spoke with every single one brought up al qaeda pronouncing the name with a guttural disdain distinct in iraqi accents most have had a family member killed by al qaedas indiscriminate tactics and have no desire to live in their seventh century fantasy world
9386819 a few months ago a raid south of samarra uncovered the primary administrative hub for al qaeda in iraq aqi the bunker complex piled high with medical records travel documents and pay stubs was where foreigners were sent before receiving their suicide assignments al qaeda literature and videos littered the underground headquarters
9386820 iraq has actually proven to be a distraction for al qaeda
9386821 the self aggrandizing notion that opposing the iraq war then at the beginning automatically devalues the importance of the endeavor today
9386822 todays hardcore iraq war detractors politicians pundits polemicists alike all use the same lines of argument to smear the importance of the iraq war at every turn
9386823 and facts of the new counterinsurgency strategy of general patrias or
9386824 what ultimately happens on the streets of samarra militarily politically economically will reverberate through the middle east and the world will our allies and our enemies see a strong america that wins its wars and stands by its friends
9386825 were going to go with the biggest story of the day tomorrow
9386826 and right now the biggest story of the day is the storm
9386827 thats the thing about money it doesnt seem to buy any class
9386828 humanity has advanced when it has advanced not because it has been sober responsible and cautious but because it has been playful rebellious and immature
9386829 but i dont want to go among mad people alice remarked
9386830 the most merciful thing in the world i think is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents
9386831 i have championed reform to end the abuses of earmark spending by congress
9386832 in fact i told congress i told congress thanks but no thanks on that bridge to nowhere
9386833 if our state wanted a bridge i said wed build it ourselves
9386834 the window is now while our congressional delegation is in a strong position to assist
9386835 the money thats been appropriated for the project it should remain available for a link an access process as we continue to evaluate the scope and just how best to just get this done
9386836 this link is a commitment to help ketchikan expand its access to help this community prosper
9386837 i think were going to make a good team as we progress that bridge project
9386838 she was asked about the bridge and she supported it
9386839 how could she have foreseen that she would be at this point now everybody is surprised by this development
9386840 dio perch mi hai dato una croce cos pesante non ce la faccio a portarla
9386841 carissima mi chiedevi una croce pi leggera io non so che fare scegli quella che desideri
9386842 there was nobody i wanted to vote for but now im so ecstatic
9386843 first two national polls find palin gains less support from women
9386844 she palin has a better feel for our energy problems than other politicians plus shes an example for our daughters and an inspiration for us women at home with little kids
9386845 she palin shows that you can start small and that its never too late
9386846 im going home and calling my mother im so excited
9386847 it wouldve been same old same old with the other choices they wouldnt have mixed it up and change is whats needed
9386848 i think its fantastic she palin is street ready shes gonna do so many things for women
9386849 it was a very smart move on the part of the mccain campaign because sarah palin hits all the right demographics and shes like one of us also she knows what working people go through
9386850 thats why youre seeing so many kids here on a school day
9386851 still the man that i admire most in this world
9386852 the role of the vice president is to break a tie in the senate and to inquire daily as to the health of the president
9386853 there was nobody i wanted to vote for but now im so ecstatic
9386854 we dont want to build a giant factory that the market doesnt need or want
9386855 investors like to know what tax policies apply when they are putting millions of dollars down on a project theres a pretty clear history that these projects are less likely to go forward without a credit
9386856 these companies are shutting down projects firing people and its congresss fault
9386857 life is not measured by the number of breaths we take but by the moments that take our breath away
9386858 i can handle anything that life throws at me i may not be able to handle it well or correctly or gracefully or with finesse or
9386859 life may not be the party we hoped for but while we are here we
9386860 we do not stop playing because we grow old we grow old because we stop playing
9386861 marriage is so tough nelson mandela decided to get a divorce
9386862 friends are quiet angels who lift us to our feet when our wings have trouble remembering how to fly
9386863 good friends are hard to find harder to leave and
9386864 and the day came when the risk it took to remain tight inside the bud was more painful than the risk it took to blossom
9386865 lifes journey is not to arrive at the grave safely in a well preserved body but rather to skid in sideways totally worn out shouting holy 5h1t what a ride
9386866 twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didnt do than by the ones you did do so throw off the bowlines sail away from the safe harbor catch the trade winds in your sails explore dream discover
9386867 the most merciful thing in the world i think is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents

9386869 could you make sure jill hears that i just want to make sure she hears that
9386870 i havent heard that in a long long long time and hanging around this lean young looking guy is making me feel pretty old you know what i mean i thought i was in pretty good shape until i hung out with this guy you know what i mean
9386871 let me end on a serious note i was a pretty good football player weve got to talk further after this
9386872 shes exactly who i need shes exactly who this country needs to help me fight the same old wash politics of me first and country second
9386873 we benefit eternally by gods being just what he is because he is what he is he lifts up our heads out of the prison house changes our prison garments for royal robes and makes us to eat bread continually before him all the days of our lives grace takes its rise far back in the heart of god in the awful and incomprehensible abyss of his holy being but the channel through which it flows out to men is jesus christ crucified and risen we who feel ourselves alienated from the fellowship of god can now raise our discouraged heads and look up through the virtues of christs atoning death the cause of our banishment has been removed we may return as the prodigal returned and be welcome as we approach the garden our home before the fall the flaming sword is withdrawn the keepers of the tree of life stand aside when they see a son of grace approaching

9386883 cuando los talibanes estaban al poder usted pod a conducir sin parar hasta llegar a kandahar segunda ciudad de afganist n a 250 millas con un bolso de dinero y nadie le hubiera tocado
9386884 ahora es el gobierno de los ladrones desde 2001 nada ha cambiado salvo que la seguridad es peor
9386885 la polic a sabe que si permanecen en su cuartel y no hacen nada los talibanes los dejan solos y simplemente lanzan los ataques desde el distrito siguiente
9386886 los talibanes les dijeron que no ten an ninguna necesidad de gente as sino solo de eruditos religiosos
9386887 en el 2002 todos se asustaron de las fuerzas de coalici n y pusieron sus esperanzas en el cambio
9386888 los talibanes guardaron un perfil bajo muchos huyeron a pakist n

9386899 well whats one of the democratic partys greatest strengths its appeal to women who make up more than half the electorate as the party that cares about their rights the partys problem of course is that clintons candidacy exposed that for the expedient lie it is since the party establishment allowed the blatant misogyny directed against clinton by the media democratic lawmakers the obama campaign and the rank and file to go unchallenged then when obama was ushered into the nomination by a fishy decision by the dncs rules and bylaws committee that was contrary to the dncs own rules the party establishment finally spoke up albeit weakly but only for so long because there was no time to pay attention to silly things like rooting out misogyny in the party that claims to care about women get in line and vote for the chosen one and keep your mouth shut and dont spoil the optics
9386900 t he practice of arbitrary imprisonments have been in all ages the favorite and most formidable instruments of tyranny
9386901 we are looking at the factors causing delays in the projects and we are addressing these
9386902 we were never in rice shortage as earlier speculated nagkaroon lang tayo ng rice deficit dahil nga sa kakulangan ng rice production we just had rice deficit because of a shortfall in rice production
9386903 the da has also been exerting efforts so that more irrigation infrastructure development could be implemented
9386904 some canals and structures are damaged water cannot be delivered to certain areas because the facilities need rehabilitation
9386905 budgetary constraint is the major concern that hinders the government from maintaining the status of our existing irrigation systems we also have a problem with the collection of irrigation service fees because the farmers here are poor
9386906 if we want to get funding support from the central government we have to tell national officials whats the reality even in our town many farms are rain fed theres no irrigation

9386914 we look forward to hearing how these serious people seriously claim that mccains vp selection is a serious choice and that they support it seriously carl hiaasen has some ideas on how these august rpofer delegates can maintain the seriousness of their convention
9386915 the delegation reflects the cuban american community of florida its military minded voters and the states business interests

9386918 win or lose black delegates and florida democratic party leaders say their national convention proved that the nation not just american politics has changed remarkably in sen
9386919 the myths perpetuated for years in florida by the large private property insurers are collapsing
9386920 now that charlie crist wont be riding shotgun on john mccains presidential campaign floridas left at the altar republican governor faces a critical juncture in crafting his national political resume
9386921 nothing has changed recently in floridas tax structure which punishes businesses by rewarding longtime home ownership though not renters or owners of commercial property
9386922 florida hasnt elected an african american to statewide office since reconstruction
9386923 though state rep geraldine thompson was stunned by what she saw thursday night a black man accepting the nomination for president of the united states the west orlando woman is still uncomfortable with what the ultimate outcome might be
9386924 the denver convention made one thing perfectly clear with a new arena beefed up stadium and performing arts center in downtown orlando theres absolutely no reason orlando shouldnt host such a convention
9386925 labor day used to be a moment to celebrate worker solidarity and the power of the labor movement to secure rising living standards and a fair exchange for ones work but somehow we lost our collective consciousness leaving most of us to stand alone with the bargaining power of a gnat and the economic insecurity to show for it
9386926 if you want to know how all this happened read
9386927 bob hackworth was a political nobody when he beat a respected longtime incumbent for the dunedin city commission in 2002
9386928 i think its absurd that we play that silly game
9386929 it is impossible to build an empire without our fathers aid i believe the sacred writings which say that except the lord build the house they labor in vain that build it psalm 127 1

9386935 dear burt while you always had quite a flair for the dramatic you never had much regard for the truth apparently you cant be bothered to read anything carefully maybe that is why you like oreilly make half your crap up glad to hear you finally got sober
9386936 all you are being asked to do is put your hands up and join others doing the same across the world to celebrate freedom amp great music
9386937 had several hundred singles and only 10p each im off there now
9386938 on average rates are persistently higher in rural parts of the country relative to suburban areas and share similar rates with many central cities
9386939 employment is stronger in new hampshire than in many other parts of the country and that could certainly play a part in the low rates of child poverty
9386940 high employment cited as factor in low n h child poverty rate
9386941 this stupid bitch dont know shit and is a right wing nut
9386942 what do you think of senator mccains vice presidential choice and how does it change the dynamics of this campaign
9386943 well i dont know governor palin i have not met her before i had a brief conversation with her after she was selected to congratulate her and wish her luck but not too much luck on the campaign trial and she seems to have a compelling life story obviously shes a fine mother and a up and coming public servant
9386944 so its too early for me to gauge what kind of running mate shell be
9386945 why didnt she quote that e mail shes had no problem reposting e mails
9386946 he took out the mechanical pencil he always carried in his inside jacket pocket and made his characteristically neat proofreading marks on a sentence that said the book remains as fresh and unique as ever he changed it to read remains unique and as fresh as ever there are no degrees of uniqueness mr shawn said politely
9386947 its a magnificent day today but a lot of our friends down in new orleans where my daughter went to school are battened down for something that may be even more devastating than what happened in katrina
9386948 pray god it wont at mass this morning 7 15 mass i along with a lot of other people prayed for those folks down there so i mean it sincerely
9386949 i hope it doesnt sound corny but say a little prayer
9386950 say a little prayer because these folks have been through you know theyve been through hell and pray god this gustav decides to take a turn or something but it doesnt look real good now
9386951 there is enormous urgency in making sure that people take the evacuation seriously
9386952 it appears that we have made progress and the coordination among state local and federal governments are better than with katrina
9386953 main message is for everybody to follow instructions you must evacuate you cant take a chance if you do not evacuate you put yourself and others in danger
9386954 than a government that sits on its hands while a major american city drowns before our eyes
9386955 i think that with a big storm like this raises bipartisan concerns and i think for john to want to find out what is going on is fine
9386956 the thing that i am always concerned about is in the middle of the storm is whether we are drawing resources away from folks on the ground because the secret service and various security requirements sometimes it pulls police and fire and other departments away from concentrating on the job i am assuming that where mccain went that wasnt an issue and we are going to try to stay clear of the area until things have settled down and then we will probably try to figure out how we can be as helpful as possible
9386957 since weve got a network of volunteers donors all across the country is to try to coordinate with officials to figure out what will be most useful if we can get volunteers if we can get donations where they can be directed
9386958 we probably wont know entirely who needs the most help and what is the best way to do it without getting in peoples way until we actually see what happens over the next 48 hours
9386959 we have to move quickly because the street sweepers start right after the trucks
9386960 we dont want to build a giant factory that the market doesnt need or want
9386961 investors like to know what tax policies apply when they are putting millions of dollars down on a project theres a pretty clear history that these projects are less likely to go forward without a credit
9386962 these companies are shutting down projects firing people and its congresss fault
9386963 as so often in the past national pride was salvaged by those of whom the nation generally feels least proud young working class men from marginalised communities while the horsey set with all their money and self regard were making a show of us yet again the competitors who demonstrated honesty and discipline pride and passion were from the invisible ireland that is represented only in court reports
9386964 cant win a race about the future by being stuck in the past
9386965 financially im kind of scared most of the time because what should happen if my health and my body fail
9386966 we have people who are healthier who are living longer and have more economic reasons to stay in the work force
9386967 on the employer side you have greater demand for experienced older workers that all adds up to longer work lives
9386968 but after i retired before they called me i really didnt have anything to do so when they called i jumped on it
9386969 if theres some project to be done next year when they call ill just go do it
9386970 its always been a good idea but right now it can be an especially good idea
9386971 you really dont want to be pulling more money out of a portfolio thats already down
9386972 to me the ideal would be 70 because you get the biggest social security benefit possible and all those additional years of employment and it keeps you going mentally and physically too
9386973 i feel blessed with the good health that i have but im a little bit bitter because i dont think i should be scared financially at 68
9386974 t he practice of arbitrary imprisonments have been in all ages the favorite and most formidable instruments of tyranny
9386975 falsified the entire thing in order to obtain the identification in a different name other than his true name
9386976 the government has the duty to safeguard the credibility of any sort of identification thats obtained through them he told the paper
9386977 this is a compelling person i want to take a new look at this ticket
9386978 even before mccain picked palin people outside alaska were beginning to notice the young governor with the bright smile
9386979 runnerup in the 1984 miss alaska contest whose good looks spawned a bumper sticker that read coldest state
9386980 it certainly solved his enthusiasm deficit with regard to mr obama i suspect that now the republican base is more united and enthusiastic behind mccain then i suspect the democratic base is behind mr obama
9386981 there is more to the qualification to high executive branch office than experience there is understanding the constitutional principle of limited government and the culture of corruption that inevitably develops in a capitol that abandones limited government that regulates everything and subsidizes everybody she understands that
9386982 t he practice of arbitrary imprisonments have been in all ages the favorite and most formidable instruments of tyranny
9386983 this years winners will join the ranks of 266 outstanding teachers who have been honored by the foundation for the last 24 years
9386984 they automatically become members of the network of outstanding teachers and educators or noted an honor society of outstanding teachers committed to nurturing a culture of excellence and service among educators through professional development publication research and advocacy in active partnership with government and non government organizations
9386985 the search for outstanding teachers represents the foundations commitment to promote a culture of excellence in education by recognizing the countrys best mentors who can be upheld as models not only for educators but for other community members as well
9386986 more than 200 exemplary elementary high school and college teachers from all over the country have so far been awarded since its launching in 1985
9386987 the president together with metro bank and metrobank foundation believe that by recognizing outstanding qualities and contributions of teachers countless other teachers all over the country can be inspired to achieve excellence in the teaching profession
9386988 tenho capacidade de me sair bem ent o n o tenho por que ficar muito nervosa eu estudei e creio que sou boa em reda o
9386989 minha primeira prova s ria infelizmente n o vou fazer o prouni programa universidade para todos porque meu primeiro ano foi escola particular eu vou fazer mais por conhecimento s para ter uma base de como estou
9386990 estou calmo eu n o estudei fa o s para medir meus conhecimentos
9386991 we have not journeyed all this way across the centuries
9386992 i took it apart in 1998 and it took about six years to restore it
9386993 this creates its own qualifications of who should be covered by the tax exemption package consequently redefining who a minimum wage earner is
9386994 the proposed regulations violate a previous supreme court decision which ruled that increased tax exemptions should cover compensation income earned for the entire year
9386995 instead of providing relief the draft regulations impose undue burden on employees and employers alike this is particularly true for the public sector which is already reeling from loads of administrative work
9386996 the tax relief package law is already too little too late workers are already overwhelmed by the high prices of food and fuel we shouldnt be made to wait any longer for the proper implementation of the tax exemptions
9386997 and now of course the insight youre able to capture out on the trail you say its so much like a religious experience for people as they meet him lets see the view that you get look at them with their hands clasped
9386998 i think the npc is bigger than the lp and the kampi is bigger than all of us
9386999 thats why its hard to speculate who we will be running against in 2010
9387000 if this arrangement is tolerated it would certainly spawn the abhorrent practice of contract substitution to the detriment of the filipino workers
9387001 onerous on the rights and privileges of our migrant workers
9387002 the resultant effect of the scheme will only impose an additional burden on the already tortuous recruitment process and costs for our migrant workers
9387003 there is a need to thoroughly review all the other provisions in the new hiring policy in order that we shall be appraised of the whole context of this unified scheme to formulate the basis for our legislative proposal policy or guideline or its ultimate rejection if found as outrightly inimical to the interests of our ofws
9387004 you cannot use state funds to support major political parties because that would be discriminatory to smaller parties unless the charter is amended state funding of major political parties is unconstitutional
9387005 bona fide candidates shall be free from any form of discrimination
9387006 and it is precisely for this reason that section 8 of same article bars or prohibits political parties from being represented before the board of election inspectors and boards of canvassers except to field in their respective watchers
9387007 these parties can avoid being beholden to certain groups and even criminal elements like gambling and drug lords who offer them funds during elections by refusing such offers because they will be getting government funding
9387008 are you sure you can do the edition if youve got the energy you and ava can do the tv piece and thats all you have to worry about
9387009 if id known she was working on that i would have tried to make it a group effort
9387010 people wont vote for then they didnt vote for barack because hes black
9387011 as a lifelong closeted communist who never votes democratic in the presidential election to begin with i would like to endorse barack obama
9387012 were going to go with the biggest story of the day tomorrow
9387013 and right now the biggest story of the day is the storm
9387014 the republican national committee has done a good job at being sensitive to not wanting to throw a party at a time the gulf coast is under siege
9387015 were trying to approach the convention with the same degree of sensitivity
9387016 international rules aimed at preventing the movement of plants and seeds in order to protect them have had unintended consequences
9387017 there are more sites more information than we have ever had
9387018 roam the boondocks see a rare species dig it up and fedex it home avoiding all the inspections along the way
9387019 is that this is a world where some people have a sense of greed a need for personal acquisition
9387020 mexicos cactus diversity attracts the interest of international markets and collectors who employ illegal tactics to obtain wild collected specimens of desirable species some of which may be newly named to science rare or threatened with extinction
9387021 pilgrimage of people of all ages and nationalities who travel thousands of miles to arrive at this sacred site and experience a mystical communion with the magical cactus
9387022 we understand the urgency of the situation because these are after all salvaging equipment to be used for the extraction of chemicals
9387023 workers applying for work abroad should first gain skills and learn techniques on stress management considering the peculiar socio cultural setting in the country they will be working in
9387024 when they leave the country they are psychologically and mentally healthy
9387025 however stress brought about by maltreatment in the workplace subsequently affects their mental condition
9387026 stress is a common thing in life but there are ways of coping with adversity that will help our workers handle problems with employers and adjust to different situations that they may encounter abroad
9387027 because unlike those working in medical centers domestic helpers and caregivers employed in residences are often alone in handling difficult situation
9387028 minha primeira impress o foi tentar entender o fen meno mete rico eleitoral nunca antes visto numa campanha eleitoral como diria o presidente lula normal que ele lacerda crescesse normal que ele ocupasse as primeiras posi es mas o estranho o pouco espa o de tempo
9387029 a alavancagem mete rica de lacerda vai exigir um estudo maior dos cientistas pol ticos porque ele um grande desconhecido na cidade nunca disputou uma campanha proporcional nunca disputou uma campanha majorit ria e consegue ter essa subida mete rica por isso n s vamos quem sabe ter a ajuda dos cientistas para explicar isso
9387030 recebo com naturalidade o resultado desta pesquisa que reflete o que estamos sentindo nas ruas e contatos p blicos a cidade est demonstrando o seu reconhecimento a um trabalho em parceria realizado pelo prefeito pimentel e pelo governador a cio neves a decis o de que melhor para todos continuar o que est dando certo
9387031 i was ordered by my supervisors to keep my mouth shut and say that there never was any party
9387032 my squad would have solved ms greenes murder but for the interference of officials
9387033 the united states has never had democracy and the word never was used in the us constitution bill of rights or the declaration of independence
9387034 at the core of liberalism is the spoiled child miserable as all spoiled children are unsatisfied demanding ill disciplined despotic and useless liberalism is a philosophy of sniveling brats
9387035 a indigna o primeira impactante mas n o podemos complicar ainda mais o contexto n o cabe chamar o presidente da rep blica ao supremo
9387036 n o estou de bombeiro mas n o cabe incendiar
9387037 de in cio eu n o me preocupei demasiadamente porque atribu os fatos a um a odamento no curso de investiga es criminais agora essa preocupa o se tornou mais s ria porque percebi que aquela clandestinidade de escutas telef nicas sinaliza total descontrole por parte dos pr prios escal es superiores de rg os como a pol cia federal e a abin
9387038 no caso ao que parece nem a pr pria abin tem explica es convincentes para epis dios como esse da intercepta o telef nica do presidente do supremo tribunal federal a minha preocupa o tanto maior quando se sabe que a abin n o pol cia judici ria e portanto n o pode fazer investiga o criminal sendo assim nem por ordem judicial ela poderia interceptar comunica es telef nicas

9387054 long has our nation the united states of america kept the forces of chaos at bay
9387055 by the blood of our people are your lands kept safe
9387056 so i have a solution and it will cost not one thin dime
9387057 the next president of the united states should sign an executive order requiring the census bureau to cease and desist from describing any american even illegal aliens as uninsured instead the bureau should categorize people according to the likely source of payment should they need care

9387059 bristol is pregnant in these pictures she is not carrying belly fat which grows outwardly wide and does not become dome shaped thats because fat is generally evenly distributed around the abdomen and a fetus is not bristols chest is sticking out a normal body reaction when sucking in stomach muscles

9387066 protesters here in minneapolis have been targeted by a series of highly intimidating sweeping police raids across the city involving teams of 25 30 officers in riot gear with semi automatic weapons drawn entering homes of those suspected of planning protests handcuffing and forcing them to lay on the floor while law enforcement officers searched the homes seizing computers journals and political pamphlets
9387067 im not sure what she brings to the ticket other than shes a woman and a conservative well shes a better speaker than mccain
9387068 people will say she hasnt been on the national scene long enough but i believe shes a quick study
9387069 plain and simple one of the most unprofessional childish and inexcusable performances ive ever seen from a politician
9387070 shes not prepared to be governor how can she be prepared to be vice president or president
9387071 look at what shes done to this state what would she do to the nation
9387072 t he practice of arbitrary imprisonments have been in all ages the favorite and most formidable instruments of tyranny
9387073 jesus is the truth we believe in him not merely in his words he himself is doctor and doctrine revealer and revelation the illuminator and the light of men he is exalted in every word of truth because he is its sum and substance he sits above the gospel like a prince on his own throne doctrine is most precious when we see it distilling from his lips and embodied in his person sermons and songs are valuable in proportion as they speak of him and point to him a christ less gospel is no gospel and a christ less discourse is the cause of merriment to devils
9387074 i would remind you that extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice
9387075 ok now i come out and say it every weird element of this whole story is cleared up by the assumption that it was the daughter who was pregnant she wasnt sure of the date she conceived and the parents were in the dark about everything until march with that in mind go to the adn story about the birth it all makes sense doesnt it i will say this sarah palin herself looks so trim i can hardly believe she was ever pregnant
9387076 we have just enough religion to make us hate but not enough to make us love one another
9387077 i told congress thanks but no thanks on that bridge to nowhere
9387078 its the sheer power of the brand itself that we have leveraged to get the discount
9387079 agree with the six recommendations and we look forward to implementing them

9387082 carry a good 45 and shoot the killer before he shoots you
9387083 im hoping that itll firm it up and shape it up
9387084 everyone is asking if im worried its going to go away no its going to tone it up i can use that
9387085 today the costume that i tried on wasnt as crazy but the better shape that i get into they will be a little more sexy and risqu
9387086 im starting off with maybe a ball gown something a little bit more elegant and a little bit more covered up
9387087 my toe is hurting me a little bit more than i thought
9387088 we switched to an open toe and we cut off some of the straps to make it a super open toe on one foot so that i can dance
9387089 i do feel the competitive spirit and hes been helping me to feel better by telling me that every female celebrity thats won dancing with the stars their name started with a k kelly monaco and kristi yamaguchi so im a little bit luckier there
9387090 i personally believe that jerious would have won the heisman had he played anywhere other than msu including the southern california community college at los angeles most us americans dont have maps
9387091 the production team has stepped up their game creatively as proven by the strong ratings
9387092 americas got talent has produced the most successful winner in reality television history this is the only show where truly unique and talented performers can achieve their ultimate dream theres nothing like it on television
9387093 is that there are certain limitations on how languages work theres a common core to human language and theres variation one way to find out what the limits are on variation is to examine exotic languages looking for patterns of similarity and difference
9387094 where languages seem at first blush very different from known languages such as european languages or japanese core patterns of human language and grammar are there when you know how to look for them
9387095 whether or not a language survives has nothing to do with language and everything to do with politics and economy
9387096 it almost directly parallels what happened to indigenous communities in the u s
9387097 there was forced assimilation children were beaten for speaking their native language
9387098 when you look carefully at both the decline and the surprising tenacity of itelmen you can begin to discern some factors that work in both directions
9387099 the fate of the language is almost exclusively about politics but it also partly in communities this small comes down to particular individuals and their views
9387100 in a small community the culture can be shaped by the values of an individual who has prestige
9387101 im tired of chasing my dreams im just gonna find out where theyre headed and hook up with them later

9387104 if i lie and say you took me for a friend patched together in my thin bones will you help me be cunning and noisy as the wind

9387106 i got no alibis cant even tell my usual lies
9387107 excellency its a natural lie to tell i beg you stop this now
9387108 i might come to the end of my life and find out everyone was lying
9387109 so we cheated and we lied and we tested and we never failed to fail it was the easiest thing to do

9387123 lords of chaos the bloody rise of norwegian black metal
9387124 youve spent a lot of time studying economic models you probably have an opinion about their overall reliability
9387125 i dont know yall it really is a tough one
9387126 periodically the two parties get together and do something that is both stupid and evil this is called bipartisanship
9387127 i personally like that lowe made a statement with ben mccaulley lets start now
9387128 there is of course cause for concern and even alarm
9387129 will we simply have to read blogs to be informed about non hollywood cinema
9387130 technology is leaving behind much that we are fond of
9387131 i personally believe that movies are a 20th century art form and theyre basically over
9387132 theres currently no money in it but its much better to gore the ox than to hold the ox thats being gored
9387133 we make music and were good at it but we get what we deserve really which is harry potter
9387134 paul youre killing me man i think the danger here is absolutism on any of these issues i actually think distribution is more exciting now than its ever been you have so many models
9387135 i can tell you it was really tough before video to play these movies theatrically mark gill said we have to work hard but if any of us worked any harder our brains would fall out now film criticism is in a great crisis i think the internet has really hurt film criticism because a blogger with no expertise is given as much weight as someone with enormous expertise
9387136 i wish there was a way on the internet to find a site with great credibility
9387137 what im praying for is that someone puts together an indie film portal that puts everything in one community and it will happen
9387138 i suddenly realized there was an advantage to doing it online we could embed a film clip i am starting to realize that there are good ways we can do this
9387139 this is a part time job that requires full time work
9387140 there are years that ask questions and years that answer
9387141 starring a nineteen year old japanese school girl of the same name who has somehow become lost in a world of mutated salt water and fresh water creatures
9387142 the report targets sudan and its religious and traditional values which are based on the respect of human rights
9387143 this organisation and those behind her are trying to exert pressure on sudan to abandon its islamic orientation and its civilised project
9387144 n a report prepared by the u s senate foreign relations committee last december it was alleged that eritrean government was providing direct assistance to sri lankas separatist tamil tiger rebels eritrea has been singled out by the international community the united nations and other international rights organizations as blatant violator of human rights keeping a large number of prisoners of conscience in jails for prolonged periods its intolerance to dissent disregard for rule of law and giving military assistance to many insurgent terrorist groups around the world
9387145 when sri lanka is currently waging a global diplomatic defensive campaign to clear her name it is unimaginable as to what motivated her to establish diplomatic ties with eritrea which has no elected democratic government for the past one an half decades no rule of law and respect for human rights accused of providing military assistance to insurgents and terrorists in other countries no constitutional guarantees for the 3 5 million citizens and utter disregard for dissent and free speech with thousands of prisoners of conscience languishing in jails
9387146 aging is really counted as how many times our stem cells have had to divide
9387147 well wait a minute epigenetic damage can also cause cancer
9387148 the idea of epigenetic therapy is to stay away from killing the cell
9387149 hey youre a human cell you shouldnt be behaving this way
9387150 our most recent results which are based on treatment of over 100 patients are very encouraging
9387151 we may be seeing the first woman president as a democrat i am reeling
9387152 that was the best political speech i have ever seen delivered by an american woman politician palin is as tough as nails
9387153 my favorite moment in todays race was coming back through disneys california adventure and seeing mrs incredible and sully cheering us on
9387154 i had to make my way through all the other runners
9387155 but it was a great race with so many people out there cheering us on that really made it special
9387156 stock prices have reached what looks like a permanently high plateau
9387157 to sit and worry about inflation expectations and what is going to happen to those rather than worry about the fact that the economy is going to go into a recession seems to be misguided
9387158 the way to get out of it is to act sitting by doing nothing is not going to get us out of this and hoping that a knight in shining armour will come and lift us out of this is optimistic in the extreme
9387159 look there is the hottest governor in the united states
9387160 this funding is not being ring fenced in this financial year but is currently being paid through the area based grant this gives local authorities flexibility about how they used their resources
9387161 the communities secretary will be reviewing these arrangements at the end of the financial year 2008 09 and will consider at that point whether there are exceptional circumstances which would merit ring fencing
9387162 defend their homes and communities against violent individuals and the drug culture
9387163 you wanted to end americas liberty so they gave you death
9387164 this is why i allowed the government provide for the common defense
9387165 were going to suspend most of our activities tomorrow except those that are absolutely necessary
9387166 its time to open our hearts our efforts our wallets to those americans who are now under the shadow and probability of a natural disaster
9387167 i pledge that tomorrow night and if necessary throughout our convention we will act as americans and not as republicans because america needs us now no matter what we are republican or democratic america needs us to do what all americans have always done in times of disaster and challenge
9387168 the ensuing events have seriously exacerbated the international situation their direct aftermath will be the speedy strengthening by the north atlantic bloc of its military and political positions and all this will be happening in the first place in the vicinity of our state border
9387169 the visits to the election commissions showed that the organisational readiness is high and that the commissions are supplied with necessary equipment and normative documents for the elections
9387170 the performance of the state standardisation committee should be stepped up for this goal we removed the energy effectiveness committee from the energy ministry and made the committee accountable to the state standardisation committee
9387171 no way she said last week explaining in broken english her refusal to return to belarus
9387172 basically he said this is the only option to return and she said no her host mother debra zapata said we are backing tanya in whatever decision she wants to make there were offers and the answers were no
9387173 deputy assistant secretary merkel made clear that the conduct of parliamentary elections september 28th will be important in this regard
9387174 merkel emphasized our interest in returning to normal staffing in belarus which the belarusian authorities reduced to only five american positions this spring
9387175 this is belarus sovereign right to recognize or not recognize independence but we count on belarus as one of our closest allies on this matter
9387176 we do not rule out the possibility of this scenario
9387177 its hard for me to say whether they held consultations on independence recognition
9387178 our western partners have already determined this election as a main figure of merit a litmus test in the relations of belarus with the us and the west
9387179 all minister present here especially officers of militia state secretariat of the security council minister will be involved in this process directly militia must provide public security the state secretariat must coordinate actions of law enforcement bodies
9387180 the us and the eu dont make steps towards the willingness of belarus to normalise the relations with the west
9387181 in response to a sincere wish of belarus to normalise the relations with the west and the united states to our concrete steps nor european union neither us dont hurry to take adequate measures
9387182 russia does not want confrontation with any country russia does not plan to isolate itself
9387183 everyone should understand that if someone launches an aggressive sortie he will receive a response
9387184 in the light of russian actions the eu should review root and branch our relationship with russia
9387185 thus europe would only be hurting itself if we were to get full of emotion and slam all the doors shut to the rooms that we will want to enter afterwards
9387186 whatever people say right is on our side we conducted ourselves absolutely morally and in line with international law
9387187 the leaders discussed the importance of supporting georgias territorial integrity and the need for russia to comply with all elements of the ceasefire agreement and withdraw its troops from georgia
9387188 the west took russia in as a member of the g8 grouping of the most important democratic industrial nations even though it fulfilled neither the economic nor the political requirements
9387189 thus these nations should meet in the old g7 format as long as russia is not prepared to find a solution under the framework of the united nations
9387190 i submitted a proposal to finish the new agreement by september russia needs to invite ukraine to the table to consider this agreement
9387191 earlier we received information that yuliya timoshenko was acting on behalf of the russian party this information has been confirmed unfortunately there is no road back now her stance on the south ossetian conflict is a result of these maneuverings
9387192 timoshenko is a politician with a masculine brain money and power are more important for her than anything else having said that she has wisely chosen the image of a village school teacher this creates a closeness with the ukrainian voter but essentially timoshenko is a pragmatic cosmopolitan who entered politics from business and regardless of how hard her image makers try at the end of the day this pragmatic businesswoman always shows through she has the face of a fox timoshenko takes the same types of risks that male politicians do and makes sharp decisions if she was a bit more flexible like most women she would have far more success however she is still more flexible and brighter than yushchenko she knows that saakashvilis military march is just one event at the end of the day and she is staying clear of the fight dominated by males this is where her gender gives her the upper hand she could well become ukraines next president if things go her way
9387193 if timoshenko is a leader and self sufficient politician then rice is the grey eminence an adviser who can always protect herself with her boss opinion
9387194 timoshenko also has a feminine image shes sexy and seductive she wears open tight dresses and never wears long pants she has a sexy slow voice but rice is just a man in a skirt rumors say shes bisexual
9387195 one paper recently reported that rice had demostratively tucked her jacket into the waistline of her pants during a press conference with russian foreign minister sergey lavrov
9387196 those who will not sign will not be able to referee end of story
9387197 she is in a unique situation unlike the other members of the program due to her family situation
9387198 because of its focus on female empowerment young women are attracted by wicca popularized by the tv series buffy the vampire slayer in short women are abandoning the church
9387199 fluoride ionic liquid as a novel super efficient solvent can lead to high quality single crystals of technologically important materials the molecules in red white blue and gray are the explosive tatb the green balls fluoride anions and the gray and blue sticks cations act as the solvent the rocks in the background are tatb crystals
9387200 most explosives belong to a general class of materials called molecular crystals which have become important building blocks in a number of other applications ranging from drugs pigments agrochemicals dyes and optoelectronics many of these materials including tatb are bound together by a strong network of hydrogen bonds this extended network often makes these materials nearly insoluble in common organic solvents leading to poor quality and limited size crystals which in turn hinders progress in many technological applications
9387201 for a suitable alternative which happened to be ionic liquids a special type of molten salt that becomes liquid under the boiling point of water 100 degrees celsius
9387202 to narrow the choices down amitesh maiti used state of the art quantum mechanical simulations to identify a special class of ionic liquids containing fluoride anions that are highly effective in dissolving hydrogen bonded materials such as tatb
9387203 the solvents and the dissolution process developed by the tmi team have applications in other fields as well such as the production of polymers plastics or molecular solids pharmaceuticals paints propellants explosives for instance the team found that fluoride ionic liquids are highly effective in dissolving cellulose plant fiber a versatile bio renewable polymeric material with many applications
9387204 materials with a high degree of inter and intra molecular hydrogen bonding generally have limited solubility in conventional organic solvents this presents a problem for the dissolution manipulation and purification of these materials using a state of the art density functional theory based quantum chemical solvation model we systematically evaluated solvents for a known hydrogen bonded molecular crystal this coupled with direct solubility measurements uncovered a class of ionic liquids involving fluoride anions that possess more than two orders of magnitude higher solvation power as compared with the best conventional solvents
9387205 possible chemical modifications notwithstanding the ultimate goal of our project was to generate high quality crystals from the solution
9387206 when you point your finger never forget that there are three fingers pointing back at you
9387207 with our new law these people who are here illegally should be afraid of living anywhere in virginia right now
9387208 if youre here illegally its not any scarier to live in prince william than in any other county
9387209 wed like to detain everyone but that is a fantasy world
9387210 we are not agents of the ice we are a local branch of government
9387211 i mean in essence what is happening is these 287 g localities are taking on the responsibility of ice doing its job and these localities are paying for it
9387212 it may be that 287 g is moot for us
9387213 one of the reasons we applied was to expedite identifying and processing illegal immigrants but if were going to end up with the very same results just by reporting under the new law and having ice do the work obviously there would be no reason to participate
9387214 based on our interaction with ice i am pretty confident that our program is more intensive than what will evolve in those other jurisdictions
9387215 some of those people may not have been illegal aliens but this stat shows you they do not have the resources
9387216 whether ice comes and gets them and ultimately deports them is a matter that is beyond our control
9387217 were spending resources to provide this information to ice and we need to know what the results are
9387218 is this your dog would you mind holding it on your lap so that i may sit down
9387219 oh you americans you are so rude fluffy is in that seat and i see no reason why she should give up her comfort for you
9387220 the people who make the laws that affect the trucking industry dont actually have to live them

9387418 labor day used to be a moment to celebrate worker solidarity and the power of the labor movement to secure rising living standards and a fair exchange for ones work but somehow we lost our collective consciousness leaving most of us to stand alone with the bargaining power of a gnat and the economic insecurity to show for it
9387419 if you want to know how all this happened read
9387420 nationwide private employers have become stingier with health plans trimming benefits and shifting premium costs to workers
9387421 whether local governments can afford these lucrative retirement plans for deputies and police and firefighters at a time when private companies are shedding pension plans is a reasonable public policy question
9387422 note is one to suppose that the st pete times editorial board thinks public employers should also be
9387423 wondering where all those skyrocketing property taxes have gone one major drain the tony retirement pensions of the states police and firefighters
9387424 its time to shake things up and i think people whove spent their whole careers managing business units and hitting their numbers tend to play it too safe
9387425 we have a lot of customers along the gulf coast and we want to show them some respect
9387426 our flight attendants have logged hundreds of thousands of miles on the largest aircraft in the sky while keeping passengers comfortable and safe
9387427 customer surveys tell us having a woman on the flight deck makes passengers feel good about flying
9387428 it was created with the belief that bloggers should have one day dedicated to getting to know other bloggers from other countries and areas of interest
9387429 the fox knows many things but the hedgehog knows one big thing
9387430 he has been held hostage before under very difficult circumstances so let us not keep him hostage here in the senate
9387431 one of our jobs as elected officials is to help constituents in a proper fashion acc american continental corporation is a big employer and important to the local economy i wouldnt want any special favors for them i dont want any part of our conversation to be improper
9387432 i remain very upset that what they did caused such damage
9387433 the appearance of it was wrong its a wrong appearance when a group of senators appear in a meeting with a group of regulators because it conveys the impression of undue and improper influence and it was the wrong thing to do
9387434 those of us who grew up in middle class neighborhoods like scranton and wilmington delaware
9387435 sen joseph r biden accepted the vice presidential nomination of the democratic party with a speech that harkened back to his working class roots in scranton
9387436 i woke up and my e mail was just going crazy
9387437 and then when it was announced it was like you couldnt breathe
9387438 it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster
9387439 so were monitoring it from day to day and im saying a few prayers too
9387440 im afraid chris that we may have to look at that situation and well try to monitor it ive been talking to govs jindal barbour riley chris ive been talking to all of them
9387441 like all americans our prayers are with those who will be affected by hurricane gustav we continue to closely monitor the movement of the storm and are considering necessary contingencies
9387442 we are in communication with the gulf state governors to make sure the convention is taking all the appropriate steps as the hurricane progresses the safety of our affected delegations is our first priority and preparing for gustav comes before anything else
9387443 the vp would wave her hand as if she were in a beauty competition and the young girls would cheer on the president while doing intricate routines
9387444 darling son theres no where else id want you to be
9387445 dov khenin wants you at the ballot on 11 11
9387446 the welcoming committee is a criminal enterprise made up of 35 anarchists who are intent on committing criminal acts before and during the republican national convention
9387447 these acts include tactics to blockade and disable delegate buses breaching venue security and injuring police officers they have recruited assistance in their criminal conspiracy from other anarchists groups throughout the country through their plans and actions they have exhibited a blatant disregard for the law and the safety of others
9387448 will suspend all activities except those that are absolutely necessary
9387449 we hope to resume some normal activities but frankly that is the hands of god
9387450 we are deeply concerned about the safety and welfare of the residents of the gulf state region our top priority is to assist those who will be affected by hurricane gustav this is not a time for politics or celebration it is a time for us to come together as americans and assist the residents of the gulf states
9387451 in order for the republican party to officially exist and for senator mccain to qualify for the ballot we are by law required to conduct specific official business at this point our program on monday has been scaled back and will only include what party rules governing the nomination of our candidates for president and vice president require we will perform the official business as required in addition we have set aside time to make delegates and americans watching our proceedings at home aware of what they can do to assist in relief efforts designed to help those who will be affected by hurricane gustav
9387452 were gonna make sure that equal pay for equal work is a reality in this country
9387453 you know john mccains new vp nominee seems like a very engaging person a nice person but ive got to say shes opposed like john mccain is to equal pay for equal work that doesnt make much sense to me
9387454 sen mccain has a clear record of opposing equal pay and as his running mate gov palin is tasked with promoting his agenda

9387474 other evils there are that may come yet it is not our part to master all the tides of the world but to do what is in us for the succor of those years wherein we are set uprooting the evil in the fields that we know so that those who live after may have clean earth to till what weather they shall have is not ours to rule
9387475 with the choice of governor palin its now the third term of dick cheney because what hes done is hes chosen somebody who actually doesnt believe that climate change is manmade
9387476 a changing environment will affect alaska more than any other state because of our location
9387477 im not one though who would attribute it to being man made
9387478 people never used to think that women were able business women or able business managers
9387479 we have proved that women can be and perhaps can even do it better then men
9387480 we know that when our baskets are going abroad it makes visitors want to come to rwanda and through that we can have a new relationship with the world outside
9387481 gahaya links has helped open our minds and develop our ideas but if we can be paid more it would be better
9387482 because of the baskets we are meeting many new buyers who come to visit and see what we can do
9387483 one of the things that weaving has been able to bring to women is economic security in terms of income but also providing some kind of social support network among themselves
9387484 our challenge is how to bring hope back to the hopeless women in the world and i think we can only do that if we give them economic security
9387485 the genocide caused many problems and we werent left with a good relationship
9387486 agaseke baskets have allowed us to come together and work for money so that we can help each other instead of hating each other or remembering the past
9387487 other evils there are that may come yet it is not our part to master all the tides of the world but to do what is in us for the succor of those years wherein we are set uprooting the evil in the fields that we know so that those who live after may have clean earth to till what weather they shall have is not ours to rule
9387488 youre talking about processes which are so slow that within the scope of a human lifetime theyre indistinguishable from stop
9387489 we became aware of the trickery the abuse from the company
9387490 the agreement signed with the mining company is illegal because it was not studied and was not voted on by the community assembly and furthermore it is unequal it doesnt have even the minimal principle of equality
9387491 will not fall into violence but we will not give up until we achieve real benefits from minefinders because we know it is going to see heavy profits
9387492 what they are offering proves the close mindedness of the company we have to take into account that they will be here for many years and we want good neighbourly relations and benefits that are equitable for all
9387493 mr chairman the great and glorious state of globule gulch home of more than 50 hotdog stands per square mile and the most beautiful women on earth the place where george washington once slept and where cows peacefully graze on our healthy grass proudly casts it 85 votes for its favorite son governor lushpuppy billings
9387494 do not go gentle into that good night blog blog against the dying of the light
9387495 the right is nothing if not filled with liars and hypocrites
9387496 in the aftermath of senator john mccains announcement of choosing alaskan governor sarah palin as his vice presidential running mate there is one argument as to why palin was a poor choice that really sticks out for me that argument is that she does not support womens so called right to choose and therefore she will not appeal to women voters and especially not democratic female voters that argument is flawed surely if palin is against abortion shes not the only woman in the country to have that belief there are many other women in this country that are very strongly pro life furthermore the insinuation that all women who identify with the democratic party are automatically pro choice is also a dangerous assumption to make have we forgotten about the catholic vote or even though those who believe that it is up to god to choose who lives or dies as much as the gop likes to portray them at times all democrats liberals and progressives are not godless heathens just as all religious people are not republicans
9387497 mccain has polled at about 12 of crossover voters from the democratic party earlier this month if he is able to increase this number with women who may still be upset by hillary clintons treatment by the media in the primary season he may be able pull out this election another factor that may give the democrats nightmares is the fact that ralph nader has been polling as high as 8 in some critical swing states anti war voters seeking to end the iraq war and are not pleased with the democratic partys inaction on the topic they pledged to fix in the 2006 congressional election could be a horrible combination for the dems will dems not happy with the obama biden ticket cross the party line will palin swing the all important middle american suburban vote the gops way by selecting a female running mate mccain may have taken more votes that obama biden had been counting on as they have dominated the polls with the support of females before palin was added to the mix it will be interesting to see how the candidates fare in the next set of polling with palin having been added to the gop ticket even if mccain palin can gather 10 to 15 of what hillary clinton pulled in the primary especially in swing states that are high populations of social conservatives like michigan ohio and pennsylvania the democrats may have a major problem on their hands come november
9387498 the right is nothing if not filled with liars and hypocrites
9387499 for years i chose not to engage in party politics at this time however changing that posture feels like the responsible thing to do
9387500 after 9 11 nobody wanted to hear anything bad about america
9387501 nobody loves a war better than the president and a few years ago it got to the point where if i said anything i truly believed about the iraq war or global warming during a concert people would get up and leave thats fine with me actually its a badge of honour
9387502 little by little it became clear that bush was bizarre and dangerous
9387503 i would do concerts where i would see people in the audience sitting with their arms crossed looking angry as i said i was right 40 years ago and i am right now and throw my fist in the air now theyre listening bushs great trick is to suggest that to go against him is to be unpatriotic slowly people realised that
9387504 they laughed all the time and told racist jokes about themselves and i realised that nobody could see that side of them they had to be seen as serious and i related to that we got to a restaurant and i asked them dont you have a big march to organise they said we just have you get a public image that you have to live up to but your private reality is often very different
9387505 the right is nothing if not filled with liars and hypocrites
9387506 like everyone else john mccains pick of alaska governor sarah palin as his running mate was a complete surprise personally i was hoping for long shot former pennsylvania governor tom ridge as his running mate but his pro choice stance on abortion might have been a nonstarter for the base of course palin presents some risks shes only been governor for less than two years of a small population state people will wonder if she would be ready to be president should mccain die in office she is also a social conservative that will be red meat for the democrats that said palin maybe the smartest move by mccain why because palin could send a signal that a mccain administration would not be the third term of president bush but a new page for the gop palin has styled herself as a reformer a fellow maverick that has shaken up the political establishment in the 49th state taking aim at the politics of corruption yes she is a social conservative which will please the base but her emphasis has been on reform which just might attract independents and moderates
9387507 lets face it the president and republicans in congress have not done a whole lot to burnish the gop brand mccain has to break with the past and chart a new course for the party picking a ridge or pawlenty or romney would not have shown that he is serious in changing the party picking palin though risky does show that he is mccain has received flak for appeasing the right too much and i think there is a lot to that charge he is caught between having to keep a base and reaching out to the middle mccain is at his best in reaching out that reform minded middle and palin might just do that while keeping the base happy as well is the maverick back maybe just maybe
9387508 i think simons link nails it the anti sen barbara boxer she seems to be making the gop base pretty happy of course she is i think competent she reminds me of a niece in georgia smart but not wanting to be seen that way in a the conservative culture she lives in only time on the trail will show if shes up to the top job if mccain dies you do have to worry about the vetting job if the best he could do was somebody in troopergate iii more liberal people and people living in more liberal cities have different expectations of womens self presentation i can see on blogs shes mostly alienating the democratic women i think mccain and many republicans hope to attract
9387509 i personally am as unpersuaded by the inexperience argument as im unpersuaded by the arguments against obama but there are plenty who disagree with me and the obama campaign is using it as a counterweight accusation to what nccain started its clear that you need to be ready to finish what other people start if you want to be president mccain with this pick is leaving himself way open to this no question
9387510 palin is a flip flopper including on her favorite reform issue of earmarks she was apparently for the bridge to nowhere before she was against it but of course obama and bidenve had their flip flop esque moments on important issues as well they all seem like amateurs to me compared to mccain whos gotten so different from 2000 that i rather thought there was alot to a dean remark that the mccain of 2000 wouldntve voted for todays mccain of course this will also alienate plenty of centrists because if mccain wins and dies during his term we get a boxer like president or for my worry box a er president palin creationism and all

9387524 we may be seeing the first woman president as a democrat i am reeling

9387527 as a result of this shortfall fy 2009 base revenues will now have to grow by 6 1 to meet the enacted revenue level of 9 98 billion given the fy 2008 experience and current economic conditions 6 1 growth seems highly unlikely we will need several months of revenue data however before attempting to forecast a revision in fy 2009 revenues a finance advisory committee meeting is currently planned for october 15th and will assist in that process
9387528 ramsey county police raided several homes occupied by people here to protest at the minneapolis republican national convention its believed that these were associated with another raid conducted last night and the target were individuals associated with a group called the rnc welcoming committee

9387530 we can no longer live we cant be safe anywhere
9387531 i hope those in government do their jobs otherwise they should resign
9387532 we ask authorities with all our heart to be more sensitive
9387533 the most frustrating thing has been the indolence of many of the authorities their insensitivity
9387534 get out of town this is not the one to play with
9387535 its been following us all over cuba ruining our vacation
9387536 they have closed everything hotels restaurants bars museums theres not much to do but wait
9387537 we cant accept the world order where all decisions are made by one nation even by such serious and authoritative nation as the united states such a world would be unstable and prone to conflicts
9387538 russia doesnt want to engage in confrontation with anyone russia doesnt want to isolate itself
9387539 the partnership should not be the kind between the horseman and the horse but of two equal individuals
9387540 send russia a clear united message that her aggression will not be rewarded
9387541 when africa dried to grassy plains groups of animals would stay close to their local source of water and groups would have become separated by large distances across the plains we believe this separation played a key role in the evolution of many of the species we recognise today
9387542 modern day climate change could break up water networks like it did millions of years ago
9387543 this is a time when we have to do away with party politics and act as americans
9387544 i will take off my republican hat and put on my american hat were going to suspend most of our activities except those that are absolutely necessary i hope and pray we will be able to resume some of our normal operations as quickly as possible
9387545 had the bush administration not let this city new orleans drown essentially we wouldnt be talking about it
9387546 the right is nothing if not filled with liars and hypocrites
9387547 needs must and it would be a minor evil remember money is short and venice is falling apart
9387548 nothing has been agreed formally but there is a way round the bylaws which would allow us to install the advertising screens which would allow the possibility of raising much needed money to pay for restoration the subject material of the advertising on the screens would be carefully considered and proposals would be submitted and then considered before being given the go ahead we cant have just anything promoted on st marks square
9387549 it is not a question of deciding whether the screens are ugly or beautiful but to recognise the fact that they are needed even in st marks square
9387550 given the reluctance at virtually all levels to openly engage with the unprecedented scale of both current emissions and their associated growth rates even an optimistic interpretation of the current framing of climate change implies that stabilisation much below 650ppm is improbable
9387551 we are certainly not on track for a two degree temperature increase at the moment we are much more on track for a three to four degree temperature increase and we need to be thinking about what that actually means
9387552 the big systems of the world start to go wrong when you get beyond two degrees
9387553 certainly if theres not a good result at copenhagen the two degree target will look impossible
9387554 theres 18 months of optimism to hold on to if by copenhagen it hasnt been addressed then it will look very bleak indeed

9387558 you have a choice be a fighting liberal or sit quietly i know what i am what are you
9387559 there is very little doubt that we have to go from a party event to the call to the nation for action action to help our fellow citizens in this time of tragedy and disaster action in the form of volunteering donations reaching out our hands and our hearts and our wallets to the people who are under such great threat from this great natural disaster
9387560 theres clearly a mood for aggressive oversight on this issue because people are demanding it its a national catastrophe i dont know if it affects the general mood of congress on every issue but theres a strong desire to find out what went wrong and what went right
9387561 american citizens have proven time and again how generous and selfless a people we are and now we have an opportunity to come to the aid of those in need

9387568 why am i the first kinnock in a thousand generations to be able to get to university why is my wife glenys the first woman in her family in a thousand generations to be able to get to university was it because all our predecessors were thick
9387569 those people who could sing and play and recite and write poetry those people who could make wonderful beautiful things with their hands those people who could dream dreams see visions why didnt they get it was it because they were weak those people who could work eight hours underground and then come up and play football weak
9387570 i started thinking as i was coming over here why is it that joe biden is the first in his family ever to go to a university why is it that my wife who is sitting out there in the audience is the first in her family to ever go to college is it because our fathers and mothers were not bright
9387571 do i want to have a beer with the guy
9387572 i think that i have a lifetime of experience that i will bring to the white house i know senator mccain has a lifetime of experience to the white house and senator obama has a speech he gave in 2002
9387573 and asking for other peoples help to hold it up and to help me pass out some simple flyers detailing our demand for a congressional investigation of 9 11 and the questions we raised
9387574 a silent but all reaching coup is taking place within the united states this coup is not being directed by bomb laden muslim terrorists nor will it ever be covered by the mainstream media the seditious act is being carried out by our very own elected officials with president bush leading the insurrection

9387587 yet critics can easily point to distinctive traditions of french italian and british film alongside hollywood and japanese movies which has no equivalent in video games why do you think this is does it bother you
9387588 i thank michelin and honda for their understanding and for agreeing to my personal demands
9387589 i am very conscious of the fact that i have made some excessively negative comments about michelin tyres even though michelin helped me make an exceptional start to the season
9387590 i think all in all im really happy ive been serving well for the first three rounds and thats always a good sign for the rest of the tournament
9387591 i dont try to impress anybody in the early rounds if it happens thats great i dont really care that much
9387592 do you know this checkpoint will take you to amallah
9387593 i think the morale in the team might be a bit lower for picking poulter ahead of darren clarke
9387594 i felt there was a dead certainty for it to be darren clarke and paul casey
9387595 im surprised ian poulter didnt come back and fight for his place
9387596 there will be a few players today thinking nick i think youve made a mistake
9387597 i dont think ian poulter will let the team down but he poulter didnt turn up to the last event and darrens the form guy ian poulter has missed the last two cuts
9387598 darren clarke has won two tournaments on the european tour this year he won a tournament two weeks ago in a very strong field on a tough course
9387599 hes got a great ryder cup record in the past hes played well with lee westwood and sergio garcia
9387600 i dont want to pull the team down nicks his own man i just had a sneaking feeling at the back of my mind that nick faldo would do something different
9387601 he faldo is slightly controversial and hes lived up to it
9387602 i have now won three races in a row it is incredible it was another great battle with stoner we know that stoner is very fast
9387603 we have a great advantage and we are one race closer to the title last year in these three races i took nine points this year 75
9387604 to win my 68th race in my hometown is incredible i saw giacomo agostini before the race and he was laughing so i said to him i would try to win today
9387605 i am enjoying the challenge it is great to be back in the top six fifth would have been amazing but we can push on from here
9387606 i think morale in the team could be a bit lower for picking poulter ahead of darren clarke
9387607 he will think about that decision for a long time
9387608 he was absolutely totally relieved it was the first time i havent heard poulter if you know what i mean he was speechless
9387609 18 ryder cups between between us 18 ryder cups between between us
9387610 nick faldo is his own man always has been always will be and certainly was in selecting ian poulter for a wildcard pick recent results past ryder cup performances the opinions of leading players in this team and a past
9387611 padraig harringtons successful defence of the open capped a riveting and at times tempestuous championship at royal birkdale all the talk in the build up was about the absence of tiger woods through injury and if i am honest he was

9387613 we have to be wary of them because we remember their quality when they beat us 2 0 at their place
9387614 we respect cork but we have to go for it and try to get the points we need to qualify for the semi finals
9387615 hes a big tall left sided defender who will bring physical attributes to our team due to his sheer size
9387616 if i improve my returns my chances against wawrinka are good
9387617 i was in danger in both matches but i felt like melzer was playing so well that it was going to be really tough for me to get back into the match
9387618 gasquet was obviously playing great too but i still felt like i had a shot of getting back in there and i had known in the past that he had struggled to close big matches out and in five set matches so that made it a little bit easier than the match against melzer
9387619 im not that good of a player that i can just blitz guys but i said it was going to be a difficult match melzers very talented so i was delighted to come through it
9387620 im going to give it my best shot and try to win local amp nations
9387621 he has built a coaching team around him with paul moriarty joined by john muggleton
9387622 brad harrington and ryan campbell have come in on the conditioning side to complement what nigel wants to do
9387623 i think all in all im really happy ive been serving well for the first three rounds and thats always a good sign for the rest of the tournament
9387624 i dont try to impress anybody in the early rounds if it happens thats great i dont really care that much
9387625 these 30 odd hours or more will be me concentrating on what happened in the second half
9387626 they had one bit of brilliance and we had two bad mistakes so put that together and you get the result
9387627 i thought the game was terrific in the first half
9387628 it was end to end but i thought we were alright and playing some good stuff
9387629 we were quite comfortable and i didnt see that coming in the second half
9387630 the passing of the ball was half decent by both sides but its all about brilliance which is what mendes did
9387631 i took a bit more control in the second and cruised through in the third so i am really pleased
9387632 it the number one ranking is a goal but i want to win a grand slam
9387633 of course by winning a grand slam i will regain the number one ranking and that is something i want really bad i will try my best to achieve that
9387634 in the first week we face the last three champions leinster ospreys and ulster
9387635 its the toughest start leinster did the deserved double on us last season
9387636 its a very tough one first up i havent won too many times at the arms park dai young has done such a good job there
9387637 theres a bit of added pressure on us as champions but we just have to make sure that we perform to our own expectations
9387638 its great that weve been there fighting to the end for the last two years but you get nothing for finishing second
9387639 we want to go one step further thats a nice sort of pressure to have and it shows how far weve come over the last couple of years
9387640 this is the best squad that ive had to deal with over the last five seasons weve improved every year since the blues came into existence
9387641 theres nobody in for him so hes staying here and well continue to use our strikers
9387642 it used to be a feature of play in the game a battle between the centre forward and centre half
9387643 it was two players committed to winning the ball its a shame it ends up with a decision like that
9387644 he is certainly making a difference in the way we play football overall
9387645 to come here today and play like we played and the fantastic win we had i think it was a joy for everyone especially for our supporters who deserved that
9387646 it was a fantastic atmosphere in a derby when youre winning the best bit is when the stadium goes quiet
9387647 its a long season weve had a tough start but were pleased what weve achieved until now
9387648 i think the morale in the team might be a bit lower for picking poulter ahead of darren clarke
9387649 i felt there was a dead certainty for it to be darren clarke and paul casey
9387650 im surprised ian poulter didnt come back and fight for his place
9387651 there will be a few players today thinking nick i think youve made a mistake
9387652 i dont think ian poulter will let the team down but he poulter didnt turn up to the last event and darrens the form guy ian poulter has missed the last two cuts
9387653 darren clarke has won two tournaments on the european tour this year he won a tournament two weeks ago in a very strong field on a tough course
9387654 hes got a great ryder cup record in the past hes played well with lee westwood and sergio garcia
9387655 i dont want to pull the team down nicks his own man i just had a sneaking feeling at the back of my mind that nick faldo would do something different
9387656 he faldo is slightly controversial and hes lived up to it
9387657 that was impressive that was the fed i knew from 05 06 can he keep it up though if he can the rest of the locker room will be getting restless including rafa
9387658 i want to see a federer vs murray final so much id be totally neutral and id sit back to see which one was clever enough to pull it out in 5
9387659 is anyone thinking this may be tricky for roger i have a feeling for a big upset today hope its not though as i am still hoping for another rafa roger final
9387660 it will only get better from here im really happy to be playing well and everybodys cheering me on so its a nice feeling
9387661 didnt see second half cause 3 year old son was wanting to see cbbeeies
9387662 we must redirect our efforts from the really celebratory event of the nomination of president and vice president of our party to acting as all americans
9387663 that was the best political speech i have ever seen delivered by an american woman politician palin is as tough as nails
9387664 that was the best political speech i have ever seen delivered by an american woman politician palin is as tough as nails
9387665 i was raised in a family where gender was not going to be an issue
9387666 the girls did what the boys did apparently in alaska thats quite commonplace
9387667 we have to be wary of them because we remember their quality when they beat us 2 0 at their place
9387668 we respect cork but we have to go for it and try to get the points we need to qualify for the semi finals
9387669 even when we were beaten by down i believed we had good enough players to have a fighting chance of getting to the final
9387670 it is great to be there it has been a struggle since 2005 but was have clawed our way back
9387671 i do not think it was a matter of us taking our foot off the pedal
9387672 i think we have to give a lot of credit to wexford because they did not lie down
9387673 they are maybe a better footballing side than they have been credit for
9387674 everybody expected from day one that kerry would be in the final nobody knew who would be there to meet them
9387675 i played ok in patches and i was decent in patches
9387676 i got on top of dave after the first frame but the first four frames tonight i wasnt there
9387677 i wanted to blow away a few cobwebs at this tournament but to win it is a nice bonus
9387678 i started well won the first frame and then i could have won the second frame
9387679 ronnies a class player he punishes you every time you make a mistake
9387680 the dressing room is different kp is confident and that rubs off us all
9387681 we had some great times with previous captain michael vaughan but this dressing room is slightly different
9387682 as long as we keep working hard im sure we can be a successful team
9387683 at the moment we have guys clicking in every single department we have a few guys playing exceptional cricket and im just fortunate enough to be tossing my hands around in the air occasionally
9387684 i dont want to put pressure on anybody i just want to say to the guys these are the roles we want you to play now go and play them for six months nine months 12 months if you give people security and confidence they will turn up for you
9387685 the guys arent talking about their talent they are chucking their talent around on the cricket field
9387686 the dressing room is different kp is confident and that rubs off us all
9387687 we had some great times with previous captain michael vaughan but this dressing room is slightly different
9387688 as long as we keep working hard im sure we can be a successful team
9387689 at the moment we have guys clicking in every single department we have a few guys playing exceptional cricket and im just fortunate enough to be tossing my hands around in the air occasionally

9387691 the guys arent talking about their talent they are chucking their talent around on the cricket field

9387699 two women suffered leg pains with one being taken to hospital via land ambulance and the second later by car
9387700 coastguard rescue teams attended an incident at sea palling beach where a dive boat overturned whilst being launched leaving three people injured
9387701 although equipment may be carried on board by a dive boat as it is being transported down to the water it is not advisable for people to be on board during this time
9387702 vessels that are being towed along the beach can as has occurred in this case easily overturn on soft sand
9387703 this mornings action reinforces norfolk constabularys zero tolerance towards raves and unlicensed musical events which disrupt the peace and quiet of our local communities
9387704 close inspection revealed this was a fantastic opportunity for us to improve access and open the route to those with limited mobility
9387705 there were a few barriers to access such as steps an awkward bridge and poor surface as well as erosion
9387706 a lot of issues occurring within the local area are happening because the youth community in langley mill and heanor are bored
9387707 i would appeal to anyone who can help identify the man involved to come forward
9387708 this was a very frightening experience for the members of staff who are still very distressed
9387709 this project has gone very well and we are absolutely confident we will be handing back the railway station in the early hours of monday
9387710 we just jumped out and got the two ladies and dogs and put them in the boat and took them safely back to hornsea
9387711 they were climbing up the cliffs but couldnt go any further and the tide was advancing it would have continued like that for another hour at least
9387712 the aircraft was in my judgment never airworthy from the first release to service in 1969
9387713 the government has stood up and said we are sorry the coroner has said the aircraft was never airworthy but nobody in the raf or mod has ever been held accountable for it
9387714 firstly negligence it is the families argument that the ministry of defence had a duty to protect so far as is practicable the lives of service people and that they breached that duty
9387715 secondly breach of statutory duty under the health and safety at work act 1974 this states that any employer should take steps as far as is reasonably practicable to minimise risk
9387716 and thirdly under article two of the european convention on human rights
9387717 a duty on the government to protect life by minimising risk
9387718 the aeroplane was unairworthy and the ministry of defence should have known
9387719 we have ceased air to air refuelling and the use of very hot air systems when our nimrods are in flight
9387720 we are currently treating this mans injuries as unexplained and we are keeping an open mind as to whether he has fallen or been deliberately hurt
9387721 i am keen to speak to the member of the public that found him this morning and called the ambulance from the nearby phone box on garstang road
9387722 the area has been transformed and is has made a big impact on the local community we are delighted with all the goodwill and help we have received
9387723 you should never look at the opinion polls for the democrats until the republicans have had their convention
9387724 nine local people six males and three females are helping police with their inquiries into the death of a maltby teenager in the early hours of this morning
9387725 a 15 year old boy was taken to the rotherham district hospital where he was pronounced dead
9387726 this provides about 1600 children with safer supervised walking routes encouraging children to get added daily exercise which helps them to be more alert and ready to learn when they get to school
9387727 we are currently treating this mans injuries as unexplained and we are keeping an open mind as to whether he has fallen or been deliberately hurt
9387728 i am keen to speak to the member of the public that found him this morning and called the ambulance from the nearby phone box on garstang road
9387729 it had an accident rate significantly higher than the national average the new road will improve safety
9387730 although drivers will be using the brand new section of the a14 the reduced temporary speed limit of 40mph will remain in place for the safety of road users and our workforce
9387731 close inspection revealed this was a fantastic opportunity for us to improve access and open the route to those with limited mobility

9387737 jeez kevin calling you an asshole would be a huge understatement wouldnt it
9387738 these are centuries old traditions and i will continue to defend them
9387739 only those who indulge in immoral acts should be afraid
9387740 jeez kevin calling you an asshole would be a huge understatement wouldnt it
9387741 the most elegantly dressed perfectly manicured perfectly tailored car sales manager wilmington had ever seen

9387743 conservatives love palin because she has a downs baby and an m 16
9387744 obama has been associated with some the creepiest people in politics religion and cultural life
9387745 there is little more wasteful than pork barrel public works
9387746 all this means that it is obama himself who has adopted the white racist framework yes i repeat that obama has adopted the white racist framework with regard to every issue of importance
9387747 why america may go to hell and feeling young again
9387748 relentlessly sending out signals to white people that a vote for barack obama an obama presidency would signal the beginning of the end of black specific agitation that it would take race discourse off of the table
9387749 barack obama does not carry our burden in addition to other burdens he in fact promises to lift burden the burden of having to listen to these very specific and historical black complaints to deal with the legacies of slavery that is his promise to them

9387756 why should the german be interested in the liberation of the jew if the jew is not interested in the liberation of the german we recognize in judaism therefore a general anti social element of the present time in the final analysis the emancipation of the jews is the emancipation of mankind from judaism indeed in north america the practical domination of judaism over the christian world has achieved as its unambiguous and normal expression that the preaching of the gospel itself and the christian ministry have become articles of trade money is the jealous god of israel in face of which no other god may exist
9387757 i am not and never have been a man of the right my position was on the left and is now in the centre of politics
9387758 be not righteous overmuch neither make thyself over wise why shouldest thou die before thy time
9387759 there is nothing more painful to me at this stage in my life than to walk down the street and hear footsteps and start thinking about robbery then look around and see somebody white and feel relieved
9387760 i think its inevitable that there will be a lower standard of living than what everybody had always anticipated
9387761 remind me never to get this guy mad at me
9387762 the word glacial used to imply that something was very slow
9387763 this new evidence from the past paired with our model for predicting future climate indicates that glacial is anything but slow past icesheets responded quickly to a changing climate hinting at the potential for a similar response in the future
9387764 theres one side of me that desperately wants to get to the north pole to be able to shake the lapels of world leaders to get them to understand what has happened there
9387765 but then theres the other side of me that says i really hope i dont get there i hope i fail because if i am able to get there we really are in deep trouble
9387766 the award recognises the efforts made to prevent waste going to landfill
9387767 she read the paper from the very top left hand corner to the bottom right corner to the very last page
9387768 she didnt want to miss a word she didnt just read it she knew every word she had read and analyzed it
9387769 she was such a bookworm whenever i was assigned to read a book shed already read it
9387770 no one is untouchable not the captain the vice captain no one
9387771 ha ha this proves that god is on the side of the democrats
9387772 this pollution is distributed on average equally from northern california to british columbia
9387773 if we did not have a system of classification that was hierarchical and had names that could be easily retrieved we would be helpless
9387774 splitters want to draw the lines around a specimen tightly while lumpers will say no thats just a slight variation and there is nothing in this system which tells you who is right it is purely subjective
9387775 if you want to preserve a vanishing species or combat a medically dangerous one or use it in some beneficial way as a crop you need to know what you are dealing with
9387776 that name is the key to all the knowledge that has been accumulated about that organism
9387777 two hundred and fifty years after linnaeus we have still only classified as few as 10 percent of the organisms living on earth
9387778 in dealing with the living world we are mostly flying blind
9387779 trying to diagnose the health of an ecosystem a lake or a forest to save or stabilise it is like a doctor treating a patient while only knowing ten percent of the organs
9387780 the registry will be the central place where everyone can go look to see what is going on in the rest of the world
9387781 wed be up to our waist in water here and it would be navigable
9387782 you could come out here with boats all the fishermen would be up and down with their fishing gear and pulling in the catch
9387783 but this is the middle of winter and it looks like a desert
9387784 this area is on the very brink of environmental collapse
9387785 you see the lack of birds and the lack of life you smell it you can smell the water if you walk out into the lake bed you can burn your feet because of the acid sulphates
9387786 its very real and its happening right in front of us
9387787 to see my parents on the day that the animals left all they could see was everything that weve worked for for 30 years going down the track its also my future going down the track
9387788 we could have held on but we did it for the benefit of the cows we just didnt want to put them through it the cows spent more time dealing with the salt in the water than producing milk
9387789 we managed to unify the railways shortly after federation but its taken us a century to do anything about water and its still extremely difficult because the water in those river systems is over allocated its a 130 allocation and that was in a good year
9387790 so when were facing a really serious water deficit there just isnt any water any more
9387791 we are now looking at a situation where we could either have an aral sea or a series of acid lakes the options we have shrink by the week because theres less water in the system look things are really grim
9387792 we used to cut down many trees for agricultural use which brought us a lot of hardship including windstorms decreased rainfall and increased solar intensity
9387793 the amount of rainfall has dramatically increased in the last five years and heat from the sun has reduced and we now have better yield
9387794 serious concern for future economic development and sustained rural livelihoods
9387795 we were doing everything by ourselves but we realised that we were not achieving much and we now involve local communities around the forests without whose help we would fail in our conservation efforts
9387796 kakum is one of the last vestiges of the upper guinea forest and one of the biodiversity hotspots in the world
9387797 the government now devolves more power to the forest communities in conserving the forests and shares the revenues coming from the forests and the results are quite remarkable
9387798 this will give drivers the reassurance of being able to collect a sample to put alongside other evidence to bring offenders to justice
9387799 the market needs decisive government action on a range of fronts if it is to pull itself out of the doldrums and we call on government to listen to the markets solutions to a whole set of problems
9387800 we know there is no silver bullet that will slay this monster but we need a joined up comprehensive approach to bring back confidence and to give the public clarity about what is available
9387801 while we wait for the government to act on all the necessary fronts many home owners are trapped in a market offering little or no mobility without any prospect of good cheer in the autumn
9387802 ive been a little bit annoyed all week and the response has been good
9387803 but i dont want to be coming back saying the response was good after basingstoke because we didnt turn up
9387804 the difference was unbelievable and to be fair to the players it was all down to them
9387805 they know we didnt put in a great performance in the first half against bath but the annoying thing was that we did it in the second half
9387806 thats what we got him in for and we have missed him
9387807 matt will hold his hand up as well he didnt have the best game and a half and then he got injured but hes stepped up two leagues
9387808 people have seen him in pre season and thought wow and you expect him to do that week in week out but wingers dont do it week in week out
9387809 manufacturing has shown considerable resilience in the face of a credit crunch a global economic slowdown and a massive increase in its costs
9387810 but there are now clear signs that these pressures are starting to take their toll on companies
9387811 given the bank of englands hands remain tied in the short term it is now essential the government tackles this turning point for the economy head on
9387812 must avoid adding any further costs to business and put in place policies which will provide the building blocks for an upturn
9387813 the government understands the pressures on the manufacturing and other sectors as a result of the global credit crunch and high world oil and commodity prices
9387814 these are the same difficult circumstances facing every country at the present time
9387815 it was no more status quo no more politics as usual it was all about change so then to see that obama literally part of his campaign uses those themes even new energy change all that i think o k well we were a little bit ahead on that
9387816 somethings kind of changing here in alaska too for being such a red state on the presidential level
9387817 what is it exactly that the v p does every day
9387818 the g o p leader of the state we havent spoken since i got elected
9387819 i guess if you take the individual issues two that i believe would be benchmarks showing whether youre a hard core republican conservative or not would be im a lifetime member of the n r a but this is alaska who isnt and i am pro life absolutely
9387820 i guess that puts me in a box of being hard core republican
9387821 the democrats also preach individual freedoms and individual rights capitalism free market let it do its thing best let people keep as much of their money that they earn as possible and when it comes to like the party machine no one will accuse me of being partisan
9387822 turning maybe purple in the state means to me its more independent its not the obsessive partisanship that gets in the way of doing whats right for this state and i think on a national level thats what were gonna see
9387823 thats why mccain is the candidate for the g o p because hes been known as the maverick as the conduit for some change
9387824 i always looked at senator mccain just as a joe blow public member looking from the outside in
9387825 hes been buttin heads with republicans for years and thats a healthy place to be
9387826 im a mom and my son is going to get deployed in september and we better have a real clear plan for this war and it better not have to do with oil and dependence on foreign energy
9387827 our aim is to be as professional as we can and let us see where the next three matches take us
9387828 it will not be easy drogheda are the setanta cup holders but we want to do ourselves justice
9387829 hes a big tall left sided defender who will bring physical attributes to our team due to his sheer size
9387830 do you want me to use any other language ive just said yes there wont be a leadership challenge from me or from anybody else and im clear about that
9387831 the coverage that i was watching from msnbc i mean these guys were ready to have sex with him
9387832 why shouldnt we believe mccain when he says hell appoint hardcore conservatives to the supreme court
9387833 boy so the republicans are stuck with sarah palin and do you think theyre just kicking themselves now thinking we could have had bobby jindal
9387834 im so sorry we had to cut the guest list way back
9387835 go ahead and spend more money you can justify it because a wedding only happens once in a lifetime
9387836 the a1 is a major link between england and scotland and through high profile operations like this we can effectively disrupt and deter crime
9387837 innocent motorists have nothing to worry about we are only interested in those who use the roads for illegal purposes or have little regard for others
9387838 over the years i have had different symptoms such as problems with my eye sight fatigue difficulty with walking
9387839 recently i noticed that my speech was becoming blurred my occupational therapist recommended that i should try speech therapy
9387840 i think this is one of the benefits of the new service because the therapists work together i went ahead and i have seen some big improvements
9387841 i have also had physiotherapy and see the multiple sclerosis nurse it is good to know that the help is out there
9387842 works almost as well though doesnt it well we report you decide
9387843 there are substantial returns paid not only to goal scoring skills
9387844 but also to fighting ability helping teams move higher in the playoffs and showing up as positive wage premia for certain players
9387845 thomas jefferson also had a few other accomplishments under his belt
9387846 its still a disadvantage to be black in american electoral politics
9387847 but come on this was the most nakedly transparently political pick ever throw me that bone i cant imagine anyone in good conscience claiming otherwise
9387848 im watching pundit after pundit blogger after blogger get excited about the possibilities of what palin could mean i think the conservative blogospheres reaction to this has been rather embarrassing palin is a blank slate so youre foisting on her every possibly positive attribute you can imagine
9387849 we could go on but thats a start at the very least i think its too simplistic to say that those with executive experience are more qualified and that history proves that out
9387850 which is precisely what has happened with the conservative blogs and sarah palin
9387851 we may be seeing the first woman president as a democrat i am reeling
9387852 that was the best political speech i have ever seen delivered by an american woman politician palin is as tough as nails
9387853 you are offering as a sophisticated alternative the proposition that the experience of having superintended a public bureaucracy will on average not improve the performance of the candidate in superintending a public bureaucracy i do not think you want to go there
9387854 in his role as a state senator obama had more constituents than palin does as governor game set match

9387858 a non conscientious legislator plays cards and does as hes told by the majority or minority leader
9387859 uncontroversial to say that the key issue is what her resume indicates about her potential performance if she were to become president
9387860 in the post cold war era the vice president has become a more important office due to the vps stature and hence ability to represent the u
9387861 this is simply not an inherent or structural feature of the vice presidents office if their are concerns that our corps of 3 000 foreign service officers are insufficiently numerous to do the work they have to you could always hire more alaska has a population of 683 000 congressional districts arent divided evenly duder sorry to let you know obamas district has 781 000 constituents isnt someone doing a little research a bitch you said his state senate district freddie he has never been a member of the u s house of representatives so i am not sure of the relevance of the population of the congressional district in which he lives as for the state senate district the reapportionment decisions issued by the federal supreme court in 1963 required that state legislative districts be equipopulous or that members of legislative bodies be granted votes weighted according to the population of their constituencies the latter is fairly common for county legislatures here in new york i have never heard of it being used for a state legislative body see http www ilga gov commission lrb con4 htm for a copy of the illinois constitution the money quotation is as follows legislative redistricting a legislative districts shall be compact contiguous and substantially equal in population representative districts shall be compact contiguous and substantially equal in population

9387863 we know for a fact a lot of localized populations have suffered dramatic declines

9387865 the biggest challenge and unanswered question is the effects of climate change
9387866 to me its a plan that says theyre going to do more planning
9387867 theres no reason to think this is going to make any difference
9387868 im the recovery coordinator and it seems like a herculean task
9387869 but im optimistic in our ability to make better progress
9387870 my study plots in california at least indicate theyve continued to plummet and very seriously so

9387881 it was a dispiriting situation as a result of all this disturbance the adults birds were spending less and less time on the beach only returning briefly to feed chicks
9387882 at times one would not have thought there was a colony there at all
9387883 gradually numbers of chicks fledged and flying with their parents rose to 67 which is very satisfactory and amazing given the level of predation

9387887 he then goes on to suggest that true social movements have only happened because of the scarcity of broadcast media options which somehow forced everyone to hear only a single message

9387906 it is great to be there it has been a struggle since 2005 but was have clawed our way back
9387907 i do not think it was a matter of us taking our foot off the pedal
9387908 i think we have to give a lot of credit to wexford because they did not lie down
9387909 they are maybe a better footballing side than they have been credit for
9387910 everybody expected from day one that kerry would be in the final nobody knew who would be there to meet them

9387913 it goes without saying but john is an all time great safety one of the leagues classiest professionals and his elite play speaks for itself

9387929 wallbrook sic plays lermontov not quite realistically the storys feverish melodrama comes from him and he seems at once absurd and hypnotic
9387930 subtle he goes underneath every line of dialogue every emotion
9387931 the film pays fetishistic attention to all of ballets detailed contrivance the elaborate makeup the constant audience consciousness the endless attention to minutiae of musical timing and technical articulation
9387932 was the conflict between romance and realism between theatre and life

9387940 our operations against them are continuing even through the ramadan
9387941 there is no instruction for us to stop our offensive against the groups of bravo and kato we cannot delay enforcement of laws
9387942 if she becomes president of the united states of america i think we would have someone who is pretty fragile at the helm
9387943 shes number one an outsider smart articulate governor in a state that couldnt get further from washington
9387944 shes a person who finally can break that glass ceiling were proud to nominate a female vice president
9387945 i meant her political background she has no global experience shes been mayor of a town half the size of depere for two years and 18 months as governor we are talking about a nation at war
9387946 this is a clear measure of john mccains judgment of what one needs in preparation to be commander in chief
9387947 this choice calls into question both senator mccains judgment and a mccain administrations ability to lead a nation in crisis
9387948 barack obama echo chamber with the blinders wrapped around their heads
9387949 she stands up for whats right and she doesnt let anyone tell her to sit down
9387950 i didnt get into government to do the safe and easy things a ship in harbor is safe but thats not why the ship is built
9387951 americans like risk takers but they also want to know that in times of crisis youre going to be calm
9387952 americans dont necessarily want somebody in a time of crisis to be overly emotional

9387963 the serious problems of soil degradation and desertification are likely to be exacerbated by climate change through accelerated erosion fertility depletion salinisation and acidification and that subsistence agriculture characterised by low productivity and extractive farming is extremely vulnerable to such climatic change

9387965 take off our republican hats and put on out american hats
9387966 the contrast between mccains responsibility and the fanatical followers in the temple of the lord obama wont be lost on everyday husbands and wives trying to meet their own responsibilities
9387967 will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character
9387968 he actually believes theres a large army of embittered hillary loyalists who will vote for a hard line conservative simply because shes a woman
9387969 not only is the whole premise ludicrous but it is every bit as sexist as the crude joke mccain notoriously told about janet reno hillary and chelsea clinton
9387970 on some great and glorious day the plain folks of the land will reach their hearts desire at last and the white house will be adorned by a downright moron

9387973 christianity and nothing else is the ultimate foundation of liberty conscience human rights and democracy the benchmarks of western civilization to this day we have no other options than christianity we continue to nourish ourselves from this source everything else is postmodern chatter
9387974 why are leftists always standing up for blacks and homosexuals a because for all three groups their only god is their penis
9387975 why are evangelical christians like the taliban a they are both religious fundamentalists
9387976 i have a grandfather who was really supportive of hitler
9387977 he said when i was your age i was leading a division in russia and i have very left wing parents so as part of the third generation after the second world war it is something i really want to explore
9387978 my own curiosity got the best of me and i started playing with it the first day was structured but the other four were not although events were tumbling down on top of us
9387979 ron was the most popular teacher in the school kids wanted to be in his class
9387980 the thing to remember is he was very young right out of stanford university so we really identified with him this was not his first experiment either which is why we were so accepting of it
9387981 you couldnt trust your best friend you were scared to death because if you did something youd get caught and if you got caught you got a bad grade you were ruled by fear
9387982 it was like an explosion constantly getting out of control it was taking on a lot of its own dimensions
9387983 the traditional story is that every single kid was enthusiastic the reality was more complicated
9387984 when students were pronounced guilty in front of the class it was gee thats good lets give em some more
9387985 wow it sent a chill up my back this kind of group desire to hurt someone
9387986 one of the students in the class was a bomb maker
9387987 i remember somebody saying were going to get the pigs out of washington
9387988 he looked shaken up he just said that what he had witnessed had overwhelmed him
9387989 there were tears and tantrums some upset some relieved others confused
9387990 i just felt ohmigod the fact that he pulled this off i did not see it coming maybe thats my own naivety but what a great experiment one of the best learning experiences i ever had
9387991 very similar to what happened in germany i didnt take part it didnt happen
9387992 the first question was would this be possible in my country with our dark burden
9387993 you had to get good grades to get into college
9387994 and to stay in college was to stay out of the draft there was definitely the spectre of vietnam
9387995 what are we cheering are we any better than the nazis
9387996 we sure had a great fourth especially after we picked up our morning papers and found that congress had adjourned the night of the third
9387997 but our enthusiasm was immediately dampened for the senate are to meet again monday so that means that prosperity will pick up only 50 percent
9387998 this country has come to feel the same when congress is in session as we do when the baby gets hold of a hammer
9387999 its just a question of how much damage he can do with it before you can take it away from him well in 18 months these babies have left a record of devastation
9388000 no sitting congress has passed fewer public laws at this point in the session 294 so far than this one
9388001 finish its tenure with the fewest number of days in session in our lifetimes falling well below 100 days this year
9388002 no mans life liberty or property are safe while the legislature is in session
9388003 give empirical credence to the association of an active congress with poor stock market returns
9388004 how could we have allowed that child abuse to happen
9388005 i dont know why some people have children at all if they know that they can only take a few weeks off work
9388006 i know you want a child and you have every right to want a child but does the child want you if you are going to put it in childcare at six weeks
9388007 i dont think the child wants you to tell the honest truth i know thats incredibly controversial
9388008 were going to look back on this time from the late 90s onwards with putting children in childcare so early in their first year of life for such long hours and wonder how we have allowed that child abuse to happen
9388009 its just awful its awful for the mothers as well its completely heartbreaking
9388010 you actually have to say to yourself if i have to work this hard and if im never going to see my kid and if they are going to have a tremendous stress in childcare should i be doing it
9388011 when they have the good house the good car the good job were talking about very advantaged people they have everything and they think now we need a baby which we can dress up and make look perfect
9388012 but do they realise that a child needs love more than anything else in the world it needs love time and attention
9388013 the vidalia bunkie or marksville locations as they are deemed the safest at this time
9388014 this issue here is not whether wooten is some sort of saint hes not the issue is the unethical behavior of governor palin
9388015 wow now were up to six pgl anti palin smear articles why
9388016 john mccain flunked geography when he was a kid and he thinks the panama canal zone is one of the 50 states
9388017 lets see palin goes on a campaign to have what to some is a out of control state trooper fired a trooper who she and her family were very close
9388018 first of all he knows my name twins owner carl pohlad called me kirby puckett sometimes
9388019 sebelius a co chairwoman of the convention also will address the delegates a party spokeswoman said although the exact day and time has not been decided
9388020 mr obama has to endure these grotesque insults with a smile and heroic levels of equanimity the reason he has to do this the sole reason is that he is black
9388021 mccain is running a campaign straight out of the playbook that lost the conservative party the last three british elections
9388022 reading them buttressed my confidence in obamas capacity to grasp the nuances of any question no matter how complex
9388023 sebelius a co chairwoman of the convention also will address the delegates a party spokeswoman said although the exact day and time has not been decided

9388025 mccain is running a campaign straight out of the playbook that lost the conservative party the last three british elections
9388026 reading them buttressed my confidence in obamas capacity to grasp the nuances of any question no matter how complex
9388027 countries like bangladesh will otherwise suffer the most from a problem to which we have contributed little
9388028 well its so easy for you you like being a childless whore
9388029 spending a lot of time hanging around susan and beseeching her to have an affair with him
9388030 talk me out of this tonight or lose me forever
9388031 let me lie to my wife about why i had to head back into the office
9388032 oh ho ho you sure do love your little jokes
9388033 this technology significantly reduces fuel oil and natural gas consumption
9388034 we really think this is a game changer for the renewables industry
9388035 its going to get us through the peak of the day by using excess energy at night
9388036 recent greenhouse gas emissions place the earth perilously close to dramatic climate change that could run out of our control with great dangers for humans and other creatures
9388037 climate zones such as the tropics and temperate regions will continue to shift and the oceans will become more acidic endangering much marine life we must begin to move rapidly to the post fossil fuel clean energy system moreover we must remove some carbon that has collected in the atmosphere since the industrial revolution
9388038 two degrees has the potential to lead to three or four degrees because of carbon cycle feedbacks
9388039 the industry simply is growing too fast compared to the demand side
9388040 we had talked to them and were always talking to them trying to convince them that this is the best place in the world
9388041 the interest level in oregon with our business energy tax credits is extremely high with solar manufacturers right now
9388042 youve got to be proactive while youre going into a period of uncertainty
9388043 we are going to cede a lot of market opportunity to our overseas competitors just because we keep turning off this industry
9388044 if it does not get renewed the u s market will shrivel up
9388045 the gap between supply and demand could be 3 500 peak megawatts or 65 percent more supply compared to demand an oversupply situation appears unavoidable
9388046 we may be seeing the first woman president as a democrat i am reeling
9388047 that was the best political speech i have ever seen delivered by an american woman politician palin is as tough as nails
9388048 good lord we had barely 12 hours of democrat optimism
9388049 it was a stunningly timed piece of pr by the republicans
9388050 well get a taste in the next five days of how well she does in the 62 days that follow
9388051 seems like a compelling person with a terrific personal story
9388052 she stands up for whats right and she doesnt let anyone tell her to sit down
9388053 i was raised in a family where gender was not going to be an issue
9388054 the girls did what the boys did apparently in alaska thats quite commonplace
9388055 they made us line up in bathing suits and turn our backs so the male judges could look at our butts i couldnt believe it
9388056 i cant claim a bill clinton and say i never inhaled
9388057 it has really opened my eyes to international events and how war impacts everyday americans like us
9388058 we had a bad fishing year so we didnt have any money
9388059 my husband loves being a dad as much as i love being a mom
9388060 im looking at him right now and i see perfection yeah he has an extra chromosome i keep thinking in our world what is normal and what is perfect
9388061 i just put down the blackberrys and pick up the breast pump
9388062 having had two children at home at the age of four months i know how much help they need even without unfortunate medical conditions
9388063 i really feel mother knows best without the peanut gallery giving unsolicited advice she strongly conveys to women today that you dont have to choose between a successful career and motherhood you do have to make sacrifices but you can have it all
9388064 i would just trust that the child is not neglected in any way there are millions of women who work why is it that the father cannot provide the same standard of care there has been an evolving view of working women even in conservative christian circles
9388065 i didnt think the republicans would pick a female candidate for another decade but john mccain is not a typical conservative leader
9388066 im absolutely elated and very emotional and just grateful to everyone whos voted for us
9388067 the journey throughout the series has been totally fantastic and surreal and to share it with the boys from the choir is great and to win is totally amazing
9388068 we had a party in the bbc last night after the show but had to come back to cardiff and arrived at 3am on sunday
9388069 its another busy day weve done a radio show with aled jones and then will be recording songs of praise in the afternoon
9388070 i think that the standard of every choir in the final was very high and it says a lot about wales having two choirs there at the end
9388071 congratulations to both finalists ysgol glanaethwy and only men aloud and particularly to only men aloud for winning the competition
9388072 both choirs have shown tremendous talent and determination throughout the series which has been a great showcase for wales and welsh talent
9388073 i wish theyd stick with the issues instead of discussing my black go go boots
9388074 a reporter once asked me about it during the campaign and i assured him i was trying to be as frumpy as i could by wearing my hair on top of my head and these schoolmarm glasses
9388075 on some great and glorious day the plain folks of the land will reach their hearts desire at last and the white house will be adorned by a downright moron

9388080 just so that you all know i did receive a brief phone call tonight from todd and sarah palin thanks to them for being so kind
9388081 several of zinbergs partners and key staff do have a criminal record
9388082 vp leon kuperman insists there is nobody in the company today with a criminal record but kuperman also admits that the company only started investigating allegations recently after its board received an anonymous letter
9388083 zinberg himself doesnt have a criminal record but several of his partners and key staff do
9388084 once you start treasury board submissions then the control of that budget and how it gets spent and the authority to spend it all come from treasury board and thats not whats contemplated by this agreement

9388091 manufacturing has shown considerable resilience in the face of a credit crunch a global economic slowdown and a massive increase in its costs
9388092 but there are now clear signs that these pressures are starting to take their toll on companies
9388093 given the bank of englands hands remain tied in the short term it is now essential the government tackles this turning point for the economy head on
9388094 must avoid adding any further costs to business and put in place policies which will provide the building blocks for an upturn
9388095 the government understands the pressures on the manufacturing and other sectors as a result of the global credit crunch and high world oil and commodity prices
9388096 these are the same difficult circumstances facing every country at the present time

9388099 i never thought running water was a luxury until i went a week without it
9388100 this is like running a marathon and being told you have another 20 miles to go but at least this 20 miles is indoors
9388101 the stadium was a great spectacle but it made our lives miserable
9388102 you got an exhausted media crew nobody wants to go out drinking all night for the first five days its a party for the second its a grind im more interested in getting six hours of sleep instead of four
9388103 the market needs decisive government action on a range of fronts if it is to pull itself out of the doldrums and we call on government to listen to the markets solutions to a whole set of problems
9388104 we know there is no silver bullet that will slay this monster but we need a joined up comprehensive approach to bring back confidence and to give the public clarity about what is available
9388105 while we wait for the government to act on all the necessary fronts many home owners are trapped in a market offering little or no mobility without any prospect of good cheer in the autumn
9388106 we can activate an email list of a couple million people who want to give back
9388107 i think we can get tons of volunteers to travel down there if it becomes necessary
9388108 a big storm like this raises bipartisan concerns and i think for john to want to find out whats going on is fine
9388109 the thing that i always am concerned about in the middle of a storm is whether were drawing resources away from folks on the ground because the secret service and various security requirements sometimes it pulls police fire and other departments away from concentrating on the job
9388110 im assuming that where he went that wasnt an issue were going to try to stay clear of the area until things have settled down and then well probably try to figure out how we can be as helpful as possible
9388111 all of the change we collect between now and our trip to the faire will go toward our trip

9388113 it is deeply disturbing that a department as shambolic as the home office already faces such problems as a result of the economic downturn it is patently not equipped to cope why havent they prepared for this
9388114 now we see that the consequences of gordon browns complete mismanagement of the economy will not just hit hard working families in the pocket but will also threaten their security and safety across the board labour are failing in their duty to ensure the welfare of the british public
9388115 we do not normally comment on leaked documents but this is draft advice that the home secretary has not cleared and has not been sent to number 10
9388116 it is however appropriate that the home office considers the effects the economic climate may have on crime and other policy areas
9388117 we take people inside the company and train up on video
9388118 and we can do that because were on the web
9388119 the performances have been ok especially in the three drawn games away from home
9388120 today the lads got what they deserved for those performances and they were good value for the win
9388121 he came on at half time against tamworth and had a big influence there when we got back into the game
9388122 i thought he was brilliant for the 90 minutes today and thoroughly deserved his goal while he also got us a penalty
9388123 we always try and do our homework and we had done that for today which led to us causing them problems down their left hand side
9388124 we were always going to try and do that with owen storey so the scouting paid off
9388125 buddhism for mothers a calm approach to caring for yourself and your children
9388126 tell me about the shit what was in it was it good for painting

9388128 it is great defending super bowl champs i look good in blue
9388129 i feel good to be here staying in the division so not really much of a difference as far as guys you are going against and i just feel good to be here to be wanted and i am just looking forward to doing some good things on this defense
9388130 he really gets after it and kind of put his own niche on kind of the defense that we were running there in philly it is good for me because there is a lot of movement which allows for guys like me a chance to kind of move and get after the quarterback a little bit
9388131 the aircraft was in my judgment never airworthy from the first release to service in 1969
9388132 the government has stood up and said we are sorry the coroner has said the aircraft was never airworthy but nobody in the raf or mod has ever been held accountable for it
9388133 firstly negligence it is the families argument that the ministry of defence had a duty to protect so far as is practicable the lives of service people and that they breached that duty
9388134 secondly breach of statutory duty under the health and safety at work act 1974 this states that any employer should take steps as far as is reasonably practicable to minimise risk
9388135 and thirdly under article two of the european convention on human rights
9388136 a duty on the government to protect life by minimising risk
9388137 the aeroplane was unairworthy and the ministry of defence should have known
9388138 we have ceased air to air refuelling and the use of very hot air systems when our nimrods are in flight
9388139 i must be the worst manager ever in the history of baseball right now walking a guy that just came from being on top of big brown to beat the white sox
9388140 right now hes on a roll i get opportunities to walk him to face big papi i will do it whoever hits in front of him this guy right now is on fire no matter what you throw there hes going to get it

9388142 odds are its a boy but well be happy with either sex
9388143 were just hoping for a healthy baby but theres a chance for a boy odds are positive
9388144 it would have been nice to do it on our terms
9388145 we were hoping to be a little further along before news got out
9388146 russias commitment to a relationship of understanding and cooperation with the rest of europe is in doubt
9388147 its up to russia today to make a fundamental choice
9388148 russia today has found itself more isolated than the ever was
9388149 what we are calling for is sanctions addressing those individuals business and officials who by their actions current or future seek to somehow continue to violate our
9388150 to assume a presence on the ground in support of all efforts toward a peaceful and lasting solution to conflicts in georgia
9388151 i think im going to have to tear it down and start over
9388152 you just dont know what to do from one moment to the next
9388153 im concerned about my children having a place to stay its just its overwhelming
9388154 i have now won three races in a row it is incredible it was another great battle with stoner we know that stoner is very fast
9388155 we have a great advantage and we are one race closer to the title last year in these three races i took nine points this year 75
9388156 to win my 68th race in my hometown is incredible i saw giacomo agostini before the race and he was laughing so i said to him i would try to win today
9388157 i am enjoying the challenge it is great to be back in the top six fifth would have been amazing but we can push on from here
9388158 it will not be possible to rule out the supposition that the process of evolution may be guided by an intelligent design
9388159 we are a christian organization and use the term to refer to the christian god
9388160 the modern intelligent design movement looks at dr phillip johnson as its founder his book darwin on trial kind of started it all in the early 90s we were using intelligent design as an intuitive term a watch implies a watchmaker
9388161 i cannot believe that god plays dice with the world
9388162 einstein believed there was order in the universe but that it had not been designed for us
9388163 science without religion is lame religion without science is blind
9388164 i am learning how to fight the jews and kill jewish children
9388165 the parents of the jewish children are the soldiers and officers who kill us here i want these parents to get a taste of what its like to have your children killed just as the palestinians experience every day
9388166 i would rather die fighting the occupation than die at home from a missile which is what happened to hundreds of palestinian children
9388167 we will unleash the fires of hell if the zionist enemy continues its crimes
9388168 if 18 million votes is not enough what does it take in the democratic party to get a woman on the ticket
9388169 i was just thinking this gustav is proof that there is a god in heaven
9388170 to just have it planned at the same time that it would actually be on its way to new orleans for day one of the republican convention up in the twin cities at the top of the mississippi river
9388171 i do not permit a woman to teach or to exercise authority over a man rather she is to remain quiet for adam was formed first then eve and adam was not deceived but the woman was deceived and became a transgressor
9388172 to the only man who i will allow to play with my bum
9388173 first of all we must thank our colleagues americans european colleagues for being involved with this during a difficult time for russia when no one was paying any attention to this
9388174 town of 9 000 talking point not at all and this idea of having everyone who lives in a town with 9 000 or fewer people
9388175 the course of this nation does not depend on the decisions of others
9388176 the volume of in house promotions for fatty and sugary foods the supermarkets are all offering is staggering
9388177 we expected to see evidence of big improvements since our last investigation but weve been sadly disappointed
9388178 with so many of us buying our food in these supermarkets their collective behaviour can heavily influence the nations eating habits
9388179 despite their claims the supermarkets all still have a long way to go to help customers choose and enjoy a healthier diet
9388180 the nccs one off march snapshot is misleading customers will have seen for themselves the current high profile supermarket price war centred on fruit and vegetables
9388181 of course treat foods are on offer at easter what matters is the balance of promotions across the year the ncc would find a different picture in summer
9388182 this ill informed report will not distract us from our work with the food standards agency and department of health on tackling obesity work for which uk retailers are recognised as european leaders
9388183 we reject the findings of this report its six months out of date contains a number of inaccuracies and is a largely subjective assessment which ignores the obvious focus we place on fresh food in all our stores
9388184 that palin didnt practice proper prenatal care before she had the baby with downs syndrome blaming the mother for her disabled child
9388185 there are substantial returns paid not only to goal scoring skills
9388186 but also to fighting ability helping teams move higher in the playoffs and showing up as positive wage premia for certain players
9388187 theyre the enforcers always the most popular guy on the team and they never get the thanks they should i love them i ask them to do a terrible thing and a tough thing every night i reward them i hate taking them out of a lineup it is much easier for me to take a skill guy out of the lineup than it is to take a tough guy out of the lineup

9388193 you have a style of writing i just cant do
9388194 the police allow it because it gives them a place to eat as well
9388195 los argumentos de sus defensores son muy escasos y no dan seguridad casi de nada
9388196 no me sorprender a sin embargo que estuviera al tanto de hugo ch vez porque ha sido una promotora de la independencia energ tica y seguramente est familiarizada con gobernantes de pa ses productores de petr leo como venezuela
9388197 pero m s all de energ a no hay nada que uno pueda hallar en sus antecedentes que sugieran alguna conexi n con am rica latina
9388198 indudablemente se teme un debate con joe biden que toque temas internacionales
9388199 si hace falta tambi n podemos adoptar este tipo de leyes
9388200 tom esa decisi n y no hay marcha atr s
9388201 no puede aceptar un sistema mundial donde todas las decisiones las toma un solo pa s incluso si es tan importante como estados unidos
9388202 espero que europa apoye nuestra integridad territorial y diga que no reconocer jam s esas acciones ilegales
9388203 on some great and glorious day the plain folks of the land will reach their hearts desire at last and the white house will be adorned by a downright moron
9388204 good politicians like good scientists draw conclusions from facts bad politicians like bad scientists draw facts from conclusions
9388205 you know the experience that she comes from is what she has done in government and remember that alaska is the closest part of our continent to russia
9388206 we have not inherited the earth from our parents we have borrowed it from our children
9388207 how many girls get to have sex for the first time with someone they love
9388208 agreement looks unlikely this week the red lines of india and concerned nsg members remain too far apart india will have to give more
9388209 our red lines are sacrosanct and if these are not met we cant endorse the agreement
9388210 the proposal makes no substantive concessions and is essentially the same as the earlier one this is insulting irresponsible and should be flatly rejected
9388211 we wish that top leaders would visit hiroshima and nagasaki while they are in power at least once to see the atrocity of the nuclear bombings
9388212 any high ranking official visiting an atomic site can only help to heighten awareness about the horror of nuclear weapons or power
9388213 hawks within the us government can be expected to criticise while doves may quietly applaud the move
9388214 wide gap in perception between japan and the united states
9388215 could have miscarried on the trip and lied to get the larger set of quarters
9388216 east asia pollution aerosols could impose far reaching environmental impacts at continental hemispheric and global scales because of long range transport
9388217 this is very challenging science with lots of complexities and a lot of uncertainties
9388218 this pollution is distributed on average equally from northern california to british columbia
9388219 anyone who has gone out to measure it has found something
9388220 people assumed the atmosphere scrubbed itself and didnt believe these pollutants could travel thousands of miles
9388221 europe even as pollution from europe can circle the globe and reach the u s air can circulate around the world in three weeks or less the national academies of science is not limiting itself to pollution from asia and will study the phenomenon worldwide
9388222 this is a time when we have to do away with our party politics and we have to act as americans
9388223 i have every expectation that we will not see the mistakes of katrina repeated
9388224 we are working with the delegations financial people finance committees many other concerned individuals to do what we can to raise money for various charities that operate in the gulf coast region
9388225 im happy to report to you that the coordination and the work thats being done at all levels appears to be excellent
9388226 i pledge that tomorrow night and if necessary throughout our convention we will act as americans not as republicans
9388227 i thin sen obama if they want to do down that route in all candor she has far far more experience than sen obama does
9388228 was a community organizer when she was in elected office he was in the state senate and voted 130 times present he never took on his party on anything she took on a party and the old bulls and the old boy network and she succeeded
9388229 i think we can activate an e mail list of a couple of million people who want to give back
9388230 im trying to get my family out of there and stay here for the week
9388231 i pledge that tomorrow night and if necessary throughout our convention we will act as americans not as republicans
9388232 selling memberships and fighting a fair contest will not be a problem for people like david
9388233 beverage alcohol really is only mildly affected by the economic factors
9388234 a lot of consumers would still consider alcoholic beverages as an affordable indulgence
9388235 its essentially a portfolio the industry presents to the customer so that if theres a problem in income you can still drink and they can still sell
9388236 people are very rational over all theyre doing what makes sense they still want to sit down after work and have a beer and ok it wont be a heineken theyll have a budweiser
9388237 a lot of people think that when times are bad people will drink more the evidence is pretty clear that at least in terms of alcohol sales that thats not true that people will drink less
9388238 someone might cut back on the expensive bottle of wine but spend that same amount of money on quite a bit of high alcohol whiskey or liquor and they could engage in much more serious binge drinking
9388239 all the scotches are sitting still the budweiser on tap is a good mover thats about it
9388240 i went some place last night and i said are you kidding me 8 for a beer
9388241 until the past year or two i kept a wary eye on both sides of the global warming debate
9388242 usually lay people are loath to enter into debates involving complex scientific questions for fear of exposing themselves to ridicule yet the wisdom of humility seems to evaporate when it comes to global warming and any number of people with no qualifications in atmospheric physics climate modelling or related disciplines feel the urge to lend their opinions to the debate
9388243 is offensive and by the way ive never agreed to be targeted let alone be hypertargetted
9388244 assume that i am a super duper hacker who managed to block all ads from your brand new media player so that i and all my friends if you care to know can enjoy the videos without your ads then what
9388245 i dont think that pre roll ads are going to go away for as long as advertisers like them and consumers put up with them
9388246 today was not textbook i did not play great i had to lean on my short game hopefully that was my bad ball striking day i am proud of that round because i felt a little off all day i held in there well especially with my short game
9388247 ive been playing pretty solid all year if you look at it last week was just my third missed cut of the year and the way the points are right now it was probably the worst cut to miss all year
9388248 im very excited with the way i played today to get back into contention and back into this tournament
9388249 today was not textbook i did not play great i had to lean on my short game hopefully that was my bad ball striking day i am proud of that round because i felt a little off all day i held in there well especially with my short game
9388250 ive been playing pretty solid all year if you look at it last week was just my third missed cut of the year and the way the points are right now it was probably the worst cut to miss all year
9388251 im very excited with the way i played today to get back into contention and back into this tournament
9388252 weve got a job to do were caught in the crossfire
9388253 were pretty sure louisiana is going to take the bullet
9388254 they have assured us that this is their first priority
9388255 the louisiana republican party is here to do our duty
9388256 all senator obama has had to do is talk thats all he does
9388257 shes vetoed legislation shes taken on corruption and in her party and won she took on the oil companies and won she administered a budget successfully
9388258 is the least experienced candidate for president in the last 100 years
9388259 i mean hes never run a city hes never run a state hes never run a business hes never administered a payroll hes never led people in crisis
9388260 is a little bit like opening a door and letting some fresh alaska air into washington
9388261 i think here he wanted to send the message get somebody fresh somebody really who represents the other america outside of washington where people dont care whether you have an r or a d after your name they just want you to get something done to help them deal with the problems they have
9388262 a woman trying to balance her work life and her family life not to mention her incredible track record of reform and taking on as she said the good old boy network
9388263 i think frankly the democratic party has done a disservice to women by trying to hold women hostage to the issue of roe v wade
9388264 the truth is the most important issue to women all the polls say this is the economy women are not single issue voters yes there are some women for whom the issue of reproductive rights trumps everything else but the truth is most women are not that way
9388265 she risked her political career to take on the special interests in her own party she took on the oil companies shes like mccain mccain wants to change this campaign from change to from left to right he wants to make it im going to clean out the stables
9388266 do people want a risky president the pluses and minuses are huge in this pick and thats why were talking about it
9388267 senator mccain has already indicated that it would be inappropriate to have celebrations that things have to be scaled back
9388268 we are 1 000 percent better prepared today than we were before katrina
9388269 we have the full resources of the federal government prepositioned supplies and equipment communications equipment and the resources of the united states military already on the scene helping to evacuate sick patients from hospitals
9388270 so we are as ready as you could possibly be what we have to hope and pray of course is that the storm does not go beyond the capacity of the levees to protect new orleans and the rest of the gulf coast
9388271 maybe i am so disappointed because i half believed in obama at least at the beginning on thursday night he made nothing of his historical moment and he purposely set out to alienate people like me it worked
9388272 the evangelical hunter beauty contest contestant is likely to appeal broadly to most women
9388273 she is an awesome lady and has more experience in her little finger than mr obama has in his whole body
9388274 maybe i am so disappointed because i half believed in obama at least at the beginning on thursday night he made nothing of his historical moment and he purposely set out to alienate people like me it worked
9388275 sarah palin would be the commander in chief after weve potential been hit by some sort of major nbc attack
9388276 having worked as a senate staffer for many years i am not convinced that hosting hearings issuing press releases and giving floor speeches is the most relevant kind of experience for a president
9388277 as horrible a job as you think bush is doing the democratic controlled congress is doing worse
9388278 im voting for him when hes willing to let that happen his views on iraq help but not compared to abortion
9388279 meaningful and well paying employment nutritious food clean water affordable energy efficient and comfortable housing and transportation systems good global leadership great educational systems good governance and last but not least
9388280 why is it that sen obama is now somehow more experienced and ready to be president
9388281 wow there is so much hate is that what it takes to be democrat is burning hate
9388282 mccain takes the lead in the whale fat beauty contest
9388283 its 3 a m and your children are safe and asleep who do you want answering the phone
9388284 i spent several years in a north vietnamese prison camp in the dark fed with scraps do you think i want to do that all over again as vice president of the u s
9388285 war is wretched beyond description and only a fool or a fraud could sentimentalize its cruel reality
9388286 to envision this inexperienced young woman as our commander in chief or leader of the free world is ludicrous
9388287 i dont know what youve been drinking the cool aid pbr or maybe youve had your nose in georges stash regardless palin will be mccains undoing she was the mayor of a town smaller than an nfl football stadium she was elected governor only because alaskans hated the other guy so much they would have voted for anyone and her journalism education is about as useful running a nation as tits on a bull women are a lot more intelligent than youre giving them credit for theyll vote for someone based on what they stand for long before they consider gender you can vote for miss congenitality sportscaster nra whack job all you want but my guess is that come january well have a mixed race president in the white house obama called it like it is and thousands of republicans and democrats are tired of the nonsense that bush has gotten away with more of the same is not an option to them
9388288 nothing in all the world is more dangerous than sincere ignorance and conscientious stupidity
9388289 there are a lot of other republican women who could have filled this role if that is what he was looking for
9388290 there are a lot of other republican women who could have filled this role if that is what he was looking for
9388291 since independents dont have many convictions about anything and arent very engaged theyll probably just get their opinion from commercials and soundbites from the mainstream liberal media like they always do which is to say theyll hear good stuff about democrats and bad stuff about republicans
9388292 thanks i am honored but it is in the best interest of my country to have a more qualified person in the position
9388293 palin has a genuine middle class story that makes joe biden look like the prince of the senate he has been for most of his life
9388294 even if mccains pick isnt just a cynical ploy to win over disillusioned hillary supporters hes got to understand that it will be seen that way all hes doing is pissing off women who will be resentful that mccain thinks they are so easily bought
9388295 i barack hussein obama voted but i didnt take a position one way or the other
9388296 seriously folks the misogyny coming out of the dems is too much it wasnt enough you ground hillary into the dirt now you want to do the same of palin
9388297 ive been focused on state government i havent focused on the war in iraq
9388298 john mccain was able to weave in his experience in a vietnam prison camp no matter what the question was
9388299 even a blind hog finds an acorn every once in a while
9388300 were the reform candidates were going to take on the establishment
9388301 debemos quitarnos el uniforme de republicanos y ponernos el uniforme de estadounidenses
9388302 no quiero que mi visita impida en cualquier sentido la respuesta de nuestro personal de emergencia
9388303 calzadas coches aparcados y fachadas de la barriada se pringaron de aceite hidr ulico muy resbaladizo
9388304 ya est bien de que la zona de puente mayorga sufra tanto castigo por la contaminaci n comprendo perfectamente que es un accidente pero que no puede ocurrir y hay que tomar medidas porque debajo viven personas y no bichos
9388305 ya no existen porque pertenecen a algunos de los centros nuevos
9388306 as long as we properly handle the gustavication of the convention it may be a positive
9388307 everything else is just an opportunity to make a mistake or distract from the historic nature of the ticket
9388308 now the republican brand out there is not so bad
9388309 the does bush help or hurt question doesnt need to be asked or answered and we wont be compared to the obama speech 90 000 person spectacle and most important this gives palin time to get her feet under her
9388310 we will take off our republican hats and put on our america hats
9388311 america were with you we are going to care for these people in their time of need
9388312 the biggest downside risk as i see it is media footage of corporate lobbyist parties going on in minnesota while new orleans floods
9388313 they should recommend that those activities get curtailed i would like to think that the corporate lobbyist community could read the tea leaves without having to be told but they may need a recommendation
9388314 as long as we properly handle the gustavication of the convention it may be a positive
9388315 it was in some ways reminded you of a lani rosenthal s documentary of adolf hitler s rally in munich
9388316 look there is the hottest governor in the united states
9388317 maybe if we had done it right maybe some of that money would have gone to inspect those bridges and other bridges around the country
9388318 maybe the 200 000 people who cross that bridge every day would have been safer than spending 233 million of your tax dollars on a bridge in alaska to an island with 50 people on it
9388319 we will continue to look for options for ketchikan to allow better access to the island
9388320 the concentration is not going to be on a 400 million bridge
9388321 no way in the world am i going to put myself in that position
9388322 i think the community is starting to see that the money for this project is not there
9388323 they could be open to smaller bridges but the problem is we dont even have the monies for the smaller bridges yet
9388324 she came off looking immature herself almost high schoolish it was conduct unbecoming a governor
9388325 sometimes you go to war with the media you have not the media you wish you had
9388326 but i am disappointed i expected to win at home

9388345 its a republican convention yet the republican brand is not that good
9388346 i think its kind of more that they know who they are
9388347 it appears its at least got him in the ballgame
9388348 i have to tell you i got a phone call from my family too and my daughter the immediate thing was wow mccain picked a woman i thought it was stunning when it happened because it is so historic the other thing i must say this is the first time that anybody who is in a national position has publicly thanked me in 24 years
9388349 well first the john mccain campaign definitely served notice that they intend to compete hard for the support of women voters of course i appreciate the reference to hillary clinton who did such a magnificent job in her campaign
9388350 you are going to have a lot of women voters wondering why senator obama didnt tap senator clinton as his running mate
9388351 to that end consider the immediate reaction of clinton adviser howard wolfson who writes today in a short piece titled ill see your biden and raise you a palin that you are going to have a lot of women voters wondering why senator obama didnt tap senator clinton as his running mate
9388352 project a gets 15 million in additional funding if it builds the engines in backwater wy
9388353 what has nasa done lately oh just sink billions into that new rocket that is still in development and has another delay to 2018
9388354 its a double edged sword and its either your co workers or your family
9388355 some of us are much stronger than others i know several officers who were fired they were damned good officers
9388356 the superintendent has done everything possible to ensure the officers will stay in and hes confident none of them will leave
9388357 short of another katrina our community is confident the force will take care of our needs
9388358 those problems are not indicative or reflective of the force as a whole
9388359 the force as a whole is doing a good job
9388360 i have a lot of admiration for the police that stayed
9388361 i couldnt tell you what i would do in that scenario not knowing where my family is
9388362 you cant perform your job if youre worried about where your family is regardless of your occupation
9388363 i think the city of new orleans has learned the lessons of katrina

9388367 do you mind if i just watch for a moment
9388368 lo de robinho no me interesa no merece la pena
9388369 no s lo que hay pero algo hay aqu vamos a estudiar profundamente en los pr ximos meses a ver si hay que enga ar al rbitro o jugar con uno m s no tengo ni idea lo hemos intentado todo pero el deportivo nos ha ganado y hay que felicitarles
9388370 miraba a la izquierda y no ve a a ning n delantero no nos hac a falta nada simplemente estar m s atentos en los dos goles en los dos centros que hab a que evitar no es preocupante porque dominamos el partido y han jugado los cuatro delanteros y lo han hecho bien
9388371 hoy no era el d a de robinho era nuestro d a y el partido era lo importante lo de robinho no me interesa no merece la pena
9388372 im sure we can work with the dtl department of tourism and leisure and the manx motorcycle club and between us we can get some more showers or get some temporary ones put up during the race periods
9388373 i do not believe that we need to raise the this tax at this time
9388374 i believe that successful environmental taxation is about a partnership between government and community
9388375 the way you deliver successful environmental taxation is by a dialogue through consultation with the community to decide what taxation the community wishes
9388376 we really dont have the luxury of sort of trying to evaluate the politics of this kind of situation
9388377 i think we take it as it is and right now we have a horrible storm bearing down on the gulf people should be more concerned about that than a and i think thats the way were going to let the chips fall
9388378 get out of my hair before i give you something to cry about
9388379 she has experience not only in politics but in life
9388380 shes a mother of five children and she has more experience than
9388381 governor palin took on ted stevens if she can take him on she can take on the russians
9388382 palin is commander in chief of the alaskan national guard
9388383 alaska is the closest part of our continent to russia so its not as if she doesnt understand whats at stake here
9388384 if they want to go down that route in all candor she has far more experience than does
9388385 there are a lot of other republican women who could have filled this role if that is what he was looking for
9388386 you know why she had to make decisions all sen obama has had to do is talk thats all he does
9388387 no doubt the campaign staff have her hooked up to a fire hose on
9388388 my guess is graham and joe lieberman are doing a lot of tutoring
9388389 the experience issue is on the other side the no 1 guy there is the guy without the experience
9388390 never again never again will a disaster of this nature be handled in the disgraceful way it was handled
9388391 i pledge that tomorrow night and if necessary throughout our convention we will act as americans and not as republicans
9388392 everything they need from the federal government to prepare for what all anticipate will be a difficult situation
9388393 well take any delegate that would like to go back
9388394 the mccain campaign has assured me this is the first priority
9388395 im trying to get my family out of there and stay here for the week
9388396 as important as this convention is the safety and welfare of american citizens is the no 1 priority so everything is being adjusted but not canceled
9388397 i just felt nervous having them there in this storm and me not being there
9388398 america needs all of us to do what american have always done in times of disaster and challenge and that is join together and help our
9388399 reaching out our hands and our hearts and our wallets to the people who are under such great threat from this great
9388400 i pledge that tomorrow night and if necessary throughout our convention if necessary to act as americans not republicans because america needs us now no matter whether we are republican or democrat
9388401 we can activate an email list of a couple million people who want to give back
9388402 i think we can get tons of volunteers to travel down there if it becomes necessary
9388403 stay clear of the area until things have settled down and then well probably try to figure out how we can be as helpful as possible
9388404 we just hope that by the time this storm hits land that it has dissipated somewhat right now that doesnt appear to be the case
9388405 ceos salaries and benefits are getting fatter and fatter while workers face soaring gas prices foreclosures and employee free choice act gives workers the freedom to form a union so they can earn better wages retirement security and
9388406 we are going to march into the arms of police whatever they are going to do is all right with us
9388407 of course this is a time when we have to do away with most of our party politics
9388408 we wish that top leaders would visit hiroshima and nagasaki while they are in power at least once to see the atrocity of the nuclear bombings
9388409 any high ranking official visiting an atomic site can only help to heighten awareness about the horror of nuclear weapons or power
9388410 hawks within the us government can be expected to criticise while doves may quietly applaud the move
9388411 wide gap in perception between japan and the united states
9388412 if i gave you an assignment to make a video would it bother you that i dont know how to make a video and cant teach you how
9388413 the c f bond is difficult to transform into other bonds under mild conditions because it is inert and unreactive its a challenge to chemists
9388414 but we found a way to take a c f bond that you can do very little with and break it and convert it cleanly into something else at room temperature
9388415 conversion of pfcs remains a challenge and our research efforts are directed at designing even more active catalysts capable of pfc activation
9388416 i hope and pray we will be able to resume some of our normal operations as quickly as possible
9388417 were going to suspend most of our activities tomorrow except for those absolutely necessary
9388418 i hope and pray we will be able to resume some of our normal operations as quickly as possible but some of that is frankly in the hands of god
9388419 take off our republican hats and put on our american hats and we say america were with you
9388420 we will refrain from any political rhetoric which would be traditional in an opening session
9388421 right now we have a horrible storm bearing down on the gulf people should be more concerned about that than a and that is the way we are going to let the chips fall
9388422 we can activate an email list of a couple million people who want to give back
9388423 i think we can get tons of volunteers to travel down there if it becomes necessary
9388424 in light of these events i will not be going to minnesota for the
9388425 i will travel down to texas tomorrow to visit with the in austin
9388426 shes been a commander in chief of the alaska national guard
9388427 remember alaska is the closest part of our continent to russia so its not as if she doesnt understand whats at stake here
9388428 quand sol ne est morte jai compris que javais gard la place la moins confortable
9388429 i have championed reform to end the abuses of earmark spending by congress
9388430 in fact i told congress i told congress thanks but no thanks on that bridge to nowhere
9388431 if our state wanted a bridge i said wed build it ourselves
9388432 the window is now while our congressional delegation is in a strong position to assist
9388433 the money thats been appropriated for the project it should remain available for a link an access process as we continue to evaluate the scope and just how best to just get this done
9388434 this link is a commitment to help ketchikan expand its access to help this community prosper
9388435 i think were going to make a good team as we progress that bridge project
9388436 she was asked about the bridge and she supported it
9388437 how could she have foreseen that she would be at this point now everybody is surprised by this development
9388438 were going to make sure that equal pay for equal work is a reality in this country
9388439 seems like a very engaging person nice person but ive got to say shes opposed like john mccain is to equal pay for equal work that doesnt make much sense to me
9388440 i am all in favor of pay equity for women but this kind of legislation opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems
9388441 were going to invest 15 billion a year in making highly efficient cars of the future right here in ohio right here in america
9388442 windmills and solar panels and biofuels right here in ohio creating millions of jobs that cant be exported

9388444 now with the release of hercules and love affairs celebrated debut listeners have two brilliant examples of the creative possibilities in the disco framework kelley polars sophomore effort is just as strong as the aforementioned approaching a musical genre with heavy stigma attached and interpreting it in a sincere innovative and modern way
9388445 his head in the stars his feet on the dance floor kelley polar is sheer beauty he reinvents romance for the 21st century
9388446 i expect from the eu summit that europe wont give up faced with this dirty attempt at aggression
9388447 my family would always travel by train on holiday to the alps or the mediterranean because my father would get concessionary fares all the way across europe
9388448 then as a young man when i was working for br we still had the same concession so i travelled everywhere in europe by train and ive always wanted to return to that era when rail travel was both romantic and exciting fortunately things have turned out in such way that ive been able to make my nostalgia and my lifelong dream a reality
9388449 luxury train travel is benefiting from the general phenomenal growth in rail travel which is helping it to buck the trend there are several reasons for this but one of the key ones is that it is rightly seen as being greener than jumping on a plane for those with a bit of money to spare it allows them to feel they are travelling responsibly while at the same time providing a great dinner party one liner
9388450 its all been done at the cost of some blood sweat and tears but im completely delighted with the result i truly believe there is no better way of travelling than letting the world slip past your window on board a train

9388453 carrie needs someone who is going to stick by her
9388454 she was devastated when her relationship with tony romo broke the last thing she needs is a relationship with another high profile celebrity whos going to end up loving and leaving her
9388455 i never said i have a girlfriend and i never said i dont have a girlfriend
9388456 my public and private life are separate i keep my private life to myself
9388457 i travelled to trinidad and stayed there for a year i went to venezuela and colombia i was in a spin for a year and a half and i didnt know how to get back to earth
9388458 and i thought it was a good thing to do
9388459 i couldnt put it all together i couldnt get money i couldnt get actors
9388460 eventually i said its not going to work im gonna write a book
9388461 i read the script and the very human story at the very core of this film spoke to me very clearly
9388462 we would very much like to make the film here
9388463 the briefing was full of professionals from the ngos asking questions about the war
9388464 and then i spotted this freak with spiked orange hair earrings and a bomber jacket we got talking about how i had landed here for no particular reason and then about his humanitarian circus called the serious road trip
9388465 what they were doing with their lives was worth giving up for something bigger
9388466 he seemed ill prepared which suited our ad hoc organisation he seemed to have no reason for being in bosnia but this didnt trouble me for many people especially aid workers you enter a war zone first then find the reason our friendship strengthened the more we kept nearly getting killed together i realised bill had a driving force behind him but i didnt know just what but it was strong it had to be as one doesnt take such immense risks without one
9388467 its only a one hour drive from split to sarajevo but i had no idea what that drive was going to be like
9388468 to push it all the way to the edge if i die and its natures mistake then i win
9388469 when people threatened my life and my natural reaction was ok go ahead i get very relaxed the more danger gets closer the more i calm way down which is a bit weird
9388470 did help heal me youre in a city of grief which gives you in many weird ways great comfort
9388471 you come all the way from america and you dont know who karadzic is
9388472 i got hold of a video camera and began shooting what was happening i forged documents and got a press pass
9388473 they were two sisters aged 17 and 18 they lived on the other side of sniper alley and they took me into their home
9388474 they took me in and they were fun and smart their parents were great they had pride and being funny was to do with their pride they only had a couple of crumbs to eat but they shared it with me and they acted as if it was a real feast
9388475 all with this very black sarajevo humour i got very involved with my friends youd be having a cup of tea with these people and talking about frank zappa and king crimson and outside the window someone is throwing himself off the top of a building because the war has got to him it was really surreal
9388476 i am glad you are listening to wonderful music you should enjoy yourselves but i want to ask one question what are you going to do excuse me but i think nothing
9388477 whenever you create a new status record you need to tell everybody about it
9388478 for example think of the absence of a guest account in your authentication system if it really needs one
9388479 they laid them out on the floor of the country club
9388480 i dont think there should be a prohibition against debate if it comes up in class it doesnt have to be part of the curriculum
9388481 i wont have religion as a litmus test or anybodys personal opinion on evolution or creationism
9388482 nearly 11 percent of children headed back to school this fall have asthma
9388483 children with asthma can thrive when asthma is diagnosed early and managed according to the childs needs
9388484 the kind of money generated around the industry is way out of proportion the admiration bestowed on actors is also out of perspective
9388485 doctors are the stars of our society people like my grandfather who was responsible for the health care in canada as well as teachers firefighters and police officers
9388486 news such as this rocks the foundation of our state
9388487 senator ted stevens has dedicated his life to the betterment of alaska i share alaskans concern and dismay at this turn of events
9388488 i have great respect for the senator he needs to be heard across america his voice his experience his passion needs to be heard across america so that alaska can contribute more
9388489 governor palin has a record of reform it was one of her signature issues when she ran for office and she has a record of accomplishment in office
9388490 i think of a man and take away reason and accountability
9388491 fishing trip that was paid for by the big oil mongers like sarahs hubby
9388492 christian rightwingers were praying for rain and flood during the dnc convention prep rnc plans canceled due to storm ironic
9388493 its always a pleasure for me to come on your program gordon and congratulations on your continued success and adherence to the principles and philosophies that keep our nation great
9388494 with seven counts of making false statements for failing to disclose
9388495 an alleged payment scheme involving fisheries legislation brought by his father
9388496 pleaded guilty to bribery and conspiracy charges he stated that almost a quarter of a million dollars in consulting fees paid to the younger stevens was in fact bribery
9388497 sarah palin is to the movement for womens equality what clarence thomas is to civil rights shes an extremist and an enemy to the cause that has been fought on her behalf
9388498 sarah palin has a great deal of surface appeal at first but once americas women look behind that cheerleader smile and see at her extreme social agenda they will run the other direction
9388499 mccain picked a fan not an equal partner she has no international experience she was just fawning all over him no independence given mccains temper sarah palin probably wont challenge john mccain on any substantive issues
9388500 chiss chi se non rispondi questo non lo saprai mai
9388501 they jonas brothers tried to play it cool but it definitely seemed as if theres something more than friendship going on
9388502 i am back out there doing some of the things that i wasnt able to do in the past i am just getting my feet back under me
9388503 last year i played well and had some good games but i couldnt do it on a consistent basis like i wanted to
9388504 granted i wasnt able to go out and practice but i never let my mind waver and used that as an excuse i gave it what i had i just expect to be consistent and great week in and week out thats what i want to be
9388505 i try to do it every time i step on the football field
9388506 with me getting practice i have already practiced more this year than last year so i am just trying to get to the top of my game i am trying to be an impact player week in and week out i am trying to prove something to myself and be the best that i can be for my team
9388507 its embarrassing to get covered i just want to go out and be as a good as i can i think the more explosive i can be the more explosive our offense can be it is going to be exciting
9388508 i am trying to be an impact player week in and week out i am trying to prove something to myself and be the best that i can be for my team
9388509 there are no immigration enforcement operations and there are no immigration enforcement checkpoints associated with the evacuations
9388510 the department of homeland securitys top priorities in any emergency are life saving and life sustaining activities we want to ensure the safe and swift evacuation of all individuals in the affected region
9388511 the health care needs of gulf coast veterans dont disappear during the hurricane season
9388512 were resolved to continue providing veterans with services whenever possible and reconstituting services as quickly as possible when they have had to be curtailed because of the storm
9388513 veterans in the affected area who need emergency medical care should considering going to the nearest civilian facility if they would risk their health by traveling to a va hospital or clinic
9388514 we are making more types of services and equipment available to the people of the gulf coast
9388515 i dont know if theyre doing enough now but hopefully theyre more on the ball than they were then thats for sure
9388516 until i see that last day when weve won the division im not going to be relaxed
9388517 hopefully things can be different i dont think this team is giving you any hints of showing what happened last year its a different group
9388518 i had to battle a lot i was a little sluggish but managed to use my experience
9388519 he didnt have his greatest stuff but he pitched magnificently
9388520 i think we have a run in us where well win five six seven in a row
9388521 being my first year in the major leagues you couldnt ask for a more exciting team and situation to be put in
9388522 unfortunately we didnt score enough runs thats been out story the last month or so not scoring runs
9388523 we cannot worry about what happened last year because this is a new year for us
9388524 were playing good baseball right now hopefully we can continue that
9388525 i expect from the eu summit that europe wont give up faced with this dirty attempt at aggression

9388528 i have a lot of respect for paris shes ballsy shes learned to play with the paparazzi attention and have fun with it and she creates little mysteries in the tabloid arena i have fun with her but its always been platonic our relationship wasnt sexual though i understand that sex sells
9388529 she and i have a very open communication if you want to know the whole story youve got to be my friend its easy to put those labels on people but theyre not accurate
9388530 i travelled to trinidad and stayed there for a year i went to venezuela and colombia i was in a spin for a year and a half and i didnt know how to get back to earth

9388552 luxury train travel is benefiting from the general phenomenal growth in rail travel which is helping it to buck the trend there are several reasons for this but one of the key ones is that it is rightly seen as being greener than jumping on a plane for those with a bit of money to spare it allows them to feel they are travelling responsibly while at the same time providing a great dinner party one liner
9388553 its all been done at the cost of some blood sweat and tears but im completely delighted with the result i truly believe there is no better way of travelling than letting the world slip past your window on board a train
9388554 contrast that to obamas bitter clingers obama just lost blue collar white democratic voters in pennsylvania and other states
9388555 remember alaska is the closest part of our continent to russia so its not as if she doesnt understand whats at stake here
9388556 did i wake up in a parallel universe i am absolutely shocked
9388557 but the danger for democrats is if they get overconfident and ridicule her they could create a backlash of sympathy for her
9388558 last time we had to spend two years with relatives in texas before it was safe to come back and when we returned our house had no roof weve just put our lives back together and been living here 12 months again and now this it hurts you know but youve got to get on with it
9388559 i hope and pray not to have to use it but it could get nasty out there if youve got a gun then its got to be worth taking it with you right i dont see problems in the bus or on the interstate but you never know
9388560 during katrina i left for one reason and that was to find safer conditions for my children
9388561 weve shared phone numbers and addresses ive got 30 gallons of water and provisions for four weeks in my house other people have generators we will network to get by thats what people in florida do all the time
9388562 i broke on to my roof which was the only place where i could stay clear of the water and ended up staying there almost three weeks
9388563 i had no food and only a tiny bit of water and only survived by the grace of god
9388564 as soon as i heard about gustav i decided to go theres no way im going to risk what happened last time even if it means staying in a refugee camp for a month at least ill be able to drink water and lie down out of the sun
9388565 ive read three books on george washington in the last couple of years and theyre still analysing the first guy what do i have to worry about
9388566 i take great comfort in knowing that they dont know what they are talking about because history takes a long time for us to reach
9388567 i can do that because im president and thats that
9388568 im sure we can work with the dtl department of tourism and leisure and the manx motorcycle club and between us we can get some more showers or get some temporary ones put up during the race periods
9388569 you should never look at the opinion polls for the democrats until the republicans have had their convention
9388570 i obviously dont want to torture any prisoners there is a long list of areas that we were in disagreement on
9388571 and waterboarding was advocated by the administration and according to a published report was used
9388572 the first thing we would do is rein in spending
9388573 ryan is constantly asking how do my brows look hes more concerned with them than his hair
9388574 he even has a kit with tweezers and brow gel in case of an emergency
9388575 this gene is crucial to the daisy chain of signals that run between body fat and brain
9388576 it likely plays a pivotal role in how much we as humans eat and whether we have offspring
9388577 the president and vice president decided not to travel to minnesota due to the hurricane
9388578 resulting in a shooting injury to the head and he later died in hospital
9388579 magomed yevloyev was arrested today in ingushetia and was killed
9388580 along the way a shot was involuntarily fired from a policemans gun and the bullet hit yevloyevs head
9388581 it is essential that the international community and especially the european union demands an explanation for what really happened
9388582 if zyazikov is once again cleared of guilt that would mean that
9388583 i think at some point it kind of sets in for everybody that theres been a lot of incredible baseball to come through this place
9388584 i couldnt get away with a monument so ill go with the dirt
9388585 babe ruth if i couldve got it in my bag but i dont think i couldve got away with it
9388586 i feel better than i have in past years at this point
9388587 weve had our backs up against the wall a lot lately and even more now
9388588 im not getting it done and thats all there is to it
9388589 this is the time when i should be winning ballgames im letting a team down big time its just frustrating im not doing my job i know how precious every win is right now
9388590 i just misread it got a bad jump and couldnt recover
9388591 tests are needed to establish a cause of death for the body
9388592 although this is now being treated as a murder we are keeping an open mind as to the circumstances leading up to the incident
9388593 there has been a lot of speculation in some sections of the media which is not helpful
9388594 chris was surrounded by a lot of shady people he wanted me to protect him but i refused the job offer because i thought things were going too far especially with people talking about what amounted to murder
9388595 just flipped because the pressure of it was too much for him
9388596 sometimes you go to war with the media you have not the media you wish you had
9388597 we may be seeing the first woman president as a democrat i am reeling
9388598 that was the best political speech i have ever seen delivered by an american woman politician palin is as tough as nails
9388599 economic conservatives are excited 2nd amendment conservatives are excited pro life conservatives are excited and reform conservatives are excited
9388600 sometimes you go to war with the media you have not the media you wish you had
9388601 when unknown people are thrust into national attention quite often they are looked down upon but quite often they get the last laugh
9388602 we will act as americans and not as republicans because america needs us now
9388603 this is a point of national concern i think everybody of good will has great empathy and sympathy for people in new orleans
9388604 most religious people are praying for people in new orleans there is no political connotation to this whatsoever this was just poking fun at and the nonsensical thing he had said several years ago
9388605 i dont believe in a god thats vengeful i believe in a god thats compassionate
9388606 a storm is not a partisan event and that is what theyve done i am outraged
9388607 take off our republican hats and put on our american hats
9388608 reaching out our hands and our hearts and our wallets to the people who are under such great threat from this great
9388609 we can activate an email list of a couple million people who want to give back
9388610 i think we can get tons of volunteers to travel down there if it becomes necessary
9388611 right now we have a horrible storm bearing down on the gulf people should be more concerned about that than a and that is the way we are going to let the chips fall
9388612 several states including missouri texas and new mexico are preparing to and have accepted a lot of evacuees
9388613 there are millions of meals and millions of liters of water pre staged as well as a lot of blankets and cots
9388614 this is not a test everyone whos out there thinking they can ride this storm out i have news for you that would be one of the biggest mistakes you could make in your life
9388615 i normally am very calm about these press conferences trying to give assurance to our citizens but tonight you need to be scared and you need to get your butts out of new orleans right now anyone who decides to stay make sure you have an axe because you will be busting your way out of your attic to get on your roof
9388616 i think that warning may be a bit of an exaggeration
9388617 if one person runs across a motorway they might get away with it
9388618 if 50 try the same thing people will be killed it is the same here we have to be reasonable even if big money is at stake
9388619 sacrificed mont blanc on the altar of money and turned it into a new disneyland
9388620 peillex knows nothing about the high mountains he only goes there in a helicopter
9388621 it is indecent that he is using this calamity to revive his old idea of licences
9388622 in chamonix we prefer to educate people to warn them and to train them
9388623 we have created a high mountain office which helps between 800 and 1 200m people a day
9388624 the idea that there should be a complete freedom for anyone to go into the mountains is just as much a myth as heidis cabin
9388625 for those still disaffected hillary supporters who are truly dedicated to improving the lives of women and children and who may be tempted to vote for mccain because his running mate will be a woman i simply ask that they consider the larger picture it is wonderful to hear that governor palin is a devoted working mom who is honest as the day is long even in alaska good for her but ladies and gentlemen i know senator hillary clinton hillary clinton is a friend of mine and sara palin is no hillary clinton
9388626 appeasement team up 3 down 1 from saturday a 25 decline
9388627 as long as we properly handle the gustavication of the convention it may be a positive
9388628 everything else is just an opportunity to make a mistake or distract from the historic nature of the ticket
9388629 now the republican brand out there is not so bad
9388630 the does bush help or hurt question doesnt need to be asked or answered and we wont be compared to the obama speech 90 000 person spectacle and most important this gives palin time to get her feet under her
9388631 we will take off our republican hats and put on our america hats
9388632 america were with you we are going to care for these people in their time of need
9388633 the biggest downside risk as i see it is media footage of corporate lobbyist parties going on in minnesota while new orleans floods
9388634 they should recommend that those activities get curtailed i would like to think that the corporate lobbyist community could read the tea leaves without having to be told but they may need a recommendation
9388635 as long as we properly handle the gustavication of the convention it may be a positive
9388636 it was in some ways reminded you of a lani rosenthal s documentary of adolf hitler s rally in munich
9388637 if my first posts general sense was that mccain had made a strong move this one is going in the opposite direction my indecision isnt surprising this is a huge gamble and we will have to see how palin performs in the months ahead what coverage she receives and whether she can move the female vote before having a better idea of how her presence on the republican ticket will play out
9388638 t his is a time when we have to do away with our party politics and we have to act as americans its a time to act
9388639 i want to thank my fellow republicans as we take off our republican hats and put on our american hats and say america we are with you and we are going to care about these people in their time of need
9388640 mondays program will be business only and we will refrain from any political rhetoric that is normal for the opening of a political convention
9388641 the message to the people of the gulf coast is this storm is dangerous
9388642 theres a real possibility of flooding storm surge and high winds do not put yourself in harms way or make rescue workers take unnecessary risks
9388643 t heres no pattern to how we will react to this other than to use all our resources and skills to put on the convention the best we can
9388644 nothing that we will do that will distract from the gulf
9388645 we can still have very regal looking guards who look fantastic
9388646 we felt doing this kind of thing was a way of keeping with the times and keeping that iconic status
9388647 most people think its fake fur and when they find out its real and it takes one bear to make a hat they are appalled
9388648 we think we are a modern nation but the queens guards are walking round with an entire dead bear on their heads
9388649 the mod is not opposed to the use of synthetic materials as an alternative to bearskins provided such materials meet the requirement for a high quality product that performs adequately in all weather conditions
9388650 baroness taylor will be meeting representatives from peta this week
9388651 if one person runs across a motorway they might get away with it
9388652 if 50 try the same thing people will be killed it is the same here we have to be reasonable even if big money is at stake

9388659 the rate of change is going up everyone says that but very few people believe it if you look at the data though on everything from number of patents filed m amp a activity all kinds of global activity its going up like that its not even linear the faster the world moves the more you have to change

9388685 we have raised 4 million on the internet i wish i had taken her a month ago
9388686 theres a real question whether shes a republican or a democrat
9388687 youre right he didnt serve so we cant call out biden on that issue either but since cheney will no longer be vp as of jan 2009 its pretty much a moot point now
9388688 theres a real question whether shes a republican or a democrat
9388689 he aint heavy father hes my favorite lobbyist hussein and his flunky are scratching their heads saying what the hell happened
9388690 john mccain said he raised 4 million when he actually raised 4 5 million clearly he is senile can you trust him with your money
9388691 famous quotes or slogans with the republican presidents who made them famous
9388692 at least three of the following five colors red green yellow blue purple and white
9388693 i just wanted to say that bush is a big nazi with his haliburton cheney junta who were selected not elected and i also wanted to say that the constitution has been shredded and if you arent angry youre not paying attention
9388694 thank you caller now we go to the democrat line
9388695 hello yes i wanted to say to that over one billion iraqis were killed in this illegal and immoral war and billions more will be killed by bush who wasnt even elected
9388696 all right callers now we ask you to please observe decorum here on c span we have standards
9388697 ask not what your country can do for you ask what you can do for a bowl of kraft mac n cheese
9388698 in the light of russian actions the eu should review root and branch our relationship with russia
9388699 no nation can be allowed to exert an energy stranglehold over europe
9388700 if i were to say that we dont care that we were indifferent i would be lying
9388701 of course will leave these positions where we are now we will not remain there forever
9388702 if i were to say that we dont care that we were indifferent i would be lying
9388703 if russia pulls out of nato they should also be required to give up their seat on the un security council
9388704 as a feminist i love that she did not leverage herself into power through her husband and consider this an important improvement over hillary
9388705 these self appointed leftwing activists who claim to speak for all women are now claiming im somehow not a real woman
9388706 even if mccain loses in november the gops new standard bearer will be a younger working mother from outside washington and not a rich businessman with perfect hair from massachusetts mccain may have saved the gop at the expense of the campaign
9388707 the democratic party has done a disservice to women by trying to hold women hostage to the issue of roe v wade
9388708 the truth is the most important issue to women all the polls say this is the economy
9388709 is a person who can identify with the challenges they face as women in every conceivable way as a mother as a mother trying to balance her work life and family life not to mention her incredible record of reform and taking on the good old boy network so ive talked to many women and they are truly excited by this pick
9388710 see you can do that if you work hard and really want it
9388711 i have to tell you i got a phone call from my family too and my daughter the immediate thing was wow mccain picked a woman i thought it was stunning when it happened because it is so historic the other thing i must say this is the first time that anybody who is in a national position has publicly thanked me in 24 years

9388722 total appreciation rates over 300 were not unusual during the period it was an amazing run fueled by adequate national gdp growth and low mortgage rates
9388723 but as weve seen ultimately the appreciation rates proved to be unsustainable everywhere they occurred
9388724 but during the boom it was not uncommon to see 30 40 50 annual increases over multiple years
9388725 we learned that the smiths not their real name down the street had to take out a second mortgage
9388726 its was neighborhood news and it wasnt good a second mortgage was a sign of financial distress a last resort
9388727 you would think the russians had just invaded new jersey dawson is old enough to remember the cold war it was worse than the yankees not winning the pennant no one ever took out a second mortgage except for a serious emergency
9388728 its not a home equity loan its another lien against your house

9388730 utahs highest state court has tossed a lawsuit accusing smartbargains of engaging in unfair competition by displaying pop up ads to overstock com visitors
9388731 overstock failed to show that smartbargains pop ups labeled with the smartbargains logo and appearing in a separate window on the top of overstocks website are deceptive infringe a trademark pass off smartbargains goods as those of overstocks goods or are likely to cause confusion
9388732 aimed at harming the companys stock and defaming company officials bringing down the stock price
9388733 the key here again as with the uptrend in the previous four years is china if oil consumption growth slows in china oil will experience a large sell off as institutional investors and traders sense that the great bull run in commodities is at least pausing
9388734 china is likely to register gdp growth of about 10 in q3 and if its below 9 or 8 5 investors will take that as a sign that a slowdown is ahead which is bearish for commodity prices
9388735 found that the s amp p 500 has averaged a total return of 14 1 per year under democratic presidents since april 1945 and 11 8 under republicans the best total returns 17 4 per year were under bill clinton whose presidency ranked first in economic results
9388736 that 1 14 point difference if maintained for eight years would yield 9 33 percent more income per person which is a lot more than almost anyone can expect from a tax cut
9388737 when democrats were in the white house lower income families experienced slightly faster income growth than higher income families which means that incomes were equalizing in stark contrast it also shows much faster income growth for the better off when republicans were in the white house thus widening the gap in income and median income grows 3 percentage points faster
9388738 if you like rising incomes higher stock prices and economic growth vote democratic

9388746 as each newspaper experienced recent staff reductions of our reporting staffs we believe sharing some content assures thorough coverage particularly in overlapping areas and allows us to direct even more resources to enterprise watchdog and investigative reporting exclusive to each newspaper
9388747 i hope mccain picks someone like her or bobby jindal it turns out as good as i could have hoped for as i am watching jindal also doing a great job under tough conditions there is hope for the gop yet

9388874 you will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy
9388875 thats bad enough but a lot less damaging than a cat 5 like katrina
9388876 you will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy
9388877 i am honored to be here tonight a proud mother a proud democrat a proud american and a proud supporter of barack obama
9388878 you will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy
9388879 i am my brothers keeper i am my sisters keeper
9388880 you will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy
9388881 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even go to the cave where he lives
9388882 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even go to the cave where he lives
9388883 yeah i know youll go to hell john but why wont you try to catch bin laden
9388884 well it doesnt really matter who mccain picked because well like obamas going to win because like all the celebrities are for him and well hes totally gonna win
9388885 ironically just before that obama said hed like to have a debate on patriotism and national defense with john mccain
9388886 judged not by the color of their skin but by the content of their character
9388887 they cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who arent like them
9388888 well it doesnt really matter who mccain picked because well like obamas going to win because like all the celebrities are for him and well hes totally gonna win
9388889 damn is he faking is he holding aces damn fold or call fold or call what does he have maybe nothing maybe a flush draw damn damn fold or call fold or call how can he do this im the chip leader not him hes faking right right dammit fold or call fold or call
9388890 shame on those two dont they comprehend the fact that people are going to suffer
9388891 i think barack obama is a fabulous public speaker i think hed make a great presidential candidate in four to eight years
9388892 hey everybody in the world knows its to each according to his needs so whats the problem
9388893 nothing in this world can take the place of persistence
9388894 i came to the conclusion that the optimist thought everything good except the pessimist and that the pessimist thought everything bad except himself
9388895 hooray now we can vote for mccain hes learned his lesson he told us so
9388896 nothing in this world can take the place of persistence
9388897 i remember him talking about her when he came back
9388898 he said she was an impressive woman he liked her
9388899 i am going to by a mansion on my credit card then get a job and figure out how to pay for it
9388900 inexperienced leader of a small inconsequential country with bad ideas
9388901 is it the number of times you have been on meet the press or the amazing abiltity to solve the worlds energy with but a simple tire gage give me a break
9388902 just because she has never done something does not mean she cant
9388903 lets just ignore her and let the msm do our dirty work
9388904 well the voters think republicans are corrupt and wants to throw them out
9388905 well how bout a republican that thinks republicans are corrupt and has first hand experience throwing them out
9388906 the aftermath of katrina will go down as one of the worst abandonments of americans on american soil ever in u s history
9388907 guardsmen had to chop their way through moving trees and recreating roadways
9388908 my favorite moment in todays race was coming back through disneys california adventure and seeing mrs incredible and sully cheering us on
9388909 i had to make my way through all the other runners
9388910 but it was a great race with so many people out there cheering us on that really made it special
9388911 im not too concerned about the numbers to be frank
9388912 i dont go home and look at the scoreboard im quite often not conscious of the scoreboard still it hurts when you lose you can chase the statistics all you like the fact was it was a belting
9388913 we did achieve something the mandela trophy and we have the opportunity to achieve more so we wont be taking too much out of this experience other than the things we dropped away from and we have a great opportunity in two weeks to show we have made some headway
9388914 we genuinely got outplayed today we got belted you always go into the game with a positive mindset you never go into a game expecting the opposition to put 50 on you
9388915 the springboks had two pretty valuable components today they were desperate and they were uninhibited because they had nothing to lose
9388916 its a powerful mix when you get your foot in the door particularly when youve been suffering for awhile
9388917 we also dropped off it and thats what happens at this level
9388918 the big difference this week was that the springboks got momentum and they utilised that very well
9388919 last week they south africa created opportunities but didnt get too many points from them
9388920 it was nice to end with three birdies as its managed to keep me in a decent position heading to the last round
9388921 gregorys played well these three days and all credit to him but there is a lot of class players behind him and he will have a lot of pressure on his shoulders
9388922 ill need to get out of the blocks quickly and post some early birdies if i am going to have a chance these greens are still causing a lot of frustration for everyone
9388923 it was a very frustrating day and i have played so much better to have had seven birdies but only be two under for the day
9388924 it was a nice finish and the conditions were a lot easier as there wasnt much wind out there

9388937 l st ab heute die klitschko br der als werbegesicht f r den beliebten pausensnack milchschnitte ab
9388938 ich habe den spot gern gemacht weil ich milchschnitte wirklich gern esse sagt magdalena brzeska zu bild
9388939 wenn eine sehr popul re sportlerin einen gro en werbevertrag bekommt
9388940 dass sie jetzt f r einen riegel mit milchcremef llung wirbt das w re absurd und w rde genauso an der wirklichkeit und unseren lesern vorbeigehen wie wenn wir von nuss nougat creme arne schreiben w rden
9388941 leitlinien zur sicherung der journalistischen unabh ngigkeit bei axel springer
9388942 anzeigen d rfen durch ihre gestaltung insgesamt oder durch beherrschende komponenten nicht den eindruck erwecken sie seien redaktioneller bestandteil des titels insbesondere auf eine klare unterscheidbarkeit der typographie ist zu achten im zweifelsfall muss die anzeige klar und in ausreichender gr e entsprechend gekennzeichnet werden
9388943 von der zeitung in petes h nden gibt es drei verschiedene ausgaben in jedem siebten ei ist eine bild dabei
9388944 der italienische konzern ferrero aus alba im piemont ist brigens der viertgr te s igkeiten hersteller der welt nach nestl jacob suchard und mars in deutschland dem gr ten auslandsmarkt des unternehmens werden 3 600 mitarbeiter besch ftigt
9388945 jetzt plant ferrero einen neuen werbe gag ein m dchen gesicht soll auf die packung der kinderschokolade
9388946 warum genau wurde frau brzeska am 11 8 zur gewinnerin des tages weil sie werbung f r milchschnitte macht
9388947 schreiben die journalisten der bild gruppe auch ber ferreros konkurrenz und deren produkte
9388948 erfreulicherweise schaltet ferrero anzeigen in bild und auf bild de dies ist wichtig denn anzeigen tragen nicht nur bei uns sondern auch bei allen anderen medien zur existenzsicherung bei
9388949 bei uns sind werbliche inhalte immer eindeutig als solche zu erkennen bzw mit dem wort anzeige gekennzeichnet eine verbindung zwischen redaktion und anzeigengesch ft gibt es weder organisatorisch noch inhaltlich die redaktion entscheidet ganz allein nach den gegebenen publizistischen anl ssen
9388950 jetzt glaubt uns wenigstens jeder dass unser ziel nur ist nicht abzusteigen

9388957 i dont know about you but every time i have sex justice is served
9388958 john mccains new vp nominee seems like a very engaging person a nice person
9388959 but ive got to say shes opposed like john mccain is to equal pay for equal work that doesnt make much sense to me
9388960 but even with all she accomplished she was still passed over repeatedly because it was hard being a woman in the 60s and the 70s being a path breaker like that
9388961 and ive got two daughters and when i think about them i say to myself i want to make sure that those girls have exactly the same opportunities as anybodys sons will thats why were gonna fight for equal pay for equal work
9388962 oh no he didnt graham attacks obama for missing votes
9388963 my favorite moment in todays race was coming back through disneys california adventure and seeing mrs incredible and sully cheering us on

9388967 there is an electricity going through the social conservative crowd right now its unbelievable
9388968 especially given all the set ups and head fakes its amazing a lot of people were sure he was going to show his more moderate colors
9388969 ive talked to two prominent social conservative leaders in the past 24 hours who told me they had previously not planned to attend the convention but were now coming to minneapolis after the palin pick
9388970 i dont know if ive ever seen a veep pick energize the grass roots like this

9388976 i just hope people will now come and look at us and talk about what they see and not about what they perceive we are
9388977 i thought we played some good football today and we have got players in the team who can cause people problems
9388978 i ran extremely well the final table was a pretty tough lineup im really ecstatic that i finally won a main event

9388992 wsop academy grads won a combined amount of over 500 000 at the 2008 wsop including the 49th and 50th place finishers in the main event
9388993 most of these graduates who had recently attended an academy credit the academy with helping them to achieve these amazing results beyond all of the tournament results our grads have achieved it is extremely common that many who attend the academy pay for their investment by way of winning cash games immediately following our events
9388994 the wsop academy is coming off another amazing summer at the world series of poker that saw one of our academy grads again at a final table just days after attending our camp
9388995 and were now excited to offer our first academy experience in los angeles and welcome 2008 wsop bracelet winner kenny tran one of l a s most noted poker professionals to our family of instructors
9388996 her insight is invaluable and will serve as a solid foundation for becoming a winning poker player
9388997 the academys tournament is an exciting way for our participants to put into action what theyve learned over the day and test their wits at the table against the worlds best like annie duke and kenny tran
9388998 i think we can get tons of volunteers to travel down there if it becomes necessary
9388999 i think we can activate an e mail list of a couple of million people who want to give back
9389000 we dont want to solicit a bunch of canned goods that cant get there or you know bottles of water where they already have water
9389001 the thing that i am always concerned about in the middle of a storm is whether we are drawing resources away from folks on the ground
9389002 im assuming that where he went that wasnt an issue
9389003 and the next thing they know theyre a vice president
9389004 were talking about a consulting firm coming and changing the way you do your work
9389005 the communication of that to the people in the organization is a tremendously important aspect
9389006 liberal arts majors without an ability to do much beyond word processing put themselves at risk
9389007 he knew that even though hed been shot he had to continue to protect the public
9389008 this person had shot him an obvious disregard for a law enforcement officer which indicates he has no regard for the public either
9389009 its kind of muscle memory that takes over thats ingrained in a law enforcement officer from early on in the academy and then that is reinforced by ongoing training in the field
9389010 looters will go directly to jail you will not get a pass this time
9389011 you will not have a temporary stay in the city you will go directly to the big house
9389012 i was worried about the kids we just couldnt stay
9389013 i sent my son out with a camera and said go take pictures of our backyard
9389014 its like what would happen if you drop flour it got all over them
9389015 a wandering mind can do important work scientists are learning and may even be essential
9389016 the message to the people of the gulf coast is this storm is dangerous
9389017 theres a real possibility of flooding storm surge and high winds do not put yourself in harms way or make rescue workers take unnecessary risks
9389018 theres a lot of preparations that have gone in in anticipation of this storm
9389019 everything they need from the federal government to prepare for what all anticipate will be a difficult situation
9389020 theyve made it through great challenges in the past and theyre going to make it through this one
9389021 need to understand that in a storm of this size there is serious risk of significant flooding
9389022 i think we have plenty of opportunity to get people out in time its those who are choosing not to get out that concerns me
9389023 going to be in some ways more challenging than katrina
9389024 checking in and getting ready to go through this again with him
9389025 this could be potentially the most dangerous storm for the energy sector weve ever seen said chris jarvis senior analyst at caprock risk management in
9389026 the industry is much more prepared and taking things much more seriously thats why so much has been shut down so quickly
9389027 it was pure terror for i dont know how long
9389028 well rebuild the roof from there i sell pigs and little by little ill save enough money from them to replace it with a little government help we can make it
9389029 it was terrible never in my life have i seen anything like it
9389030 my sisters house completely collapsed she managed to get out before it fell on top of her
9389031 i dont think i can do another katrina but i can definitely do what were doing today because its smooth its effective and its getting the job done
9389032 and well be able to get our people back with little hassle
9389033 because i do not want my visit to impede in any way the response of emergency personnel
9389034 we sent a message out to the country three years ago that was absolutely horrendous and we know that
9389035 they took all the criticism all that happened and applied some processes that are working
9389036 in nagins case what he has to do is be a leader of all people in and quietly solidly execute
9389037 no flamboyance no loudness no treatment of the media one way or the other just keep your head down and do this well
9389038 of course this is a time when we have to do away with most of our party politics
9389039 fifteen percent looks small but the impact is larger than meets the eye
9389040 louisiana refineries supply a chunk of the southern states product needs gasoline diesel whatever
9389041 that could keep a lot of those refineries shut down for awhile because you have to deal with flooding and
9389042 if that capacity remains shut down for an extended amount of time you could see prices really start to rise four dollar gasoline is not out of the question
9389043 i dont know how much were going to sell them for now but the price is going to have to go up
9389044 weve been out of food since yesterday the people outside are screaming
9389045 life is like living in a cloud for us we never know what is going to happen
9389046 after a certain point though mother natures going to have her say
9389047 when we take a hit like this it not only affects the growers but it can trickle through the entire sugar economy
9389048 one of the things we found out after katrina and rita was that the plants came back faster than the surrounding communities
9389049 where the workers are and getting them back is going to be tricky thing
9389050 its awful when youre in one but the fact is the u s economy is so big that these things just dont matter that much economically
9389051 katrina was a real mess and caused something like 25 billion in damage but if you lose 20 billion or 25 billion in the context of a 10 trillion economy its not really a very big deal
9389052 how many times are the other 49 states going to be willing
9389053 there was talk the first time around about whether it was worth it those kinds of comments might be better received this time
9389054 im shutting my shutters but then im going to drink
9389055 im opening the porch bar until it gets too windy im anxious but im staying
9389056 the challenge seems to be that people arent listening or they are listening and deciding to stay
9389057 they were out walking their dogs this morning and have no intention of leaving
9389058 most are people of means they have generators they have security they got guns god bless them
9389059 im all american but my family history is palestinian so we are used to evacuating
9389060 latinos are fearful that by being taken to shelters they will be turned over to immigration officials
9389061 often people along the way like shelter workers take to being ice agents and turn people in
9389062 we didnt have enough people to go into the neighborhoods where we know latinos are living
9389063 we put out word on two spanish radio stations which is the best we can do
9389064 weve gotten lizards birds dogs cats bunnies and even a pig
9389065 we even had an english mastiff so big we needed to order a special crate
9389066 the tracks go through the levees and they are going to be closing the flood gates behind us
9389067 we do have extensive plans to respond wherever the storm is going to go
9389068 its been three years and new orleans is not all the way back together if another hurricane comes it will just be even longer for new orleans to get back
9389069 we dont need another storm putting more people out of their home again and leaving them to start from the beginning ive been through that
9389070 i had the mentality in new orleans that a hurricane would come there because it hadnt come in years
9389071 now that ive been through it if they say leave ill leave i have a baby now i dont know where id go but im going
9389072 i dont want to see this city get another one
9389073 we wouldve never thought that we could possibly be facing another katrina in our lifetime even if it doesnt come the frenzy of it all its crazy my home may never be the same again
9389074 doug said lets go up to chattanooga and look for a house
9389075 so we would have a safe place for the children to come should they have to evacuate
9389076 i love this city but we cant keep going through this
9389077 after this time im going to really be done with it
9389078 tomorrows session will be business only and we will refrain from any political rhetoric which would be traditional in an opening session
9389079 we are not making any commitments past 5 30 pm tomorrow afternoon
9389080 the message to the people of the gulf coast is this storm is dangerous theres a real possibility of flooding and high winds
9389081 therefore it is very important for you to follow the instructions and direction of state and local officials do not put yourself in harms way or make rescue workers take unnecessary risks
9389082 we dont want to get caught up in the katrina craziness
9389083 has prepositioned teams of search and rescue teams aircraft and commodities throughout the region
9389084 there are millions of meals and millions of liters of water prestaged as well as a lot of blankets and cots
9389085 this is a time when we have to do away with our party politics and we have to act as americans
9389086 i have every expectation that we will not see the mistakes of katrina repeated
9389087 we are working with the delegations financial people finance committees many other concerned individuals to do what we can to raise money for various charities that operate in the gulf coast region
9389088 im happy to report to you that the coordination and the work thats being done at all levels appears to be excellent
9389089 i pledge that tomorrow night and if necessary throughout our convention we will act as americans not as republicans
9389090 i thin sen obama if they want to do down that route in all candor she has far far more experience than sen obama does
9389091 was a community organizer when she was in elected office he was in the state senate and voted 130 times present he never took on his party on anything she took on a party and the old bulls and the old boy network and she succeeded
9389092 i think we can activate an e mail list of a couple of million people who want to give back
9389093 im trying to get my family out of there and stay here for the week
9389094 america needs all of us to do what american have always done in times of disaster and challenge and that is join together and help our
9389095 reaching out our hands and our hearts and our wallets to the people who are under such great threat from this great
9389096 i pledge that tomorrow night and if necessary throughout our convention if necessary to act as americans not republicans because america needs us now no matter whether we are republican or democrat
9389097 we can activate an email list of a couple million people who want to give back
9389098 i think we can get tons of volunteers to travel down there if it becomes necessary
9389099 stay clear of the area until things have settled down and then well probably try to figure out how we can be as helpful as possible
9389100 we just hope that by the time this storm hits land that it has dissipated somewhat right now that doesnt appear to be the case
9389101 funny sweet caring loving sensitive trust worthy silly cool good hearted
9389102 i cant do it funny i cant think humorous cheeky cool humorous smart smart calm
9389103 you could have had honest flaky imaginative loveable grumpy temperamental and persevering
9389104 je li umiesz co zrobi dobrze nie r b tego za darmo
9389105 we wanted a family center not just for children but for adults and gatherings as well
9389106 were encouraging the community to come and use this this isnt something we built just for us this is something we wanted to share with the community
9389107 were not in the coffee business serving people were in the people business serving coffee
9389108 hier ist mein geheimnis es ist ganz einfach man sieht nur mit dem herzen gut das wesentliche ist f r die augen unsichtbar
9389109 die zeit die du f r deine rose verloren hast sie macht deine rose so wichtig
9389110 ich betrachtete im mondlicht diese blasse stirn diese geschlossenen augen diese im winde zitternde haarstr hne und ich sagte mir was ich da sehe ist nur eine h lle das eigentliche ist unsichtbar
9389111 aber du darfst sie nicht vergessen du bist zeitlebens f r das verantwortlich was du dir vertraut gemacht hast du bist f r deine rose verantwortlich

9389336 get behind me satan because you dont have gods agenda in mind but the agenda of the one who is trying to steal all our lives away from god
9389337 you dont know how close to the ground it is
9389338 if you want to be my followers you have to deny yourselves take up your cross and follow me
9389339 those who want to save their lives will lose them and those who lose their lives for my sake will find them

9389344 all education must if its very nature be either religious or atheistic it cannot be neutral that is impossible neutrality in religion is atheism it is the same thing it means in fact that if you leave god out it does not matter whether you think he is there or not you cannot therefore merely have neutral education to which you append religious instruction as one subject taken alongside arithmetic geography and the rest it will never have real value unless it is felt to pervade the education as a whole the aim should be to secure that the whole life of the school is conducted as part of the training not only of citizens but of christian citizens
9389345 if these are limited to the secular so as not to offend particular religious or atheistic groups then as temple said above they are in practice anti religious since they leave religion out that teaches by implication that religious values are either not true or not important or both
9389346 are you comfortable having your inexperience on the top of the ticket or on the bottom of the ticket those are your choices saying that palin isnt experienced enough to be president can backfire it can also be used to highlight the fact that obama really isnt experienced enough to be president either the democrats should be very careful how they approach this
9389347 anchorage alaska gov sarah palin was for the so called infamous bridge to nowhere before she was against it a change of position she ignored saturday when she bragged about telling congress thanks but no thanks to the pork barrel project
9389348 after mccain introduced her as his choice for vice president palin talked about her reform credentials and said she stopped the bridge project
9389349 she didnt talk that way when she was running for governor
9389350 andrew halcro ran against palin in the 2006 governors race receiving the third most voters and remains a critic in his blog and web site halcro raised the bridge issue saying palin changed her position for political purposes
9389351 according to the ketchikan daily news the bridge issue came up on sept
9389352 ketchikan mayor bob weinstein said he was there at the candidate forum when she was asked about the bridge and she supported it
9389353 bill mcallister palins press secretary questioned how she could have used the scuttled bridge project to promote herself in national politics when she got there a week ago as mccains unexpected choice for the ticket
9389354 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency governor palin shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade the agenda of big oil and continuing george bushs failed economic policies thats not the change we need its just more of the same
9389355 i think that uhhh you know campaigns start getting these uhhh hair triggers and uhhh the statement that joe and i put out reflects our sentiment
9389356 tyler has gone down in history as one of the least effective us presidents
9389357 he was trying to explain his troubles winning over some working class voters saying they have become frustrated with economic conditions its not surprising then they get bitter they cling to guns or religion or anti pathy to people who arent like them or anti immigrant sentiment or anti trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations
9389358 its perfectly true that she lacks experience but were not really saying that
9389359 so palins qualifications to be president must be closely examined
9389360 the wingnuts would have gone crazy if the real maverick john mccain showed up

9389375 i think were going to make a good team as we progress that bridge project
9389376 she was asked about the bridge and she supported it
9389377 how could she have foreseen that she would be at this point now everybody is surprised by this development
9389378 of course when you become governor things come into much sharper focus than when you are a candidate

9389454 defending the nations core values its organizing ideology and its free political and economic institutions
9389455 is far too deeply entrenched in americas political culture and foreign policy tradition to be dismissed
9389456 but wrights latest round of media appearances have not seemed to me to be any kind of defense of liberalism or the black church or even black liberation theology so much as one mans desire to deny a rival his destiny
9389457 the open door is as much about ideology as it is about economic expansion and the distribution of power in the international system
9389458 fay reminded us we dont have to be hit by a hurricane to have a major loss
9389459 die etappe war h llisch schnell und wurde am ende richtig schwer deshalb bin ich froh weiter im gelben trikot zu fahren
9389460 das ganze team hat hervorragend gek mpft und damit alle ausrei er zur ckgeholt das war ein schweres st ck arbeit
9389461 das war ein richtiger drecksberg ich h tte nicht gedacht dass der kurze anstieg so hart wird
9389462 das war ein sieg des willens nach meiner langen verletzung im fr hjahr konnte man nicht damit rechnen
9389463 das hat mich sicher 30 sekunden gekostet das ist nat rlich rgerlich denn es geht im kampf um den gesamtsieg um jede sekunde
9389464 ich habe vorher schon gesagt dass meine vorbereitung nicht optimal war ein zwei tage mehr zum einfahren h tten mir sicher gut getan
9389465 drei tage nach dem 0 4 in der champions league qualifikation bei atletico madrid hat sich schalke mit einem 1 0 gegen den vfl bochum an die tabellenspitze der bundesliga gesetzt sind sie mit der reaktion zufrieden
9389466 die mannschaft hat nach dem gro en betriebsunfall in madrid sehr gut reagiert sie hat ruhig und kontrolliert gespielt man sieht dass sie eine entwicklung macht es dauert halt bis alles homogen ist
9389467 ist schalke f r europa zu schwach aber f r die bundesliga gut genug
9389468 es ist nicht richtig der mannschaft die internationale klasse abzusprechen sie hat am mittwoch einen sehr sehr schlechten tag erwischt es ist passiert aber das ist auch schon anderen klubs passiert dass sie in einem spiel alles hergeben
9389469 am anfang der saison sind in der bundesliga nur die ergebnisse wichtig da gibt es keinen sch nheitspreis zu gewinnen deshalb bin ich mit dem bundesliga start zufrieden wenn ein neuer trainer seine philosophie umsetzen will geht das nicht von heute auf morgen auch die bayern haben mit ihrem neuen trainer viel geduld
9389470 ist es denn richtig dass trainer fred rutten an seinem 4 3 3 system festh lt auch wenn er daf r gar nicht genug starke st rmer hat
9389471 die mannschaft hat von anfang an in diesem system gespielt es ist wichtig dass sie wei wie die grundordnung ist die raumaufteilung stimmt defensiv ist die arbeit sehr sehr gut wir haben bisher erst ein gegentor gekriegt
9389472 rafinha hat nach seiner umstrittenen olympia teilnahme erstmals wieder in der startelf gestanden ist das thema damit erledigt oder gibt es noch konsequenzen f r ihn
9389473 sportlich ist das thema auf jeden fall erledigt aber er bekommt eine geldstrafe die schon empfindlich ist das ist eine gr enordnung die jedem weh tun w rde
9389474 ganz entspannt er hat gesagt dass der brasilianische verband daf r aufkommen wird er fliegt ja jetzt wieder nach brasilien da k nnen sie sie sich ja jetzt mal unterhalten

9389476 ich habe am sonntag auf unserer gesch ftsstelle noch einmal alle faxe kontrolliert uns trifft es nicht
9389477 ich bin trotzdem zufrieden mit dem wochenende die eisb ren haben gut gespielt und es war wichtig hoch zu gewinnen um im rhythmus zu bleiben
9389478 wir haben zwei spiele gewonnen zehn tore geschossen und nur zwei kassiert und stehen trotzdem mit leeren h nden da diese regelung ist nur schwer zu verstehen mit dem auftreten meiner mannschaft bin ich sehr zufrieden nach den harten trainingswochen habe ich viel positives gesehen aab und fortier haben gut harmoniert und auch die jungen spieler haben mir wieder gut gefallen wir schauen jetzt nach vorn auf den start in die del saison

9389493 and it seems vladimir putin and dmitry medvedev were expecting the sco to back them over the georgia issue in that spirit but china basically told them to take a hike staying decided neutral on the issue

9389503 we have serious reasons to believe that american citizens were right at the heart of the military action this would have implications for american domestic policy if this is confirmed we will have grounds to suspect that somebody in the u s has created this conflict to aggravate the situation and create a competitive advantage for one of the presidential candidates

9389534 these figures illustrate that many georgia families are struggling to make ends meet yet our policymakers are proposing cuts to critical services like health care education and services for vulnerable populations that will only make it harder for them
9389535 if the economic downturn continues as expected georgias policymakers are likely to face tough decisions about how to balance the states budget they should avoid taking steps that would make it even harder for struggling families to get by

9389727 during my 25 years in real estate ive never seen a better time to buy a home the choice is fantastic and mortgage rates are as low as theyre going to be for the foreseeable future
9389728 whatever lifestyle youre seeking the selection of well priced houses is almost unbelievable now thats because so many of the homes that have gone through foreclosure are in the starter home category
9389729 far too many 20 somethings buy only for their current housing needs if they can afford to they should look for a starter home that will serve their wants and desires for at least five years that way they can maximize their investment dollars
9389730 in most cases you should buy ahead for as much house as you can afford in terms of space and location you want to make your first purchase in the most desirable area possible
9389731 you want that first home to pinch though not to squeeze your budget too tight when you buy you should think both about your present needs and resale down the road

9389738 apesar da proposta pelo fabiano eller ser muito boa para o santos e para o atleta estou mais preocupado com a recupera o do time no campeonato brasileiro o fabiano para n s uma pe a fundamental e a manuten o dos jogadores mais importante at do que o lado financeiro
9389739 o presidente ainda n o passou nada para mim mas a proposta excelente superior ao que eu ganhava na espanha
9389740 em dois meses de clube poderei gerar um bom lucro para o santos e acho que isso tem de ser melhor analisado
9389741 o gr mio correu bastante tamb m tivemos a infelicidade de sair com a derrota mas o time est de parab ns pelo que correu agora acertar e pensar no pr ximo jogo
9389742 eu procuro fazer o m ximo e todos os jogadores fazem o m ximo infelizmente a gente n o conseguiu o objetivo mas a gente precisa do apoio do torcedor at o final
9389743 pens vamos em ganhar o jogo apesar de jogarmos com uma equipe dif cil
9389744 a responsabilidade grande desde que eu assumi o grupo pr ximo do rebaixamento onde ainda estamos
9389745 muito cedo o campeonato est aberto o gr mio faz campanhja equilibrada e n o podemos fugir disso mas j vimos varias vezes o jogadores passaram por essa circunst ncia e todo momento e alguns tem esse deslumbramento a gente tem que saber disso e trabalhar com esse tipo de coisa entusiasmo avassalador se n o souber controlar
9389746 n o podemos tomar gol do jeito que tomamos um gol assim pode complicar tivemos bom volume e o vasco se defendeu muito bem e um m rito o gr mio tomou a iniciativa foi um time que sempre teve alternativa bastou um erro e acabamos levando um gol em um descuido o que n o pode acontecer
9389747 i think it was a successful convention for barack obama i think that the speeches by hillary and bill clinton really helped in that regard to heal the wounds in the dem party certainly among the delegates in the hall
9389748 they may not have meant a word of it but i think they certainly put on the best face in terms of trying to heal the wounds of the party
9389749 not that anything anybody does here has any impact on gustav but i think republicans are keenly aware of how badly they came off in the response to katrina and if anything i think theyre going to go overboard in terms of showing their sensitivity to the people on the gulf coast at this convention

9389758 para n s uma satisfa o jogar no brasil e enfrentar as atuais campe s ol mpicas sabemos o n vel das equipes e vamos tentar fazer um bom papel importante ter uma experi ncia como essa principalmente porque estamos atravessando um processo de renova o
9389759 dizer que eu estou satisfeito n o cabe mas o empenho foi o que eu espero de uma equipe minha desde que cheguei o nico jogo que n o tivemos um desempenho igual a esse foi contra o atl tico mg
9389760 o resultado depende de circunst ncias e perdemos chances concretas mas o advers rio por ser qualificado conseguiu os gols n s tivemos mais chances que eles eles erraram igual a gente mas n s n o aproveitamos eles aproveitaram
9389761 a situa o j era dif cil quando eu cheguei mas vamos passar isso com tranq ilidade o grupo sofreu um monte de coisas e temos que ir minimizando aos poucos o nimo novo existe
9389762 ningu m que veio aqui gostou do primeiro tempo porque foi um jogo horr vel com poucos ataques no segundo tempo abrimos um pouco mais mas tamb m n o foi nenhum espet culo o empate acabou sendo bom para os dois lados
9389763 em rela o diferen a n o dava para ser diferente pela forma que estamos jogando
9389764 n s trocamos muitos jogadores a defesa nunca foi a mesma sempre me perguntam isso e sempre a mesma resposta
9389765 fiquei surpreso ao ver mais uma vez essa postura do robinho um atleta pode e tem o direito de declarar sua vontade de se transferir para outro clube mas tem contrato em vig ncia e precisa ter uma postura mais profissional com o real madrid
9389766 estou fisicamente bem e tenho a confian a do professor luxemburgo estou crescendo de produ o em um momento importante no qual acabamos de perders um jogador importante que era dolo da torcida
9389767 estou feliz porque ter conseguido ajudar da melhor maneira os meus companheiros que taparam muitos buracos sempre digo que os momentos ruins n o duram para sempre quando voc trabalha bem no dia a dia uma hora as coisas melhoram

9389772 a bola bateu na parte branca da risca da grande rea e acabou subindo quando n o tem que entrar n o entra
9389773 o kl ber pereira me falou que a bola pegou em uma sali ncia do campo e subiu n o teve nada a ver com falta de qualidade dele foi um lance em que faltou sorte no momento s isso
9389774 a gente sempre quer mais e n o pode se contentar com um empate mas n o podemos esquecer que a partida era um cl ssico contra uma equipe qualificada e na casa do advers rio
9389775 as duas equipes tiveram bons momentos dentro do jogo e qualquer uma poderia ter vencido
9389776 o primeiro tempo foi mais do s o paulo e boa parte do segundo do santos o resultado foi justo e chegamos a quatro jogos sem derrota estamos melhorando gradativamente
9389777 precisamos melhorar a qualidade no passe final no futebol quanto mais simples melhor vamos seguir trabalhando a equipe em cima dos advers rios para n o sermos surpreendidos
