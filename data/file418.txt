4180003 sometimes it comes down to who can fake the other person out sooner or who buckles under pressure or who bluffs and who can call it
4180004 there are certainly situations where coaches send athletes out for the wrong weight
4180005 could cost them money could cost them a medal could cost them a place on the team

4180025 we are pleased to see clearsight s continued investment in the development of testing tools that help telecommunication operators better operate and manage their network infrastructure
4180026 what ever barack wants is fine and dandy with me im just grateful this country still lets women vote we still can vote right
4180027 he has not shown that the u s has either as a matter of deliberate policy or official indiffernce required or allowed its combatants to engage in widespread actions in violation of humanitarian law
4180028 no matter how much i wanted to i could not convince myself that killing someone was right
4180029 i have already missed a large chunk of my young sons life and i was willing to sacrifice any more lost time with him especially during his formative years
4180030 because it is an act of aggression with no defensive basis it has been supported by pretenses that cannot withstand even elementary scrutiny first before the u s dropped the first bomb it was quite evident that iraq had no weapons of mass destruction second the bush administration had the gall to exploit the american publics fear of terrorists by making the absurd assertion that a secular batthist government was working with a fundamentalist terrorist group there was nevery any intelligence to substantiate this third the notion that the u s wants to export democracy to iraq is laughable democracy is by the people not an appointed puppet theater
4180031 a u s soldier who deserted his iraq bound regiment and sought asylum in canada said the u s war in iraq was illegal and he accused the united states of committing war crimes pfc jeremy hinzman 25 is believed to be the first u s soldier to apply for refugee status in canada after refusing combat duty in iraq
4180032 i was told in basic training that if im given an illegal or immoral order it is my duty to disobey it
4180033 whether a country lives under freedom or tyranny or whatever else thats the collective responsibility of the people of that country
4180034 this is a very disappointing decision it puts canada more fully in complicity with an illegal and immoral war jeremy will probably end up back here at fort bragg thats usually what happens
4180035 i applied for conscientious objector status in the u s army because i realized that i cannot kill a fellow humna being but my application was denied i knew that in iraq i would be ordered to take part in combat operations or other actions that are against my principles
4180036 nga and i knew canada had welcomed many americans like us during the vietnam war and we knew canada had refused to join the invasion of iraq
4180037 sending jeremy and his family back to the u s where he would face harsh punishment would be cruel
4180038 it would fly in the face of the motion adopted by the house of commons on june 3 which called on the harper government to stop all deportation proceedings against these conscientious objectors
4180039 jeremy hinzman 29 had filed for a pre removal risk assessment and permanent residency on humanitarian and compassionate grounds with citizenship and immigration canada in january after several prior failed attempts to gain refugee status today he was told that both of those applications had been rejected and he must leave the country by sept 23
4180040 obviously were disappointed but life goes on and well make the most of it wherever we end up
4180041 im disappointed but i think that every soldier that has refused to fight in iraq has done a good thing and im not ashamed
4180042 robidoux said hinzman who lives in toronto with his wife and two children plans to take a close look at the decisions before deciding how to proceed
4180043 federal ndp citizenship and immigration critic olivia chow who put foward the june 3rd parliament motion called the decision to expell jeremy mean spirited she called on citizenship and immigration minister diane finley to hald the deporation of hinzman and other resisters immediately
4180044 the war resisters support campaign is calling on supporters across canada to urgently continue to put pressure on the minority conservative government to immediately cease deportation proceedings against other us war resisters and to respect the will of canadians and their elected representatives by implementing the motion adopted by parliament on june 3rd please see the page for what you can do

4180056 its hard to escape the conclusion that at some point our extraordinary housing boom cannot continue indefinitely into the future
4180057 while local economies may experience significant speculative price imbalances a national severe price distortion seems most unlikely in the united states given its size and diversity
4180058 i think the worst of this may well be over

4180064 we believe our ima hybrid system is best suited for smaller vehicles where the fuel efficiency gains are the greatest
4180065 the challenge especially with small cars is to bring the price down to where more people can afford it and that is our goal for this new hybrid model to make it affordable for a new generation of car buyers
4180066 despite the jump in inflation readings for july we have rising conviction that inflation readings for august and now even september will be more favorable thanks to the sustained trend in retail gasoline and natural gas prices
4180067 the real eye opener was the jump in clothing prices
4180068 one month is hardly a trend but with import prices jumping we may be now seeing apparel adding to inflation rather than restraining it it is also a warning that we could be seeing price increases in other areas as the import cost rises spread through the economy

4180074 wow i expected less bigotry among foodies but i guess i was wrong big frown and about the xenu rumour ive been in scientology since 1994 and even was in the sea org for a bit and have never read this story anywhere except the internet such crap the person who started the thing ought to spend his time writting sci fi novels instead of bothering churches if you dont want it fine but dont pick on other peoples beliefs just because you dont agree if someone talks to you about their religion just firmly say no and theyll go away ive done it with other orgs and religions and it always works for me so maybe youre not being firm enough grow up people this is forum for food amp services and leave the religions out of it even if you think they are idiotic and strange

4180078 this idea if surowiecki is reporting it rightly sounds very wrongheaded to me but it sounds like just the sort of idea that some people would take seriously so maybe it is worthwhile to say something about it here

4180080 we can make more money in mobile than we do in the desktop eventually and the reason is the mobile computer is more targeted think about it you carry your phone and your phone knows all about you we can do a very very targeted ad over time we will make more money from mobile advertising not now but over time
4180081 while these services will be a powerful force in our lives they are a potential privacy nightmare
4180082 these services are all being sold to consumers as only providing real benefit no one is talking about the fact they are about building and collecting more data not just about the content you like but where you go and where you are at the moment

4180088 the third time it happened i was standing there and i got on to the bus and said you have to let this child on the bus
4180089 a lot of kids go to that school from out of zone and rely on that bus to get to school
4180090 one driver didnt even open the door he just yelled out school bus
4180091 these changes were communicated to our people and the driver concerned was counseled on the new process
4180092 our charter states quite clearly that school children can travel on both public and school buses
4180093 i just dont understand why he had to take those kind of chances
4180094 yesterday the us men had disappointing days in both gymnastics and greco roman wrestling
4180095 they make you detach yourself from your emotions and we can seem uncaring
4180096 thats why the emotional experience of patients can be so depressing
4180097 if we really focus on making a safe and healthy environment for health professionals we are less likely to lose staff overseas and as a consequence we will provide more humane care for patients
4180098 cameron has obviously been a huge influence in the changing of attitudes towards patients in new zealand
4180099 itsps nice to know that five years after his death he still lives on
4180100 its not fair on waitakere people and its certainly not fair on north shore the people of waitakere just have nowhere else to go

4180146 coal production especially is undergoing a dramatic renaissance as the nineteenth century has returned to haunt the twenty first century hundreds of thousands of miners are now working under conditions that would have appalled charles dickens extracting the dirty mineral that allows china to open two new coal fueled power stations every week meanwhile the total consumption of fossil fuels is predicted to increase at least 55 over the next generation with international oil exports doubling in volume
4180147 if this seems unduly apocalyptic consider that most climate models project impacts that will uncannily reinforce the present geography of inequality one of the pioneer analysts of the economics of global warming petersen institute fellow william r cline recently published a country by country study of the likely effects of climate change on agriculture by the later decades of this century even in the most optimistic simulations the agricultural systems of pakistan a 20 decrease from current farm output predicted and northwestern india a 30 decrease are likely to be devastated along with much of the middle east the maghreb the sahel belt southern africa the caribbean and mexico twenty nine developing countries will lose 20 or more of their current farm output to global warming while agriculture in the already rich north is likely to receive on average an 8 boost
4180148 it will become impractical to constrain atmospheric carbon dioxide the greenhouse gas produced in burning fossil fuels to a level that prevents the climate system from passing tipping points that lead to disastrous climate changes that spiral dynamically out of humanitys control

4180188 barack obama wants you to inflate your car tires yes thats right inflate your tires thats barack obamas solution to the high gas prices we pay in new mexico every day
4180189 this is the same barack obama who told a crowd of wealthy san francisco liberals that people who live in small towns cling to their religion and guns because theyre bitter
4180190 now he opposes producing more oil and gas here at home and opposes lowering your gas tax this summer
4180191 we could save all the oil theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups

4180206 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation

4180211 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
4180212 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
4180213 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
4180214 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000

4180217 the vast expanses of glaciers massed on average 1 6 miles deep contain enough water to raise sea levels worldwide by 23 feet should they melt or otherwise slip into the ocean they would flood coastal capitals submerge tropical islands and generally redraw the worlds atlases the infusion of fresh water could slow or shut down the oceans currents plunging europe into bitter winter
4180218 this is distinctly alarmist and part of mr gores wake up call it is common ground that if greenland melted it would release this amount of water but only after and over millennia so that the armageddon scenario he depicts is not based on any scientific view

4180225 we are the only industrialized nation without a national policy to promote universal high speed internet access and it shows
4180226 most of our speed test users logged on with broadband connections such as dsl modem or fiber people with dial up connections didnt take the test because it took them too long so even these dismal statistics paint a rosier than reality picture of connection speeds across the country

4180231 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
4180232 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
4180233 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh

4180240 its acceptable for enterprise use if the security it provides is the same as other handsets in play
4180241 so i ask you to join with me to call on every candidate at every level to accept this challenge for america to be running on 100 percent zero carbon electricity in 10 years
4180242 we need to act now this is a generational moment a moment when we decide our own path and our collective fate
4180243 have warned that there is now a 75 percent chance that within five years the entire north polar ice cap will completely disappear during the summer months
4180244 the arctic ocean was much warmer than it is now for several millennia after the end of the last ice age we know this because there are trees buried in the tundra along what is now the arctic shore
4180245 we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires
4180246 herald a post civil rights america any more than his victory in november will mean that race as an issue has been vanquished in america
4180247 i am not persuaded that 20 000 additional troops in iraq is going to solve the sectarian violence there in fact i think it will do the reverse
4180248 we just have to slow down our economy and cut back our greenhouse gas emissions because we have to save the planet for our grandchildren
4180249 our 14 offices are part of a highly structured volunteer heavy plan to win in new hampshire
4180250 we are creating neighborhood teams with volunteers who are trained equipped and empowered to build a campaign organization in their own neighborhood
4180251 i think weve built on that grass roots effort from 2004
4180252 we took three days and the criticism lasted weeks and weeks it looked like we spent five weeks lying on the beach and we spent two hours
4180253 i also agree that the worlds problems arent caused by global warming
4180254 we only do 60 cities that leaves me 300 days a year to do something else
4180255 whatever i wrote last year is what i recorded this year
4180256 if the world needs savin and the polar caps are melting shouldnt we all check in and see if were destroying this sucker
4180257 its amazing that i can sell 35 million albums and have 50 million spins as a writer and one three minute song carries more weight than all of that combined
4180258 first of all you cant go make everyone understand what you do
4180259 now two years after that song comes out we go into iraq now all of a sudden im responsible for the iraq war i cant go tell everybody to listen to the words and tell them i have nothing to do with the iraq war my philosophy on that is i think we need to take care of afghanistan and get osama bin laden but im not going to apologize for being patriotic and wherever the troops go ill go there and play
4180260 i dont think anyone should listen to what stupid celebrities say if someone endorsing someone is going to change the way you vote then youre not taking advantage of your american right here everybody needs to educate themselves and vote the best they can
4180261 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
4180262 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
4180263 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
4180264 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
4180265 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
4180266 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
4180267 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
4180268 a great slideshows is determined by the type of interaction a presenter has with their slides
4180269 if the presenter is addicted to reading bullet points then everyone in the room suffers
4180270 we can keep blaming software for the putrid output but in reality we need to take responsibility
4180271 as communicators learning to create visual stories that connect with our audience is becoming imperative especially in light of global competitive pressure
4180272 my whole thing is that that i saw the dark knight i feel like im dumb because i feel like i dont get how many things that are so smart its like a ferrari engine of storytelling and script writing and im like thats not my idea of what i want to see in a movie i loved the prestige but didnt understand the dark knight didnt get it still cant tell you what happened in the movie what happened to the character and in the end they need him to be a bad guy im like i get it this is so high brow and so f king smart i clearly need a college education to understand this movie you know what f ck dc comics thats all i have to say and thats where im really coming from
4180273 robert downey is a fucking walking abortion what a tool
4180274 in spain they run from the bulls in argentina we wait for them
4180275 the answer is simple to power our country with 100 clean energy in ten years all we need is your help
4180276 without the slightest doubt the technology for a hydrogen economy exists or can be developed in reasonable time
4180277 the problem of maximizing power from sunlight has been known for at least 30 years and is primarily one of physical limitations not engineering technology
4180278 this is being done in a friendly and straightforward way
4180279 it is also all about what we can do to reduce our carbon footprint and greenhouse gases
4180280 these are all small things and they all add up
4180281 we believe our ima hybrid system is best suited for smaller vehicles where the fuel efficiency gains are the greatest
4180282 the challenge especially with small cars is to bring the price down to where more people can afford it and that is our goal for this new hybrid model to make it affordable for a new generation of car buyers
4180283 i have the coolest name of anyone who isnt actually a porn star
4180284 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
4180285 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
4180286 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
4180287 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
4180288 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4180289 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4180290 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
4180291 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
4180292 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
4180293 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
4180294 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
4180295 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
4180296 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
4180297 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4180298 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4180299 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
4180300 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
4180301 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
4180302 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
4180303 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
4180304 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
4180305 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
4180306 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
4180307 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4180308 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
4180309 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
4180310 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
4180311 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4180312 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
4180313 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
4180314 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
4180315 individualism puts conservatives at a huge disadvantage as the left swarms through the big institutions they love so dearly the education bureaucracy the colleges all the layers of government institutionalized science the liberal media the only thing that saves conservative politicians is the american people if they happen to feel like it
4180316 the greatest tyrannies are always perpetrated in the name of the noblest causes
4180317 government big enough to supply everything you need is big enough to take everything you have the course of history shows that as a government grows liberty decreases
4180318 the issue today is the same as it has been throughout all history whether man shall be allowed to govern himself or be ruled by a small elite
4180319 the clintons with their folie a deux determined to get four presidential terms two for him and two for her
4180320 and the whole shebang coming to a disastrous climax with hitler mussolini and stalin
4180321 considering what the current neo con president has actually succeeded in doing to the balance of power between the branches which far supasses fdrs now feeble looking attempts
4180322 bush has gotten away with dispicable acts that any civilized democracy should not tolerate
4180323 higher superstition the academic left and its quarrels with science
4180324 because in math and organic chemistry you find truths someone cannot say 2 2 5 or that a carbon molecule no longer has a molecular weight of 12
4180325 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
4180326 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
4180327 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
4180328 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
4180329 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
4180330 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
4180331 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
4180332 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
4180333 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
4180334 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
4180335 just so you all know we did set a record
4180336 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
4180337 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
4180338 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
4180339 an anonymous secondhand quotation from sen barack obama at a closed house democratic caucus meeting on july 29 caused an uproar among partisans it is an excellent example of how the pernicious use of unnamed sources so pervasive in washington can backfire on journalists and sources
4180340 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
4180341 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
4180342 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
4180343 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
4180344 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
4180345 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
4180346 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
4180347 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
4180348 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore
4180349 ill use every talent i possess and all my energy to try to bring back tolerance decency and generosity to the country i love
4180350 we need cleaner forms of energy and we need them fast
4180351 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
4180352 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
4180353 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
4180354 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
4180355 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
4180356 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
4180357 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
4180358 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
4180359 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
4180360 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
4180361 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
4180362 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
4180363 its the first big unequivocal test about what this possible president really thinks
4180364 youve got to be sure that you get the right person the person has got to be of presidential stature has got to be someone you can be comfortable with work with and help you as president compatibility is very crucial
4180365 the chemistry between us had been correct but not warm
4180366 you dont want it to be a reason for people to question your judgment
4180367 employees here dont know where hell get the ethanol there are only gas pumps here
4180368 our dangerous over reliance on carbon based fuels is at the core of all three of these challenges the economic environmental and national security crises
4180369 seven words that can change the world reveals the astonishing simple truths that have the power to forever transform our world for the better while freeing our minds from the enslavement of limiting beliefs this is not a text for the simple minded it is a guiding philosophy for the mindful intelligent few who are wise enough to seek out and recognize the higher simplicities of truly purposeful living
4180370 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and the planet began to heal
4180371 anybody gone into whole foods lately and seen what they charge for arugula
4180372 as you may know a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
4180373 normally there is something peculiar about us politicians we all have our foibles david cameron is remarkably free of such flaws he does very normal things like go down to tesco and having his bike stolen
4180374 who is this guy what does he what to do what does he mean by change and what has he done

4180378 id love to have breakfast with you just the three of us without cameras and lights and tell you why i feel so strongly about this
4180379 utopians in the american vein who both believed in power but bridges wanted to see it redistributed abram wanted to see it concentrated
4180380 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
4180381 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
4180382 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
4180383 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
4180384 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
4180385 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
4180386 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
4180387 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
4180388 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
4180389 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
4180390 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
4180391 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
4180392 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
4180393 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
4180394 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
4180395 this boat is going to be the toyota prius of the houseboat business
4180396 it is the most eco friendly houseboat anywhere in the country
4180397 gore will consume a lot more fuel driving to and from the lake than he will ever use cruising on this houseboat
4180398 climate confusion how global warming hysteria leads to bad science pandering politicians and misguided policies that hurt the poor
4180399 we are a debt relief agency amp have proudly helped people file for bankruptcy for over 30 yrs
4180400 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
4180401 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
4180402 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
4180403 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
4180404 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
4180405 well im voting for barack obama hell help with global warming
4180406 it would take as long as 15 years that is until 2023 to go from starting a pilot plant to proving the technology will work
4180407 we have to store radioactive waste for 250 000 years
4180408 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
4180409 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
4180410 we are pleased to note ofcom has vindicated the ipccs claim against channel 4 in spirit and in substance
4180411 it is entirely appropriate people should bear a cost if only of unpopularity and criticism for speaking freely however the cost should be reasonable and not disproportionate there should not be in the words of a famous supreme court decision a chilling effect on free speech
4180412 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
4180413 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
4180414 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
4180415 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
4180416 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
4180417 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
4180418 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
4180419 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
4180420 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
4180421 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
4180422 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
4180423 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
4180424 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
4180425 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
4180426 make s the researchers own experience a topic of investigation in its own right
4180427 an autobiographical genre of writing that displays multiple layers of consciousness connecting the personal to the cultural
4180428 feel the truth of their stories and to become coparticipants engaging the storyline morally emotionally aesthetically and intellectually
4180429 in problem posing education people develop their power to perceive critically the way they exist in the world with which and in which they find themselves they come to see the world as not a static reality but as a reality in progress in transformation humboldt 2
4180430 look john kerry has been vetted he ran for president i think he would be a strong choice hed be a good choice especially in the context of foreign policy
4180431 it is very important for marines to stay fit and relieve stress and the fact that we have a facility set up right outside our work space helps us maintain fitness
4180432 you see guys come out to the gym during their breaks often times these marines dont have time for much else
4180433 we want to see the iraqis put their face on the mission while we are here to provide over watch and reassure them they are doing right
4180434 the cohesion and camaraderie in addition to training has prepared the leadership as well as the individual marine to successfully complete every mission
4180435 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
4180436 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
4180437 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
4180438 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
4180439 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
4180440 a thirst for oil comes back to haunt a nation of gas guzzlers
4180441 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
4180442 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
4180443 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
4180444 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
4180445 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
4180446 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
4180447 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
4180448 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
4180449 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
4180450 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
4180451 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
4180452 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
4180453 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
4180454 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
4180455 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
4180456 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
4180457 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
4180458 some facts of our biology are ideally shaped for music which pours through them as beautifully as light through a stained glass window ackerman 216
4180459 m ost of america understands that the competence bar is set so low for gov george w bush of texas that its practically lying on the ground
4180460 doesnt seem to realize that in the real world people hate eddie haskell
4180461 for every complex problem there is a solution that is simple neat and wrong
4180462 de facto slogan has become real men dont think things through
4180463 every day that the campaign is about race is a good day for john mccain
4180464 he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
4180465 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4180466 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4180467 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4180468 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4180469 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4180470 being a past instructor of the pasadena kids safety academy i appreciate and respect that the safety girls double checked their facts before putting the information in their lyrics they then presented the information in their music and in a way that gets the attention of their audience quickly while instructing them how to deal with safety issues the best part is the children dont even realize they are learning
4180471 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
4180472 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
4180473 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
4180474 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
4180475 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
4180476 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
4180477 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4180478 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4180479 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4180480 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis

4180499 an illegal alien from mexico pedro espinoza allegedly asked that of jamiel shaw jr 17 before espinoza shot and killed him shaw a promising high school student athlete wooed by stanford and rutgers was gunned down at 8 40 p m just three doors from his los angeles home where his father jamiel shaw sr awaited his arrival from the mall shaws mother anita learned the news of her sons march 2 shooting death while serving as an army sergeant in iraq edwin ramos an illegal alien from el salvador on june 22 allegedly gunned down and killed tony bologna and his sons michael 20 and matthew 16 the bologna family coming back from a barbecue in their suv apparently blocked ramos car in a san francisco intersection according to reports after the bologna vehicle backed up and let the ramos car pass by ramos allegedly opened fire on the family the common factor in these killings as with so many others the alleged killers came to the country illegally federal officials estimate that 40 000 of the 170 000 inmates held in los angeles county jails each year are illegal immigrants and in the cases of espinoza and ramos the police had previously arrested each and for reasons that remain unclear the authorities either never referred the arrested alien to immigration and customs enforcement for deportation or ice failed to institute deportation proceedings
4180500 i think smacking is a good idea because children who do the wrong thing will learn to not do it again
4180501 children who do not listen need to be disciplined so they wont do it again if theyve done a bad thing
4180502 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4180503 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4180504 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4180505 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4180506 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4180507 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4180508 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4180509 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4180510 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4180511 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4180512 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4180513 im just back from a vacation in portland ore a blue america town with obama signs everywhere its the kind of thing that leads one to suppose that senator obamas victory in november is a done deal you get the same impression from looking at magazine stands or even just listening to conversations in crowds and elevators its all obama all the time while poor john mccain galumphs around geography challenged and unfocused but the urban collegetown sorts who swoon over mr obama are not most americans no matter how many of them surround him in ecstasy when he makes a speech nor of course are black people anything approaching most of america
4180514 as we are all noticing mr obama with his rock star appeal still has yet to clinch the deal and the tough nuts are older less educated whites and less affluent than the ones who find mr obama so exciting as steven warshawsky tells us in 2004 john kerry got about half of these peoples vote i e 55 of those with incomes less than 50 000 47 of those without college degrees he also got 88 of the black vote and he lost despite seeming a done deal among many the problem is that all indications are that if the election happened now mr obama would get somewhat less of this white segments vote than mr kerry did in the primaries this crowd largely went for hillary clinton it would only take a small percentage of such voters tipping to mr mccain for mr obama to lose the election and even if he got every single black vote less than 2 of a white shift would cancel out its effect instantly the breathless speculations about the portentousness of this moment in american history and commentary on michelle obamas fashion sense would be relics of a bygone era would racism be the culprit maybe the new york times cbs poll revealing that one in 20 white voters will not vote for a black candidate for president hardly shows that america is still all about racism it shows how vastly different this nation is than it was 20 years ago however the fact remains that this small number could decide a close election like this one or it would appear that many whites are simply put off by mr obamas association with the race baiting theatrics of the reverend jeremiah wright this need not be racist all of us are wary of someone who seems like they might hate us then there are those who dont have a sense of what mr obama is about these are people who are not especially intrigued by his multicultural biography they just want to know what he has to offer on this topic we hear this week that the obama folks are about to put out a book summarizing his policy proposals and reprinting some of his speeches a for effort but this wont do it for one thing a book is not the best way to get your message out when the people who need to hear it tend to have a less intimate relationship with the printed page than obama fans who subscribe to the atlantic
4180515 to avoid john kerrys fate barack obama must craft a message designed for oral communication focused on a compact number of points such as employment health care and national security the message will include yes slogans and soft pedal long lined argumentation the elegant carefully reasoned speech in the wake of the wright scandal only had so much effect even press pundits often came away with sound bite misinterpretations such as he compared his grandmother to wright humans speak in and recall speech in utterance packets of about seven words the obama folks need to work with that think ending welfare as we know it and mend it dont end it and not more about hope the preacherly note goes over great with educated whites and with black people but has less pull elsewhere i sense that mr obama despite his political savvy is under the impression that he can get elected on the basis of reflectiveness but reflectiveness alone has never gotten anyone into the white house and evidently charm is not going to get mr obama any further than it already has
4180516 last week saw three human rights episodes play out in russia china and the united states these events show us how america stacks up against the rest of the world this past week the world saw the resurgent danger of the old soviet union in the modern russian federation russian military forces invaded the sovereign neighboring nation of georgia although russia claims to be aiding people in the disputed georgian province of south ossetia the reality is that covert russian agents have been fomenting upheaval and russia had been moving forces into place for this invasion prime minister vladimir putin is taking russia back to an autocratic government political opponents are being jailed critics silenced strategic assets seized the bear has returned putin is also using this to send a message his message to europe is that the russian bear will maul any who oppose it senator john mccain was right to criticize president bushs 2001 claim to have looked into putins soul and seen a friend as mr mccain says when he looks at mr putin he sees three letters kgb
4180517 we saw a quieter version of authoritarian oppression in china the white house press corps was detained for several hours at the beijing airport missing president bushs first event the chinese government wanted to inspect every piece of reporters equipment the action reinforced that china has no concept of a free press with the right to report whatever it finds this same behavior was seen by chinas refusing to grant entry to the games for an american athlete who was an outspoken advocate of human rights and also in expelling three americans for speaking on human rights in tiananmen square all this of course justifies president bushs remarks in taiwan before the games condemning chinas human rights abuses on a less prominent note we see how china tried to rid beijing of smog to provide nice visuals during the games just shut down the private sector the chinese government ordered factories closed banned millions of people from driving and took other steps to create a picture perfect setting how would the american people and press react to our government essentially ordering millions of people temporarily out of work the protests would be deafening and of course our constitution would not allow it
4180518 yet in a story that has already been forgotten the u s reaffirmed its commitment to human rights last week in the hamdan trial a military tribunal at guantanamo bay acquitted salim hamdan of one of the two charges against him a conspiracy charge and in convicting him of supporting terrorism they gave him less than six years instead of life in prison the military judge a navy captain then counted time served hamdan could thus go free early next year the media refused to carry the most obvious point of that story military tribunals work these are not show trials hamdan beat one charge and could be out of prison soon although the media usually didnt mention anything beyond this man being osama bin ladens driver hamdan had two surface to air missiles in his car trunk that he was transporting across an international border when he was arrested this fellow may well be a very bad actor yet when freedoms at stake america errs on the side of liberty and leniency in russia or china hamdan would either be imprisoned for life without a trial or simply executed
4180519 china and russia showed americans how human rights and human lives can be easily discarded by would be super powers the actions of these two nations make complaints about gitmo seem overblown but dont expect the left to admit it

4180528 there was some argument before me as to whether it was fair and reasonable for defendants to have to pay the medical expenses when all they were doing was exercising their statutory rights to have a blood sample taken
4180529 the district court is a creature of statute and it follows that the power to make the order must be derived from a statutory provision

4180532 will have tens of millions of dollars more from them supporting the business as we go through the recovery plan
4180533 it is about our ability to get the property market moving again and start to deal with some of these assets
4180534 i have seen absolutely nothing in my time around the board table that would lead me to believe that the company was managed in a bad way
4180535 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4180536 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4180537 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4180538 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4180539 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4180540 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4180541 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again

4180555 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
4180556 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
4180557 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
4180558 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
4180559 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4180560 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4180561 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4180562 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4180563 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4180564 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4180565 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4180566 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4180567 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4180568 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4180569 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4180570 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4180571 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4180572 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4180573 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4180574 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4180575 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4180576 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4180577 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4180578 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4180579 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4180580 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4180581 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4180582 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4180583 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4180584 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4180585 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4180586 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4180587 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4180588 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4180589 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4180590 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4180591 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4180592 who are open to doing something on the production side
4180593 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4180594 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4180595 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4180596 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4180597 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4180598 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4180599 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4180600 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4180601 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4180602 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them

4180613 the issue is that in many ways mitt romney has had very definite swings of position not just on one or two things but on many of the issues
4180614 a lot of the republicans i know are not necessarily comfortable with romney
4180615 this is not just the same old message with new methods

4180669 there arent any real rules or guidelines for the process but its plausible it could get approved under the current administration
4180670 the facts are what they are and the facts are on our side
4180671 make no mistake if this monster monopoly is approved it will be third time unlucky for consumers
4180672 it will still be bad for passengers bad for competition and bad for the u k and u s aviation industry
4180673 all we are trying to do is put ourselves to compete more competitively
4180674 this agreement just puts us on a level playing field
4180675 we wanted to wait until the market actually demonstrated access to london so we could take the wind out of that argument
4180676 american is looking to cover their costs no company can go on charging less for their product than it costs to produce it
4180677 i believe this is also good news for the industry
4180678 the job of the regulators is to assess the long term impact of the alliance on competition not to provide special protection from the immediate challenges of the economic cycle with which every other airline has to deal
4180679 we believe our proposed cooperation is an important step towards ensuring that we can compete effectively with rival alliances and manage through the challenges of record fuel prices and growing economic concerns
4180680 britain has a strong and rich history of inventors and innovators and they do work extremely well under the pressure of a challenge
4180681 we now need to put these ideas to good use
4180682 the drc does have jurisdiction to determine the appropriate sanction and or order for compensation arising out of the dispute between chelsea and mutu mutu is not entitled to object to fifa jurisdiction
4180683 if a tourist arrives and says he wants a parasol for 10 days we look at him in amazement and build a statue in his honour
4180684 what worries us most is the phenomenon of hit and run tourists
4180685 spend less eat less in the restaurants watch their shopping in the camp shop and at the cafe and on the beach they are just buying drinks and ice creams for the children rather than meals
4180686 to show that my place is not just for the rich weve decided to have a special tourist menu for 200 euros
4180687 thanks to safer vehicles aggressive law enforcement and our efforts countless families were spared the devastating news that a loved one was not coming home

4180689 the greed that the owners of this company are getting into that will ruin this once upon a time nice startup
4180690 we dont really want to give any info on how we use it as an investigative tool to help the bad guys
4180691 it is an investigative tool for us and it is a very new investigative tool
4180692 ive seen them in cases from new york city to small towns whoever can afford to get the equipment and plant it on a car
4180693 and of course its easy to do you can sneak up on a car and plant it at any time
4180694 but i dont think thats something detectives would be too happy to put out there like that
4180695 they do have different techniques they like to use on suspects but they dont really want people to know
4180696 in the event that such a transaction would present itself
4180697 we have the necessary flexibility to do something strategic with either of these businesses today
4180698 weve done our homework and things like that we are slowly building
4180699 there are guys here who are eight weeks into their international career but there are also guys who are 10 years into it
4180700 you have to have guys who are feeding off each other and enjoying themselves and i think thats what we are getting
4180701 the coaching staff are allowing us that balance and the guys are installing the discipline you dont want to go too far one way or the other
4180702 you could do 50 000 hectares if you only raised so much cash
4180703 theres a world wide interest in soft commodities and this is the only vehicle they can get involved in milk thats listed in the world
4180704 whilst eventually we anticipate some easing of dairy prices from current levels the outlook through the medium to long term remains buoyant
4180705 is likely to undertake a further capital raising within the next few months
4180706 it was a good result good comments but the capital raising has put a damper on the share price theyre obviously looking to get a lot bigger which will be extremely good for pgg wrightson because im sure the management fee will get a lot bigger
4180707 there were many pedestrians from the party out on the footpath
4180708 we all cry at different times its not just a shining star but also a young life that weve lost libbys family have suffered beyond words
4180709 everyone at regents holds their breath when we know he bensley is going to court
4180710 oh man i was surprised man and that just made me feel more at home
4180711 i see the tattoo on the face i seen some tv shows about when people go get those so im shocked to just be here and to just be engulfed into the culture
4180712 it has taken a long time but hes made some massive improvements so he has got there on merit
4180713 aussie mclean did some really good work with him during the hurricanes season and i think what maa has learned is you can tackle low enjoy the game and still play at a really high level instead of getting tied up and anxious and over the top physically
4180714 we think he has that game and we are seeing it at training
4180715 when you have good kickers around you though it is hard he has dan carter inside him
4180716 im a great believer that well rounded skills make you a better player and the ability to make the opposition think about what you are going to do makes you a much more dangerous player
4180717 we immediately dispatched the westpac rescue helicopter from christchurch with a st john advanced paramedic on board to tekapo

4180720 it takes her clark about 24 hours to tune out of her special work environment and then shes like everybody else
4180721 i am convinced that honoring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4180722 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect senator obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again

4180726 i just wanted to perform till the end winning or losing was not in my mind
4180727 i have heard stories that there was a tender for 2 5m all that henderson asked for was expressions of interest
4180728 he had not got to the stage of discussing price with anyone there was no offer on the table
4180729 sometimes they say this is the sort of price area we are interested in talking about and these are the conditions its a concept we have used regularly
4180730 no one puts a price every wide boy in town can be lining up for a property and they are all being cute or you have got serious players
4180731 an expression of interest is a worthless piece of paper an offer is capable of acceptance
4180732 obtain valuations and conclude sale and purchase agreements at those valuations
4180733 we thought when the council deal went through we would get paid but when we contacted them earlier this week they said there was no money to pay us
4180734 i think its going to be a challenge but were still optimistic we can do it
4180735 i think you probably know we got a late start on this whole thing
4180736 ya know less than half the time of a normal games organizing committee to get this done
4180737 once we finished the invitational games and we started putting together our operational plans for the 2009 games we did a reset on our budget and we came up with a 18 million budget for world winter games
4180738 we are cutting back on some of the things outside the competitions and sports and some of the things specific to the athletes
4180739 well you know its a tough economic environment were not sure how everyone will respond we know theyll respond i think the hard part is we dont know much
4180740 i miss you very much we know what happened to mom

4180743 he worked in the department of foreign affairs and the ontario government
4180744 observed that the market is well supplied with current commercial oil stocks standing above their five year average the conference further noted with concern that the current price environment does not reflect market fundamentals as crude oil prices are being strongly influenced by the weakness in the us dollar rising inflation and significant flow of funds into the commodities market

4180761 honorable mention goes to the 2008 chevy malibu which would be a great mid size sedan for college graduates for just a few thousand dollars more
4180762 for under 15 000 you can get a brand new mazda3 thats reliable and fun to drive
4180763 for families on a budget look at one or two year old models for added savings
4180764 you could pick up a five or six year old model save yourself thousands of dollars and still have one heck of a truck
4180765 college students are usually on limited budgets and they can very easily save money on gas by driving smarter and keeping an eye on a few of the vehicle components that affect fuel economy
4180766 by the end of the week before classes start the students are comfortable and confident theyve made close friends and are familiar with the campus
4180767 its not really an engineering project its multi disciplinary and its a great way for students to interact and learn about campus resources
4180768 my landlord has told me to vacate the house because i indicated to him that there was no way i could raise the foreign currency to buy the fuel coupons houses to rent are difficult to get these days and that means that my four children wife and i might end up living in the open if we fail to secure alternative lodgings
4180769 as it is i am struggling to keep the children in school we barely have enough food and i need to settle a huge bill after my wife stayed for two weeks in hospital where she was operated on for breast cancer god knows where on earth i would raise that kind of money
4180770 we have seen many property owners arrested for charging rent in foreign currency but there is no law that i am aware of that stipulates that a landlord cannot ask for fuel coupons so that way we are able to dodge the law while at the same time getting our rent in a form that enables us to keep our money stable
4180771 because that would leave me with the burden of having to go out onto the streets to sell it again
4180772 fuel coupons are now firmly a form of currency in a country whose people will stop at nothing to ensure that they are protected against a hyperinflationary environment
4180773 like foreign currency the value of the coupons does not change even if kept for a long time and that way service providers realise that they are able keep their money in a stable form
4180774 in other words coupons are a replacement for foreign currency and insistence on their usage by those who offer services or sell products amply indicates the level to which our economy has dollarised
4180775 i was in fourth or fifth grade and i didnt have a hand pump so we took out the bike pump and dan filled it up in one pump
4180776 the air bladder is shaking its got so much air in it but he says i think maybe one more pump
4180777 i was taking some snaps pre practice and i looked down at my ankle brace and it goes pop
4180778 the glue that held the velcro melted then i go to tape it and it was so humid that the tape wouldnt stick so practice hadnt started and my ankle brace is essentially broken
4180779 but you just think to yourself man i just practiced and now im coming out to this
4180780 i always thought there was some magic in those sessions because the songs seemed to acquire a haunting almost bittersweet quality as we laid down the tracks roberta flack recorded this song several years later but i have always been a fan of bettes original vocal on this version
4180781 das ist nicht wie 1968 bei der invasion der tschechoslowakei als russland seine nachbarn bedrohen eine hauptstadt besetzen eine regierung st rzen konnte und damit davonkam

4180783 reclaiming public spaces as a space for public imagination and enlightenment where they have become propagandistic barriers to thought and awareness
4180784 wise the fuck up fuck off and go die in a ditch
4180785 i can see it picking up well start seeing it from february onwards but for the rest of the year it will still be tough
4180786 beyond that it has become clear new zealand is in a recession and that has a great impact in what we are able to do
4180787 it has been volatile for the last three years if it stays at 70c for a while it allows us to do our planning and its not an issue
4180788 how close was david beckham to joining ac milan instead of the los angeles galaxy extremely close he says but things worked out for the best becks has taken major league soccer by storm even if the hype machine from last summer has died down the media attention may be less but beckham has appeared in every game for the galaxy and has contributed to their league leading attack
4180789 becks sat down with massimo lopes pegna for a candid chat on the quality of mls what he misses about europe his england ambitions which players impress him most right now and much more
4180790 this dynamic sector has both tremendous opportunity and growth as the 78 million baby boomers start to age and move toward their retirement years i look forward to working directly with gary as we focus our strategy of promoting and providing education for long term care insurance
4180791 i am your nightmare i am the shape in the dark
4180792 so im pretty much fucked in the ass about this whole ordeal
4180793 so im pretty much fucked in the ass about this whole ordeal
4180794 i am your nightmare i am the shape in the dark
4180795 there is heavy demand because of the economics of the country at the moment
4180796 demand for food parcels has grown since last year because of seasonal workers who are between seasons and because of the high cost of food and electricity
4180797 it the demand is a poor reflection on society really but we do have really generous people in this community who give week after week like pat the sausage man who drops off a box of sausages each week
4180798 we are just glad to be able to support the salvation army
4180799 i have been here for 12 years and the whole time we have been donating a box each week and it goes back well before my time
4180800 in july we gave out 50 and 60 in june
4180801 it is mostly food parcels for families with only a few individuals
4180802 in may we gave away 40 parcels compared to 17 in may last year
4180803 may was a really big month but we still dont know why
4180804 we are really fortunate we get a lot of donations particularly from members of the church the organisation will go to the supermarket and buy supplies if we get too low
4180805 i have been doing this for 17 years and this is the worst winter we have ever had
4180806 between three and eight food parcels are going out a week
4180807 a food parcel will only feed a family for three or four days but good budget advice will help them for a lifetime

4180811 the shareholders are not interested in selling cheap if people are looking for a bargain they should not be looking to alana
4180812 you could do 50 000 hectares if you only raised so much cash
4180813 theres a world wide interest in soft commodities and this is the only vehicle they can get involved in milk thats listed in the world
4180814 whilst eventually we anticipate some easing of dairy prices from current levels the outlook through the medium to long term remains buoyant
4180815 is likely to undertake a further capital raising within the next few months
4180816 it was a good result good comments but the capital raising has put a damper on the share price theyre obviously looking to get a lot bigger which will be extremely good for pgg wrightson because im sure the management fee will get a lot bigger
4180817 will have tens of millions of dollars more from them supporting the business as we go through the recovery plan

4180820 were very confident because most of the effort has gone into agreeing the commercial terms within the term sheet so hopefully the next round is not a difficult process to get over the line

4180825 theres no specific bank facility to the project its a business banking facility that goes into the company and we spread it over the seven villages we have as they require it

4180832 if obamas candidacy represented nothing more than the spark for this profound initiative to unite the working class and defeat the pernicious influence of racism it would be a transformative candidacy that would advance progressive politics for the long term

4180845 it takes her clark about 24 hours to tune out of her special work environment and then shes like everybody else
4180846 i have heard stories that there was a tender for 2 5m all that henderson asked for was expressions of interest
4180847 he had not got to the stage of discussing price with anyone there was no offer on the table
4180848 sometimes they say this is the sort of price area we are interested in talking about and these are the conditions its a concept we have used regularly
4180849 no one puts a price every wide boy in town can be lining up for a property and they are all being cute or you have got serious players
4180850 an expression of interest is a worthless piece of paper an offer is capable of acceptance
4180851 obtain valuations and conclude sale and purchase agreements at those valuations
4180852 we thought when the council deal went through we would get paid but when we contacted them earlier this week they said there was no money to pay us

4180860 commercial whole loans are difficult or impossible to hedge and knowledgeable players in the commercial mortgage market are attempting to sell their positions while they still can so we may be seeing a sequel to august 2007 but without the fraudulent borrowers and without the no money down issues
4180861 one of the few financial firms that are playing offense and showing revenue growth
4180862 the market is pricing in a significant cut roughly 50 percent or more
4180863 we believe we will shortly be back to profitability and be able to earn the dividend
4180864 i prefer to get the yield lower by getting the stock price higher
4180865 if they announce tomorrow they cut the dividend it wouldnt surprise me
4180866 the options market has proven to be a good indicator of upcoming dividend changes
4180867 the number of properties that have been foreclosed on by the banks and still havent sold is the highest weve ever seen
4180868 likely delay the inevitable that most of those properties go into foreclosure
4180869 it is clear that far fewer homeowners are finding a way out of foreclosure
4180870 although the declines in notices of defaults seem promising much of this can be explained by the actions of just one lender
4180871 ninety one percent of the decline in notices of default since april can be attributed to countrywide financial unfortunately this is more likely due to the challenges of integrating two companies the size of countrywide financial and bank of america than it is a fundamental shift in foreclosure activity
4180872 it cant possibly make a difference youve brought a pistol to a nuclear war
4180873 the numbers are the worst weve seen and its not just the magnitude of the problem but the scope so many markets are affected
4180874 im taking a major loss ill probably have to bring a check to the closing
4180875 the bank is willing to do a short sale and we have an offer of 170 000 on the house but we believe the bank will turn that down
4180876 they hand over their keys and walk away from the homes
4180877 it takes time for people to recognize that these losses are real
4180878 with 3 9 million unsold homes on the market prices will have to come down even more before the market stabilizes
4180879 the number of properties that have been foreclosed on by the banks and still havent sold is the highest weve ever seen
4180880 in many areas with large concentrations of foreclosure sales homes are being purchased below replacement cost values
4180881 once the inventory is drawn down price pressure will return because the costs of construction are rising
4180882 a tremendous amount of cost pressure here that is affecting many many industries
4180883 beef and cheese are up but weve been able to mitigate that cost
4180884 although downside risks to growth remain the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern
4180885 the committee expects inflation to moderate later this year and next year
4180886 it would be a mistake to view this as a rolling over of the inflation problem and an endorsement of the feds policy to keep rates on hold
4180887 they are dragging their feet in forcing these banks to reserve realistically
4180888 some of these banks could have been closed two or three quarters earlier
4180889 do whats required to ensure the health of the fdic
4180890 we save a lot of banks by being able to work with them avoiding failures that would be costly to the insurance fund
4180891 the only ones that people see are the ones that fail
4180892 in some of these cases i believe regulators should act sooner than later to prevent future losses to the fund
4180893 ask yourself why would a borrower be interested in a lender thats three states away its probably because theyre having difficulty getting loans from banks that really know that community
4180894 a lot of people will have been caught out by the brutal nature of that reverse
4180895 the typical summer slowdown has been exacerbated by renewed fear over credit the direction of the economy and home price depreciation along with the sudden about face in the oil price and hedge fund losses
4180896 you are going to see stresses continue for financial institutions
4180897 financials find themselves back firmly entrenched in last place nearing all time bearish lows
4180898 banks have to reinvent themselves and find new ways to make money and that doesnt happen overnight
4180899 the strong performance weve seen off the bottom may be a bit premature
4180900 the problems in the mortgage market have put the nations housing in a downward spiral that will be hard to break
4180901 i think we all recognize that in a world of electronic trading where there are more venues and more opportunities where people may be able to hide their activity consolidating the review of insider trading activity was critical
4180902 we have immediately published this proposal for public comment because of its potential to increase the likelihood that those who engage in insider trading will be caught and punished
4180903 what started as a us financial crisis is morphing into a global economic crisis investors now expect a downturn of such intensity that it will prevent inflation from taking hold
4180904 we have seen an extraordinary sea change but this is very controversial investors may be reading too much into the fall in oil prices
4180905 it has become apparent that other economies are deteriorating fast and the whole decoupling thesis has started to come apart at the seams canada is frozen over we have arctic conditions in sweden a landslide in germany and the uk is falling off the white cliffs of dover
4180906 foreign exchange is a relative concept it is not that the us is in good shape just that others are slowing sharply central banks have been too worried about inflation when they should have been thinking about growth
4180907 long oil short banks has been the dominant trade of the credit crunch
4180908 it was almost the only game in town so to see such a dramatic reversal raises a lot of questions is there something deep seated in this slowdown
4180909 you can only stretch a piece of elastic so far before it snaps back we think this pessimism on the oil sector is overdone
4180910 watch out for the profits squeeze in the third quarter investors have turned a blind eye to the second round effects of inflation such as rising inflation it will take several months of slowing global growth to be sure that the inflationary dragon has been slain
4180911 us equities are back to 2001 levels of popularity sentiment has moved a long way not so cool britannia remains unloved
4180912 the upswing is over the extremely strong economic performance of recent years is in the past
4180913 the german economy has got to get through a rough patch for growth in the coming months but overall theres no reason for excessive pessimism based on the development of the first half of the year
4180914 once you remove the inflation shock consumer confidence could be relatively robust
4180915 im still fairly optimistic for germany we have chances for recovery by the end of the year
4180916 the labour market is for the time being in stagnation mood but not recession mood and that is the main reason why i am fairly optimistic
4180917 cheaper oil and the weaker euro exchange rate are certainly easing the burden for industry but with the euro it doesnt have an immediate impact
4180918 the outlook for industrial valves remain positive despite the bad news from the overall economy
4180919 home prices in the u s are likely to start to stabilize or touch bottom sometime in the first half of 2009 though prices could continue to drift lower through 2009 and beyond
4180920 a necessary condition for an end to the current global financial crisis is the stabilization of the price of homes in the u s stable home prices will clarify the level of equity in homes the ultimate collateral support for much of the financial worlds mortgage backed securities we wont really know the market value of the asset side of the banking systems balance sheet and hence banks capital until then
4180921 public policy can hasten this process by not prematurely propping up housing starts and by expanding the underlying demand for homes generally the most effective initiative though politically difficult would be a major expansion in quotas for skilled immigrants skilled immigrants tend to form new households by far the most important source of new home demand the number of new households in the u s is increasing at a rate of about 800 000 a year of which about a third are immigrants perhaps 150 000 of those are loosely classified as skilled a double or tripling of this number would markedly accelerate the absorption of unsold housing inventory for sale and hence help stabilize prices
4180922 its a good idea foreclosures dont help anybody its costly to the holder of the mortgage and disaster for the homeowner in the days before we sliced and diced mortgages into securities when the borrower got into trouble hed come to the assistant vice president of the local s amp l and get agreement to stretch out the payments or restructure the loans in a deal that worked for both parties until the recent surge in foreclosures more than half of all loans that went into foreclosure were cured without the sale of the property
4180923 u s home prices will stabilize only as the current huge 800 000 excess of vacant single family homes for sale is dramatically reduced and prices deflate to the level consistent with the historical rate of return on owning a home that prevailed before the price surge in the u s and elsewhere
4180924 new single family home completions are currently just barely under the rate of home demand generated by household formation and replacement needs only early next year will the current suppressed level of housing starts be reflected in completion levels consistent with a sufficiently rapid rate of liquidation to materially reduce the bloated inventory excess
4180925 we seem to be approaching a peak in the number of new foreclosures though the number in foreclosure will continue to rise for awhile
4180926 its the imbalance of supply and demand which causes prices to go down but its ultimately the valuation process of the use of the commodity which tells you where the bottom is for example the grain markets can have a huge excess of corn or wheat but the price never goes to zero itll stabilize at some level of prices where people are willing to hold the excess inventory we have little history but the same thing is surely true in housing as well we will get to the point where there will be willing holders of vacant single family dwellings and that will no longer act to depress the price level
4180927 the issue is how you get a viable mortgage market when this is all over what happens in 2010 or 2011
4180928 it does not alter the flawed model a new regulator does not have that capability
4180929 this was the ideal opportunity to come to grips with what is a fundamentally flawed model which privatizes profits and socializes losses which is fiscally tolerable in small amounts but in trillions of dollars it isnt
4180930 they should have wiped out the shareholders nationalized the institutions with legislation that they are to be reconstituted with necessary taxpayer support to make them financially viable as five or 10 individual privately held units and auctioned off the affordable housing programs should be put into gnma or another government agency by the time we have the next mortgage crisis the five or 10 individual companies would have diversified into other areas of finance and maybe one or two of them would fail but having been significantly downsized systemic risk would be avoided
4180931 when bear stearns was bailed out it was inevitable theres no credible argument for bailing out bear stearns and not the gses
4180932 untrue the law that stipulates that gses are not backed by the full faith and credit of the u s government is disbelieved the market believes the government guarantee is there foreigners believe the guarantee is there the only fiscal change is for someone to change the bookkeeping
4180933 they should have wiped out the shareholders nationalized the institutions with legislation that they are to be reconstituted with necessary taxpayer support to make them financially viable as five or 10 individual privately held units

4180936 we have fully explored and exhausted every avenue for securing this funding in a manner that least affects californias budget and immediate cash needs
4180937 will continue to work cooperatively with the receiver and the legislature to move forward in a fiscally responsible way to provide the necessary funding for the receivers efforts
4180938 the mega funds who are going public are looking for alternative revenue streams with more predictable cash flows
4180939 theyre having difficulty getting financing for deals and theyre always looking for opportunities for returns
4180940 were in a situation where smart people can look at debt opportunities and recognize real arbitrage
4180941 its a lot easier right now to distinguish between good debt and bad debt opportunities
4180942 at the present time as a result of the current supply and demand imbalance in the global credit markets we are investing primarily in senior and subordinated debt securities
4180943 the real question is what business is everyone going to be in
4180944 the business models for the large wall street firms and the private equity firms have to transform
4180945 the bank can swap the stock of assets from illiquid to liquid form it cant provide funding to finance investment that has to come from mobilising savings in the economy thats what the financial sector is there to do
4180946 it would be a very dangerous move to have a situation where the government saw its major role as guaranteeing lending
4180947 why should the taxpayer take on the risk of borrowing by individual borrowers some of whom are risky its the lenders who should take the risk
4180948 we dont guarantee lending to other forms of borrowing there is no reason why in the long run you need any guarantee of lending to the mortgage market
4180949 that we havent seen play out yet so we have to go through that process

4180997 it is not in the national interest to reject the better offer to go for an offer which is not in the best interest of the country i therefore invite members of this honourable house to oppose this motion

4180999 we purchased the washer and dryer set a few weeks ago
4181000 for 40 years ive alwyas had a kenmore heavy duty top load washer with the big agitator
4181001 bought this with matching dryer 18 months ago and the control board just went a 600 repair had no problems with the washing or operation up to that point i have bought many kenmore appliances and this was the only one that had a problem and at his price it is really sad that i had to replace it so soon rather than pay so much for the repair will be writing letters
4181002 love this machine it is fantastic it has the high efficiency and technology of a front loader but the convenience of a top loader it is so quiet that it is perfect if you have little ones at home during naptime or trying to watch tv since our laundry room is next to our family room it can fit so much laundry yet also gentle and efficient enough for just 1 peice of delicate clothing less trips to the dry cleaner too

4181005 the aim of the presence of u s forces in iraq is to serve the security and stability of iraq not to use iraq as a base to target the interests of our neighbors
4181006 it is in our interest to consult with our neighbors iran and other states so as not to be misunderstood
4181007 the issue of a security pact between iraq and the u s irritates the sensitivities of everybody the leaders and the states that are friends of iraq
4181008 the interference in determining the destiny of iraq will be harmful especially for the americans themselves they must not demand from iraq more than is required let the iraqi people choose how to live and what government they want
4181009 there is an iranian stance regarding this issue i confirmed this is an iraqi issue that is based on the iraqi national interest which aims to protect the sovereignty of iraq
4181010 you defended your land and justice was on your side
4181011 that is why you won with the assistance of russian peacekeepers i think that is an appropriate outcome

4181013 just a few minutes ago they russians entered poti in tanks
4181014 have received strict orders from the supreme commander in chief to apply wartime laws to looters
4181015 the united states of america stands with the democratically elected government of georgia we insist that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
4181016 we have information that american military transport aviation say they are delivering a certain humanitarian cargo to tbilisi airport though they said we had bombed the airport two days ago
4181017 lets ask them will they invite you the media to check whether it is humanitarian or not what is in it the cargo in reality it is of major concern to russians
4181018 this is not to say that what theyre doing is right but im saying there simply is no other feasible way
4181019 everything that was horrible about the old gi bill they changed and made it phenomenal
4181020 i wouldnt have gotten out you dont want to go from working in uniform in an exciting environment to working at a minimum wage job somewhere its kind of anticlimactic i wouldnt be here right now pursuing a commission if it wasnt for the gi bill
4181021 in the end i was getting about 1 500 a month gi bill without fail
4181022 people talk all the time about recruiters misleading people into joining the army recruiters told me this stuff about education benefits and i found everything to be totally true they funded my education 100 percent without any problems without any mistakes its a really great program
4181023 i would rather have the money given to me and if i could save a little bit extra i would like to have that liberty
4181024 when you start tying funds down you just have less discretion i would rather have a lump sum
4181025 the department finds no need for the kind of sweeping and expensive changes offered
4181026 we believe that is not necessarily true because if you look at the people that are signing up for the military these days they are folks who for whatever reason arent necessarily thinking about college
4181027 hopefully whats happening is the information is helping women keep themselves out of danger
4181028 men are taught how to fight from a young age
4181029 to defend themselves women need know how to physically hit and kick
4181030 ninety percent of self defense is preventing the attack and 10 percent is knowing how to handle an altercation
4181031 awareness is the most important element in realizing the difference between danger and safety
4181032 basically if the officer hears the noise first of all it has to be verified by the officer if he believes that the noise is loud and able to disturb somebody else that is it its an unreasonable amount of noise
4181033 when anyone goes to court they need to have a clear layout of what the law is
4181034 they need to understand how they clearly violated the law and i think that giving officers discretion to determine if someone is violating the law isnt doing due diligence to citizens that have to participate in local government and to citizens who have to defend themselves when they go to court there is not an actual concrete decibel level and way of measuring to determine if someone is breaking the law
4181035 when you have these repeated noise violations you have associated conditions that come with them
4181036 usually those associated conditions are things like noise and disturbances for loud parties late at night overcrowded parking on the streets or on the sidewalks litter and trash in garbage cans that may be left out for days and poor upkeep of rental property in residential areas
4181037 when you develop these partnerships its intended to encourage the spirit of cooperation where you are balancing the collective interest of all the citizens
4181038 the community participates in the identification and setting of priorities and applying appropriate resources
4181039 we have been working on neighborhood issues for the past two years with the neighborhood association board of realtors san marcos police department and other individuals off and on campus
4181040 i have been sending a letter each semester to students about living off campus and being aware of their neighbors needs as well as directing them to the city web pages and our off campus student services web pages since spring 2006
4181041 the second part of this is to expand the behaviors and conditions and host responsibility to include things like littering throwing trash in the neighbors yard public urination and any kind of disturbance of property
4181042 we cannot be mere spectators to this alarming issue lozadas case is a danger sign to all of us it tells us that this country has reached the situation where just about anyone can be kidnapped and terrorized in broad daylight right before the eyes of the public and the media it tells us that the truth in this country has become so costly that powerful forces are willing to commit illegal acts to stifle it
4181043 we cannot allow foul play to obstruct the truth and justice if we allow this to happen the chilling effect would prevent would be whistleblowers from coming forward we will all turn a blind eye on the possible excesses in government and before we know it we would wake up chained and enslaved under a tyranny
4181044 i just love it its so gossipy and superficial its amazing
4181045 i probably wouldnt want to see myself on there because it would ruin it for me
4181046 i like watching other people get gossiped about it makes me feel better
4181047 and half of my friends are guys its kind of embarrassing because youre out with a group of friends and the next day it says youre dating one of them and lap dancing too
4181048 rap music was a government ploy to convince black people to kill each other and keep them in the ghetto

4181050 you won t believe us but we actually came from the past
4181051 because it creatures a glitch in time and that could destroy the earth
4181052 listen you see we sent every single time machine into the distance past one must have landed by you when the time machines are used time zones switch back and fourth creating a glitch if the glitch grows to big all the time in earth will end causing the end of the world
4181053 you must go back in time to that day and unactivate the machine
4181054 your time traveling trip has ended your memory will not be erased but you will be sent back to your time

4181192 onze relatie strandde kort nadat we in 2006 remigreerden vanuit bonaire na een pauze van twee jaar hebben we elkaar weer gevonden sinds valentijnsdag dit jaar vormen we weer cht een gezin
4181193 na een absurd drukke periode heb ik de afgelopen jaren bewust gekozen voor de rust
4181194 ik heb deze tijd gebruikt om helemaal tot mezelf gekomen ik ontdekte dat weglopen voor jezelf en een ander de schuld geven van je eigen tekortkomingen je niet verder brengen met deze persoonlijke groei kwam er ook weer ruimte voor mijn liefde voor frans n mijn liefde voor het acteren vanaf begin september ben ik te zien in de film panman rhythm of the palms
4181195 frans en ik leefden vanaf het begin van onze relatie in de hoogste versnelling ik geloof dat we na onze eerste nacht samen meteen samenwoonden

4181278 chelsea is delighted with the drcs decision to award the club 13 68 million in compensation

4181348 ive always wanted to do this program but was too young so now is my chance
4181349 this program will give me more skills which will give me more options in the future
4181350 this program gives first nations youth a chance to experience first hand what its like to work in natural resource related jobs such as forestry energy and mining
4181351 mnr is contributing a total of 500 000 to the program in 2008 and 2009 because its a great investment in the future of these young people
4181352 we get the chance to expose the youth to a variety of learning opportunities many of the participants have continued on to post secondary education its a very rewarding experience for everyone involved
4181353 from the beginning we knew that this program would be extremely successful in exposing first nations youth to forestry operations over the eight years since the program began we have seen many of our first and second year graduates move on to a formal education in forestry or further training in preparation for work
4181354 i must say i am truly impressed at the eagerness to learn and pride in accomplishment shown by the first nations youth participants
4181355 the fnnryep has proven to be a springboard into further on the job work and leadership management training provided by outland and other industry partners our tracking indicates that as graduates become adults even more are engaged in education and personal career development in a wide variety of fields the fnnryep is offering youth healthy encouragement toward better life decision making
4181356 first nations youth are a growing and dynamic segment of the population in the north
4181357 we are proud to support this initiative to build economic capacity among first nations youth and also learn from years of tradition in resource stewardship that will benefit first nations communities governments and business throughout northern ontario
4181358 we are delighted to partner with cyr drilling international and its investors to bring new economic opportunities to our community

4181378 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4181379 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4181380 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4181381 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4181382 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4181383 you can forward past the out of tune guitar and singer
4181384 i wanted to get back to that name because our whole image and our whole brand and who we are is built on history and tradition
4181385 that name is synonymous with darlington raceway four years ago it didnt seem right to make that change we were on a new date there was a lot of stuff going on now i feel very good about the position darlingtons in with our four straight sellouts the way the capital improvements have gone everything has gone really well next year is a milestone year for us being our 60th anniversary of racing it was just perfect timing
4181386 rose has always been a favorite of my fans and mine too actually so i am really happy to have this cool remix out for everyone to hear you can get it on the dynamic version of ones and 0s
4181387 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4181388 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4181389 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4181390 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4181391 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4181392 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4181393 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4181394 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4181395 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
4181396 no he didnt ive improved only in the last year
4181397 it really affected my performance because the rain made my gun slippery and i missed several targets
4181398 we were pleased with the waca reaction that the new playing dates offer local fans including corporate groups wanting to entertain at the cricket good dates for a pre christmas test match
4181399 the whole thing was going to be determined at this sadc summit
4181400 we were all scheduled to go and meet with the troika the sadc organ on politics and defence were not going anymore
4181401 as everyone is aware for any foreign travel one needs travel documents and mr tsvangirai does not currently have any such documents
4181402 it was the south africans who invited us and paid for the tickets
4181403 there is disagreement on one element over which morgan tsvangirai had asked for time to reflect
4181404 we have adjourned to give morgan tsvangirai more time to consider these matters
4181405 would be accommodated in the new government when he was ready to sign
4181406 very agitated and shaking and they feared for their safety
4181407 they introduced themselves and at that time he johnson pulled out a handgun and shot chairman gwatney several times he then turned and left the business
4181408 we are deeply saddened by the news that bill gwatney has passed away
4181409 there was a desire on both sides to find a conclusion to this issue
4181410 this is a very important agreement this turns a new page in our relationship
4181411 this agreement signed today is designed to resolve the last major historical issue that has stood in the way of a more normal relationship between our two countries
4181412 under this agreement each countrys citizens can receive fair compensation for past incidents when fulfilled the agreement will permit libya and the us to develop their relations
4181413 the important role libya is playing internationally and expressed his hope that cooperation between the two countries would continue
4181414 this was a big game for us we had this one circled for a long time
4181415 a few of us felt we really needed this game to prove to ourselves we do mean business and were ready to win the gold medal
4181416 they knew what to do to take us out of our game
4181417 kobe had a lot of good dunks that was crazy
4181418 they pretty much picked us apart in 2006 the only way to change that was to be aggressive
4181419 were built to play defense we will eventually impose our will and wear them down
4181420 the defense in the second quarter turned it around for us
4181421 we played very good defense im proud of our effort
4181422 every time we go out of the hotel they are celebrating us
4181423 on setting up diplomatic relations between the two countries at the level of ambassadors
4181424 one of the steps that has long been required is the establishment of a proper embassy for syria in lebanon and vice versa
4181425 now if the syrians will go ahead and demarcate the border between lebanon and syria and respect lebanons sovereignty in other ways then this will have proved to be a very good step
4181426 to reactivate the work of the joint committee to demarcate the lebanese syrian borders within a mechanism and a set of priorities
4181427 it is not possible to mark the borders in shebaa farms as long as there is still israeli occupation the occupation must end
4181428 the blessing of the crops mass is an acadian custom acadian settlers would gather and give thanks each fall for the blessings of the harvest
4181429 we had a meeting last fall and 18 people attended
4181430 of those 18 five trustees were appointed and all five are descendants of the original trustees of the church
4181431 if no one had showed up that would have been the end of it
4181432 we talked about having one a couple of years back just a family one but it didnt materialize
4181433 so we were coming up with ideas and i thought of a fashion show all the cottagers are around so hopefully theyll show up
4181434 one of our goals would be just to show people what we are all about as a t o p s group
4181435 were a weight loss group but were a support group more than anything else we do programs with weight loss in mind but its more about people coming together supporting each other and sharing
4181436 so we decided on not always perfect as our theme
4181437 the clothes are secondhand and we come in all shapes and sizes not everybodys perfect
4181438 huge advances in the electronic media have made education borderless and online all our strategies pricing and marketing efforts are aligned keeping in view an average american household in any part of the country we can today deliver online homework help for every budget every child and every family that is the bottom line
4181439 we first sense the pain of the customer the student and then back it up by our actions the introduction of budgeted tcy founded in 1998 provides educational services to students tutoring companies publishers and schools steps
4181440 whenever an expansion needs to be done at the health centre the community is expected to raise 25 per cent of the cost so the money raised this weekend will go towards our next expansion at the centre
4181441 the health minister made an announcement a few years ago that we would be getting some additional beds but were still waiting
4181442 they are patient listeners and care about the unique needs of our child they have helped my child do better constantly share her academic anxieties and motivate her for higher grades we have seen an increase in our childs problem solving skills too
4181443 we want to give our students the best learning experience every minute they spend with our tutors and on our technology is very important for us they our students deserve to get the world class tutoring help
4181444 mankind is at its best whenever we set our vision to the stars

4181448 looking back to the influences that impacted my career tracy hickmans chronicles series left a lasting impression on me
4181449 his novels were my first exposure to epic fantasy and even though i read them at an early age the setting and characters he created still continue to influence me all these years later

4181452 rules were strict a captain led a sub captain brought up the rear and a bugler conveyed the captains orders woe betide the ill mannered lout who sprinted past the captain or failed to behave like a gentleman of the wheel it was a wonderful time for the cyclist he could travel further and faster by road than anyone previously had been able to and he had not yet encountered the hostility and malice that he was all too soon to meet from hooligans police magistrates and the gentry
4181453 when the bicycle runs away with you downhill place your legs over the handlebars and steer for the nearest hedge choosing a soft spot to land
4181454 one advantage of the high bicycle was that you could see over the hedge to pick your spot but that was no help if a boy or a policeman pushed a stick through your front wheel or in the dusk you found a rope stretched across the road
4181455 and the upper classes continued to regard cyclists as beneath notice except of course when they startled horses being driven or ridden by the upper classes when they became pests to be exterminated
4181456 more than half of ischemic strokes 52 in men and 54 in women may have been prevented through adherence to a healthy lifestyle
4181457 for total stroke 47 of cases in the women and 35 of cases in the men may have been prevented
4181458 this study shows that following a healthy lifestyle which has been associated with up to 80 lower risk of coronary heart disease and 90 lower risk of diabetes may also prevent more than half of ischemic strokes
4181459 the risk of relapse was still small but certainly not insignificant
4181460 i think these numbers are somewhat reassuring but they also highlight the need for new therapeutic options for women who have completed five years of treatment
4181461 these tumors are certainly more aggressive early on but the outlook is good for women with these tumors who survive for five years
4181462 we can now tell these women that their risk for developing a recurrence is lower than for women with er positive tumors
4181463 there has been some discussion about whether aggressive treatment makes a difference and this study supports the view that it does

4181481 at first glance its hard to imagine two more biologically distinct groups of people burying their dead in the same place

4181500 i really like spending time with my kids theyre really good girls and the jonas brothers are just awesome theyre darlings
4181501 its kind of cool to be a part of it its good to see people so excited about a band
4181502 i want you to sing this with me as loud as you can
4181503 when i was growing up i had a pretty difficult time
4181504 i just found when i was introducing myself to people it was a little awkward
4181505 you get all those wee wee jokes and that sort of thing
4181506 he e mailed me right away and said holy sh the nintendo is named after you
4181507 the reason my parents chose that is because they didnt really have a name picked out when my mom was pregnant
4181508 i thought it was weird nintendo would go with that
4181509 now when i meet people i say my name is wii
4181510 oh wii are you going to go home to play with yourself
4181511 o combina ie de r amp b hip hop i pop a lansat dou hituri de succes
4181512 en het is al een kwartier lopen om er te komen
4181513 theres a time and place for everything and now is the time
4181514 i felt like there was no bigger event in hip hop at this moment than me and t i working together
4181515 it was always turmoil between our camp and his camp us as the bosses of our companies everyone is gonna follow our lead wed figure if it aint no problem and we dont have no issues no beef then theres no reason we shouldnt be able to get together and make music that was an executive decision that was made on both our behalves
4181516 i was surprised just as much as everybody else was
4181517 i talked to luda and he said it was time to sit down do business make grown man moves both of them got albums coming out time to try new things cris did something for t i too that nobody heard yet its about to come out soon its a good move
4181518 its showing that once great minds set their differences aside they can make something happen
4181519 thats two grown men not two grown males grown men
4181520 its not every day that you meet the single biggest influence of your band let alone get to jam with them in a laid back and creative atmosphere
4181521 filming live from daryls house was one of the highlights of our musical journey well be pinching ourselves for years to come given that he pretty much wrote half our songs it was about time we met daryl hall in real life
4181522 the hayes family is comfortable with dr kraus recommendation to not conduct an autopsy
4181523 we are overwhelmed with the outpouring of support and love from isaacs dear friends colleagues and fans from every corner of the world and we thank each and every one of them for their kind thoughts and prayers
4181524 they do their own singing and their own dancing in the film
4181525 you get the opportunity to see both of these guys go for it in a real way thats fun and energetic mac definitely can carry a tune he does a great falsetto in the movie and a baritone and alto as well he has a range he plays a range of emotions in the film as well as octaves
4181526 when i came on they asked do you want him in the movie and i was like of course not to include him in the movie would have been sacrilege i had to have isaac in the film
4181527 when i went to shake his hand and tell him how much i loved him and what a great job he did he hugged me back and looked me in the eye and said make a great film man
4181528 i think theyre so awesome its been really inspiring theyve been very gracious maroon is always been that way with us as well its been a really cool thing so far
4181529 its just a whole big bunch of songs and songs like gravity thats the oldest song on the record
4181530 we provided intake documentation and the judge said it was insufficient
4181531 the judge said he should have informed the court sooner and because it was the second time hed missed court in this case she issued the warrant
4181532 working towards getting him some help and we hope that will be taken seriously by all parties in this case
4181533 he qualified for us and he feels comfortable with me
4181534 we have to work out an arrangement that will work with the courts
4181535 we are in court again next week on other matters and my hope is we can get the warrant resolved by then and get back on track we have some things in the works to get the warrant taken care of my hope is that we can resolve it without an arrest but hes been arrested at the airport before so they obviously have an eye out for him so im not sure
4181536 when we were recording at sound city studios i found it very easy to get drunk and stay there
4181537 i also found it easy to amuse my friends joshua any time hes down i just want to make him happy and nothing delights him more than seeing me on rollerblades one night i got sh faced and long story short when the head of sound city one of the pre eminent recording studios wakes you up at 7 in the morning in their upstairs parking lot and youre wearing nothing but a tank top cutoffs and rollerblades youve got f ing problems
4181538 i was rolling with a certain hollywood figure who may or may not have been aforementioned as a guest singer on this record and this tattoo artist i was rolling with in order to keep her in my life as my friend it meant the end of the potential for another aspect of our relationship so it was more of a disappointment
4181539 thats the worst kind of heartbreak in a way because it was the heartbreak of being an adult
4181540 i get off the phone with this girl and i said out loud f now im a f ing fool
4181541 i dont care what anybody says when youre hanging out with celebrities you never expect to get involved with them emotionally no matter how much you like them
4181542 this album is kind of i hate to sound corny but its kind of a mature look at hollywood
4181543 i fell in love with hollywood the city itself in a randy newman sort of way so i guess the album is about a variety of things di swinging in hollywood and acting tougher than you really might be
4181544 i really believe if you want to keep doing what were doing in this business youve got to grow
4181545 you have to go somewhere you have to be on a curve not on a line
4181546 not that its a good one but i have some sort of reputation and i could f that up doing the wrong thing thats suddenly a consideration thats never been present before thats going to affect everything the trick was learning how to give appropriate time to certain things but what im glad to see is really on this record its the same story two best friends having a sh s and giggles good time making rock and roll
4181547 who are you how many hit records do you have
4181548 back in college when me and my roommates would get hammered and rap along to victory id yell to no one in particular that this was one of the 10 greatest hip hop songs of all time while clutching a quart of mickeys ice in one hand and a half eaten totinos party pizza in the other well just so you know heres a partial list of other things i thought were pretty great back then drunk driving self immolation ramen noodles the wwf phishs billy breathes and the career prospects of florida gators qb jesse palmer a k a the guy who ended up on the bachelor

4181550 carlitos way rise to power is perhaps the finest direct to dvd prequel to a substandard brian de palma al pacino gangster flick that also stars mario van peebles and that guy who played maurice tt rodriguez in boogie nights to be released this decade or at least in the past five years
4181551 how many lives were lost during your tragic vote or die campaign in 2004 when will your savage thirst for blood be slaked
4181552 what have i ever done what have you ever done aside from you know launching a multimillion dollar media empire lording over a hugely successful clothing line shaping the career of perhaps the greatest mc of all time scoring a series of hits as both a producer and a solo artist and running in the new york city marathon on a whim actually wait never mind
4181553 your skin is way smoother than i wouldve imagined given the amount of times i have seen your proactiv commercial
4181554 in tons how many magick talismans ancient tomes aleister crowley artifacts did it take to convince jimmy page to appear in the video for that god awful song you did on the godzilla soundtrack
4181555 did you know that the average american is blessed with a blissfully short memory and yet a seemingly endless appetite for nostalgia so much so that he or she is willing to forgive most transgressions and forego all pretenses of taste in exchange for a song that will sound excellent in very large speakers or at the beach are you aware that most of us are doddering sods brainless infants who prefer things big and loud and shiny and equate aesthetic excess with true happiness do you realize theres a sucker born every minute did i just let the cat out of the bag
4181556 thank you for not beating me with a champagne bottle or a telephone receiver
4181557 it is such a surreal feeling to look behind the bus and see semi trucks with my name on them
4181558 even as this thing grows our fans are the same young kids that have always come out to the club shows they come to forget about school or work or whatever and have a good time so thats what we are going to give them
4181559 sorry bout that mister some tomater juicell take care of the stank
4181560 shoot barack you didnt tell me you was runnin for president
4181561 what sen obamas half brother meant to communicate was that he was pleased that the candidates message of change is fostering vigorous dialogue
4181562 in no way was his proposal to fill yalls backsides with rock salt intended to be taken in any other way
4181563 i thought we would be able to escape controversy by leaving the country for a week and visiting iraq and europe
4181564 little did we know that cooter would command just as much attention back home by getting drunk with the russian ambassador lighting off fireworks and crashing obamas campaign limo into a creek in the ozark mountains
4181565 maybe if he gets elected he can make me secretary of moonshine course that dont mean i aint votin for the other fella ol jelly legs wants to take my guns away
4181566 between 2006 and 2007 violations continued at the range and they continued to complain the last incident occurred in july 2007 when another range employee allowed hollywood actor brendan fraser to utilize machine guns at the range using leaded ammunition
4181567 it was cheaper and worked with these types of guns
4181568 actually complained about the smoke and he was warned to wash his hands face and clothing before returning home
4181569 we reached this conclusion as a result of our careful assessment of the many physical improvements that have been made to the 100 yard shooting area at blue trail and improvements in operating procedures that the management has committed to implement
4181570 we were able to make this assessment with the assistance of our environmental conservation police unit which had several senior officers inspect the range and which has special law enforcement and military expertise in firearms and range safety

4181575 if people have problems of a partisan nature they should not use a death of a firefighter or anything associated with the disaster to deal with it so shut up
4181576 the only time my father has ever mentioned the firefighters death was at the beginning of the announcement letter for the meeting where my father empathizes with the community and sends his condolences to the firefighters family
4181577 by her making that accusation it suggests to me that she was aware of the meeting at st norbert church
4181578 as it became clear that he was going to win the democratic nomination for president it seemed irresponsible to stand by as so many were offering admiration piety even worship to of all things a politician because the idea of barack obama as a reformer is a great lie
4181579 though there was no particular evidence that the tire gauge attack was having an effect the mccain campaigns glee was evident
4181580 meanwhile mccain himself was sent out to pose in front of working oil rigs to testify to his thirst for pulling more black gold from the earth the message couldnt be plainer see that itty bitty little tire gauge if you vote for obama thats how big your penis is if you vote for mccain on the other hand your penis is as big as this rig thrusting its gigantic shaft in and out of the ground real men think keeping your tires inflated is for weenies
4181581 republicans have been expert at setting up their rigs to drill deep into the male voters lizard brain down to where sexual insecurity resides this is where they draw the line connecting the voters own worries to the democratic candidate this is how they turn fear into contempt and hostility the same psychological move that makes some men react to an advance from another man or even the sight of an effeminate man with hatred and violence see that democrat over there hes a little prissy isnt he kind of girly and if you vote for him what are people going to think about you
4181582 health care polls just as well as offshore drilling does with roughly two out of every three americans favoring some kind of universality but the last time the obama campaign highlighted universal health care in one of its press releases was in april
4181583 prefer a universal health insurance program over the current employer based system

4181594 any attempts to hinder a journalist who is going about doing his job seemingly within the rules
4181595 this we hope has been addressed we dont want to see this happening again
4181596 its clear to us that the protest zones are just a cynical public relations ploy on the part of the chinese authorities
4181597 sadly i think the protest zones are just a trap at some level
4181598 one step further for china to open up and i think its a very good gesture
4181599 in accordance with the law enjoy the freedom of speech and other kinds of rights
4181600 welcome olympic games with joyfulness and construct a harmonious society
4181601 about protesting i think chinese people have experienced very little of this
4181602 i think foreigners might have more protests i think chinese people do not have the awareness yet we dont know what there is to protest about
4181603 but the glory is the glory of pasteboard and the wealth is the wealth of tinsel
4181604 weve talked about people but we havent found the right person to co direct on mulan can you think of anybody

4181610 di dalam penciptaan terdapat ayat ayat tanda keberadaan kekuasaan allah bagi al baab
4181611 what the bolivian people have expressed with their votes today is the consolidation of the process of change
4181612 we are here to keep advancing in the recovery of our natural resources the consolidation of nationalization and the state takeover of companies
4181613 it depends now on how the government proceeds if they push through an aggressive agenda they will see a lot of resistance and maybe violence if hes a conciliator and tries to negotiate hell have a chance of governing with a lot of political support
4181614 the conflict has increased between the president and the regions the president has won but his opposition in the east won by more than the president
4181615 stay home have an iced tea or whatever and dont mow your lawn
4181616 the situation in georgia remains fluid and dangerous as soon as possible my colleagues senators lieberman and graham will be traveling to georgia theyre both members of the senate armed services committee i hope that other members of the armed services committee in the senate will go together
4181617 these women were in afghanistan trying to help the afghan people and have now given their lives as a result of a senseless pointless and cowardly act
4181618 they were travelling in white toyota land cruisers that were clearly marked as irc vehicles as humanitarian vehicles
4181619 their policy was never to travel with weapons in the car so there wouldnt be any doubt that theyre a peaceful humanitarian organisation
4181620 the uk government utterly condemns these attacks on innocent civilians
4181621 what were going to do is im going to stay in the game plan and at night were going to throw
4181622 and after we throw well watch film and hes going to go over the game plan with me as if i was there
4181623 the whole denver broncos organization has been great to me
4181624 all i can do is just show them that im here now and when i get back and be accountable

4181626 this one is flowers and flowers make me happy that one is a dude screaming and screams make me sad
4181627 a diet of nothing but classics is just as damaging as a diet of pop culture
4181628 the beef n cheddar marked a major milestone for arbys in 1978 and it continues to be a favorite even today
4181629 we want to thank our loyal customers for making the beef n cheddar a star on the arbys menu by offering it for just 30 cents less than what it originally cost 30 years ago
4181630 menu board labeling has the potential to dramatically alter the trajectory of the obesity epidemic in california
4181631 if you can skim 50 calories off your diet each time you eat out you are going to reduce your weight gain and might even lose weight this analysis suggests that a painless way to make that happen is to put calorie information on menu boards for everyone to see it will be of great benefit to the 82 percent of california adults who regularly eat at fast food chains
4181632 even nutrition professionals underestimate the calories contained in meals typically available at fast food restaurants by 200 to 600 calories
4181633 theres a movement afoot to license more lay midwives to attend home births
4181634 fear of litigation has led to more women in labor being tethered to monitors and forced under the knife
4181635 legislating against home birth is totally un american and unfair
4181636 we rank 42nd in the world in live births and we spend more money than anyone else you cant blame it on home birth
4181637 unless theres ready access to certain emergency personnel and equipment and even surgery youre potentially endangering babies and moms health and lives
4181638 weve all seen scenarios where mothers came in after very major blood loss in a very catastrophic state by the time they arrive in the hospital youre sort of behind the eight ball in trying to resuscitate these patients the same thing with neonatal outcome
4181639 recent push by direct entry midwives to receive licenses so they can practice their craft without fear of prosecution
4181640 its amazing the technology we have but we are losing the value of normal natural birth
4181641 add homelessness mental illness or drug addiction into the mix and taking much needed medication falls from the top of the priority list
4181642 we dont know to what extent ongoing drug use interferes or affects the medication they take but crack or heroin interferes with adherence
4181643 theyre more than just an hiv infected person or a person using crack every day or a homeless person these are problems no one can manage by themselves these folks have struggled their whole lives
4181644 on paper they look good but hiv dementia and other problems have set in and even though newer medication has people living longer lives most of our residents probably wont ever go and live on their own
4181645 the best hosting service ive ever worked with bar none
4181646 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4181647 the best hosting service ive ever worked with bar none

4181650 the benefits they enjoy from being part of the civilized world
4181651 scheunemanns work as a lobbyist poses valid questions about mccains judgment in choosing someone who and whose firm are paid to promote the interests of other nations
4181652 so one must ask whether mccain is getting disinterested advice at least when the issues concern those nations
4181653 if mccain wants advice from someone whose private interests as a once and future lobbyist may affect the objectivity of the advice thats his choice to make
4181654 this is an issue that he has been involved with for well over a decade
4181655 we must not allow russia to believe it has a free hand to engage in policies that undermine georgian sovereignty
4181656 were proud of anyone who has worked on the side of angels in fledgling democracies
4181657 i told him that i know i speak for every american when i said to him today we are all georgians
4181658 as you know through the nato membership if a member nation is attacked it is viewed as an attack on all

4181779 at a time when demand for food and fuel is rising and in the face of growing environmental challenges we need to find ways to feed an ever increasing global population
4181780 even for a prince whos a long established champion of organic farming and critic of gm crops these are comments which verge on the extreme

4181888 im riding my team manager sasha stockers boards and just getting used to them at this stage and i need to adjust the waves are great though and by tomorrow i should be good hopefully

4181890 school wasnt working for me at the start of the year so i figured it was time to really work on my surfing ive spent a lot of time surfing indonesia and new zealand recently and im feeling good for a strong result but its an outstanding field here and this will be a hard event to win
4181891 rio de janeiro was for many years the center of the greatest surfing competitions in brazil and we are very pleased for bringing back to this city a big event like this we are working with two options of structure in two different beaches so that we can take better advantage of the waves conditions thus billabong girls pro rio promises to repeat the success of the two previous years and definitely enters into the citys sport calendar
4181892 this contest is a day i get to share with the groms of san diego i love watching the kids have this day of uninhibited fun surfing with me and my professional surfer friends its my favorite event of the year
4181893 investing in a diverse democracy foundation giving to minority led nonprofits
4181894 racial and ethnic minorities now account for 43 percent of americans under 20 among people of all ages minorities make up at least 40 percent of the population in more than one in six of the nations 3 141 counties
4181895 meaning and impact of board and staff diversity in the philanthropic field joint affinity group may 2002
4181896 10 percent of all foundation grants each year even though minority groups represent nearly one third of the u s population and experience many of the nations greatest disadvantages
4181897 does foundation type size or location affect foundation giving practices do foundations that give more for science and technology tend to be less diverse grantmakers than foundations that give for human services and to what extent is the variation in diverse grantmaking the result of individual decisions within foundation as opposed to characteristics of foundations and their giving priorities
4181898 what do we need these crts and cgas for if bequest dollars will always outperform them
4181899 why bother with all of the effort and expense of life income vehicles
4181900 i just spent 10 days around the mentawais on a boat trip with nate tyler andrew doheny asher pacey surfing im looking forward to a fun day and a shin dig after the best thing about the vqs is that its free with heaps of prizes so many events these days kids pay 120 bucks and dont get a thing i reckon local kalen schloss will take the title
4181901 ive been in the states lately went in a vqs at the golden west contest near huntington beach came second a month ago it was so sick now its at home i just wanna have fun ive got the last 3 pro juniors coming up so i want to use this weekend to shake the cobwebs off cause i havent had a pro junior contest since may so its a good warm up
4181902 it was so hard out there i am glad to get away with a win
4181903 the current and the waves were really tricky and it was a struggle to remain in position and find some good enough rides
4181904 it was pretty hard out there and i just had one good wave
4181905 i was relaxed enough still and i waited patiently for that last wave to come and it was enough so i am stoked
4181906 i am having a bit of trouble with my ears at the moment i have an infection i believe but i am still feeling well and fit
4181907 i am not thinking of any ratings or pressure i just want to have fun and keep improving against all these excellent surfers
4181908 i cant believe i managed to score a 9 00 point ride out there it was so hard to find a good wave and it was very difficult to find the right position as well
4181909 it was bigger today and it was kind of slippery and bumpy with this wind but i made it so i just hope for tomorrow to be a bit easier
4181910 i had very good surfers in my heat so i am pretty stoked to get through to it
4181911 i had a lot of fun out there actually because i like challenging conditions and some pretty solid waves came through during my heat
4181912 it thought i was 4th so it was a big surprise for me when i got back to the beach marshall it is my third time in lacanau but the first one i manage to get through a round so it is already a good confidence boost

4181916 laurence ball 58 claims he was told he had a tumor in his lung and needed surgery to remove the organ
4181917 the impact of this on my life and my family is hard to imagine
4181918 i have lost everything my job my health and i have had years of what should have been a happy retirement stolen from me
4181919 to say that i was shocked doesnt really do it justice
4181920 i was exhilarated to have survived the operation and then to be told that i didnt have cancer i could not get my head around the words
4181921 getting the labour movement and the left to understand the capital markets properly
4181922 at 200 a phone thats 5 billion of revenue despite the recent price cuts morgan stanley uses an average unit price of 550 per phone this seems far too high to us but 27 million units at this price would yield almost 15 billion of revenue
4181923 but the idea that companies maximize short term profits at the expense of long term returns is to put it mildly unproven
4181924 any individual corporation would be best served by a return to servitude company towns anyone the system as a whole may well be better served by having a systematic counterweight to maximizing short term profits
4181925 as you think about that remember that there are other values in this world than maximizing short term productivity like treating people with dignity

4181934 there was a lot of enthusiasm and it was a great way to finish the workout
4181935 both sides of the ball were excellent everyone was mentally sharp but physically tired and that was by design at the end of a full days work it looked as sharp as i anticipated it could on both offense and defense for the first time through
4181936 that can make us a lot lot better we have not done it at that tempo before and we very very pleased for day one of that work
4181937 now that we have been through several two a days the players really respond to days like today when they know they have just one practice they really spent themselves this morning
4181938 knowing that this afternoon they will just be back in meetings i especially saw a lot of great work out of the defense during blitz pickup drills
4181939 the missouri constitution requires that voters be given a single subject when changes to state laws are proposed by initiative petitions this lawsuit raises the constitutionality of having numerous subjects placed before voters in the same ballot measure
4181940 missourians should have a fair opportunity to vote for a single subject and not be disenfranchised by being forced to chose between multiple subjects we look forward to the opportunity to engage in the debate and inform the voters of missouri on the nature of the issues
4181941 the casinos have long tried to tie gambling money to education in an attempt to gain support for expanded gambling but this petition goes beyond what is constitutionally allowed

4181946 this is a unique chance to see the very best of welsh talent in a different way its our ambition to show the world why top music makers like gruff rhys continue to reinvent and revitalise the vibrant music scene in wales
4181947 there are too many variables involved until we go line item by line item
4181948 and we didnt raise any rates from a volume standpoint we did really well
4181949 from an ability to collect standpoint we are nowhere near where we need to be our net revenues are nearly 200 000 less than last year because of bad debt and contractual adjustments
4181950 either i do it this way or i cant do it at all either i do it perfectly or my efforts are completely flawed either i take this path to my goal or theres no way to get there
4181951 well what would it take to enable me to make that change how could i do that what are my options

4181953 what i always wear my watch at a convenient angle for passing photographers
4181954 its a strange luxury to see someone elses version of your life
4181955 that russian troops must return to the lines they held before the start of the military operation but before an international solution is worked out russian peacekeepers are to take up an additional security role
4181956 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity
4181957 i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4181958 our position on georgias territorial integrity is not going to change no matter what anyone says and so i would consider that to be bluster coming from the foreign minister of russia and well ignore it
4181959 the russian leadership cannot be trusted and this hard reality should guide the wests response only western peacekeepers can end the war
4181960 russias position is unchanged we will support any decisions taken by the peoples of south ossetia and abkhazia and not only do we support it but we will guarantee them both in the caucasus and throughout the world
4181961 we dont want them here what we need are friendship and good relations with the russian people
4181962 as to choosing the united states has made very clear that it is standing by the democratically elected government of georgia
4181963 and we are aware that the u s is uptight about this project
4181964 but a choice will have to be made someday between considerations of prestige related to an illusory project and a real partnership in matters which indeed require collective efforts
4181965 lets be very clear whose interests are being served by the partnership that russia and the united states have engaged in on iran or north korea
4181966 america is losing the whole region and this is the region of eastern and central europe
4181967 this is much bigger than any other place where there is american influence and this is the most natural allies of america
4181968 there will be no compromise at the expense of our territorial integrity
4181969 i never accused the united states in the first place of anything
4181970 i just said that the russians mistook some of the statements at certain levels
4181971 i dont think you can have any doubt but that the united states has from the very beginning believed that the south ossetian situation needed to be resolved and resolved peacefully as weve been working for months and months and months to do but that russia seriously overreached that russia engaged in activities that could not possibly be associated simply with the crisis in south ossetia
4181972 we expect russia to meet its commitment to cease all military activities in georgia and we expect all russian forces that entered georgia in recent days to withdraw from that country
4181973 if i were a neighbor of russia and i saw what russia had done in georgia i would be very nervous
4181974 i think those countries that are leaning toward the west are very nervous today
4181975 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade
4181976 our position on georgias territorial integrity is not going to change no matter what anybody says
4181977 and so i would consider that to be bluster from the foreign minister of russia we will ignore it
4181978 we are very concerned about these reports it is a serious situation
4181979 its difficult at the tactical level to know each and every engagement in each town

4181986 i need to replace it and had expected to go for an old model c5 but it occurred to me that there might be alternatives that would relish a rutted track twice a day
4181987 other than the farm track all my driving is on normal roads i do about 25 000 miles a year and appreciate a decent spec but have no interest in pointless fripperies such as alloy wheels

4182002 turbulence caused by external factors is changing the automotive industry like never before and energy has become a major point of concern since it touches virtually every aspect of our lives
4182003 the global growth in demand for oil is outpacing its availability which will ultimately result in energy scarcity likely before we develop advanced energy technologies that will be enough to close the gap to the worlds energy demand
4182004 imagine we have developed advanced technologies for solar wind hydro energy and its storage sufficient enough to close the gap to the worlds energy demand
4182005 we need to improve our industrys readiness for upcoming change
4182006 if we do this right my deep belief is that this industry can go beyond that and be the leaders in developing the right solutions to address these complex energy and mobility challenges
4182007 as an industry we need to prepare differently for our collective future and now more than ever make the right decisions about energy use and technology development

4182065 the player adrian mutu will have to pay the amount of 17 173 990 euros to chelsea football club
4182066 this is an important decision for football not only did the drc make us a very significant monetary award the decision also recognised the damaging effect incidents involving drugs has on football and the responsibilities we all have in this area
4182067 we never asked for a sum the only thing we ever said publicly was how much in our accounts mutu was worth when mutu left obviously he had a value in our account
4182068 that value was 13 million pounds 25 28 million but when we made our case to fifa we did not ask for a specific amount

4182273 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4182274 welfare reform was one of the toughest things i had to do but it was certainly worth it
4182275 the results have been superb and many more people have moved from welfare into a career and are making better lives for themselves and their families this ad helps explain why reforming welfare was so important and spreads the message that government can work when we make a commitment doing things efficiently and effectively
4182276 governor thompson led efforts on welfare reform in the early 1990s when no one else was talking about making changes
4182277 he knows what works and what doesnt to have him say that no one did a better job than we did here in new hampshire means a lot
4182278 nbc needs to capture every second of every competition at multiple venues in china quickly turning them into dynamic programming for television and internet broadcasting nothing can fall through the cracks
4182279 we welcomed the opportunity to work with omneon to support nbc for its olympics coverage omneon is the market leader for developing storage solutions for broadcast video which is becoming more prevalent via the web especially for hugely popular sporting events like the olympics
4182280 for the first time the average american will be able to create their own unique olympic experience whether at home at the office or on the go
4182281 with 25 sports streamed live at nbcolympics com and significant live coverage on our cable platforms and nbc highlighted by all swimming finals the biggest nights of gymnastics and beach volleyball live in primetime the viewer has plenty of options for live coverage in the 41 years since my first olympics its staggering to me to be involved in a games where we are producing 2 900 hours of live coverage especially from an olympics half a world away its more live coverage from a single olympics than the total of all previous summer olympics combined the enormity of what were doing just blows me away
4182282 because the workflow must be seamless and the nature of the programming is so significant we decided to use seagates enterprise hard drives which are the best fit for our needs in terms of reliability best in class design and unrivaled performance

4182284 if opponents of a special session to invest surplus funds into liheap are concerned with costs they should join republicans in support of saving the taxpayers over 31 000 each day a special session is held
4182285 it has to be something i cant do without them
4182286 there is no time to wait for a december session reports from a task force or action from the u s congress
4182287 the time to act is now and maines citizens should not have to pay for that action
4182288 its also possible that web servers with sybase database backends could also conceivably be exploited
4182289 similar to phishing this attack takes advantage of the website visitors trust in the site they are visiting instead of phishing for information however malware is sent to the client which the client has a higher likelihood of accepting being from a trusted site
4182290 there are times like its one of those cities i might catch some flack for saying this but you know theyre front runners when youre doing good theyre on your side when youre doing bad theyre completely against you
4182291 i hear you but for example ryan is from st louis and st louis it seems like they support their team theyre out there and encouraging in philly cant be no punk
4182292 well st louis never boos anyone boy id love for our fans to be like them

4182295 we do sample airworthiness bulletins when we do maintenance audits but we can only sample them
4182296 qantas would have at any time in excess of 2000 airworthiness bulletins current for its fleet
4182297 so there is no way we can audit every ad airworthiness directive they currently have
4182298 there has been too much cost cutting and not enough attention to quality
4182299 it is appalling that one of australias largest and most profitable companies can engage in this sort of dishonest and unethical business behaviour under our current ir laws

4182302 as for what real cities brings to the table it has a network with 1 800 local affiliate sites and claims a combined 44 million monthly uniques on average
4182303 for centro the purchase should help it strengthen its position as a go between for media agencies and newspapers
4182304 the acquisition of real cities should help more agencies buy local media centros media placement software and services have made it a lot easier
4182305 we think centro as a company that sits impartially between the buy side and sell side is well positioned to be a leading player in this space at the same time we think it can expand the local marketplace
4182306 this transaction makes sense not only for mcclatchys online newspapers but for all real cities customers
4182307 any newspaper web site advertiser or advertising agency doing business with centro has no doubt been impressed by centros quality service and one order one bill efficiency couple these two strengths with the promise of centros new ad placement technology and you see why were pleased with our decision
4182308 weve partnered so much with real cities and mcclatchy over the years and have such a tremendous amount of respect for the leadership team that its a great pleasure to bring our companies together
4182309 we look forward to a seamless integration and serving real cities clients with the most successful media campaigns at the local level mcclatchy and centro will continue to work together to help grow the local digital sector for many years to come
4182310 the turnout is because of the home theres not much in competition to it that i can see most of the people here are genuine

4182312 a world wide positive intention experiment will be conducted at 8 pm universal time 08 08 08 to put an end to secret agreements that have prevented the revolutionary technology and knowledge of extraterrestrial life entering mainstream society a galactic freedom day declaration has been issued by cooperating citizen organizations clearly expressing humanitys intent to put an end to secret agreements concerning extraterrestrial life
4182313 all culture is a cover for secretively monstrous behavior particularly the nuclear family
4182314 the whole world is a mess and i just want to rule it
4182315 people who sort of even know me in real life sometimes express disbelief until the people who really do know me confirm to them that its all true people who dont know me at all usually think i make all this crap up the funniest part of this to me is that there is so much that i actually dont write about that is about a hundred times crazier than the stuff i actually do write about if you all only knew thats all i have to say if yall only knew
4182316 decisions decisions just roll the dice fate is going to do with you what she will anyway
4182317 unfettered whining is a banana split for the motherfucking soul
4182318 theres no rule that says you have to be fulfilled doing a particular socially acceptable thing
4182319 its a strange thing to discover when youre an adult that youve been somewhat misadjusted to the world your entire life and didnt know it
4182320 if you can get past the occasional imbecile induced bike folly and the fact that davis seems to perpetually be in the path of some giant bipolar tornado you may come to realize that this city is a great place to live
4182321 i see a bookshelf filled with different books from different authors all acting as portals to different worlds and different times the author may give them birth but its the readers who keep them alive
4182322 some books contain the machinery required to create and sustain universes
4182323 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
4182324 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me
4182325 i found that writing for me was a thing of the hands hands need to produce art and whether its written or made it feeds the need to produce art
4182326 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
4182327 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
4182328 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
4182329 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking
4182330 why does my job exist it exists because i willed it into existence when the day goes badly i can remind myself that i have asked for this job by name and thought to create this for myself and i can only blame myself for the whole thing
4182331 dude i was a nerd from the day i was born i was reading in kindergarten i got humungous glasses that covered half of my face in second grade ive been living the nerd life ever since

4182333 i sometimes think god is a shit and he wouldnt be worth it otherwise hes much more interesting when hes a shit
4182334 sometimes though you dont get to choose what kinda fame youre gonna get or how much itll cost ya
4182335 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
4182336 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother
4182337 when you are young passion and hope are so strong thats its almost impossible to stop loving someone after youve been kicked around by life however you start to have a dual response to handsome con men wow and arrrrrrgh it takes not will power but painful experience to make us wise
4182338 be of service go where you can help if youre an artist be of service to your art dont have it the other way around you have to put aside your dreams of being a hotshot and learn to be useful you step up everyday get a nice clean hit and youre done
4182339 oh honey you just need to meet the right man
4182340 whenever youre called on to make up your mind and youre hampered by not having any the simplest way to solve the dilemma youll find is simply by flipping a penny no not so that chance shall decide the affair as youre passively standing there moping but as soon as the penny is up in the air youll suddenly know what youre hoping
4182341 im not normal by conventional social standards and ill never be so maybe i should stop worrying and just embrace the insanity a bit
4182342 you are always dreaming every dream you could dream all the time even when youre awake a part of your brain is stirring that brew which one you choose to remember in the morning is based on wishes anxieties its a vast and fascinating place everywhere you turn a part of you
4182343 her weirdnesses have the quality of life in a trailer park during tornado season someones shih tzu just blew in through the window pfft theres a buick parked on the ceiling bah old man parsnip just got blown right into the anal cavity of a standing cow cest la vie her life is managed in clusters of riot interrupted by the occasional errant moment of calm
4182344 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really
4182345 oddly enough she can handle having a lesbian daughter much better than one who is still single at 30
4182346 i am way more afraid of forgetting how to be happy alone than i am actually ending up alone
4182347 various medical authorities swarm in and out of here predicting i have between two days and two months to live
4182348 you know marcel proust french writer total loser never had a real job unrequited love affairs gay spent 20 years writing a book almost no one reads but hes also probably the greatest writer since shakespeare anyway he uh he gets down to the end of his life and he looks back and decides that all those years he suffered those were the best years of his life cause they made him who he was all those years he was happy you know total waste didnt learn a thing so if you sleep until youre 18 ah think of the suffering youre gonna miss i mean high school high school those are your prime suffering years you dont get better suffering than that

4182358 but that does not mean we exclude people from our party that are pro choice
4182359 i think its a fundamental tenet of our party to be pro life but that does not mean we exclude people from our party that are pro choice we just have a albeit strong but just its a disagreement and i think ridge is a great example of that far more so than bloomberg because bloomberg is pro gay rights pro you know a number of other issues
4182360 mccain says he couldnt pick a running mate who is pro gay rights
4182361 i dont mind gays just keep them the hell away from me
4182362 its not that i dont like people i just like it when theyre not around
4182363 i dont like gay people and i like it when theyre not around me
4182364 far more so than bloomberg because bloomberg is pro gay rights pro you know a number of other issues
4182365 focus on what you are passionate about helping people with
4182366 daarom kwam ik niet meteen met een goed antwoord ik wil nog zo veel meer zeggen
4182367 onze moeder heeft ons geleerd te waarderen wat we hebben gekregen zij zou een 14 jarige nooit stimuleren om iets te laten veranderen aan haar lichaam
4182368 verschrikkelijk dat mensen zich altijd focussen op negatieve aspecten en dat sommige mensen hun eigen leven blijkbaar zo moe zijn dat ze het nodig vinden om leugens over andere mensen te verspreiden
4182369 contains updates on washington supreme court and washington court of appeals decisions local and national legal news and the odd bit of humor to keep things interesting

4182372 its not by chance that the army is training in the golan so extensively we are seeing a significant strengthening by hizbullah in the past few years were monitoring any possibility of a shift in balance of power due to the syrians supplying hizbullah with advances weapons systems
4182373 were doing what needs to be done preparation wise id rather not elaborat if we need to take action well be ready
4182374 no ashu you dont eat chalk remember chula and mieja had drawn kolams with chalk in front of their house they are for drawing

4182377 weve built up a good squad over the last few seasons and i would like to see everyone remain here
4182378 were all experienced enough not to let that sort of thing bother us
4182379 you hear it year in year out so im not sure it bothers too many people in the squad
4182380 i havent trained in almost three weeks now so its a little bit disappointing going in to the new season

4182391 its utter nonsense for hillary to imply that the alleged 18 million form a solid lardlike block sworn to her as in some fascist regime and that if they arent heard at the convention they will swarm like lemmings to the edge of a cliff and fling themselves off
4182392 hillary is setting feminism back defining women as petulant brats driven by emotion rather than logic and fair play

4182400 rachel knew that being burned was a part of life
4182401 we want to test how the stones work across different seasons and weather conditions
4182402 wed hope that people will even be able to detect the difference in the air quality as a result of the stones
4182403 the cost of producing the japanese stones is around double that of conventional stones but weve got that down to around 30 per cent more
4182404 a national program with all states on a level playing field is the right approach to reducing co2 emissions
4182405 test of a first rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at
4182406 we are pleased to have rebounded from a difficult first quarter with strong sales and net income results for the second quarter
4182407 we believe we have a strong opportunity to enhance our competitive position in the market by continuing to improve profitability and efficiency per store develop a broad product selection selectively open new store within stores in established well known retail locations develop customer service programs such as our after sales warranty support programs and leverage our wholesale business to create new opportunities at the retail level
4182408 our decision comes down to the bare necessities where do we want to get our energy having a domestic supply is far more reliable and secure than relying upon foreign sources can we develop domestic supplies and provide protection for the environment and wildlife including polar bears yes we can and should
4182409 this analysis represents the first direct comparison of cortisol responses to stress in lactating and nonlactating females in nonhuman primates we found no evidence of hyporesponsiveness to stress among lactating females rather plasma cortisol levels were significantly higher in lactating than in nonlactating females both shortly after capture and the morning after
4182410 concerns over risk to their infants may explain why lactating females exhibited higher cortisol responses to trapping and individual housing and why these responses did not vary significantly across the 6 lactation months
4182411 this opposition has highlighted that among other concerns there are no methods proven effective for cleaning up oil spills in the arctic ocean this is especially troubling because the federal minerals management service admits that oil spills are likely in the chukchi sea if it is opened to oil and gas development
4182412 a key aspect of the debate both during the public consultation on and parliamentary debate about the code of practice for voluntary retention of data and also during the debate about the directive within the european council and the european parliament has been the impact or potential impact that retention of communications data has on individuals human rights
4182413 the implementation of the directive does not alter the balance in that debate and we consider that these measures are a proportionate interference with individuals right to privacy to ensure protection of the public
4182414 yet again the government have proved themselves unable to resist the temptation to take a power quite properly designed to combat terrorism to snoop on the lives of ordinary people in everyday circumstances
4182415 we want to promote the idea of it services to smes
4182416 at the same time we want to offer a more professional way for the channel to manage it for clients so we are encouraging the outsourcing of it maintenance
4182417 there is a lot of talk about managed services in the us but it is still in its infancy in europe and we want to advance it
4182418 oems that build their own brand servers make up about a fifth of the worldwide server market so they are important to us
4182419 an it buyer from an sme or corporate will want virtualisation and they want as wide a range of options as possible
4182420 we are spending more and more time with our communications devices but spending less on them

4182425 the partnership between intrinsic and ramesys is a perfect combination we are like minded companies similarly sized and both with ambitious growth plans for the future

4182429 the bush administrations just released management plan for the tongass national forest in alaska puts millions of pristine acres in this ancient rainforest on the auction block to the timber industry yet will raise no revenue for the u s government as the u s taxpayers themselves will have to pay to build the roads the timber companies need to access the forest the tongass is the largest national forest in the country
4182430 at 17 million acres roughly the size of west virginia the tongass national forest in southeastern alaska is the countrys largest national forest and the worlds largest intact coastal temperate rain forest it contains grizzly and black bears wolves eagles and five species of wild alaskan salmon under the new plan about 3 4 million acres of the forest would be open to logging and development of this acreage about 2 4 million is in roadless areas and about 663 000 acres is considered to have trees valuable for timber production
4182431 we just had to tidy up the channel i said earlier this year that i wanted 12 15 new partners and i may well go over that we have actively recruited a number of data and managed services resellers
4182432 it is seen as a competitive advantage rather than a cost and i have not seen a massive impact to date the largest corporate accounts are being hit more than the mid market
4182433 invloed van het filosofische gedachtegoed in de wereld is vandaag de dag slechts mogelijk als die invloed zich uitstrekt tot de meerderheid van de afzonderlijke mensen want zo staat het er nu voor de massas van de bevolking kunnen lezen en schrijven zonder echter toegang te krijgen tot de volle omvang van de cultuur van het avondland toch zijn het juist zij die mee weten mee denken en mee handelen ze kunnen deze nieuwe kans des te beter benutten naar gelang dat zij meer doordringen tot de volle omvang van de verheven opvattingen en de kritische onderscheidingen daarom is het voor de beschouwelijke ogenblikken van alle mensen noodzakelijk om zonder verlies aan diepte het wezenlijke zo eenvoudig zo helder als maar mogelijk is overdraagbaar te maken
4182434 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4182435 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4182436 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4182437 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4182438 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4182439 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4182440 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4182441 kids in congo were being sent down mines to die so that kids in europe and america could kill imaginary aliens in their living rooms
4182442 sonys playstation 2 launch spring of 2000 was a big part of the huge increase in demand for coltan that began in early 1999
4182443 sony and other companies like it have the benefit of plausible deniability
4182444 because the coltan ore trades hands so many times from when it is mined to when sony gets a processed product that a company often has no idea where the original coltan ore came from and frankly dont care to know
4182445 but statistical analysis shows it to be nearly inconceivable that sony made all its playstations without using congolese coltan
4182446 other studies mostly just look at one aspect the carbon capture
4182447 this is a first step in trying to quantify the environmental trade offs
4182448 the decision to substantially reduce greenhouse gas emissions is going to be intertwined with decisions about how to deal with these other emissions
4182449 people are turning their attention to this which is great

4182453 los rusos estaban preparados para aprovechar cualquier oportunidad y avanzaron agresivamente sobre osetia
4182454 durante 45 a os hemos hecho grandes esfuerzos para evitar una confrontaci n militar con rusia
4182455 no veo que haya razones para cambiar ahora ese enfoque
4182456 tiene que haber consecuencias de las acciones emprendidas por rusia contra una naci n soberana
4182457 tiene inter s en reafirmar el estatus de rusia como gran potencia su tradicional esfera de influencias y en corregir lo que los rusos ven como concesiones que se les impusieron despu s del colapso de la uni n sovi tica en la d cada de 1990
4182458 desafortunadamente ha elegido hacerlo de manera negativa y todas las naciones mirar n a rusia ahora de manera diferente por la acci n punitiva que lanz

4182464 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4182465 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4182466 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4182467 we are here against the atrocities being committed over the people of kashmir for the last three days we are also here with the demand of the people that the srinagar muzaffarabad route should be opened and i very respectfully appeal to the people that they should act patiently
4182468 there have been lot of atrocities over people of kashmir for the last two days more than 40 kashmiri youths have been killed it was a general perception in the kashmir valley that double standards have been adopted police and army were quite patient in dealing with the violent protests of jammu
4182469 right now the temper needs to be cooled down and mutual trust needs to built in it because neither in the valley nor anywhere else in the country people even expected that jammu will have so much reaction
4182470 a recession is a significant decline in economic activity spread across the economy lasting more than a few months normally visible in real gdp real income employment industrial production and wholesale retail sales
4182471 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4182472 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4182473 you can support us or leave to our fate but if they come for us and all hope is gone we will turn the middle east into a radioactive wasteland until the end of time
4182474 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4182475 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

4182547 we unanimously declined transpowers first application in 2006 because it did not meet the grid investment test git which is designed to protect consumers from unnecessary costs
4182548 the new proposal was substantially better in terms of providing reliable and cost effective transmission to the upper north island it is in line with good electricity industry practice particularly as it provides improved diversity of supply that means consumers will be better off in the long term
4182549 the pebble bed reactor is a nuclear reactor where the fuel is in the form of a sphere and heat flows out of the fuel sphere and theres helium that comes through the reactor and its heated helium that is used to generate electricity its completely safe because were talking about ceramic fuel elements it contains no metal parts and even if there was a loss of coolant in the reactor the fuel cannot over heat to the point where you have a meltdown of the fuel sphere the pebble bed concept comes from germany where experimental plants ran for several years now after a decade of refinements the south africans are commercializing the design they claim the technology is ready for worldwide distribution the big question is whether the world is ready for a nuclear resurgence
4182550 the pebble bed reactor is a nuclear reactor where the fuel is in the form of a sphere and heat flows out of the fuel sphere and theres helium that comes through the reactor and its heated helium that is used to generate electricity its completely safe because were talking about ceramic fuel elements it contains no metal parts and even if there was a loss of coolant in the reactor the fuel cannot over heat to the point where you have a meltdown of the fuel sphere
4182551 should the oil markets themselves begin to connect these dots then all our lives are going to be impacted violently and immediately the commodity traders for various interested firms live solely by anticipating conditions and events not by debating them and verifying them
4182552 even people on the lower end of it increase their estimates over time because technology and know how improves my own sense is that we wont find a peak and that there will probably be a demand peak that will probably come in 25 or 30 years
4182553 if you need to ask the price you cant afford it
4182554 the pebble bed reactor pbr is an advanced nuclear reactor type a number of prototypes have been built and it is currently under active development in south africa as the pbmr design and in china whose htr 10 is the only prototype currently operating
4182555 we should be shooting to match france which gets 77 percent of its electricity from nukes its past time for a decisive leap out of the hydrocarbon era time to send king coal and soon after big oil shambling off to their well deserved final resting places maybe on a nostalgic old steam locomotive besides wouldnt it be a blast to barrel down the freeway in a hydrogen hummer with a clean conscience as your copilot or not to feel like a planet killer every time you flick on the a c thats how the future could be if only we would get over our fear of the nuclear bogeyman and forge ahead for real this time into the atomic age
4182556 electricity demand is rising faster than people predicted because the dairy farming boom is exceeding expectations its the irrigation systems that use most of the electricity
4182557 if the cost comes down they may well be justified especially if certain groups insist on blocking new power generation initiatives
4182558 but the greens appear to have painted themselves into a corner no nukes

4182561 there is still no safe and long term way to dispose of the waste
4182562 all the high level waste produced so far is in storage and has to be constantly monitored and cooled

4182564 little heed is given to the bible and the lord has given a lesser light to lead men and women to the greater light
4182565 but god will have a people upon the earth to maintain the bible and the bible only as the standard of all doctrines and the basis of all reforms
4182566 the words of the bible and the bible alone should be heard from the pulpit
4182567 dont you quote sister white i dont want you ever to quote sister white until you get your vantage ground where you know where you are quote the bible talk the bible it is full of meat full of fatness carry it right out in your life and you will know more bible than you know now
4182568 now sister white theres something else that id like to find out how should i use your writings in preaching
4182569 heres the way to use them first ask god to give you your subject when you have the subject chosen then go to the bible until you know for sure what the bible really teaches on that point after that turn to the writings and see what you can find on the same subject and read that it may cast light on it or guide you into other scripture or make some point clearer when you go to the people however preach to them out of the bible
4182570 the testimonies of sister white should not be carried to the front gods word is the unerring standard the testimonies are not to take the place of the word let all prove the positions from the scriptures and substantiate every point they claim as truth from the revealed word of god
4182571 believers are not to rest in suppositions and ill defined ideas of what constitutes truth their faith must be firmly founded upon the word of god
4182572 on the same page in dealing with the current crisis
4182573 both said russia had escalated the dispute beyond its catalyst the conflict over south ossetia both said the united nations security council should call for an end to the violence both called for putting georgia on a path toward membership in nato and both spoke of deploying an international peacekeeping force in the disputed areas that set off the fighting
4182574 headstrong and reckless endangering the countrys security by rashly ordering an attack on the russian enclave of south ossetia on the eve of the olympic games in beijing and badly underestimating russias determination to respond militarily
4182575 lionized mr saakashvili as a model for democracy in the region to a point that the georgian leader may have held unrealistic expectations about the amount of support he might receive from the u s and the west
4182576 as we said earlier rex tillerson who is the board chair and ceo of exxonmobil doesnt talk often to the press
4182577 his company has reported remarkable profits in the first half of this year the high price of gas brought exxonmobil close to 22 billion in profit in profit for the first half of this year i asked him how he justifies that amount that some see as obscene
4182578 i saw someone characterize our profits the other day in terms of 1 400 in profit per second well they also need to understand we paid 4 000 a second in taxes and we spent 15 000 a second in costs we spend 1 billion a day just running our business so this is a business where large numbers are just characteristic of it
4182579 do you understand and can you appreciate from your position with the escalation of the price of a gallon of gas why people are fed up angry indeed disgusted with the oil companies

4182584 a group of czech dissidents addressed an appeal to her comrade davis you were in prison you know how unpleasant it is to sit in prison especially when you consider yourself innocent you have such great authority now could you help our czech prisoners could you stand up for those people in czechoslovakia who are being persecuted by the state angela davis answered they deserve what they get let them remain in prison
4182585 she presented a cogent intelligent and penetrating analysis of the functions of prisons in western democracies and made a strong case for their abolition

4182593 this rise in crime rate provides no support for liberal theories of crime no sustenance for the kind of person who proves the strength of his compassion by conceiving of those less law abiding than himself as automata mere executors of the dictates of circumstance
4182594 people who deny responsibility for their own actions use a language that portrays them as passive victims of circumstance
4182595 i have never understood the liberal assumption that if there were justice in the world there would be fewer rather than more prisoners
4182596 after all they are not highly educated so they have no culture there is no religion there is no belief that the country is involved in a transcendental purpose so there is very little left for them they live in their own soap opera actually
4182597 this rise in crime rate provides no support for liberal theories of crime no sustenance for the kind of person who proves the strength of his compassion by conceiving of those less law abiding than himself as automata mere executors of the dictates of circumstance
4182598 i learned early in my life that if people are offered the opportunity of tranquillity they often reject it and choose torment instead
4182599 political statements of 30 years ago are a bit less relevant
4182600 the fact she was full of shit 30 years ago doesnt mean she isnt talking sense now
4182601 enthusiasm for totalitarian dictatorships throwing their political opponents in prison
4182602 choosing to study at a university in a country does not automatically equate to support for the civil rights abuses conducted by that countrys secret services or do you think that people who choose to study in the usa therefore support the bombing of afghanistan detention without trial at guantanamo bay or the cia trying to overthrow democratically elected governments do people who choose to study in france therefore automatically support the bombing of the rainbow warrior
4182603 the quotation referred to is attributed to her by solzhenitzyn who has a pretty fair memory but there is no indication that he was there when the question was asked or where she was when the question was asked would you risk prison in the gdr after getting out of prison in the usa or how the question was actually phrased or what she actually said vs what her translator said she said in other words hearsay
4182604 do people who choose to study in france therefore automatically support the bombing of the rainbow warrior
4182605 did foreign fascists who visited nazi germany and spoke admiringly of it automatically support the concentration camps
4182606 people who think that this 30 year old not quite a quotation somehow negates the problems in this society that she is pointing at need to examine their reasoning

4182617 we can today confirm that we have advised the metropolitan police service that the actor christian bale should not face any charges following an incident which occurred in relation to his mother and sister at the dorchester hotel on 21 july this year
4182618 whilst the cps treats all incidents which take place in a domestic context seriously it is important that the views of complainants are also taken into account when making decisions in such cases
4182619 taking all the factors into consideration the decision has been taken that there is insufficient evidence to afford a realistic prospect of conviction and accordingly the police have been advised that no further action should be taken against mr bale

4182723 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4182724 our position on georgias territorial integrity is not going to change no matter what anybody says
4182725 and so i would consider that to be bluster from the foreign minister of russia we will ignore it
4182726 we are very concerned about these reports it is a serious situation

4182732 hes doing a great job its unbelievable hey im in great company i mean im standing next to somebody who broke my record that took 36 years to do and they say that somebodys character is judged by the company they keep so im in great company what the heck what do you think
4182733 somebody once said greatness is a matter of measure which others judge themselves by
4182734 and the amazing thing is that he almost accomplished that four years ago in athens but because of one relay that he was on that didnt get the gold medal that basically prevented him from getting seven gold medals so hes now increased the possibility of getting eight gold medals and hes increased the chances because hes a world recordholder in an event that he wasnt previously
4182735 theres this common thread of people that have become really excellent in sport that is we knew how to beat our competitors we knew everything about them and we knew everything to make ourselves the best at what we did so in theory then if i competed against somebody like michael id actually have his number tagged and hed have mine so wed have to tie
4182736 and hes the greatest swimmer in the world probably the greatest athlete in the world right now that hes proving that hes won more gold medals than anybody more gold medals in olympic games and so its just fantastic to watch this great human being do something thats now going to be never done before
4182737 i wish him the best and im going to be rooting him on i wish i could be there

4182748 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico

4182750 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
4182751 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia

4182755 este tipo de racismo social y ambiental es una violaci n de derechos humanos y es una forma de discriminaci n que viene agrediendo al medio ambiente la salud biodiversidad la econom a local la calidad de vida y seguridad en nuestras comunidades esta discriminaci n racial es ocasionada por las pol ticas p blicas y privadas y que se manifiesta en la intenci n de que los costos e impactos sean asumidos por nosotros los mapuches junto a la exclusi n manifiesta en la toma de decisiones que afectan nuestras vidas
4182756 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
4182757 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
4182758 esta situaci n viene d ndose hace mucho tiempo atr s y se les ha notificado y dado tiempo para realizar los cambios correspondientes pero ellos s lo han respondido con promesas incumplidas es por eso que anunciamos que estamos dispuestos a recuperar nuestra escuela y se hace el llamado a todas las instituciones mapuche presente en el wall mapu ha colaborar en este proceso
4182759 jos huenchunao exige ser trasladado de inmediato desde la c rcel de angol a un centro de eduaci n y trabajo lugar en el que pueda desarrollar trabajo agr colas y permanecer en condiciones de dignidad inherentes a su condici n de preso pol tico comunero mapuche
4182760 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche
4182761 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
4182762 frente a la situaci n de nuestro werken preso pol tico mapuche jos huenchunao mari an recluido en la c rcel de angol cumpliendo una condena de 10 a os por el caso poluco pidenco queremos anunciar y denunciar lo siguiente
4182763 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades
4182764 la legitimidad y normalidad del acto plebiscitario reafirma la consolidaci n del proceso democr tico boliviano y la solidez de sus instituciones
4182765 urgente necesidad de respetar y promover los derechos intr nsecos de los pueblos ind genas que derivan de sus estructuras pol ticas econ micas y sociales y de sus culturas de sus tradiciones espirituales de su historia y de su concepci n de la vida especialmente los derechos a sus tierras territorios y recursos
4182766 celebrar n consultas y cooperar n de buena fe con los pueblos ind genas interesados por conducto de sus propias instituciones representativas a fin de obtener su consentimiento libre e informado antes de aprobar cualquier proyecto que afecte a sus tierras o territorios y otros recursos particularmente en relaci n con el desarrollo la utilizaci n o la explotaci n de recursos minerales h dricos o de otro tipo

4182768 la empresa manquiri s a al estar operando en territorio boliviano debe sujetarse a lo dispuesto por el ordenamiento jur dico nacional en materia de derechos de pueblos ind genas como son el convenio no 169 y la declaraci n de las naciones unidas esto implica que si la demanda del ayllu resulta evidente y fehaciente la empresa tendr que realizar sus descargos respectivos ante las instancias respectivas
4182769 la empresa manquiri s a al estar operando en territorio boliviano debe sujetarse a lo dispuesto por el ordenamiento jur dico nacional en materia de derechos de pueblos ind genas como son el convenio no 169 ratificado por ley no 1257 y actualmente la declaraci n de las naciones unidas ratificada por ley no 3760 esto implica que si la demanda del ayllu resulta evidente y fehaciente la empresa tendr que realizar sus descargos respectivos ante las instancias respectivas
4182770 las personas privadas extranjeras que operan en el pa s como es la empresa manquiri subsidiaria de la minera americana coeur dalene como en el presente caso y que tienen adem s instancias encargadas de velar que el desempe o de sus inversiones es la tarea de opic no derive en da os a las comunidades ind genas y originaria son bien acogidas sus iniciativas de soluci n de conflictos que permitan alcanzar una real y efectiva restituci n de los derechos vulnerados o en riesgo de ser vulnerados
4182771 las pol ticas del opic obligan a la empresa a financiar un plan de desarrollo para pueblos ind genas y manquiri no lo financi el proyecto minero caus el reasentamiento de algunas familias del ayllu que fueron removidas sin un plan de reasentamiento lo que implica que no hubo una metodolog a para compensar estas familias adem s causo la fractura de la comunidad porque la empresa no ofreci tierras como parte de la compensaci n sino ofreci casas en la ciudad lejos de su comunidad del pastoreo y de sus animales
4182772 en el marco de sus atribuciones y competencias conferidas por la constituci n pol tica del estado y la ley no 1818 en lo que toca a preservar el respeto a los derechos humanos de los pueblos ind genas reflejados en el ordenamiento jur dico nacional y los instrumentos internacionales reconocidos por bolivia
4182773 la empresa va a tratar de resolver este conflicto muy r pidamente para no da ar m s su reputaci n los miembros del ayllu no deber an someterse a una negociaci n que no tiene condiciones justas y deber an exigir que opic tome la responsabilidad por los incumplimientos de sus pol ticas por parte de la empresa minera en cuesti n
4182774 el conflicto en chile no existe ni debe existir y los incipientes signos de conflictos son perfectamente controlables
4182775 cuando fui militar dirig un grupo donde el 80 y 90 eran de origen mapuche y que ten a las mejores relaciones con ellos y record que adem s en la cabecera de su escritorio ten a un retrato de lautaro
4182776 la votaci n de este domingo fue el mayor desaf o que ha enfrentado la gesti n de morales
4182777 para ser confirmado en su cargo el presidente necesita un m nimo del 53 7 de los sufragios el porcentaje que logr en las elecciones de 2005 mientras que los prefectos deben obtener la mitad m s uno de los votos
4182778 tambi n fueron confirmados en sus puestos cinco de los ocho prefectos que se sometieron a la votaci n mientras tres deber n abandonar sus labores

4182782 la historia dice que barrick ayud y respet cada pulgada de los cr menes en toronto el 7 de mayo de 2008 cuando me encontr con los ejecutivos de barrick qued confiado en que la gerencia har todo lo posible para suprimir las matanzas en el sitio de la mina de porgera hab amos convenido en iniciar un di logo pero a n antes de comenzar las matanzas y las muertes que ocurren en el sitio de la mina est n aumentando
4182783 nuestras investigaciones han establecido que el personal de seguridad de barrick ingres a las aldeas locales usando rifles de alta potencia tipo m16 y dispararon contra los pobladores inofensivos
4182784 la gente ha hecho quitar todos de sus huertas y jardines ahora est viviendo al lado de la descarga de residuos de la mina y buscan el oro ya que no tiene ninguna otra manera de ganarse la vida
4182785 esta situaci n est alcanzando su punto de crisis y barrick gold no est tomando ninguna acci n responsable la soluci n es clara las situaciones econ micas y sociales de la gente local rodeadas por la basura y la contaminaci n atmosf rica son atroces
4182786 no queremos que sea una firma m s de la que muchos han firmado sino que nos preocuparemos d a a d a hora tras hora de que este convenio pueda llegar a su etapa final lo que se recupere aqu no es para hacerlo picadillo de cebolla sino que ser algo hist rico para el pueblo mapuche
4182787 hemos recuperado la totalidad del espacio que ocupaba la fuerza a rea y estamos con la parte t cnica con nuestros asesores que es el observatorio de derechos de pueblos ind genas y con los ejecutivos del gobierno regional para avanzar metro a metro y ac no poemos hablar de bicentenario sino de reinvindicaci n y reconocimiento de nuestros territorios
4182788 la culminaci n de un proceso de conversaci n de dialogo que hemos desarrollado y que ha tenido muchas vivisitudes en el camino los anuncios de la presidenta el 1 de abril son los caminos para dar respuestas a las necesidades que tienen nuestros pueblos
4182789 que quisieramos iniciar con todas las comunidades de nuestro pa s la presidenta bachelet nos ha se alado que este es el camino y las comunidades de maquehue nos enorgullesen porque han entendido y hecho efectiva esta invitaci n estos hechos que parecen peque os van marcando nuestra historia este convenio contiene una serie de iniciativas de inversi n donde nos comprometemos la administraci n p blica los servicios a cumplir los anuncios de la presidenta de este nuevo pacto por el re conocer en este convenio se conjugan valores de participaci n de respeto de sensibilidad social y de compensaci n con los pueblos originarios de la deuda hist rica que tenemos como sociedad
4182790 hoy en las palabras de la propia intendenta el t rmino compensacion fue utilizada y el propio convenio habla de la demanda de recuperaci n territorial
4182791 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas
4182792 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
4182793 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades
4182794 esta violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales
4182795 hay un uso excesivo de la facultad de los fiscales que han ordenado el ingreso de funcionarios de fuerzas especiales y del grupo de operaciones especiales
4182796 de mantenerse esta l gica lo m s probable es que vamos a cosechar desgracias
4182797 en nuestro pa s han sido declarados enemigos los j venes que expresan su descontento por la ausencia de perspectivas de futuro los estudiantes que se oponen a la mercantilizaci n de la educaci n los trabajadores sindicalizados que luchan por condiciones laborales dignas y los mapuches que exigen la restituci n de sus tierras ancestrales
4182798 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
4182799 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
4182800 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
4182801 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
4182802 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
4182803 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos
4182804 magn fica demostraci n de la incapacidad de di logo de los estudiantes de chile
4182805 igual de vehemente de apasionado de arriesgado en la defensa de sus err neos principios pol ticos su padre me explic ella era militante de la ultraderecha de sus d as
4182806 y de inmediato la sentencia de expulsi n quedar sin efecto
4182807 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
4182808 frente a la situaci n de nuestro werken preso pol tico mapuche jos huenchunao mari an recluido en la c rcel de angol cumpliendo una condena de 10 a os por el caso poluco pidenco queremos anunciar y denunciar lo siguiente
4182809 la argentina depende fundamentalmente del campo y de lo que sucede en el campo
4182810 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades

4182815 this type of time frame helps people see steady progress along the way while not feeling too much pressure this is similar to some of the dieting regimens not too close so you dont see progress but not too far away either so you dont get discouraged
4182816 even though guilt and shame are often interchangeably used each is a distinct emotion
4182817 participants who felt guilty about the impulse buying used proactive coping strategies such as adjusting budgets and planning to reduce impulse buying in the future on the other hand shameful buyers used more avoidant emotion focused strategies such as denial and reframing the incident to be less injurious to the self

4182827 there is a great deal of excitement in the quantum condensed matter community about the iron pnictides
4182828 for more than 20 years our perspective was limited to cuprates and it is hoped that this new class of materials will help us understand the mechanism for high temperature superconductivity
4182829 precisely how this happens is one of the challenging questions in strongly correlated electron systems
4182830 but even though we dont know the precise mechanism we are still able to make some general predictions about the behavior of pnictides and weve suggested a number of experiments that can test these predictions

4182844 what has been called the long war is likely to be many years of persistent engaged combat all around the world in differing degrees of size and intensity this generational campaign cannot be wished away or put on a timetable there are no exit strategies to paraphrase the bolshevik leon trotsky we may not be interested in the long war but the long war is interested in us
4182845 for the foreseeable future winning the long war against violent extremist movements will be the central objective of the u
4182846 the principal challenge therefore is how to ensure that the capabilities gained and counterinsurgency lessons learned from iraq and afghanistan as well as the lessons re learned from other places where we have engaged in irregular warfare over the last two decades are institutionalized within the defense establishment

4182863 as nanotechnology scientists we face a challenge similar to the one faced by structural biologists half a century ago determining the structure with atomic scale precision of a whole range of nanoscale materials
4182864 if we can understand how peptides self assemble at the surface of a nanoparticle we can open up a route towards the design and synthesis of nanoparticles that have complex surfaces these particles could find applications in the biomedical sciences for example to deliver drugs to a particular target in the body or to design sensitive diagnostic tests in the longer term these particles could also find applications in new generations of electronic components
4182865 bionanotechnology holds great promise for the future we may be able to create stronger lighter and more durable materials or new medical applications basic science and techniques for working at the nanoscale are providing the understanding that will permit future such applications of bionanotechnology

4182883 the clear language of the artistic license creates conditions to protect the economic rights at issue in the granting of a public license these conditions govern the rights to modify and distribute the computer programs and files included in the downloadable software package
4182884 the lack of money changing hands in open source licensing should not be presumed to mean that there is no economic consideration
4182885 there are substantial benefits including economic benefits to the creation and distribution of copyrighted works under public licenses that range far beyond traditional license royalties for example program creators may generate market share for their programs by providing certain components free of charge similarly a programmer or company may increase its national or international reputation by incubating open source projects

4182899 its interesting that when your boyfriend shared his fantasy with you you jumped right to the term cuckolding

4182901 nothing about responsible nonmonogamy involves a free pass of any sort
4182902 its absolutely possible for you to transform your monogamous relationship into one thats nonmonogamous but you need to sit down and hash out the details including whats okay and whats not
4182903 the more you hash this out beforehand the better youll both feel
4182904 both sides agree that it is in the best interest of party unity and making sure that everyones voice and vote is honored to make sure her name is put into nomination its to honor everyone who worked so hard on both sides

4182909 i realised that the stork billed is a ferocious predator when instead of picking up the fish from the water by scooping it into its beak it just dived bombed directly at its target it flapped its wings during the initial dive to fold them as it gains momentum just before touching the water
4182910 the speed was so fast that most probably the fish had little chance of escaping
4182911 you can know the name of a bird in all the languages of the world but when youre finished youll know absolutely nothing whatever about the bird so lets look at the bird and see what its doing thats what counts i learned very early the difference between knowing the name of something and knowing something

4182923 yes of course definitely i really want to make it here
4182924 at the beginning i wasnt really playing maybe only 10 or 20 minutes at the end of the games but when the coach was replaced i found new confidence and i worked myself into the team
4182925 the beginning was difficult because i have never had that situation before that was the hard part i needed to learn from it and i did it just shows that nobody will just give you something you have to work hard for it
4182926 i worked my way into the team and from there my experience was very good i got new friends too so in general it was a very good time for me
4182927 playing professionally is a new situation one where you play in front of 25 000 people one with pressure from press and fans every single week i am not saying it is better than reserve football here because you learn so much but it is different
4182928 it looks more like the first team and that can prepare you and make you a better player
4182929 it fills me happiness that i am at arsenal a great club and one of the best for young people

4182937 james fahn executive director of the bangkok based earth journalism network and one of the speakers in the recent climate change media workshop for southeast asian journalists held in manila said that
4182938 always put in may such as climate change may cause more tornadoes in asia than climate change would result in this and that he stressed
4182939 what we have are only scenarios and scenarios are not facts
4182940 focus more on the solutions to climate change and to adapt to its effects and less on the frightening statistics to move from denial to despair to action
4182941 editors stick to what they know even if facts tell otherwise
4182942 we have the technology to do it and it would create a transparency that is critically important in this type of market

4182950 hatred hurts the person hurting its like drinking poison and expecting that person the person you are hating to die
4182951 the dia research dates from 1976 and shows the dangers were known about over twenty years ago the soviets used the frequencies and intensities used by mobile phones 1800 mhz and 900 mhz as weapons it is a rule of the intelligence community that you hide things in plain view getting the public to accept microwave mind control weapons which affect their behavior under the guise of mobile phones was a stroke of genius getting the public to pay for these microwave mind control devices so their brains and behavior can be damaged to make them more docile and easy to control was pure diabolical genius
4182952 what happens when the fbi spends millions of dollars targeting an american citizen for an illegal cointelpro operation while perpetrating precedent setting violations of that citizens constitutional rights yet fails to arrest that person the fbi then uses the media to slander the targeted person and coercion to blackmail those around the target including the targets family into keeping silent in regard to the torture they are being subjected to in efforts to drive them to suicide such precedent setting crimes are now being perpetrated against my person by the fbi nsa amp dhs you could be their next victim
4182953 the indigo blue ribbon campaign to promote the awareness of people targeted for mind control amp organized stalking crimes
4182954 what is the us federal government doing using satellites to spy on americans within the privacy of their own homes this has been occurring since long before the 9 11 attacks black operations which were an inside job perpetrated to keep the war on terror open ended so that the illuminati run us federal government can continue to erode our freedoms under the pretext of protecting us from an invisible enemy
4182955 it is illegal amp against its charter for the nsa to spy domestically unless it receives permission from the fisa court to do so and then only if it can prove that the american citizen to be placed under surveillance is in contact with an international terrorist so exactly what is the nsa doing illegally spying on myself and millions of other unwitting americans
4182956 nsa personnel can dial up any individual in the country on the signals lntelligence emf scanning network and the nsas computers will then pinpoint and track that person 24 hours a day the nsa can pick out and track anyone in the u s
4182957 the followings a diagram of the type of mind control software that agencies like the nsa utilize on targets of illegal mind control research any american citizen can be targeted for this satellite based weaponry at any time without their knowledge or consent
4182958 we need a program of psychosurgery for political control of our society the purpose is physical control of the mind everyone who deviates from the given norm can be surgically mutilated the individual may think that the most important reality is his own existence but this is only his personal point of view this lacks historical perspective man does not have the right to develop his own mind this kind of liberal orientation has great appeal we must electrically control the brain some day armies and generals will be controlled by electric stimulation of the brain
4182959 consider the damage done to us as a people by the us congress cia fbi dod nsa and dhs alone the biological chemical and electronic warfare that they have subjected so many of us to the illegal and humiliating nsa satellite spying of us within the privacy of our own domiciles the inhumanity of their mind control torture the complete manipulation of the us economy through the illuminati controlled federal reserve bank and irs and the treasonous crimes committed by them through the improperly ratified and unconstitutional federal reserve act the us federal governments usurpation and manipulation of the us media through the cias operation mockingbird the abject treason of the attacks on 9 11 and one can only arrive at the following conclusion only a population that is either extremely ignorant of the facts or masochistic would ever allow for a government which is such anathema to exist within their country
4182960 so to begin i want to state the most basic of all facts about brainwashing in the entire history of man no one has ever been brainwashed and realized or believed that he had been brainwashed
4182961 nothing would warrant the monitoring of individuals every minute habit 24 7 unless theyre us intelligence doing illegal inhumane testing
4182962 the most powerful weapon in the hands of the oppressor is the mind of the oppressed
4182963 the extensive crimes against humanity which the us federal government controlled by the privately held federal reserve bank has perpetrated against the american people which includes the crime of menticide are so far reaching that in most instances its beyond their comprehension the people of this planet must stop thinking in groups amp starting thinking for themselves the illuminati has us convinced that we should be fighting eachother as in making war on other countries when it is the illuminati which operates through our banking systems amp governments whom we should be working to destroy
4182964 these guys are professional liars who have raised selected memory loss to an art form
4182965 with the creation of this website ive done the best i can to document the nsas illegal spying and mind control operations which adversely affect myself and myriad other americans in the present day there are also citizens from many other countries reporting this same phenomenon
4182966 as for the 9 11 attacks with the satellite spy technology that the nsa has incorporated into its echelon spy system there is absolutely no way that this agency would not have known about the attacks on 9 11 before hand if osama bin ladin was really behind these attacks as we have been told the nsa could have immediately disabled him through the use of directed energy weapons technology bin laden like lee harvey oswald was nothing more than a lightening rod used to cover up yet another major us intelligence black operation perpetrated against the american people

4182987 as with previous multi year drm development efforts this one disintegrated like wet kleenex on contact with the general public now that vista hdcp blu ray and hd dvd are all broken it seems like the millions of dollars and thousands of work hours sunk into these systems was mis spent the only benefit that these anti copying systems confer to the companies that developed them is the right to sue competitors and that benefit could have been had by shellacking a one atom thick layer of token drm onto their systems just enough to be able to invoke the dmca everything else was just gold plating wasted money

4182997 were very happy and relieved to hear that matthew is alive
4182998 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4182999 our position on georgias territorial integrity is not going to change no matter what anybody says
4183000 and so i would consider that to be bluster from the foreign minister of russia we will ignore it
4183001 we are very concerned about these reports it is a serious situation
4183002 its difficult at the tactical level to know each and every engagement in each town
4183003 we let her stay here and now shes blaming everything on us
4183004 it meant a lot to us we wanted to keep the pressure on them kind of redeem ourselves
4183005 this was a payback game for us and we knew people were wondering how we were going to respond
4183006 every night we want to play well but we got better as a team tonight
4183007 when we can get a stop on the defensive end and get out and run until you get out on the court with us you cant really understand how fast we are as a team
4183008 last time we just sat back and let them run their sets and let them pick us apart and when you let teams do that theyre good they have good motion and can really hurt you this time we made them run their offense 30 feet from the basket were really into them and kept the pressure on the whole time
4183009 but if a team comes out and plays better than us or if we dont come out and play like we know how to play then we can lose
4183010 the danger from iran is grave it is real and my goal will be to eliminate this threat
4183011 we cannot continue to rely on our military in order to achieve the national security objectives weve set weve got to have a civilian national security force thats just as powerful just as strong just as well funded

4183020 i found myself perplexed and disappointed by what i saw as a widespread aesthetic of mimicry among chinese rock bands of all stripes
4183021 part of the reason for this is simply the novelty of rock in china and the difficulty its had establishing roots
4183022 the absence of new ideas in chinese rock is partly due to a lack of confidence among the musicians they havent fully figured out what it means to play rock music in their culture what chinese rock should sound like
4183023 westerners also bear some responsibility for the arrested development of chinese rock
4183024 one of the most interesting things i was told while in china was that the idea of imitation has a much different cultural connotation there

4183234 i think he has a better shot now that mccarthy is evidently back to getting more lower body into his delivery theres never a guarantee but none of his injuries were that bad i agree that changing mechanics too much can be a bad thing id be loathe to change things that were working the idea that we can see things is being proved more and more false so im having less and less faith in coaches that are working off eyesight guesses and wisdom passed down from well who knows

4183247 you are out there by yourself if you think about competing with others that is when the mental mistakes can happen because you are not so strong psychologically
4183248 i was in very good shape back then if i couldnt win a gold then i thought i could never get a gold extra training would not have had an effect
4183249 hes been encouraging me saying you didnt win but this does not mean you cannot win in 2008

4183302 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state

4183307 while we have taken many steps to reorganize and streamline operations to respond to changing business models and these economic challenges we need to do more to control expenses
4183308 we know this freeze comes at a time when the economy is putting stress on your personal expenses and when you are working hard to adapt to our changing business model
4183309 we are confident that all of the efforts and cost control measures being made will result in a far more stable and financially healthy company in the future

4183317 we do sample airworthiness bulletins when we do maintenance audits but we can only sample them
4183318 qantas would have at any time in excess of 2000 airworthiness bulletins current for its fleet

4183320 there has been too much cost cutting and not enough attention to quality

4183322 winning mere one gold medal does not reflect the expectation of a vast population like us
4183323 the gap between overall inflation and core inflation now is the biggest gap seen since 1974 and that reflects a commodities bubble and that bubble is bursting
4183324 weve moving from a mini me recession into a mild expansion and in that environment i think stocks in general are relatively cheap
4183325 i do like health care and technology but i think the most important thing is to have a good position in long term assets in this market
4183326 i dont like treasurys but i think people need to take on board a little risk here because i think the return will eventually be there
4183327 i dont think the real optimistic strategists are thinking the end of this year is going to be great im stretching it into the middle of 09 at that point the market gets a little firm footing
4183328 were getting to a point where now the data tells a reality but it tells a little bit of a backward looking reality
4183329 were getting to the last stages of this but as inflation ripples though i think these cpi reports will probably continue to be ugly through years end

4183348 the initiative deceptively reads like its supporting all alternative fuel vehicles and renewable energy sources
4183349 but a closer read finds a laundry list of cash grabs much of the measures billions could benefit pickens company to the exclusion of almost all other clean vehicle fuels and technology
4183350 even worse private trucking and delivery companies could buy 5 000 natural gas trucks collect california taxpayer funded rebates of 200 million or more and immediately send those fleets out of state
4183351 its like asking california voters to finance a new bridge with taxpayer dollars without mentioning that the bridge could be in ohio
4183352 it is hard to tell if the water scheme is the device being used to seize the land or if the wind turbine scheme is the means by which he will fund the water scheme
4183353 no matter what the case may be nancy pelosi will personally profit from whatever pickens does as an investor
4183354 while the stock was initially offered at 14 and is now valued below that amount the low of 10 in early july of this year is bouncing back
4183355 especially in light of ads by pickens and growing consensus that the pickens plan will gain support especially if pelosi is firmly behind it
4183356 there was something about this story that i felt so personally committed to
4183357 ive always had a lot of respect for average working people

4183360 john is still mulling over their relationship he likes to have some space before deciding it is definitely over but he may be too late if these rumours that she is dating a model are true he will be really upset
4183361 john took the decision to end things as he felt he just wasnt ready for the level of commitment that jennifer deserved
4183362 contrary to reports jennifer didnt want to have kids or marry this year but she did want to set a timetable for their future together she also wanted him to assure her he would cut down his tours in the future when they did eventually have children
4183363 bob wants answers about what has been going on max is keen to meet him and explain he only has his daughters future at heart but he has a tough job on his hands
4183364 peaches is expecting fireworks although she knows her dad will respect her wishes
4183365 bob cant get over the fact she did this on a whim
4183366 right now he doesnt want to see her but hes incandescent with rage and she is in for a huge talking to when they finally meet up
4183367 peaches was ashamed of the overdose and worried shed end up like amy winehouse she and faris had started regularly using drugs and she realised it was becoming a problem
4183368 so when she met max again who is a nice boy and a harvard graduate she thought being alongside him would steer her life on a different path
4183369 of course we have our ups and downs but all in all my mother taught us to appreciate what we have been

4183371 discarding fish not only means a massive waste of food and potential income it also leads to unrecorded catches resulting in a poorer scientific basis for our management decisions

4183378 dell welcomes the availability of intels xhci specification because it provides a single interface standard that will expedite the industry transition to next generation usb 3 0
4183379 this interface standard is important to ensure that our customers have interoperable usb 3 0 systems devices and software drivers

4183381 microsoft intends to deliver windows support for hardware that is compliant with the xhci specification this is a huge step forward in enabling the industry and our customers to easily connect superspeed usb devices to their pcs for exciting new functionality and usages
4183382 nec electronics has supported intels ehci specification for usb 2 0 and whci specification for wireless usb 1 0 and developed solutions based on both of these standards
4183383 nec electronics will now provide usb 3 0 solutions based on intels xhci specification to ensure interoperability of our solution with multiple products from various manufacturers as we have done for usb 2 0 nec electronics would like to lead the usb 3 0 market with our discrete usb 3 0 host controller

4183420 latino businessmen really learned the hard lesson in prince william county which is if you are not involved public policy can really affect the local economy
4183421 we have exclusively done our lobbying through the eyes of businessmen and women and that is why we have created this coalition because we think the economic arguments are often the strongest
4183422 the truth is we are the ones who have the tools and the facility to do this with some of the shops and restaurants that our community visits
4183423 we review our policies regularly and make changes to keep them current and effective we have not yet received the petition from the supreme court but we take local laws extremely seriously and will review the petition carefully

4183427 i think the times like the washington post usa today the wall street journal the los angeles times major networks and wire services was far too squeamish about tackling the story
4183428 the times did not want to regurgitate the enquirers reporting without verifying it which is responsible but the times did not try to verify it beyond a few perfunctory efforts which i think was wrong
4183429 without overstating these bonds i naively believed that i knew edwards as well as i understood anyone in the political center ring yet i never saw this sex scandal coming partly because i accepted the mythology that surrounded the edwardses marriage and partly because i assumed that any hint of a wandering eye would have come out during the 2004 campaign
4183430 but then rielle hunter and the national enquirer brought us all into the real world
4183431 last week i spoke to a reporter for the raleigh news amp observer who said he spent five days in los angeles trying to confirm any aspect of the beverly hilton story he came up with nothing zero zilch
4183432 not because he wasnt trying because without a checkbook the raleigh news amp observer was not going to be let into the world of rielle hunter
4183433 the enquirer cannot be ignored but neither can it be trusted
4183434 we needed to verify the hotel allegations or at least give edwards a chance to address them before publishing we reported aggressively but used restraint when it came to publication
4183435 some readers think we did too much with this story others think we did too little i think we handled it right

4183454 secondo la concezione materialistica della storia la produzione e riproduzione della vita reale nella storia il momento in ultima istanza determinante di pi n io n marx abbiamo mai affermato se ora qualcuno distorce quella affermazione in modo che il momento economico rappresenti essere lunico determinante trasforma quel principio in una frase fatta insignificante astratta e assurda

4183508 generally the forces are starting to move out of the city particularly gori starting to consolidate their positions and get themselves into a position where they can start to back away towards the border we see that going on particularly in the areas around the seaports and around tbilisi and up north of tbilisi and west towards gori
4183509 really there has been no air activity and so we see them generally complying and moving back into a position where they can start to make their exit in an orderly fashion
4183510 i dont see any prospect for the use of military force by the united states in this situation is that clear enough
4183511 the air corridors are open for us to take the humanitarian supplies in
4183512 they appear to be withdrawing their forces back towards abkhazia and back and to the zone of conflict toward south ossetia
4183513 the united states spent 45 years working very hard to avoid a military confrontation with russia i see no reason to change that approach today
4183514 well first of all i think we need to take this in sequences getting the russians back inside the zone of conflict and then back inside abkhazia and south ossetia it seems to me is the first objective
4183515 whether they russian forces stay there how long they stay there and so on is as best i can tell a subject that will be negotiated
4183516 ensure that all lines of communication and transport including seaports airports roads and airspace remain open

4183529 the claim for compensation of chelsea football club regarding the breach of a contract which was signed between the two parties on 12 august 2003 has been partially accepted
4183530 the player adrian mutu will have to pay the amount of 17 173 990 euros to chelsea football club
4183531 this is an important decision for football not only did the drc make us a very significant monetary award the decision also recognised the damaging effect incidents involving drugs has on football and the responsibilities we all have in this area
4183532 we never asked for a sum the only thing we ever said publicly was how much in our accounts mutu was worth when mutu left obviously he had a value in our account
4183533 that value was 13 million pounds 25 28 million but when we made our case to fifa we did not ask for a specific amount

4183539 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4183540 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4183541 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4183542 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4183543 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4183544 we looked into working a deal with some teams but it just wasnt there
4183545 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4183546 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4183547 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4183548 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4183549 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4183550 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4183551 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
4183552 state transportation officials say a sacramento highway project is on hold so they can study its potential effect on global warming the department of transportation wants to add lanes to the congested highway 50 corridor west of downtown sacramento but a judge last month ruled the state had failed to analyze the greenhouse gas emissions that could be produced if the project goes forward

4183572 for those who are coming early to tailgate and to enjoy the game with friends and family please pick up your trash and be respectful of the community
4183573 there was a remarkable change in the neighborhoods from the louisville game to the end of the season
4183574 game day is sort of the apex of an ongoing problem from day to day which is students being unaware of trash pick up and how to handle their trash
4183575 constant ongoing parking problems the neighborhoods are besieged with cars every day not just on game day these are issues that are ongoing and perhaps if this game day thing expresses some awareness my hope is that the awareness carries on every day

4183579 this conference takes great pride in the success of its student athletes not only on the playing field but more importantly in the classroom

4183588 this is an important decision for football not only did the drc make us a very significant monetary award the decision also recognised the damaging effect incidents involving drugs has on football and the responsibilities we all have in this area

4183597 shall we write the test for the null case now
4183598 i think this method can be deleted now do you agree
4183599 one of the programmers the driver has control of the keyboard mouse and actively implements the program the other programmer the observer continuously observes the work of the driver to identify tactical syntactic spelling etc defects and also thinks strategically about the direction of the work
4183600 when pairing is working at its best both share the same goal for completing the task
4183601 an effective technique is to explain your code to someone else
4183602 the pairs write tests together giving them a chance to align their understanding before tackling the meat of the implementation
4183603 with pair programming four eyeballs are better than two and a momentous number of defects are prevented removed right from the start these continual reviews outperform traditional formal reviews in their defect removal speed
4183604 knowledge is constantly being passed between partners from tool usage tips to design and programming idioms the partners take turns being the teacher and the student even unspoken skills and habits cross partners
4183605 expert novice pairing can even be valuable for novices who are novices only in the sense that they havent been with their team for very long watching and then doing with an expert by your side can greatly reduce the time it would require to learn the right way of working with the team it really helps when the newbie works with many of the experts or with any team member so he or she can learn about many different aspects of the system
4183606 collaborative teams consistently report that together they can evolve solutions to unruly or seemingly impossible problems the driver might actually be working out a design or implementing a part of the problem realizing that he or she may ultimately come to a dead end in the problem resolution the navigator while watching the drivers partial design or implementation begins thinking about the next step when the driver hits the dead end the navigator is often prepared to take over and lead the way often the cycle continues until the problem is solved
4183607 in our recent web survey we asked what have you found beneficial about pair programming
4183608 two people working in a pair treat their shared time as more valuable they tend to cut phone calls short they dont check e mail messages or favorite web pages they dont waste each others time
4183609 under stress people revert they will skip writing tests they will put off refactoring they will avoid integrating with your partner watching though chances are that even if you feel like blowing off one of these practices your partner wont
4183610 with any software development process there is a constant struggle to get the software engineers to follow the prescribed process a benefit of pair programming is improved adherence to procedures and standards
4183611 others see us already working with someone else and they leave us alone the net effect is that we have bigger blocks of uninterrupted time which is good for our mental state and our progress it also reduces task switching which for some people generates a huge overhead

4183621 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4183622 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4183623 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4183624 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va

4183628 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4183629 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4183630 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4183631 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4183632 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4183633 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4183634 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4183635 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4183636 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4183637 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4183638 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4183639 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4183640 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4183641 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4183642 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4183643 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4183644 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4183645 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4183646 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4183647 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4183648 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4183649 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4183650 youre a hard worker one of the best employees weve ever had with your knowledge work ethic and skill set you will have no problem getting a job at another hospital
4183651 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4183652 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
4183653 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4183654 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4183655 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4183656 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4183657 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4183658 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4183659 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4183660 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4183661 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4183662 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4183663 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4183664 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4183665 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4183666 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4183667 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4183668 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4183669 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4183670 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4183671 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4183672 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4183673 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4183674 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4183675 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4183676 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4183677 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4183678 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4183679 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4183680 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits

4183682 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
4183683 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
4183684 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4183685 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4183686 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4183687 we should probably go ahead and strip all assumptions out of how

4183689 the twins recently contacted seattle to inquire about third baseman adrian beltre as they look for ways to boost their offense against lefthanded pitching a club source said its unclear how deep the discussions got but the twins decided to act on the internal discussions they had about the mariners slugger

4183693 the yankees acquisition of bobby abreu went so well two years ago they are trying to recreate it now with jarrod washburn
4183694 rival executives report that there is some anger within the seattle hierarchy about the way the negotiations with the yankees for jarrod washburn have played out publicly and an nl executive who has been in contact with the mariners on monday says he wouldnt be surprised if seattle works to deliver the lefty to another team even if it means swallowing many dollars
4183695 there is no way niese is being offered for ibanez the mets arent that stupid

4183699 3 type pitcher and considering his age frame and development there was definitely room for growth
4183700 many draw comparisons between dejesus and carlos triunfel another prized mariners shortstop prospect but dejesus has shown more power than triunfel displayed in his first two professional seasons
4183701 furcal rafael furcal he doesnt have the arm and isnt a shortstop but at the plate he morban may very well have similar natural skills
4183702 its not that often youre getting the brandon morrows down there
4183703 most organizations are sending mid level prospects down there who are pitchers and sending their elite hitters because youre just so leery of putting more innings on that arm
4183704 it was done last year with brandon and i think there were probably times when people were holding their breath a little bit with it he got through it but i think we probably wouldnt go that route again
4183705 are we going to be in the marketplace looking for guys to improve yes
4183706 olney says that requests for max scherzer are keeping the dbacks from making any moves such as for raul ibanez

4183719 the officers were on campus investigating a crime that had been reported to them and they approached the players who took off running
4183720 when the officers caught up with them they said they never heard them say stop but that kind of begs the question of why they ran

4183729 because i feel we have to regain some respect in the league i really am not in the mode of just playing people because they just got here from triple a they are going to get a lot of at bats but early on here we need to win some games to regain our stature in the division
4183730 all we need is a number four starter and well totally be able to beat tampa and boston
4183731 it could be an action packed week in seattle when we surveyed teams this week on players they expect to see moved jarrod washburn was voted most likely starter to get traded and arthur rhodes was voted most likely left handed set up man to relocate the mariners are driving a slightly harder bargain on raul ibanez but if they dont move him too it wont be for lack of interest
4183732 it may be true that marte will wind up being a type a
4183733 but isnt it possible that because hes a type a no one is going to want to sign him is a team really going to want to give up a first round pick for damaso marte i think that answer may be no so i dont know if its as reasonable to ask what theyre asking for him as they think it is
4183734 jarrod washburn who has an era of 2 65 in his last eight starts is reportedly drawing interest from the yankees cardinals white sox and possibly the brewers
4183735 the mariners are looking for some outfield help and the yankees might talk about players such as melky cabrera brett gardner or justin christian in the right deal seattle asked about austin jackson but was told no washburn does have a no trade clause that would allow him to block a trade to the yankees but theres some sense that he would waive it for a chance at a pennant race
4183736 the mets have narrowed their trade focus to acquiring a corner outfielder and one team insider expressed optimism that clevelands casey blake seattles raul ibanez or pittsburghs jason bay could be obtained next week

4183743 it is not too late to make up for lost time but we must avoid further delay a research program more generously funded than the one proposed in 2001 supported by the federal government with international cooperation will allow us to compare the efficacy costs and consequences of the various options of responding to global warming mitigation sequestration geoengineering or doing nothing so that an informed public can agree on the best courses of action
4183744 what research we do or not do in the first place
4183745 prudence demands that we consider what we might do if cuts in carbon dioxide emissions prove too little or too late to avoid unacceptable climate damage
4183746 mesoscale iron enrichment experiments 1993 2005 synthesis and future directions
4183747 computational models predict that a 10 percent decrease in stratospheric ozone could cause an additional 300 000 non melanoma and 4 500 melanoma skin cancers and between 1 6 and 1 75 million more cases of cataracts worldwide every year
4183748 the promise of geoengineering will delay the implementation of mitigation
4183749 until there is an adequate scientific basis on which to justify such activities
4183750 the mount pinatubo eruption lofted more than enough aerosols into the atmosphere to compensate for a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide yet ozone concentrations fell by only 3 percent and its believed that this small reduction was caused by chlorine from human made chlorofluorocarbons which are now banned by the montreal protocol so while the threat to the ozone layer is worth studying in greater detail its expected to diminish with time
4183751 that if geoengineering is ever implemented it must be geoengineering plus mitigation and never geoengineering instead of mitigation
4183752 the sensitivity of polar ozone depletion to proposed geoengineering schemes
4183753 we could avoid all of the potential consequences presumably adverse that we know about
4183754 mesoscale iron enrichment experiments 1993 2005 synthesis and future directions
4183755 humans adopt geoengineering as a solution to global warming with no restriction on continued carbon emissions
4183756 democracy is the worst form of government except all the others that have been tried
4183757 from public officials and first responders to the average citizen
4183758 you dont have to get an emergency management certification or a degree
4183759 you can take this single class if you like but there is an option for certification and a two year emergency management and homeland security degree this is an introductory class that deals with all types of natural as well as manmade disasters
4183760 for example if you have a devastating storm and it compromises the structural integrity of a building
4183761 you have to understand structure and stability how to respond to people as well as property
4183762 but if it affects the whole community there arent enough resources so often the average person is the first responder
4183763 were always going to have disasters so we need people who are trained other than police and fire
4183764 its not isolated to one particular area or agency it really opens doors
4183765 in any type of disaster youre going to have volunteers show up and want to help
4183766 it teaches you how to assist first responders during a disaster
4183767 we learned how to conduct light searches of buildings triage how to document that information and pass it onto other first responders
4183768 a police officer might try to start cpr to get someone breathing
4183769 but in cert you have to treat the people you can save first
4183770 we learned cribbing how to go into a building and shore up a heavy piece of rubble to get a person out from under it
4183771 the greater fear right now is missing the next big rally
4183772 inflation numbers were bad but they are probably going to get better
4183773 there has been a sufficient amount of pessimism to warrant a short term rally
4183774 money is on the side line waiting to move in
4183775 all citizens are to bear in mind that it is both their right and duty to use their free vote to promote the common good
4183776 right to health to home to work to family to culture is false and illusory if the right to life the most basic and fundamental right and the condition for all other personal rights is not defended with maximum determination
4183777 any attempts to hinder a journalist who is going about doing his job seemingly within the rules
4183778 this we hope has been addressed we dont want to see this happening again
4183779 its clear to us that the protest zones are just a cynical public relations ploy on the part of the chinese authorities
4183780 sadly i think the protest zones are just a trap at some level
4183781 one step further for china to open up and i think its a very good gesture
4183782 in accordance with the law enjoy the freedom of speech and other kinds of rights
4183783 welcome olympic games with joyfulness and construct a harmonious society
4183784 about protesting i think chinese people have experienced very little of this
4183785 i think foreigners might have more protests i think chinese people do not have the awareness yet we dont know what there is to protest about

4183788 en un gran momento en un partido clave porque abre las puertas de la segunda fase y porque adem s ha sido ante croacia
4183789 siempre que las reacciones son buenas es positivo la derrota contra lituania fue muy dolorosa pero ha sido una derrota bisagra no hay mal que por bien no venga para el equipo se produce en un momento muy importante defendimos con mucha intensidad jugamos como equipo y todos nos sentimos m s c modos van pasando los d as pasa el trabajo y el equipo va creciendo
4183790 its a huge honour for me personally long overdue recognition for motorsport generally and is a welcome reflection of the tremendous support ive received over the years from so many people
4183791 its been an extraordinary year for me in more ways than one
4183792 the racing steps foundation stepped in and saved my racing career with a fully funded drive with carlin motorsport the most successful team in f3 ive come through my third year at university successfully and now im to get a full blue
4183793 the plan now is to cap it off with the f3 championship
4183794 we judged olivers outstanding achievements on the race track to be wholly worthy of this the first ever full blue for motorsport
4183795 his commitment to his education in addition to his driving career is unusual in motor sport and sets new standards of aspiration and attainment
4183796 this will give him an unfair advantage as formula 1 starts to use hybrid and emission reducing technology
4183797 its fantastic to see everything coming together for oliver after a dire shortage of funds threatened to end his racing career prematurely
4183798 a corto plazo nuestro objetivo es lograr que ning n pa s m s entre los que no han reconocido hasta ahora la independencia unilateralmente proclamada de kosovo no lo haga mientras el tribunal est considerando el caso
4183799 cuando el tribunal adopte su opini n y nosotros creamos que la misma confirmar que la proclamaci n de la independencia fue un acto contrario al derecho internacional es que se reanuden las negociaciones sobre el estatuto de kosovo

4183801 no debemos encarar el partido como si fuese f cil debido a la goleada
4183802 con el equipo completo venci a eeuu y nueva zelanda
4183803 tiene un estilo de juego parecido al de alemania f sicamente es fuerte y tiene jugadoras altas
4183804 creo que lo m s dif cil y lo m s importante es evitar una batalla
4183805 nos gustar a mantener la posesi n y encontrar el ritmo del partido y creo que si lo conseguimos esa ser nuestra oportunidad de ganarlo
4183806 esperamos un juego muy f sico as que tendremos que olvidarnos del rival y concentrarnos en nosotras mismas
4183807 hemos crecido mucho como equipo desde nuestra primera derrota en los jjoo ante noruega
4183808 m s que mi vecino me siento como si fuera noruega
4183809 jugamos contra canad bastante a menudo y creo que sabemos m s o menos lo que esperar de ellas
4183810 cuantos m s minutos tenemos juntas en este equipo mejor equipo es
4183811 primero vamos a hacer los deberes con canada por ahora s lo disfruto del momento y pensamos en el pr ximo partido
4183812 hacer un juego f sico contra ellas y tener algunas magulladuras al final del partido
4183813 la mala conducta de un jugador debe ser considerada como un incumplimiento de contrato unilateral
4183814 me siento enormemente decepcionada quer amos ganar pero cometimos muchos errores
4183815 nuestras devoluciones no fueron buenas tenemos que controlar m s el partido ahora deberemos trabajar en eso
4183816 tuvimos muchas ca das y cometimos muchos errores si nos hubi semos equivocado menos nos habr a ido mucho mejor

4183826 you only have one chance you cant afford to make one mistake its not a nice feeling its a very very tight focus sometimes it can be very subtle its like fencing you are in an arena waiting for the moment to attack an eye movement a change of grip on the bars fingers flexing one foot being back small subtle things and you are doing it in an environment of adrenaline pumping intensity its very mental very very mental one mistake and its over you are waiting to be shot down its an awful event you could be the fastest on paper and go out in the first round i like winning but i take a lot of punishment in the process
4183827 weve built up a good squad over the last few seasons and i would like to see everyone remain here
4183828 were all experienced enough not to let that sort of thing bother us
4183829 you hear it year in year out so im not sure it bothers too many people in the squad
4183830 i havent trained in almost three weeks now so its a little bit disappointing going in to the new season

4183832 are looking forward to a convention unified behind barack obama as the partys nominee

4183835 it seemed like we needed a 12 step program to cure us of our addiction to buying beaten up stocks
4183836 we were commiserating over how badly we had done in this market and how we were all losing clients and assets over and above our losses in the market
4183837 sensible advice for most investors would be to hold low cost index funds
4183838 weve been lucky well maybe its not 100 luck maybe 95 luck
4183839 it was obvious we should not have owned homebuilders or retailers or banks and that i should have known better than to invest in such things it was also obvious that growth in china and india and other developing countries would drive oil and other commodities to record levels and that related equities were the thing to own while i am quite aware of our mistakes both of commission and omission when i ask what is obvious now there is little consensus if there is something obvious to do that will earn excess returns then we certainly want to do it

4183844 it now appears that an effort may be under way to depose georgias duly elected government russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
4183845 there can be no talks with the organizers of genocide
4183846 saakashvili was crazy enough to go in the middle of the night and bomb a city
4183847 of course saddam hussein ought to have been hanged for destroying several shiite villages and the incumbent georgian leaders who razed 10 ossetian villages at once who ran over elderly people and children with tanks who burned civilians alive in their sheds these leaders must be taken under protection
4183848 theres enough platforms that we are allowed to be on
4183849 after all the effort that we put in to get somebody a fair trial and then to say no matter what we did it didnt matter i dont see that as a positive step
4183850 i think it was generally our opinion that hamdan made some bad mistakes in his life that led him down a path that turned out to be a bad one once he was in it i dont see that it was that easy to get out
4183851 the fact that he apologized that didnt sound like al qaida to me
4183852 if the first guy is getting a 30 year sentence what do you do for a real hard core criminal
4183853 the situation has now been resolved and senior lending network is proud to have been able to provide the support necessary to keep ms curl pinkins in her family home
4183854 our philosophy is that each loan we make has a story and a family behind it
4183855 our loan officers take the time to understand the borrowers needs and build a relationship before we offer our services i truly believe that is why senior lending network is the most respected reverse mortgage provider in the nation and the one people refer to their friends and families
4183856 i am so pleased at how the whole situation finally worked out
4183857 i was holding my breath for a while now i feel as if my prayers have been answered so i can stay in my home

4183861 everybody reported increasing disability as they get older especially since were talking about people who were around 60 when they started
4183862 however we found that over time the runners group had very low levels of disability that increased very slowly the controls on the other hand had disability that increased much more quickly at the end of the study the difference between the disability levels was very dramatic
4183863 so not only were they less disabled but they lived longer as well
4183864 we statistically adjusted for many factors such as obesity and age
4183865 we also chose pretty healthy people in our control group they were not obese had normal body weight had the same education levels as the runners and didnt drink or smoke much we tried to restrict it so that the main difference between the two groups was running
4183866 adopting an exercising program even in the 50s or 60s will be beneficial down the road were just really excited that were able to show benefits of exercise not only in living longer but living healthier up into the 80s
4183867 we think its probably vigorous exercise in general that produce these results
4183868 even though we chose the groups for running and non running we dont necessarily think that there is anything specific to running that running is better than cycling or swimming or any other form of regular aerobic exercise

4183874 any homicide investigation any major investigation you rely on information you receive from either a persons of interest persons whove been charged or members of the public and were following up on the leads

4183876 for strategic reasons we we dont want to go into further information
4183877 we expect to do some further arrests further down the road they were charged with some offences but were not charged with murder that is as much as i will want to say
4183878 a significant development as far as the investigation is concerned

4183882 the ability to provide total visibility metrics and data sharing between dynatrace and the lisa soa testing framework offers the defense it community a way to ensure the highest service levels of their critical applications
4183883 the ability to cause the cause within the application being monitored and share data in the same context literally ties together the effects being viewed with the root cause as generated by the lisa testing environment
4183884 with the complexity of soa based systems our customers demand real time root cause analysis across tiers
4183885 we can have lisa model the end to end workflows drive user behaviors and provide failure reporting at the component level dynatrace integration enables users to pinpoint the root cause of problems in synthetic transactions down to the code whether java net or a hybrid of both and supply rich real time data for collection into the reporting framework

4183994 i have never believed that one should make national security policy on the basis of trust
4183995 i think you make national security policy based on interests and on realities the bush administration appears to have few options to pressure the russians gates made crystal clear that u s military intervention is not an option and that because of commitments in iraq and afghanistan as well as political sensitivities that the u s was unlikely to take part in any peacekeeping mission in the region in his first comments since the fighting started in georgia gates warned that the russias actions could endanger moscow washington relations for years to come
4183996 to punish georgia for daring to try to integrate with the west
4183997 i think that the russians further message was to all of the parts of the former soviet union as a signal about trying to integrate with the west and move outside of the long time russian sphere of influence
4183998 so i think that they had an opportunity to make some very broad points and i think they seized that opportunity

4184072 but i dont think they had come up with it yet and what bob kearns came up with whether or not it was the most revolutionary idea anyone ever had was bobs idea they were denying him his dignity
4184073 it shows that there is justice in the world that you cant steal something and get away with it
4184074 were clearly focused on moving ford forward and tomorrows innovations

4184076 i dont know if were ready to announce the mexico connection yet ill run that by dick before the meeting
4184077 well i think i could fairly volunteer would dick might say the amount of mexican uranium that we found in the damascus could take out baltimore in a blink of an eye i think thats exactly what dick would say
4184078 ok let me just make sure that my team is on the same page
4184079 ill just put it on the agenda and write up a fpo statement to send to texas for w
4184080 lets wait till we get dicks word on this i dont want another melbourne

4184082 and i have but laura called me last night shes a wreck dick worse than when she quit smoking
4184083 thats good right shes a newlywed what did you expect a stork dropping a bundle of joy off
4184084 dick we need to get her to a doctor we both know what needs to be done
4184085 the things were going to do when you get well
4184086 but i think its time to spiderhole lynne its time richard she cant go to dc this morning its time richard
4184087 dont say a word richard just nod and ill do what i have to do
4184088 what about the twin you gonna hurt the twin donald
4184089 the use of military force by the united states in this situation
4184090 if russia does not step back from its aggressive posture and actions in georgia the u s russian relationship could be adversely affected for years to come
4184091 in the days and weeks ahead the department of defense will re examine the entire gamut of our military to military activities with russia and will make changes as necessary and appropriate depending on russian actions in the days ahead
4184092 that certainly is not our desire i think frankly we have been pretty restrained in this and i would say beginning with my remarks at the vercunda conference a year ago february where now prime minister putins speech was regarded by virtually everyone there as very aggressive and we have tried not to respond in that manner
4184093 i think what happens in the days and months to come will determine the future course of u s russian relations but by the same token my personal view is that there need to be some consequences for for the actions that russia has taken against a sovereign state
4184094 anymore is an interesting add i have never believed that one should make national security policy on the basis of trust i think you make national security policy based on interests and on realities
4184095 spent 45 years working very hard to avoid a military confrontation with russia i see no reason to change that approach today
4184096 i would consider that to be bluster from the foreign minister of russia
4184097 the united states of america stands strongly as the president of france just said for the territorial integrity of georgia
4184098 the most urgent priority for the u s military at this time is to save lives and alleviate suffering
4184099 at this stage of the game it would be premature to try to go through the forensics that we have and make a determination although we are looking at it most of what we have seen and been able to monitor and verify is of a defacing of web sites not really as robust as denial of service
4184100 so i think that my guess is that everyone is going to be looking at russia through a different set of lenses as we look ahead and i think russia has some serious work to do to try to work its way back into the family of nations that
4184101 we are not getting the business to make it viable it started off with the smoking ban which is really biting now
4184102 on top of that theres higher utility bills higher petrol prices and food costs are up people just havent got the money anymore

4184106 le dije a saif de ninguna manera es muy doloroso y es suficiente que l tenga mi nombre en el antebrazo

4184108 good calories bad calories said weight loss isnt the point
4184109 these trials are fundamentally tests of the hypothesis that saturated fat is bad for cholesterol and bad for the heart mr
4184110 theyre not just about which diet works best for weight loss or is healthiest but what constitutes a healthy diet period
4184111 so heres the simple question and the point how can saturated fat be bad for us if a high saturated fat diet lowers l d l at least as well as a diet that has 20 to 25 percent less saturated fat
4184112 my real age is 16 i dont pay any attention to what everyone says

4184130 i am convinced that honoring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4184131 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect senator obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again
4184132 we see them generally complying and moving back to a position where they can make their exit
4184133 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity
4184134 it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4184135 we will support any decision made by the people of south ossetia and abkhazia
4184136 if you play him enough times hes bound to have an off day
4184137 i proved that i played with the best tonight and it couldnt have happened to me on a better stage
4184138 in a lot of the other matches it has been a point here or there
4184139 thats why he was no 1 in the world he played those points better than everyone today i played them well
4184140 if you get 35 000 people in the stands in the cfl youre making a profit
4184141 im sure toronto can handle that and two or three games from the nfl
4184142 i think it will be great entertainment for the toronto community and i think everyone wants to see the nfl play because we all watch the games on sunday
4184143 i think it will be great for the city here
4184144 i think football especially the nfl wants to become a north american market
4184145 it wont be overnight it will take five or six years but that would be a godsend it would be nice to see the most competitive league and most prosperous league competing in our city
4184146 as expected the seasonally stronger second quarter resulted in occupancy increases levering our increased rental rates and improving our operating margins
4184147 our realized same property revenue increases exemplify this effect we expect to see further improvement through the busy third quarter of the year particularly as our branding and marketing efforts start to pay off
4184148 financial markets had a positive impact on the investment portfolio overall this quarter as canadian equity markets rose 8 6 per cent on the strength of higher commodity prices and energy stocks
4184149 well above the 4 2 per cent real return required to sustain the canada pension plan at its current contribution rate
4184150 while we continued to do a good job containing our operating costs the second quarter was disappointing from a revenue perspective
4184151 due to phone model changeovers two of our larger customers reported lower royalties than in previous quarters
4184152 i would say 110 is where it might go something like that
4184153 after posting disappointing results in our second quarter we made it clear that we would take immediate action to reduce costs and simplify our business and during the third quarter thats exactly what we did
4184154 our results do not yet reflect the impact of the changes we have made however i believe that we have created a more nimble organization that will benefit our financial performance moving forward
4184155 what we see as do many around the world is a global economy that is difficult
4184156 when energy and oil prices go up on top of inflation and health care and core food items theres a great deal of pressure on the customer
4184157 while some may have been hoping for a beat and bigger raise we think wal mart is appropriately conservative in a tough environment
4184158 now that the checks are for the most part behind us some of the lift that we saw in the july period is now behind us
4184159 people are eating more sandwiches in puerto rico and relying more on private label products in the uk
4184160 gross margin expanded significantly more than we expected as improved inventory management led to reduced number of markdowns and fewer clearance sales
4184161 is it full valuation no the stock will be worth more five years from now than it is today its a nice growth company
4184162 they know the assets and they know the business really well and its opportunistic timing
4184163 this business is a free cash flow business youve got limited fixed assets very decent margins and one of the best marketing teams ever seen in any business
4184164 we have improved customer traffic and ticket and overall sales growth in our markets
4184165 while inflation and higher fuel costs are pressuring suppliers retailers and customers worldwide were confident that wal mart is well positioned for this economy
4184166 wal mart continues to execute well and deliver solid results in a challenging economic environment
4184167 the government is working to make sure that the economy recovers as soon as possible

4184179 they showed me the body they took me to the area where they found it it took a day and a half to get there

4184182 that they discovered the body of the mythical apeman in a remote forest in northern georgia
4184183 i alleged that these people the tga were motivated by a wrongful sense of vengeance
4184184 i alleged that these people knew full well the catastrophic effect their decision would have on pan its employees customers service providers shareholders and of course me and my family both financially and personally
4184185 certainly there was an enormous amount of damage done to our industry to companies to individuals and the industry is still recovering were still rebuilding confidence
4184186 im not aware of any other case in this country where the government has accepted a claim against it for abuse of public office and paid such a large amount to a private individual
4184187 what it means is the government has thrown in the towel its accepted responsibility for what happened to pan
4184188 i think its highly likely that there will be class actions by former shareholders and former businesses that relied heavily on pan pharmaceuticals
4184189 the agreed settlement amount of 50 million plus legal costs is considerably less than the 234 million claimed
4184190 that prices could continue to drift lower through 2009 and beyond
4184191 we attribute this gap between homeowners perceptions and reality to a combination of inattention and a fair bit of denial that causes people to believe their home is insulated from the woes of the market that affect others but not them

4184262 chelsea is delighted with the drcs decision to award the club 13 68 million pounds in compensation
4184263 they went to the combine and he was one of the highest recruited football players in nevada even though he didnt play football his senior year
4184264 he wanted to play basketball in college he knew he didnt want to play football he wanted to play basketball
4184265 he returned a punt and broke five six tackles and returned it for a touchdown he used track to keep in shape for basketball instead of football he was just doing that football more for fun he was in love with basketball
4184266 he was a very talented athlete nice kid like anything else
4184267 you see kids and can tell they have a lot of talent you see his desire to win thats something you cant coach
4184268 the staff and he were the best football coaches i have worked with and they really helped me to believe in myself no matter what the circumstances and showed me how to dig deep and fight on the field
4184269 if he got looks from division ii schools he would have gone
4184270 some of the best years of my life were playing in the program that coach williams coach gary lanners coach brian mello and coach don schank put together
4184271 coach williams and our relationship is to this day as strong as it was then
4184272 even though i dont get to come home to fallon as much i as would like i still make time to stop in to say hello to him and i always loved to try and catch him working out the cchs teams that came after i graduated
4184273 i did see him play a couple basketball games during high school i didnt see him long or triple jump
4184274 i saw him in a tournament somewhere around tahoe he had an incredible amount of leaping ability he had a pretty good breakaway on slam dunk that was a good indicator that he can jump it was just a matter of honing his skills and putting it all together
4184275 he is a dealer this is a young man in the business to do business
4184276 there is nothing to indicate he is a big drug dealer there is nothing to justify that
4184277 i am sorry for what i did i feel bad for what i did it was really stupid and i know that

4184303 it is now up to the cpsc to use the tools given to them by this law and restore the confidence of consumers in the products on store shelves
4184304 this is a huge victory for consumers over big business
4184305 this law puts safety first by making new and important changes like requiring that toys be tested for safety before they are sold and creating an internet database where consumers can share information about dangerous products
4184306 protecting americas littlest consumers better was always a good idea but now its the law
4184307 we look forward to working with a stronger cpsc with more tools at its disposal
4184308 we especially appreciate the visionary features of the new law such as its ban on toxic phthalate chemicals in childrens products and its creation of a revolutionary new publicly accessible database of potential hazards
4184309 for the first time it bans several chemicals from childrens toys at the same time it requires more research be conducted on those chemicals rather than allowing potentially dangerous exposures while research is underway i hope the message is clear chemical companies can not neglect their responsibility to do well designed safety research and then use the lack of evidence of risk as a justification to sell potentially dangerous products
4184310 we hope the enactment of this law marks the beginning of an era of more transparency and scientific integrity not only at the cpsc but all federal agencies
4184311 we couldnt meet our commitments you know about our supply issues

4184411 however theres zero doubt in my mind bill clinton is going to enthusiastically campaign for senator obama

4184613 der bisher angegrabene s dtrakt erinnert an r umlichkeiten die man h ufig um das forum dem hauptplatz einer r mischen stadt findet
4184614 hier geht es um einen eingriff in einen der gr ten zirbenwaldbest nde mitteleuropas der fl chenverbrauch ist in dieser lage zu gro r umig
4184615 im vergleich mit dem zirbenlift der 17 hektar wald in anspruch genommen hat ben tigen wir nur zehn hektar au erdem platzieren wir die h tten zwischen den b umen
4184616 der sogenannte projektexperte und anrainer kurt t chler sprach sich gegen das projekt aus aber nur weil er mir sein haus um 250 000 euro verkaufen wollte obwohl es nur einen wert von 90 000 euro hat ich bin darauf nicht eingegangen deswegen m chte er das projekt verhindern
4184617 ich m chte nur die natur sch tzen das hat mit immobilienwerten nichts zu tun
4184618 wir sind 23 anrainer und werden bis 8 september einspruch gegen den positiven bescheid einlegen
4184619 die gr nen stehen hinter den anrainern alles w re nie soweit gekommen wenn die landesregierung nicht das landschaftsschutzgebiet aufgel st h tte das war ein kniefall vor den projektwerbern wir werden alles tun damit dieses unzeitgem e projekt nicht kommt

4184623 towards this end we will leverage on our positioning as a major home grown one stop financial services provider that understand what our market needs and deliver world class solutions to meet these needs
4184624 the groups growth in the first half of its current financial year can be attributed to a notable increase in net interest income and islamic banking income and are further complemented with an overall reduction in finance cost
4184625 under such circumstances it is highly unlikely that airport operators like mahb malaysia airports holdings bhd will reduce fees charged to airlines that use the airport after all their bottom line is also affected
4184626 there could be a dip in the second half with jetstar pulling out and airlines making adjustments to their winter schedules but we remain confident of achieving a 5 4 per cent passenger growth this year
4184627 in its istanbul declaration in june iata had asked for a global reduction in airport fees to which the airports council international which represents the worlds commercial service airports had responded with a no and that the rates should be negotiated with the respective airports
4184628 after all airport charges constitute only four per cent of overall airline costs the bulk of the airlines cost is fuel and so they should be tackling the oil companies
4184629 we have in the pipeline a whole range of marketing activities to reach the investors
4184630 these include advertising sponsorship running road shows in selected regions and a large commitment to developing an online resource centre through a new website
4184631 in terms of geographic focus we are keen to tap into the newer emerging markets for offshore investment flows such as india china and the gulf corporation council gcc region
4184632 for instance we will be running a roadshow in india next week in hyderabad and mumbai to meet a select group of investors and intermediaries
4184633 to date many of these offshore investments have been routed through mauritius or singapore labuan has many advantages over these traditional jurisdictions but many indian businessmen are not aware of this
4184634 these results represent a satisfactory performance mainly due to our continued strong operational performance
4184635 more large organisations are looking at it information technology outsourcing they are looking at ways to be more efficient so far we havent seen any slowdown
4184636 it the bill can be reduced by rm1 5 billion as we use more organic fertilisers and biofertilisers
4184637 efficient technology in oil palm wastes treatment and incorporating the clean development mechanism into these projects will further enhance the economic returns through carbon credits earned
4184638 right now we have forwarded their views to the finance ministry but i have not received any reply from the minister
4184639 it the new approach was announced by the government two weeks ago
4184640 if our analysis is accurate we dont think it will affect any of the ipps credit ratings
4184641 of course there are pros and cons in implementing such a move we cant really say yes or no without studying it
4184642 this is especially in the current market scenario where market players have cited prevailing conditions inflationary concerns and interest rate outlook as having an impact on the bond market
4184643 malaysia is not isolated from broader global events these issues may in turn affect issuance activities as well as trading and liquidity in the ensuing months
4184644 the joint business agreement will enable the airlines to reduce costs and attract new customers helping to mitigate pressure on fares from record fuel costs
4184645 the current slowdown in the economy is different from the asian financial crisis of 1997 the group has very little unsold residential stock a healthy balance sheet and locked in profits yet to be recognised

4184658 it felt good to run and win but it really hurt

4184660 its a real good course the official and the volunteers are just great its just a real class act

4184779 growing global operations are forcing companies to more pro actively evaluate and address their supply chain risks companies are sourcing from and selling to more new regions often adding new carriers forwarders logistics and distribution partners to their network at the same time customers are continuously demanding improved service levels

4184801 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4184802 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4184803 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4184804 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4184805 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4184806 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4184807 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

4184830 paves the way for the removal of the unrepresentative board which was appointed by president thabo mbeki immediately after the anc national conference in polokwane
4184831 in the teeth of strong opposition from cosatu and a wide range of civil society organisations who condemned the new board which was dominated by business interests and did not contain any trade unionists or working journalists
4184832 the passing of the bill is a triumph for democracy
4184833 i warn you you are attacking the character of accused one najwa and that can give me the right to attack your character

4184850 chelsea is delighted with the drcs decision to award the club 13 68 million pounds in compensation
4184851 this is an important decision for football not only did the drc make us a very significant monetary award the decision also recognised the damaging effect incidents involving drugs has on football and the responsibilities we all have in this area

4184856 the ability to provide total visibility metrics and data sharing between dynatrace and the lisa soa testing framework offers the defense it community a way to ensure the highest service levels of their critical applications
4184857 the ability to cause the cause within the application being monitored and share data in the same context literally ties together the effects being viewed with the root cause as generated by the lisa testing environment
4184858 with the complexity of soa based systems our customers demand real time root cause analysis across tiers
4184859 we can have lisa model the end to end workflows drive user behaviors and provide failure reporting at the component level dynatrace integration enables users to pinpoint the root cause of problems in synthetic transactions down to the code whether java net or a hybrid of both and supply rich real time data for collection into the reporting framework

4184864 reflect on what i am saying for the lord will give you insight into all this
4184865 who endowed the heart with wisdom or gave understanding to the mind
4184866 the heart of the righteous weighs its answers but the mouth of the wicked gushes evil
4184867 but the things that come out of the mouth come from the heart and these make a man unclean
4184868 that is why i am suffering as i am yet i am not ashamed because i know whom i have believed and am convinced that he is able to guard what i have entrusted to him for that day
4184869 reflect on what i am saying for the lord will give you insight into all this
4184870 i would just say that mans part is to trust and gods part is to work
4184871 la realidad es que la gente lo pasa mal con el transantiago y si se sigue metiendo plata a un sistema fracasado lo nico que va a hacer es prolongar esa agon a

4184876 patriotism is the willingness to kill and be killed for trivial reasons
4184877 ive taken lots of friends to nudist beaches both men and women
4184878 some of them walked away thinking it was great some walked away thinking it was boring but they all walked away thinking most people look somewhat like me
4184879 there are very few model perfect people out there at a nude beach you get a more realistic perception of what humanity really looks like
4184880 for girls especially there is so much pressure in our society to be a perfect size as a result there is a whole generation of people killing themselves to meet a standard that is impossible part of living a naturist lifestyle is accepting your body and regaining a normal body image
4184881 people will hide and mask themselves in a number of ways to look prettier tougher or to establish their social rank
4184882 but if you are buck naked chatting with someone youll be chatting with the real person when you get past the fear factor and the initial embarrassment you realize it allows for a more authentic human interaction
4184883 nudity is a taboo in america because we primarily equate nudity or nakedness with sexuality and we have taboos about sexuality
4184884 a lot of it has to do i think with the puritan and victorian heritage that we have which says that any kind of temptation will lead you into hell
4184885 at nude beaches we swim we play volleyball we lay in the sun we do the same things everyone else does at the beach we just prefer to do it without clothing
4184886 americans are still severely bothered by nakedness see a bit of janet jacksons breast on national television and its a fiasco but all of the violence on accepted to me its bizarre
4184887 no true conservative would suggest compromising civil liberties so its not a conservative versus liberal issue naturists span the entire political spectrum
4184888 its been very trendy lately to try to put skinny dipping on the list of sex offenses for which you have to register with the state its already passed in 13 states
4184889 thats ridiculous go to any nude beach and you will understand that in ten minutes but people confuse nudity and sex all the time they dont bother to distinguish between the two and thats the root of a lot of our problems
4184890 it causes you to sit up and say my gosh who thinks these kinds of prison sentences make sense
4184891 this is unbelievable its not very often you get to say you beat the no 1 player in the world anytime but to do it at the olympics with usa on your chest im so proud to be a part of that
4184892 i dont think you could see this result in another country
4184893 maybe if you play him enough times hes bound to have an off day
4184894 i would have to look at the facts and details to see if it was a knowing omission
4184895 any payment for services or anything provided free to an officeholder should be reported if its over 75
4184896 he was only to be paid fees if the court awarded them to him expenses were not included and will be paid if and when he bills us because we had a contract negotiated at arms length that did not require the payment of fees by me or the committee it was not a gift and therefore not disclosed
4184897 but for sisters dont they look rather different from each other
4184898 we have a gapers delay on the edens from skokie rd down to the junction with reports of guys cheering on lesbians who are making out
4184899 i dont know what its called but i know the sound that it makes when it takes a mans life
4184900 they send us in there then they wont let us take the gloves off the other dude he got his gloves off day one if you wanna win the damn thing you got to fight same way they fight
4184901 nibbling gently at the soft manicured hands that feed him
4184902 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint

4184912 some of the same psychological stresses as their comrades on the battlefield
4184913 it is difficult for people to exchange euro coins for paper money
4184914 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue

4184919 so it is ridiculous to allege that the land was bought by money given by rabri devi
4184920 but suddenly he got enough money in 2004 to buy the land plots and gift them to his daughter in 2006
4184921 what impressed us from their presentations was the consistency of the culture of the gensler organization

4184930 wir sind uns dar ber im klaren dass das regime saakaschwili in georgiens genau so wie das ukrainische und einige andere regimes direkt von den amerikanern aufgep ppelt wurden das sind deren politische projekte
4184931 dabei gehe ich von der logik politischer gesetze aus die genauso wie physikalische gesetze immer funktionieren in dieser hinsicht ist die situation jetzt vor allem in der ukraine herangereift f r einen schlag gegen russland was pr sident viktor juschtschenko dabei zum anlass nutzt ist eher eine taktische frage die ich im moment nicht beantworten kann
4184932 wir russland und eu m ssen jetzt verstehen dass die sicherheit in europa in unserem gemeinsamen interesse liegt w hrend des kalten krieges hatte amerika geholfen das problem des kommunismus zu l sen aber jetzt artet amerika selbst zu einem problem aus sie amerikaner wollen den frieden auf unserem kontinent ruinieren

4184938 dont count on doing anything in any place that you dont expect to be seen
4184939 i may meet this guy and he may not be someone i could ever feel romantic towards but either way i think i could definitely be friends with him
4184940 well if he doesnt show up hes an idiot and youre welcome to go do something with my room mate and me
4184941 other educational systems teach you to take tests the american system teaches you to think
4184942 i dont need to test i go with my gut
4184943 i go with my gut too i just test it along with whatever else makes sense
4184944 you need to look at that we need to pull out all stops
4184945 where you have defined and discrete irrigation communities the commonwealth is prepared to step in and buy back the entitlements from that entire community
4184946 prime minister rudd must recognise that irrigators are not only a part of their surrounding community but are the driving economic force in the community
4184947 social and economic impact studies must be completed before any town and community is effectively shut down
4184948 stagflation became a term the late 1970s and early 1980s mortgage rates were in the teens back then but i doubt they will get that high this time but i wouldnt expect them to be coming back down anytime soon either

4184994 cuando asumimos la conducci n del comit departamental en diciembre saludamos a los triunfadores en las elecciones y les deseamos xitos en el gobierno desde el comienzo de nuestra gesti n afirm bamos en un documento que hab amos optado por la individualidad partidaria por sobre la integraci n de frentes raz n por la cual concurrimos al comicio con candidatos propios en la boleta 3 de la uni n c vica radical en consecuencia no forma parte de la administraci n municipal de santa fe aclarado esto y desde el lugar que nos toca ocupar nos esforzamos hoy por encontrar respuestas y propuestas frente a un debate que se ha instalado en la sociedad el exorbitante aumento de la tasa general de inmuebles preocupa a la gran mayor a de los santafesinos en general y a este comit radical en particular
4184995 sabemos que el pago de la tasa es la retribuci n por la prestaci n de un servicio y que el aumento de costos amerita una actualizaci n que en un esquema de equidad se deber a haber hecho de forma escalonada y progresiva sin embargo se opt por el tarifazo en el mismo momento que los argentinos est bamos preocupados y atentos al conflicto entre el sector agropecuario y el gobierno nacional por otro lado advertimos que los porcentajes de aumento superan ostensiblemente el crecimiento de los salarios de los trabajadores repercutiendo negativamente en el presupuesto de los santafesinos abriendo de esta manera la puerta para un eventual conflicto de naturaleza social
4184996 que conforman uno de los grupos m s vulnerables cuya disciplina para el pago de los tributos es hist ricamente conocida los montos de aumento deterioran su an mico presupuesto y los requisitos para la dispensa del pago son tan engorrosos y poco conocidos que tornan m nimos los pedidos de exenci n
4184997 mayoritariamente locatario y como tal responsable del pago de la tasa general de inmuebles seguramente trasladar el porcentaje de aumentos sobre el precio de los productos y servicios generando de esta manera mayor presi n en los ingresos de la poblaci n
4184998 en un esquema en donde los funcionarios provinciales manifiestan que los impuestos el agua el gas y la luz que todav a no aumentaron van a aumentar y en donde el ciudadano com n parece ser el nico que no puede decidir aumentar sus ingresos nuestra fundada preocupaci n no se agota en lo antedicho la ordenanza 11 498 votada recientemente por el concejo vincula el aval o municipal con el que asigne la provincia y seg n manifestaciones de autoridades del rea econ mica del gobierno provincial la provincia va a revaluar por lo tanto podemos llegar a tener dos aumentos casi consecutivos
4184999 la misma ordenanza dice que el aumento emergente del reval o provincial no se aplicar hasta tanto el concejo fije la nueva al cuota para lo cual dispone de sesenta d as en el mismo sentido nos preguntamos qu pasar si el rgano deliberativo municipal no se expide en el plazo fijado si bien es cierto que el intendente municipal por el decreto 651 08 suspende el pago por seis meses de la diferencia que supere el 200 de aumento leg timamente cabe preguntarnos si despu s de pasados los seis meses los santafesinos que superan ese porcentaje no tendr n que pagar la tasa completa

4185138 its not what the numbers say but rather what they mean
4185139 its probably under the never take anything for granted philosophy to which i certainly subscribe
4185140 i think its great that theyre doing that its brand reinforcement maybe its trying to attract a more vast audience a younger audience but a constant reminder of their presence in the marketplace is a good thing even as big as they are

4185147 we the participants of the women world championship 2008 express our worry about the current dangerous situation near cabardino balkaria we think when there is such a tense situation it is not expedient to hold such a high level tournament in that area thats why we kindly ask you to move this tournament to the safer place which would be convenient for all the participants
4185148 in the current situation i appeal to all not to mix politics and sport and n ot to involve fide and the world chess community into political territorial and other disputes
4185149 for some time relative calm was maintained in south ossetia
4185150 the war games included a us navy supercarrier battle group an us navy expeditionary carrier battle group a royal navy carrier battle group a french nuclear hunter killer submarine plus a large number of us navy cruisers destroyers and frigates playing the
4185151 a strategic diversion has been created for russia the south ossetia capital has been shelled and a large georgian tank force has been heading towards the border american marines a thousand of them have recently been in georgia training the georgian military forces russia has stated that it will not sit by and allow the georgians to attack south ossetia this could get bad and remember it is just a strategic diversion but one that could have horrific effects
4185152 cases of possible threats by russia directed at georgia with the intention of taking control over the baku ceyhan pipeline
4185153 russia actively tends to isolate the central asian region from direct access to world economy especially to energy supplies if georgia government is destabilized western access to baku caspian sea and further will be limited
4185154 ever since the continents started interacting politically some five hundred years ago eurasia has been the center of world power the key to controlling eurasia says brzezinski is controlling the central asian republics
4185155 brzezinski russias invasion of georgia is reminiscent of stalins attack on finland
4185156 the russians deliberately provoked the fighting in south ossetia and timed it for the olympics this is a long standing russian effort to get rid of president saakashvili
4185157 and i want to stress im not a warmonger and i dont want a new cold war any more than dimitri does the russians wish to re establish a historic area of hegemony that includes ukraine and it is no accident that the other former soviet republics are watching this and extraordinarily upset as putin progresses with an attempt to re create a kind of a hegemonic space
4185158 the unipolar world refers to a world in which there is one master one sovereign one center of authority one center of force one center of decision making at the end of the day this is pernicious not only for all those within this system but also for the sovereign itself because it destroys itself from within what is even more important is that the model itself is flawed because at its basis there is and can be no moral foundations for modern civilization
4185159 unilateral and frequently illegitimate actions have not resolved any problems moreover they have caused new human tragedies and created new centers of tension judge for yourselves wars as well as local and regional conflicts have not diminished more are dying than before significantly more significantly more today we are witnessing an almost uncontained hyper use of force military force in international relations force that is plunging the world into an abyss of permanent conflicts we are seeing a greater and greater disdain for the basic principles of international law and independent legal norms are as a matter of fact coming increasingly closer to one states legal system one state and of course first and foremost the united states has overstepped its national borders in every way this is visible in the economic political cultural and educational policies it imposes on other nations well who likes this who is happy about this in international relations we increasingly see the desire to resolve a given question according to so called issues of political expediency based on the current political climate and of course this is extremely dangerous it results in the fact that no one feels safe i want to emphasize this no one feels safe because no one can feel that international law is like a stone wall that will protect them of course such a policy stimulates an arms race i am convinced that we have reached that decisive moment when we must seriously think about the architecture of global security
4185160 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
4185161 the position of the russia side is not proceed beyond the peacekeeping zone but we have to respond to provocations
4185162 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4185163 we dont want them here what we need is friendship and good relations with the russian people
4185164 we let her stay here and now shes blaming everything on us
4185165 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
4185166 it is not easy to turn around the existing forces by 180 degrees
4185167 de facto territorial integrity of georgia is limited because of the conflict
4185168 this problem can be solved only through the search for mutual solutions
4185169 the fact that the biggest number of bombs fell on purely economic and civilian targets clearly indicated that was a premeditated thing and it had nothing to do only with abkhazia or south ossetia
4185170 why would one attack them unless there is some other purpose
4185171 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
4185172 the message is that russia has perhaps not accepted that it is time to move on from the cold war and it is time to move to a new era in which relations between states are on the basis of equality and sovereignty and economic integration
4185173 we will use u s aircraft as well as naval forces
4185174 rally the free world in the defense of a free georgia
4185175 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia and insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
4185176 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4185177 i have to say that the reports are not encouraging about russias respect for this cease fire
4185178 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
4185179 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
4185180 either support for a virtual project or real partnership with russia on issues that demand collective action
4185181 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
4185182 blind knowledge is working at useless ground and crazy faith is living the dream of its liturgy a new god is a word or the mere sound dont seek and dont trust for all is mystery
4185183 its called the american dream because you have to be asleep to beleive it
4185184 in the days ahead we will use us aircraft as well as naval forces to deliver humanitarian and medical supplies
4185185 to let in all forms of humanitarian assistance we expect russia to ensure that all lines of communications and transport including seaports airports roads and airspace remain open for the delivery of humanitarian assistance and for civilian transit
4185186 you have heard the statement by the us president that the united states is starting a military humanitarian operation in georgia
4185187 it means that georgian ports and airports will be taken under the control of the us defense ministry
4185188 continue our efforts to rally the free world in defense of a free georgia
4185189 reshaping us policy toward russia will take longer than the months between now and january 20 when a new president takes office but mr bush can at least atone for his earlier misjudgments about mr putin and steer policy in a new direction that his successor would have to deal with
4185190 looting burning villages and killings of civilians that are in areas under russian control
4185191 this causes great concern as it is not clear whose orders the russian troops are executing and why russia does not honour the declared ceasefire
4185192 a vast mission of peacekeepers observers and other monitors who will record the illegal actions by russian troops
4185193 georgias territorial integrity and the withdrawal of the occupation army must be the main objectives to be pursued by the international community after military actions are discontinued
4185194 serious mistakes can be made that have to be paid for a long time afterwards
4185195 in a major escalation of the conflict with russia over georgia president george w
4185196 as to choosing the united states has made very clear that it is standing by the democratically elected government of georgia
4185197 and we are aware that the u s is uptight about this project
4185198 but a choice will have to be made someday between considerations of prestige related to an illusory project and a real partnership in matters which indeed require collective efforts
4185199 lets be very clear whose interests are being served by the partnership that russia and the united states have engaged in on iran or north korea
4185200 america is losing the whole region and this is the region of eastern and central europe
4185201 this is much bigger than any other place where there is american influence and this is the most natural allies of america
4185202 there will be no compromise at the expense of our territorial integrity
4185203 i never accused the united states in the first place of anything
4185204 i just said that the russians mistook some of the statements at certain levels
4185205 i dont think you can have any doubt but that the united states has from the very beginning believed that the south ossetian situation needed to be resolved and resolved peacefully as weve been working for months and months and months to do but that russia seriously overreached that russia engaged in activities that could not possibly be associated simply with the crisis in south ossetia
4185206 we expect russia to meet its commitment to cease all military activities in georgia and we expect all russian forces that entered georgia in recent days to withdraw from that country
4185207 if i were a neighbor of russia and i saw what russia had done in georgia i would be very nervous
4185208 i think those countries that are leaning toward the west are very nervous today
4185209 i am convinced that honoring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4185210 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect senator obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again
4185211 ive said all along this has got to be resolved
4185212 this has been very very difficult for the city for the state and thats obviously why we need a resolution
4185213 the wayne county prosecutors office will be taking an emergency appeal to the state court of appeals regarding these recent orders
4185214 a new blog doesnt have to be ground breaking or political or showbiz to be influential sometimes the blogger behind it just needs to be a good person for he himself to become a positive influence to the bloggers he meets and the readers he writes for well fritz tentativa is certainly the nicest and friendliest new blogger ive ever had the pleasure of meeting so my last slot goes to him
4185215 this blog demonstrates how personal experiences can be relate able and interesting even to people who do not know the blogger this blog excels in turning seemingly insignificant events and thoughts into interesting thought provoking and entertaining reads

4185220 fritzified is always a fun read and is of course updated and maintained by the one and only fritz tentativa if you havent experienced his wit and photography skillz then youre in for a treat
4185221 fritz tentativa has a way with words and pictures with his biting wit and massive rockstar potential whatever that means he turns every blog post into something someone with a biting wit and a massive rockstar potential would write armed with his nokia n82 he snaps away turning each moment into a photo you wouldnt believe was taken with a camera phone i guess thats why hes a diva
4185222 ive decided to nominate fritzified com a wholesome combination of lifestyle food gadgetry even fashion but written from an intelligent point of view and not just flashy superficiality

4185232 i can do you while you write a reply describing what im doing to you
4185233 my boyfriend is playing with my breasts as i write this to you
4185234 oh yes just like that give it to me harder oh yes just like that oh yes yes im cumming im cumming
4185235 doing lunch and picking up father in law from senior center
4185236 forty next birthday divorced for the second time and havent been laid in almost three years
4185237 ouch is right sheesh jules i get so horny sometimes i could well i dont know what youre all right you have bob and i just need to see the two of you together to know that the last time you got laid was probably last night
4185238 yes you are and if i didnt like you and bob so much i could be jealous as it is im just happy for you
4185239 friends i have friends jules good ones like you and bob so one of the first two and in the short term probably the second a lover
4185240 jules youve got your scheming look on again what are you planning
4185241 not sure to be honest just a wild thought that crossed my mind
4185242 old enough to maintain an erection long enough to make me climax
4185243 legally old enough too eighteen or older and preferably not too much older than me maybe fifty tops why do you ask
4185244 remember last year the beach you bob and me jamie and helen
4185245 jamie had his new digital camera with him remember and he took loads of photos including one or two of you in that blue and white bikini
4185246 the one i wore once two sizes too small that one
4185247 yes because thats why hes studying computer science at college
4185248 true but i was thinking more of what he learned before he went
4185249 yesterday while he and helen were out with their dad i was tidying some stuff away in his room and dislodged some of his college papers he had on his bedside table when i picked them up there were two photographs both of you
4185250 of me whatever would jamie want photos of me for
4185251 of course i do hes a sweetie always polite good looking intelligent and he always pretends hes pleased to see me
4185252 because he is silly anyway back to the photographs i want your promise on oath that you will never reveal this conversation to anyone without my express permission especially not to jamie
4185253 the photographs one was of you in the bikini three quarter front shot full length smiling at the camera ill tell you elaine you looked hot
4185254 didnt show anyway that was one of the shots the other was a little different
4185255 no i never have why do you ask oh the other photograph
4185256 yes the other photograph digital manipulation i think but it was the same shot except that you were totally nude
4185257 put them back where i found them and said nothing to jamie
4185258 i think he keeps them there as stimulus when he jacks off i know he does jack off because there are some things you cant hide from a woman who does your laundry
4185259 youre telling me your son keeps a nude picture of me beside his bed as masturbatory stimulus
4185260 im definitely flattered god that thought makes me feel good
4185261 i like jamie as you well know and yes im truly flattered of course i dont know if its me he sees in his minds eye when he comes
4185262 why are you telling me this jules if youd said nothing i wouldnt have had to swear secrecy
4185263 yes i am of course its up to you how you manage it but i wanted you to know that if you do im okay with it i wont freak out because my best friend has seduced my son
4185264 elaine honey jamie is the only male i know that i would trust not to hurt you except bob and sorry hon youre not getting him
4185265 will you release me from that promise will you tell jamie that you found the photographs and that you told me and will you ask him to come to my place at ten tomorrow morning with his camera and ask him to bring the photo the nude photo too will you
4185266 if he wants a nude picture of me i think he should have to take it not fake it
4185267 youre released from that promise and yes ill tell him promise me you wont hurt him
4185268 julie love i swear i may exhaust him but i wont hurt him
4185269 youve made my tits too big you know and my areolae are different too what did you do look for a nude image in the same approximate pose and morph the two together
4185270 yes i did i had to do a lot of work on skin tones too
4185271 jamie relax hon um may i be blunt ask a couple of very personal questions
4185272 you use the picture as stimulus when you jack off right
4185273 who do you see in your imagination who is the woman youre fucking
4185274 yes you if id wanted an actress or a model or a porn star someone like that there are millions of pictures on the net i could use
4185275 i wanted to imagine someone real someone i knew and youre the most beautiful woman i know and i had the photo of you in the bikini to work from
4185276 um no theres a girl in college we get together neither of us is looking for anything permanent and were good together its fun
4185277 yes you did jamie i think that if youre going to use a picture of me to jack off then you should have the real thing to work with dont you
4185278 i suspect youve wondered why i asked you to bring the camera right well im not usually wearing a robe at ten in the morning jamie under this robe im naked naked so that you can take a photograph of the real me not the imagined me
4185279 my ex was a keen photographer and he built a studio up in the roof space of course what i didnt know then was that he was photographing his bimbos up there so why dont you and me take us a walk upstairs and you can see the real me okay
4185280 no jamie im not joshing you in the studio i will take off this robe and ill be naked so that you can take some photos would you like that
4185281 ill take that as a yes come on before i lose my nerve
4185282 you might need to experiment with the lighting ever used a studio before
4185283 first time for everything talking of firsts theres something id like you to do for me after we finish here
4185284 i dont think youd ask anything you thought i couldnt do so what is it
4185285 jamie honey i never joke about something as important as sex
4185286 jamie you might be more comfortable naked too let me see what im getting for my reward dont worry i locked the door and switched on the answering machine
4185287 go on be a devil give a new meaning to nude photography
4185288 its my name honey and im no blood relation in fact if youre going to be my lover i insist
4185289 elaine can you show me some of these lighting controls these mothers are more involved than anything ive used before
4185290 sure i dont think youll need more than a couple plus reflector maybe hair light maybe your cameras digital isnt it
4185291 take half a dozen test shots well copy them to the pc work out what works what doesnt okay
4185292 sounds like a plan can we start with some standing shots dark background low key then maybe some sitting maybe kneeling then id like to bring the couch into shot take some reclining
4185293 okay elaine would you care to stand over there and lets see what we can come up with
4185294 better than my manipulated picture thats for sure um how many can i print
4185295 pick your six favorites ill burn them all to a cd for you anyway but your eyes only okay although your mom might like to see them
4185296 she found the first one remember and didnt go screaming to rip you a new one instead she put them back and told me in confidence it was me asked her to tell you ask you to come over here
4185297 enough about photography for the moment we can always come back up here but for the moment dont we have something else to do
4185298 elaine ive known you all of my life with you being my moms best friend and all and i dont think you ever lied to me
4185299 and if i let you put that monster into my pussy how long do you think youll manage to last
4185300 hey good answer you said youve fucked before jamie the girl in college
4185301 um yeah not often only a couple or three times
4185302 okay how about this for an agenda item one i blow you okay
4185303 well yeah but ive never done it before so youll have to show me what to do
4185304 not a problem item three i reckon that by the time youve finished eating me youll be hard again
4185305 okay item three we fuck after that well we play maybe we take some more photos maybe we fuck again
4185306 okay then jamie on the bed on your back and let me at him
4185307 thats it yeah okay they were good very good i mean when a girl gets a guy off using her mouth it has to be good yes well it was but not like that you are sensational elaine utterly sensational and sometime maybe in a year or so when ive recovered id like really really like to have you do it again
4185308 its a promise honey because i enjoyed it too you taste good
4185309 can we sort of rest a while a hug maybe until i get my breath back before i eat you
4185310 i hope you mean in the sexy neighbor who is planning on having mind blowing sex with you soon way when you say that
4185311 yes of course and also in the wonderful woman who is my semi secret lover way
4185312 honey it was for purely selfish motives believe me the word is that young men should have older lovers in their early days as a man peaks at eighteen or nineteen and a woman in her thirties okay im stretching a point for me but youre right there on the button
4185313 i think flat on my back with my legs apart so you can kneel between them is probably best
4185314 youre reading and the kids jump up and they say i saw a rat i saw a rat and then one jumps up another is on the table the girls are screaming the boys are running because they want to see it is a big scene a big show
4185315 i was not going to do that to other parents
4185316 i was not going to take their kids and get them at the sink with me and open up the cabinets and pull down all of those things that have rat droppings and rat urine on them and have them wash the stuff and breathe this in
4185317 how dare they ask me to go back into that classroom and teach a class how dare them
4185318 sono stanco ieri faceva caldo ma va molto meglio rispetto allanno scorso
4185319 stiamo facendo una buona preparazione ci saranno altre due amichevoli e credo che per la prima giornata con linter sar pronto
4185320 sono rimasto qui perch ho trovato quello che in dieci anni non avevo mai trovato qui mi vogliono tutti bene e questa la cosa pi importante per me le sirene di mercato non le sento perch alla fine conta solo la volont del giocatore e io voglio restare qui per molto tempo
4185321 oggi non si pu dire qui mancini ha fatto tanto magari fra 6 7 anni potrei avvicinarmi a quello che ha fatto lui
4185322 un peccato che sia stato mandato via in tre anni ha vinto molti trofei e allinter non accadeva da anni stato massacrato dalla stampa e in societ non stato tutelato da parecchi
4185323 nei prossimi tre quattro anni far vincere tutto ha due coglioni come una casa se dice che vincer dovete credergli
4185324 ha un grande gruppo ma non credo possa vincere la champions se dovesse arrivare ai quarti o agli ottavi avrebbe gi fatto molto una vittoria finale assomiglierebbe a un miracolo
4185325 questa squadra mi piace possiamo lottare per la coppa uefa e il mio sogno che tra 2 3 anni possiamo lottare per la champions se dovessi arrivarci per me sarebbe come vincere un mondiale
4185326 lippi sa quello che posso dare ha sempre avuto buone parole per me non ho dovuto dimostrare nulla nellamichevole di carrara conosce bene le mie capacit
4185327 un grande uomo e un grande allenatore sono certo che far tanta strada perch coerente ha pagato anche per altri
4185328 ma figuriamoci scherza il giocatore direi a tutti di andare in avanti e prenderemmo dieci gol
4185329 i have been living here for the past year its a very safe and secure place it is impossible for anyone to enter any building before being questioned by security i believe that the singers killer either went up with her or she asked security to let him in
4185330 is an important egyptian figure implicated in the murder of a lebanese singer
4185331 banning the publication of information and facts means that everyone is free to interpret things the way they like
4185332 because it conceals the truth and allows for violations whereas disclosure would stop rumors speculations and lies in their tracks
4185333 there are many murder cases are in progress in egypt today why havent they banned reporting on them too why does suzanne tamims case get special treatment
4185334 never sit with your back against the wall next time
4185335 inspired generations of young people around the world to pursue freedom in their own countries
4185336 as freedom faces challenges in many parts of the world his gandhis example is even more relevant this enduring legacy is one of the great gifts of indias revolution
4185337 both countries india and america are working to protect their people and values of 21st century threats while at the same time respecting the rule of law and cultural pluralism
4185338 indian americans have been strong contributors to the local communities they have settled in and around the country

4185558 whilst the cps treats all incidents which take place in a domestic context seriously it is important that the views of complainants are also taken into account when making decisions in such cases
4185559 taking all the factors into consideration the decision has been taken that there is insufficient evidence to afford a realistic prospect of conviction and accordingly the police have been advised that no further action should be taken against mr bale

4185595 i think they had a leg to stand on in a certain way
4185596 i think they thought we would have come up with this anyway based on the amount of time and energy and research and people we had on it
4185597 but i dont think they had come up with it yet and what bob kearns came up with whether or not it was the most revolutionary idea anyone ever had was bobs idea they were denying him his dignity
4185598 it shows that there is justice in the world that you cant steal something and get away with it

4185636 jim steacy a young hammer thrower from lethbridge alta will head to beijing to compete in a sport dominated by europeans he will be the first canadian to compete in the hammer throw since 1924 when john murdoch finished eighth while the beijing olympics will be steacys first olympic appearance it is his 11th turn on the national team although he hasnt received much media attention in canada yet that could change at the games his track record is already impressive he has won the senior mens hammer throw title for five consecutive years at the canadian track and field championships including his junior wins he has seven consecutive titles steacy has also been successful on the international stage he won the 2007 pan american games in rio de janeiro and finished second at the 2006 commonwealth games in melbourne in may he smashed the canadian record by throwing a distance of 79 13 m that was well over the athletics canada a qualifying standard of 78 50 m it also comes very close to the benchmark of 80 m that hammer throwers try to achieve comparative to the four minute mile for middle distance runners steacy picked up hammer throw in 1999 only nine years ago its a relatively short amount of time for the sport in which most athletes start in their early teens it means the 24 year old will be matched up against men who have been throwing for 15 or 20 years knowing the competition he will face steacys olympic goals are long term he is hoping to make it to the finals in beijing and will be striving for a podium finish at the 2012 games in london those are goals he is quite capable of achieving in the last year steacys average throw was 76 50m if he throws that distance during competition he will be in a good position to reach the olympic finals his average for this year was also a two metre improvement over the previous year if he continues to make gains like that steacy will be a strong contender for the 2012 games along with being a top performing athlete steacy also attends the university of lethbridge where he is studying kinesiology and psychology

4185666 and when you look at the internet business whats dangerous about it is that people who are clearly unqualified get to disseminate their piece to the masses
4185667 therefore theres a total disregard a level of wrecklessness that ends up being a domino effect and the people who suffer are the common viewers out there and more importantly those in the industry who havent been fortunate to get a radio or television deal and only rely on the written word and now theyve been sabotaged not because of me or like me but because of the industry or the world has allowed the average joe to resemble a professional without any credentials whatsoever

4185680 en su momento el requisito de planta fue un incentivo para que las compa as farmac uticas invirtieran en m xico estaban protegidas y nadie m s pod a competir pero eso ten a que terminar tarde o temprano
4185681 el derecho de planta correspondi a una etapa pero con la globalizaci n y la creciente apertura de mercados ten a que terminar ahora el reto es que la autoridad pueda hacer frente al control sanitario de las importaciones
4185682 la importaci n indiscriminada de medicamentos de cualquier parte del mundo
4185683 recibe sueldos y prestaciones muy por encima de lo est ndares nacionales
4185684 a diferencia de algunos colegas de la industria nosotros creemos que las firmas farmac uticas que operan en m xico est n en capacidad de competir y hasta exportar y que la apertura debe verse como una nueva oportunidad
4185685 medida pone en riesgo la seguridad sanitaria sin tener ninguna evidencia de que va a tener el resultado que pretenden
4185686 no hay evidencia en alguna que demuestre que esto va a bajar los precios
4185687 hasta hace unos a os predominaban las interferencias graves como la persecuci n la censura directa o el asesinato de periodistas ahora esas formas est n en retirada afortunadamente y afloran otras menos ostensibles pero igualmente da inas

4185689 no podemos decir que el criterio fue tomar los casos peores de ninguna manera
4185690 muchos gobiernos de la regi n utilizan sistem ticamente contratos publicitarios para recompensar o castigar a medios por sus contenidos
4185691 no hay normas que proh ban espec ficamente la discriminaci n
4185692 aqu el gobierno pretende darte un contrato de publicidad para callarte la boca
4185693 el gobierno nacional suele hacer pagos generosos en concepto de publicidad a periodistas de medios gr ficos nacionales influyentes que tienen programas de radio o televisi n por cable con bajos niveles de audiencia
4185694 el gobierno nacional abusa sistem ticamente de sus facultades en materia de publicidad oficial y asignaci n excesiva de pauta a medios afines
4185695 autocensura que inhibe a redacciones enteras y es capaz de acallar hasta a los periodistas m s valientes
4185696 aqu aparte de venir a competir se viene a tener sexo
4185697 algunos ya llegan con pareja otros la consiguen incluso se llevan a cabo fiestas despu s de que los atletas terminan sus competencias y ah es donde se dan los encuentros
4185698 sabemos que debemos tener cuidado porque en estos tiempos est dif cil es una persona que ves una vez y luego ya no sabes m s
4185699 no nos dieron pl ticas ni condones ni nada est bien ya estamos grandes y sabemos pero debieron darnos condones dan cuando no hay competencia ahora que es la competencia m s grande y se junta tanta gente deber an habernos dado

4185709 wow that person has spent most of their life and countless amounts of money honing a completely worthless skill

4185712 wow that person has spent most of their life and countless amounts of money honing a completely worthless skill
4185713 hes doing a great job its unbelievable hey im in great company i mean im standing next to somebody that broke my record that took 36 years to do and they say that somebodys character is judged by the company they keep so im in great company what the heck what do you think
4185714 somebody once said greatness is a matter of measure which others judge themselves by
4185715 and the amazing thing is that he almost accomplished that four years ago in athens but because of one relay that he was on that didnt get the gold medal that basically prevented him from getting seven gold medals so hes now increased the possibility of getting eight gold medals and hes increased the chances because hes a world recordholder in an event that he wasnt previously
4185716 theres this common thread of people that have become really excellent in sport that is we knew how to beat our competitors we knew everything about them and we knew everything to make ourselves the best at what we did so in theory then if i competed against somebody like michael id actually have his number tagged and hed have mine so wed have to tie
4185717 and hes the greatest swimmer in the world probably the greatest athlete in the world right now that hes proving that hes won more gold medals than anybody more gold medals in olympic games and so its just fantastic to watch this great human being do something thats now going to be never done before

4185741 sugar honey and high fructose corn syrup sweeteners are all considered natural food ingredients under the u
4185742 the fdas definition of anything isnt very credible due to political pressure among other reasons
4185743 research on high fructose corn syrup and sugar show that both sweeteners have a similar impact on satiety or feelings of fullness
4185744 the human body digests sugar honey high fructose corn syrup and fruit juice concentrates similarly by breaking them into glucose and fructose which are absorbed into the bloodstream where they are transported to the cells of the body and converted into energy
4185745 high fructose corn syrup accounts for roughly 42 percent of all nutritive sweeteners consumed in the u s compared to sugar which accounts for 45 percent of all nutritive sweeteners consumed

4185752 were facing a phenomenon of a favorite son democrat running for president and we cant control that
4185753 that is what it is and were going to have to confront that and its not going to be easy
4185754 some of the republcians have been put into a position to where they feel theyve got nothing else to do but trust

4185757 the price of crab dropped friday by 11 cents to land at 1 50 per pound although prices are still about the same as last year operating costs are significantly higher largely because of skyrocketing fuel expenses

4185771 in trying to get an rfid program off the ground youre working with an emerging technology so you want to go in step wise fashion with buy ins from many cross functional project teams in your company
4185772 the case for rfid is it an authentication solution or a track and trace tool
4185773 the problem of counterfeiting has gotten so out of hand that china executed the head of its fda
4185774 from our manufacturers perspective public health is the issue patient safety and brand integrity so we use packaging and rfid as a way to address the problem through serialization and track and trace technology
4185775 the point i want to make is when a person takes a pill in the safety of his or her home is he or she really assured that the drug is authentic i think the answer is no
4185776 if youre an adr you can say you bought drugs directly from the manufacturer and start a new paper pedigree the prescription drug marketing act of 1988 has a loophole big enough to drive a truck through
4185777 so far so good gen 2 technology means the process for making the tags has been simplified and made more robust we no longer have the availability and lead time problems we had with the first round of rfid technology
4185778 we see a good degree of interoperability between the readers and tags based on the uhf gen 2 standard what you need to build a critical mass solution is a standards based system
4185779 were not quite there yet at the item level were single sourcing our tags so theres a little vulnerability there for us now but i expect well be moving to a backup tag supply soon
4185780 can we sustain packaging and distribution center cycle times we experienced some degredation early on which was centered mostly around rework but its vastly improved after the first couple of months following some tweaking its no longer a capacity restraint for us were running where we need to be in our distribution center and on our packaging line
4185781 we are now trying to build our pedigree platform on top of the serialization data carrier concept we have in place we have a way to extract data and send it to our downstream channel partners in an interoperable fashion thats where were going
4185782 we manufacture a product and put an electronic code on it that serves as a unique indentifier we ship it to the wholesaler after we send them an advance shipping notice there is a digital signature so it can electronically indicate that it has received the product there is no paper pedigree that can be torn up with a new one started at each step theres an electronic or digital signature that allows us to take the secondary wholesaler or diverter out of the equation this technology prevents the introduction of counterfeit goods into legitimate commerce and thats the objective a pedigree and track and trace technology
4185783 we replaced the whole line from the infeed to the exit
4185784 we replaced the bottle descrambler the bottle cleaner the filling systems the capper the induction sealer the labeler and the case packer
4185785 but because of the four liter bottle we use an infeed hopper thats about 10 times the size of the others
4185786 before we could only unload bottles six at a time
4185787 now we can dump a case of 24 at a time
4185788 it picks up the bottles inverts them blows air in and then pulls a vacuum to draw the air out before returning the bottles to the line
4185789 theres a feedback loop that will either slow down or speed up the auger
4185790 as the powder builds up on the auger over time on a shift it has to go faster to provide the same amount and rate
4185791 most in line cappers have no problems with a standard bottle but when you have an offset neck theres a challenge because you dont want to cap it and indent the top of the bottle
4185792 if its on loose it will be rejected due to height
4185793 the system also informs us whether the labels on if its skewed or if its straight
4185794 when a machine is down it automatically stops the upstream machine so the bottles dont back up
4185795 and when a machine starts running again the upstream machines restart automatically

4185974 new yorkers living in communities near newtown creek have suffered long enough
4185975 we know that there are dangerous chemicals in the soil water and air at sites around newtown creek
4185976 i am disappointed that the new system will not be in place by tomorrows deadline which comes more than three years after i worked to pass a law to require entergy to install backup power for their sirens however and i am pleased that the new system promises to be the best in the country and i do think it is important that fema take the time they need to ensure that everything is in order before the new system is brought on line we will soon have a great system in place and i applaud the hard work that entergy fema the nrc and local officials have done to bring us to this point
4185977 todays out of control petroleum markets cant be explained by normal market fundamentals and i hope that aggressive action by the federal trade commission can burst the energy price bubble that is burdening american families and dragging down our economy
4185978 every american sees the smoke and this proposed rule is a down payment on the fire engine we need to put out record high pump prices
4185979 by establishing a clear bright line distinguishing healthy market practices from illegal manipulation we can help restore a functional oil and gasoline marketplace where pump prices are fair and affordable i encourage every american who believes manipulation may be behind todays record high gasoline and diesel prices to write the federal trade commission to encourage them to issue the strongest final rule possible
4185980 this is welcome news for the southern tiers hardworking farmers who are still struggling to recover from the devastating effects of the june storms
4185981 i am glad to see that the usda has taken the necessary steps to provide assistance to our farmers so that they will not have to stand alone in shouldering the burden of recovering from this disaster i strongly urge anybody who thinks they may be eligible for assistance from the usda to visit their local fsa office as soon as possible
4185982 community health centers throughout new hampshire and across the nation are often the first line of assistance for the low income and uninsured providing primary and preventative health care to millions of individuals children and families regardless of income or insurance status
4185983 i welcomed the opportunity to meet with families first health and support center officials to hear more about their work to bring health care services to some of the most vulnerable in our population its clear that federal resources such as the 259 519 that i helped secure for families first in 2002 play a valuable role in providing comprehensive health care services to this population families first and the community it supports can be assured that i will continue to strongly support their mission
4185984 throughout his time in congress senator sununu has preserved protected and enhanced community health center funding to meet the growing number of under and uninsured
4185985 a frozen katrina will be measured in hypothermia cases and malnutrition or unfilled prescriptions if the poor are forced to spend grocery or medicine money on fuel
4185986 a looming energy disaster with lives hanging in the balance
4185987 it is critical for idahos and americas future to remain competitive in the world economy and the best way to do that is offer our best and brightest students a top notch technical education and the math and science basics
4185988 our future efforts in technology and research rely heavily on the math and science education provided by idahos universities and i am proud to stand on the university of idaho campus today and see karen christian begin what i hope will be a long running scholarship program
4185989 we are delighted that karen has chosen to pursue her passion for science at the university of idaho
4185990 senator crapos foresight and generosity and the idaho community foundations excellent stewardship will foster many future idaho students passion for science and mathematics science technology engineering and mathematics stem education is critical to preparing our young people for success in college and success in career and we are very grateful for the support of the mike crapo math and science scholarship fund
4185991 we are so pleased to begin making awards from the fund
4185992 providing students with higher education aid is one of the best possible ways to help students as individuals and the state as a whole and we appreciate the opportunity to work with senator crapo on this worthy project
4185993 being selected for the mike crapo scholarship for math and science will help me throughout my first year at the university of idaho
4185994 it is an honor to be chosen for this scholarship
4185995 thanks to safer vehicles aggressive law enforcement and our efforts countless families were spared the devastating news that a loved one was not coming home
4185996 whatever you may think you know about beijing and china throw it out the door
4185997 whatever you think you may know is probably wrong anyway
4185998 its difficult at the tactical level to know each and every engagement in each town
4185999 to punish georgia for daring to try to integrate with the west
4186000 the united states of america stands strongly as the president of france just said for the territorial integrity of georgia
4186001 i would consider that to be bluster from the foreign minister of russia
4186002 we are very concerned about these reports it is a serious situation
4186003 the middle eastern states arent nations theyre quarrels with borders
4186004 up until now a time of death was declared using repertory and pulse parameters only essentially preventing organ harvesting from donors
4186005 brain death is irreversible and considered a death for all intents and purposes determining it as the actual time of death while the organs are still viable will allow for more organ donations
4186006 more importantly we have been able to reach a consensus among the religious medical and ethics communities to view and rule brain death as time of death
4186007 the death of hizbullah leader imad mugniyah will lead to an earthquake in the zionist regime
4186008 this despicable crime will increase the zionists disasters and strengthen the courage of those who will hit the zionist regime
4186009 his pure blood just like the blood of the other fighters will claim a heavy price from the enemy
4186010 i would like to express my condolences following the death of this great commander who had become a shahid martyr by the zionist criminals
4186011 this action is a clear result and example of organized state terrorism by the zionist regime
4186012 prevent the zionist regime from taking these actions that are a clear violation of international law
4186013 a golden page in the history of mankinds fight against the aggressive and occupying zionists
4186014 we will march to the martyrs square the burial place of hariri to say enough syria continues to control internal affairs in lebanon through its allies
4186015 i say this very quietly that there is no way to coexist with hizbullah
4186016 let him hizbullah secretary general hassan nasrallah live the way he wants but we want to live the way we want
4186017 the pickens plan is a bold and achievable approach to meeting our nations energy challenges like pickens i believe tomorrows energy mix must include the development and expansion of natural gas and wind energy production importantly however i believe we must utilize all domestic energy resources including not only natural gas and renewable energy but also oil coal and nuclear energy developing and expanding domestic energy resources will translate into energy security and will ensure stable sources of supply and well paying jobs for oklahomans and americans
4186018 utilized in all 50 states natural gas makes up nearly a quarter of our nations energy supply it provides electricity in over 60 million homes and 40 percent of u s industry relies on natural gas for energy or as a necessary feedstock to produce a variety of products from chemicals and fertilizer to glass to maintain a vibrant and internationally competitive economy america must produce enough affordable natural gas to meet a growing demand oklahomans stand ready to help meet this challenge presently oklahoma produces oil and gas from over 120 000 wells and is one of the top natural gas producing states in the country in fact oklahoma alone annually produces nearly one tenth of total u s natural gas production the expertise and experience of oklahomas producers lead the world in many exploration and extraction technologies additionally the industry provides billions in tax revenue and employs tens of thousands in some of the highest paid jobs in the state
4186019 as americans continue to suffer from high gas prices we need to take advantage of our abundant domestic supply of natural gas for use as a transportation fuel
4186020 the drive america on natural gas act adds flexibility to the current renewable fuels standard mandates by adding natural gas it encourages the use of a proven alternative fuel and sends a market signal to manufacturers to consider compressed natural gas as a cost competitive alternative natural gas is domestic plentiful affordable and clean the promise of natural gas as a mainstream transportation fuel is achievable today not 15 or 20 years from now
4186021 the senate should be talking about big solutions to the big problem one we like is oklahoma sen jim inhofes proposal to help make compressed natural gas more readily available as a transportation fuel but thats not on the senate leaderships agenda neither is drilling offshore or in alaska most democrats are against adding new supply but their excuses are having a harder time with the gasoline buying public
4186022 mcclendon endorsed a bill by reps dan boren d muskogee and rahm emmanuel d illinois to create incentives for moving more vehicles to natural gas and he endorsed another bill by rep john sullivan r tulsa to invest federal money into research on natural gas vehicles sen jim inhofe r tulsa has also introduced legislation on the matter
4186023 we continue to see unprecedented growth in u s gas production that will eventually overwhelm the u s gas markets
4186024 even if that number were to increase 100 fold in the next ten years to 11 000 000 or roughly 5 percent of the entire vehicle market a formidable goal the impact on natural gas supplies and the natural gas delivery infrastructure would be small equating about 4 percent of total u s natural gas consumption
4186025 the senate should be talking about big solutions to the big problem one we like is oklahoma sen jim inhofes proposal to help make compressed natural gas more readily available as a transportation fuel but thats not on the senate leaderships agenda neither is drilling offshore or in alaska most democrats are against adding new supply but their excuses are having a harder time with the gasoline buying public
4186026 the pickens plan is a bold and achievable approach to meeting our nations energy challenges
4186027 like pickens i believe tomorrows energy mix must include the development and expansion of natural gas and wind energy production
4186028 theres probably 30 000 35 000 jobs that are created by these marginal wells that are producing today
4186029 new federal legislation that would help low producing oil and gas wells makes good sense as the united states considers all options to meet its energy needs
4186030 both sexes tend to lean on stereotypes in those areas that are more emotional such as independence the fear of being abandoned fears in general and sexuality in these areas it would seem the partners are not aware of the true thoughts and desires of the other
4186031 this shows the great importance of open communication especially in emotionally laden topics as a tool for reducing conflicts and improving the quality of couples lives

4186106 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4186107 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4186108 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4186109 i cant emphasize strongly enough the importance of calling us if your dog suddenly starts barking at 3 a m or you think you see someone in your backyard
4186110 if nike can get a waiver then why cant we get one its a very dangerous precedent
4186111 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4186112 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
4186113 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4186114 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4186115 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4186116 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4186117 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4186118 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4186119 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4186120 sin trabajo no hay paz social y la inseguridad aumenta

4186122 the team finished the race in 81 minutes and want to improve on our time next year but i think we all did very well our next event is the blisters for bread charity fun walk to show our support to feeding hungry schoolchildren
4186123 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4186124 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

4186141 a little more breathing room but there was also a fair amount of disappointment
4186142 there was something about this story that i felt so personally committed to
4186143 ive always had a lot of respect for average working people
4186144 bob wasnt an ordinary man he was probably a genius but as a person his lifestyle his family scale he was just an average guy so i felt like i understood that

4186146 hes an addict in some ways he wants to give it up but he cant
4186147 i think they had a leg to stand on in a certain way
4186148 i think they thought we would have come up with this anyway based on the amount of time and energy and research and people we had on it
4186149 but i dont think they had come up with it yet and what bob kearns came up with whether or not it was the most revolutionary idea anyone ever had was bobs idea they were denying him his dignity
4186150 it shows that there is justice in the world that you cant steal something and get away with it

4186160 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4186161 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4186162 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4186163 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4186164 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4186165 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4186166 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4186167 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4186168 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4186169 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4186170 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4186171 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4186172 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4186173 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4186174 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4186175 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4186176 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4186177 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4186178 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4186179 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4186180 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4186181 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
4186182 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
4186183 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
4186184 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances

4186222 it appears that the government has misread the nationalist mood of the people of jammu which is also supported by strong public opinion in the country this is the first time in history that the government has succeeded in even alienating nationalist opinion
4186223 the government should at least at this late hour recognise the gravity of the situation and speedily take a just and fair decision rather than adopt a do nothing policy
4186224 the constitutional right to religion of the pilgrims has to be made effective the myopic attitude of the government and its snail like speed in finding a solution has allowed the situation to escalate

4186300 it has all the hallmarks of the previous attack with the same delivery albeit a slightly different disguise and formatting of the e mails and the eventual link directing you to a variant of the same malicious executable download
4186301 at one point on the morning of aug 13 the msnbc spam campaign spiked and equaled the total amount of all spam we were seeing in our traps in other words this is a significant attack
4186302 so far volumes have been ranging in the 1 5 to 2 million message per hour range for the msnbc spam
4186303 although nowhere near the peaks that we saw with the cnn outbreak from last week it also took three days for the cnn spam to reach those volumes
4186304 so far we have seen two variants of these e mails
4186305 the first links to a file named up html at the end of the breakingnews msnbc com url which linked to a page that is branded cnn not msnbc this should be an immediate red flag to any user that something is not right the newer variant links to msn html this page uses the same logo that is on top of the real msnbc com site and will likely look more legitimate to users

4186315 education is a basic right for every child in canada but for far too long the children of attawapiskat have been denied the opportunity to learn in safe clean and comfortable surroundings
4186316 children are our future and it is shameful that in this day and age our children are crowded into drafty leaky portables that challenge the delivery of their academic programs instead of learning in a proper facility
4186317 i am very proud and inspired by the work of shannen koostachin and the children of attawapiskat but i am very discouraged and disheartened by the government of canadas failure to address these basic educational needs
4186318 it is shameful and unethical that these young leaders and this community has been forced into a position to lobby for what every other canadian child has the right to a quality education
4186319 children shouldnt have to mount an international campaign just to get a school built

4186322 the government of canada seems to have forgotten that the right to a proper education is a fundamental human right but shannen isnt content to be treated as a second class citizen she has emerged as an inspiring young leader who is waging a fight that has international significance
4186323 minister strahl told me he had other priorities than building a school maybe he thinks we will just lose hope and give up but i was always taught by my parents to stand up and speak for what i believe in i told him the children wont give up we will keep moving forward walking proud in our moccasins until we are given justice

4186395 to reduce americas dependence on foreign oil and also fight islamic terrorism would you support offshore oil drilling
4186396 to reduce americas dependence on foreign oil and also protect pristine beaches would you support offshore drilling
4186397 national polls tell us about the national mood but dont tell us how close the election is
4186398 its important for people who closely follow the election to go to sources of reliable information about separate state elections particularly the battleground states
4186399 i stay away from the tabloids im not going to talk about lindsay because shes my friend you know shes great shes also 22 years old i think people forget that
4186400 with the internet the way it is one second were enemies one second were best friends one second were lovers and then were broken up
4186401 i love the ronsons theyre close to my heart and i respect all the work they do samantha and my relationship is a private matter
4186402 in 2007 there were 20 000 citations for charges related to driving without a license
4186403 to say there is a need for this initiative is untrue and ill conceived
4186404 convincing corroborating identification vehicle registration or a valid drivers license
4186405 why do we see a difference between the objects hitting the ground and the big objects whizzing by
4186406 odds are an object we might have to deal with would be like an ll chondrite and thanks to our samples in the laboratory we can measure its properties in detail
4186407 shes going to come out here for the kids birthdays
4186408 it will be the first time the cousins meet im sure the boys will be like big brothers to maddie
4186409 really really good i went through a stage when i was in high school when it wasnt so good but now im at a stage where i really appreciate her a lot more
4186410 that was special but it was also strange because shes always been the baby and now the baby was having a baby

4186416 our goal is to provide any type of assistance for children who are in need and times are rough now
4186417 but when the quran was revealed all such fairs came to an end and literary gatherings were defunct from now on the quran was the only work to command peoples attention none of them could challenge or compete with it or even suggest that a single word be changed moved added or omitted from the sentence where it occurs yet the quran did not close the door to competition indeed it left it wide open calling on them individually and collectively to take up its challenge and produce anything similar to it it repeated the challenge in different forms berating their inability to do so and reducing the task for them time after time
4186418 then bring ten surahs like it that have been invented and call upon for assistance whoever you can besides allah if you should be truthful
4186419 and if you are in doubt about what we have sent down i e the quran upon our servant then produce a surah like thereof and call upon your witnesses i e supporters other than allah if you should be truthful but if you do not and you will never be able to then fear the fire whose fuel is men and stones prepared for the disbelievers
4186420 do they not reflect upon the quran if it had been from any other than allah they would have found within it much contradiction
4186421 and they say why are not signs sent down to him from his lord say the signs are only with allah and i am only a plain warner is it not sufficient for them that we have sent down to you the book which is recited to them verily herein is mercy and a reminder for a people who believe
4186422 there has been no prophet except that allah gave him miracles due to which people believed in him i have been given as my miracle the revelation which allah revealed to me i hope thereby that i will have the largest number of followers on the day of judgment
4186423 it wont leak in your pocket and make you pregnant
4186424 it takes a strong man to make a tender chicken
4186425 it takes an aroused man to make a chicken affectionate
4186426 we appreciate the frustration of viewers its a minority who have been affected by these enhancements together with the manufacturers were doing all we can to help viewers find the best value replacement
4186427 at that time no one could conceive that this would happen and we certainly had no intention of selling boxes that would not work in a few years
4186428 judging by the number of calls we have received we think tens of thousands of our customers are affected and we are trying to help them
4186429 i am angry about the lack of publicity and consultation about this change
4186430 no warnings were given of these upgrades the timetable and the units that would possibly be affected
4186431 they have experience in managing portfolios of assets like these
4186432 the finest most complex and maybe even magical new condominium project
4186433 president talabani has travelled to the mayo clinic on august 2 for a surgery on his left knee but while conducting general medical tests the medical team perceived that he suffers narrowness in a valve of his heart which required a heart surgery the surgery has been undergone and that it was successful
4186434 if russia does not step back from its aggressive posture and actions in georgia the us russian relationship could be adversely affected for years to come
4186435 we would hope that he would be true to his word
4186436 the provisional ceasefire that was agreed to really must go into place and that means that military activities have to cease
4186437 the russians were prepared to take advantage of an opportunity and did so very aggressively in a way that went far beyond reasserting the autonomy of abkhazia and south ossetia
4186438 we have information that american military transport aviation say they are delivering a certain humanitarian cargo to tbilisi airport though they said we had bombed the airport two days ago lets ask them will they invite you the media to check whether it is humanitarian or not
4186439 we are just watching the situation there are still snipers out there certain groups have gotten through and the provocations are continuing
4186440 we will settle things with everyone and right now establishing peace is the main issue
4186441 we are not there to defend the ports we are there to provide humanitarian aid
4186442 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4186443 ik ben sergeant elburg jullie instructeur de komende weken moet ik jullie veranderen van een hoop gebakken stront waar de vliegen nog van wegblijven tot ware killers waar de satan nog voor aan de kant gaat hier ben je van mij en ben ik de enige die jullie behoren te haten ik zal jullie breken kapot maken en je laten afvragen waarom je in vredesnaam de vaderlandse grond hier nog bevuild ik zal je kennismaken met jullie nieuwe beste vriend genaamd pijn en komende tijd zal hij de enige hier zijn die je nooit alleen zal laten dag en nacht de dagen van op je luie reet naar de teletubbies kijken zijn voorbij vanaf nu trekken jullie je grafmuil enkel open als ik dat vraag en is elk laatste woord dat je zegt sergeant jullie zullen alles doen wat ik zeg ook al zou ik jullie je eigen stront laten eten en denk niet dat ik bluf begrepen dames

4186462 the horses trotted well today they all look healthy and fit and happy were looking forward to starting the process tomorrow
4186463 kirks horse had arguably been our first or second horse until recently so while losing daniels experience was a blow by bringing kirk back in we dont lose a lot
4186464 daniel is a fantastically experienced rider kirk is not so experienced but has been there at crucial times in the past couple of years for new zealand and performed very credibly
4186465 so i think the net effect on the quality of this team is not a very big effect at all
4186466 these guys are seasoned competitors and although katie hasnt spent as much time outside of new zealand as the rest of them shes ridden on an awful lot of teams competitions and feels pretty comfortable being part of the team
4186467 shes going to be our no 1 rider shes going out first i have a lot of respect for her and feel very comfortable sending her out in that trailblazing role
4186468 but i am confident of our build up bruce won a grand prix just before coming into quarantine and sharn has had some very strong results in the us
4186469 katie has been the one that has struggled the most of recent and i attribute that to the travel and acclimatisation aspect
4186470 i would not have been able to do that without working in new zealand and i have been trying to do this for years
4186471 when i come back i will go to the bank and settle the loan and start up a backpackers and do this by myself with friends in new zealand who will invest the scheme in new zealand has opened up doors going to new zealand is not only working for money and buying people who are potential investors might want to do joint ventures
4186472 we have very very few people from sanma province in the rse scheme so we would like to see more people there
4186473 we have the land but not the finance for the land and if more and more people go out that will make the difference they want to see your beautiful country get some work and bring some money to their people
4186474 for the season coming up we will have a good model and will expand it to the remote areas where we have hardworking people without experience of city life so we get some real benefits to the rural community
4186475 we are behind them 120 because i dont know where the people would have come from otherwise
4186476 without the 200 people on the scheme we would have cleaned out winz and i have no idea where we would get the others
4186477 vanuatu is very limited in its financial resources and about 80 of the population is in rural areas by exporting labour to new zealand we will help poverty in vanuatu and help people be more positive when the workers return they can start their own business and build their own homes it is already happening
4186478 due to atrocious weather a helicopter which was dispatched from christchurch has been unable to reach the location

4186482 no hay peor ciego que el que no quiere ver
4186483 no se puede ese es el lugar del otro del caballero
4186484 people must be aware of it and i think the taskforce is a good thing
4186485 everyone needed to step up tonight we needed the three points but it didnt happen and we are pretty gutted
4186486 we still had a chance if we got three points now weve got to keep our heads up and keep going
4186487 weve put a lot of time and effort in a lot of it off our own backs really because we dont get a lot of money weve worked hard its just so disappointing
4186488 you lose someone like kayla and it leaves us a bit thin and all our pattern went
4186489 all we could do was try and hold them until we got kayla back on the park
4186490 there is six points left and we have to get as far up the ladder as we can and we have to re assemble and see who is going to be fit
4186491 pasti dibuka kota konstantin sebaik baik pemimpin ialah pemimpin yang membukanya dan sebaik baik tentera ialah tentera yang membukanya kota konstantin

4186519 we can today confirm that we have advised the metropolitan police service that the actor christian bale should not face any charges following an incident which occurred in relation to his mother and sister at the dorchester hotel on 21 july this year
4186520 whilst the cps treats all incidents which take place in a domestic context seriously it is important that the views of complainants are also taken into account when making decisions in such cases
4186521 taking all the factors into consideration the decision has been taken that there is insufficient evidence to afford a realistic prospect of conviction and accordingly the police have been advised that no further action should be taken against mr bale
4186522 accordingly kevin where do i get the ideas for a new enterprise

4186530 el verano negro de la sanidad valenciana por la falta de previsi n de la conselleria
4186531 continuos e incesantes problemas que se est n registrando en los hospitales
4186532 si un d a se quedan en el hospital general sin refrigeraci n durante tres d as a la semana siguiente son los enfermos de la fe los que tienen que sufrir altas temperaturas por la falta de mantenimiento de las instalaciones
4186533 lo mismo ocurre con el sistema inform tico de la conselleria
4186534 el abucasis ha demostrado ser el gran fracaso de la gesti n del pp pues con un solo error es capaz de bloquear toda la sanidad valenciana y el fallo que se produjo ayer se une a la larga lista problemas que acumula este sistema
4186535 el consell ya se ha gastado cuatro millones de euros en mejorar sus deficiencias
4186536 la falta de previsi n unida a la pasividad y la poca capacidad de reacci n de la conselleria est n provocando el caos en los centros sanitarios de la comunitat
4186537 viva en otra realidad porque mientras cree que esto es el pa s de las maravillas la sanidad se bloquea cada dos por tres y los pacientes sufren las consecuencias de la ineficacia total y absoluta de su gesti n
4186538 exigir responsabilidades por lo ocurrido porque ante la reincidencia de estos problemas no nos cabe ninguna duda de que estamos ante un d ficit de mantenimiento de las instalaciones sanitarias
4186539 en qu se gasta la conselleria el dinero si no es en inversiones que eviten este tipo de situaciones
4186540 la cobertura en atenci n primaria no llega ni al 50 por ciento y la de atenci n especializada s lo es de un 10 por ciento

4186561 we will be handing over these kits to district supply officers mid day meal scheme officers and consumer campaigners wanting to provide unadulterated food to people
4186562 till now it used to take considerable time to make checks samples would have to be sent to special laboratories in bhuj rajkot and vadodara and it would take days for results often officers would be sought to be compromised but now all of it will be in the past
4186563 a booklet to guide consumer campaigners on how to use the kit will soon be put on the website its a very simple exercise
4186564 the states science colleges too will be given one kit free of cost so that students can learn how to check adulterated food a chemical in the kit can find out whether there is urea in milk or if castor oil has been added to groundnut oil one can easily say that with this kit as many as 1 225 mobile laboratories will be added in the state

4186911 one rather simple way of getting into your paper is to take the side of the argument that most of the citizens will want to avoid they are intellectual exercises and it is legitimate to argue now one way and now another as debaters do in similar circumstances always take the that looks to you hardest least defensible it will almost always turn out to be easier to write interestingly on that side

4186914 instead of stuffing your sentences with straw you must try steadily to get rid of the padding to make your sentences lean and tough you dig up more real content instead of taking a couple of obvious points off the surface of the topic and then circling warily around them for six paragraphs you work in and explore figure out the details you illustrate
4186915 when we hear a word we hear with it an echo of all the situations in which we have heard it before the word mother for example has for most people agreeable associations when you hear mother you probably think of home safety love food and various other pleasant things the question of whether to use loaded words or not depends on what is being written

4186928 i think its only natural that parents are going to act that way initially
4186929 youre talking about something that is probably the most important thing in their life indirectly theyre threatened because their kids have been threatened
4186930 let the kids know that what the teacher has written is important enough for you to read carefully

4186934 i always say i dont care what they say about me the first day of school but what they say about me at the last day of school
4186935 if the teacher thinks differently than your parental philosophy your child is learning more than you can teach her
4186936 if something doesnt feel right take it to the principal and ask that they conduct an investigation
4186937 give the school a chance to get to the bottom of the situation and find a solution

4186953 die systemfrage ist nicht so wichtig wichtig ist nur dass man die spiele gewinnt wir m ssen variabel sein welches system am besten greift muss der trainer entscheiden
4186954 wir m ssen das system erst noch verinnerlichen gegen erfurt waren die abst nde zwischen den einzelnen mannschaftsteilen zu gro wenn wir es schaffen schneller zu verschieben die r ume enger zu machen und besser gegen den ball spielen bin ich berzeugt dass das richtig spa machen wird
4186955 das ist auf jeden fall eine option in der bundesliga werden die bayern zuhause h ufig auf eine sturmspitze treffen was soll man dann mit vier abwehrspielern die k nnte man auch direkt an den m nchner karlsplatz stellen
4186956 der stellenwert des trainers muss sich verbessern nat rlich muss der coach auch toparbeit nach dem neuesten entwicklungsstand abliefern aber wenn er das tut dann muss sich sein stellenwert auch viel st rker in konstanz ausdr cken
4186957 wer mittel oder langfristig arbeiten darf der hat auch erfolg
4186958 der trainer ist der wichtigste mann er muss das st rkste glied in der kette sein
4186959 und um den trainer herum schafft man dann die rahmenbedingungen so muss es sein nicht andersrum
4186960 aber ich sehe die gefahr dass viele klub verantwortliche kurzfristig hohe ziele propagieren weil sie im umfeld begeisterung entfachen und mehr dauerkarten verkaufen wollen

4186964 more than five years after the start of the iraq war we should have the resources in place to treat the psychological wounds of war as well as we do the physical ones but we dont
4186965 when someone with a history of depression ptsd or other psychological wounds walks into the va and says they are suicidal it should set off alarm bells we cant convince veterans or service members to get care if they think they will be met with lectures and closed doors
4186966 time and again it has taken leaks and scandals to get the administration to own up to major problems at the va from inadequate budgets to rising suicide rates and its response to rising costs has been to underfund research and cut off services to some veterans service members and veterans need more than an 800 number to call

4187041 there was a group of girls living in the armory sic and cornwall street section that the neighborhood workers seemed unable to reach said mrs deering of course they came to the clubs and classes at the neighborhood house but no one was able to get beneath the surface of their problems
4187042 and it was a problem aggravated by the influx of soldiers and sailors
4187043 i made a survey of the neighborhood and found there was no moving picture house no park no dance hall no opportunity whatever for wholesale amusement
4187044 i found the prejudice against allowing girls to indulge in baseball very strong among the mothers in that neighborhood
4187045 i was surprised at the eagerness with which the girls themselves entered into the spirit of the thing
4187046 i didnt pick and choose my girls i grouped them together at random what we were working for was group spirit which is rarely found among girls they dont understand team work but before the summer was over they grasped the idea and the result was splendid
4187047 they were a self governing body they made their own rules and stuck to them
4187048 we played seventy games during the summer and the team which won the cup for good sportsmanship was comprised of the former

4187073 sustituye el tratamiento cl sico de efluentes en vez de tener un problema generamos un producto
4187074 el emulsificante podr a venderse sin problema el producto que contiene la bacteria viva depende de la legislaci n de cada pa s si permite ingresar organismos vivos
4187075 la limpieza no es completa y demora mucho tiempo eso restringe su uso a situaciones donde la contaminaci n no es muy grande y no hay urgencia por una descontaminaci n r pida
4187076 para usarlo en alimentos tenemos que purificar el compuesto es un proceso m s complicado y lo vemos a m s largo plazo
4187077 m s de una crema que se utiliza para el tratamiento de la piel contiene sustancias emulsificantes a las empresas les servir a por un tema de marketing de tener un nuevo producto y tambi n por la estabilidad las emulsiones que se hacen con este producto son muy estables y eso importa en cosm tica que la emulsi n no se corte como ocurre con una mayonesa

4187102 this is a grand american tradition and we are proud of that we stay true to those traditions but the packaging of the show brings us into the 21st century as the culture has changed the circus has evolved

4187123 los combatientes creen que los funcionarios chiitas pertenecen a la organizaci n badr que recibe entrenamiento y est dirigida por ir n por supuesto con conocimiento de los estadounidenses
4187124 los militantes ahora miembros de sahwa mantuvieron bloqueadas las importaciones procedentes de ir n
4187125 si estados unidos lanza un ataque contra ir n ser el primer voluntario en luchar del lado estadounidense

4187135 i dont think it tells us very much more than wealthier people and higher social classes live in the south west and the south east though that doesnt detract from the achievements of students in these areas
4187136 there are also many more independent and selective schools in the southern part of the country and any additional improvement in selective schools is bound to be reflected in regional statistics
4187137 the exam boards themselves say this crude data on a level performance in the regions would need more analysis before you can draw any significant conclusions across the country many more young people are getting valued a level qualifications especially in the priority subjects of english and maths we do know that the improvement rate for overall a level passes is the same or faster in the north west than in all of the southern regions we also know that exam results in london are now higher than the national average following years of underperformance
4187138 i heartily congratulate all students who have successfully completed their a levels and thank teachers for their hard work more pupils are now passing maths a level than at any time in over a decade its crucial for society that we have talented mathematicians and maths is essential for science and innovation
4187139 todays results for science and maths a levels give us reason to be encouraged maths and further maths have continued their robust recovery with the numbers of students taking these a levels increasing for the fifth year in a row this is a welcome pay off for the serious efforts made in recent years to boost this subject

4187141 en cuanto a estados unidos ellos quieren tener acceso a territorio georgiano por diferentes razones una es el tr nsito de petr leo y gas y segundo establecer una base militar para el ej rcito estadounidense en caso de un ataque contra ir n y para ubicar radares o sistemas antimisiles
4187142 somos castigados por nuestra aspiraci n a volvernos parte de un mundo democr tico hoy nuestra opci n hacia occidente est amenazada la agresi n rusa es un desaf o para la comunidad internacional y cada minuto es cr tico para las vidas de civiles inocentes

4187657 i would go for more for muscular endurance as opposed to trying to build up muscle mass youre just trying to train your leg muscles to be able to work hard longer one thing that i think is one of the best things to do is the core which is anything from the navel to the knees and that if you have good core strength that helps with your posture which helps with your good running form which can also help prevent injury

4187669 take responsibility to verify the eligibility of mr barack h obama to be president of the united states
4187670 mr obama has refused to produce a physical certified stamped copy of his birth certificate an electronically displayed imaged displayed by his official campaign website has alleged to have been a forgery we request that the fec require mr obama to authorize the fec to obtain an official copy of his birth certificate
4187671 i am looking for 50 brave men or women from 49 states and the district of columbia to join me in suing the secretaries of state in our respective states to prevent them from posting the name barak h obama on the november 2008 ballot until he presents incontrovertible proof that he is a u s citizen
4187672 the secretaries of state are the ones who by placing a person or initiative on the ballot certify that the candidates or initiatives meet the legal requirements to be on the ballot
4187673 the office of the president is simply too important to trust to someone other than a person whose loyalties are 100 percent american and while it is impossible to read into the heart of a man or woman we do have the test our forefathers gave us which is this office is not to be entrusted to anyone but a natural u s citizen
4187674 the revelation that the birth certificate of obamas own sister was evidently used to create the electronic forgery represents what supporters of this analysis claim is a smoking gun that appears to implicate sen
4187675 the stakes couldnt be higher even the snopes anti rumor site acknowledges that obamas constitutional fitness to be president depends solely on his being born in the united states because his mother not yet 19 at the time of his birth would not have had a sufficient number of years as an adult citizen according to the laws prevailing at the time to pass on natural born citizenship automatically
4187676 there have been reports so far unconfirmed that obama was born outside the country either in kenya his presumed fathers native land or in canada the fact that the obama campaign has been touting as genuine a forgery since june 12 will likely increase pressure to not only account for the fake but produce a genuine paper birth certificate obama in his book dreams from my father specifically mentioned having such a document in his possession but it has not been submitted for public inspection or analysis if it in fact exists
4187677 if obama were born outside the united states one could argue that he would not meet the legal definition of natural born citizen because u
4187678 so she wouldnt have met the requirement of five years after the age of 16
4187679 natural born citizen under article ii section 1 of the constitution of the united states
4187680 no person except a natural born citizen shall be eligible to the office of president

4187688 they werent being very discreet about it the news hadnt even broken yet that she and john split
4187689 youd think of all people jen aniston wouldnt need to use people in her camp as a dating service
4187690 john took the decision to end things as he felt he just wasnt ready for the level of commitment that jennifer deserved
4187691 jen didnt want to have kids or marry this year but she did want to set a timetable for their future together
4187692 jen who decided to move on she is very fond of john and has thought he might be the one
4187693 she finds him funny sexy and very talented plus he understands all the aspects of living in a fishbowl but in the final analysis she just got tired of his roving eye

4187699 je komt elkaar tegen op premi res en feestjes en dan hadden we altijd belangstelling voor elkaars werk
4187700 dit is echt nieuws dat even tot je door moet dringen ik had altijd veel respect voor hem hij was zichzelf en hij maakte gewoon mooie dingen

4187702 wij waren heel intensief met hem bezig met de fashion week er valt echt een gat percy was een heel flamboyant figuur en zo waren zijn ontwerpen ook heel uitgesproken heel feestelijk en heel spectaculair vol drama
4187703 wat een einde voor zon talentvolle zachtaardige en inspirerende man

4187705 we zullen jou en je fantastische creaties missen je laat ons in verbijstering achter

4187709 ive been workin this grave shift and i aint made shit
4187710 the motive of an foia requester is generally irrelevant to the analysis
4187711 you state that the individual who has made the foia request
4187712 signed a no contact order last month which states that he is not to have contact with your mother or her family
4187713 the order is good until the court date which is some time this month
4187714 do anything i can to keep this person from obtaining your personnel records
4187715 here im saying clearly i oppose barack obama and the book is designed to lay this information out and let the american public decide
4187716 he was registered as a muslim the documentation i thoroughly researched it from the indonesian newspapers and indonesian television he attended mosque with his stepfather
4187717 the friends who were in school with him attest that he was then considered a muslim and thats the testimony of the people in indonesia who grew up in those six years
4187718 right now vile smear peddler jerome corsi is back with a new book of lies this time about barack obama well need the combined efforts of every member of the action wire to push back against this years vicious republican attack book
4187719 together well show corsi and the right wing smear machine that we wont back down from a fight
4187720 if you get one of these e mails that says im a muslim not true that never been a muslim this is just stuff that is designed to make people suspicious
4187721 obamas mother chose another third world prospect for her second husband a second man of color to be her mate
4187722 i stated they were not written to express my true views they were intentionally written to be antagonistic or aggressive or provocative the catholic church im a good member i was born and raised in the catholic church
4187723 you cant take a few quips that ive wrote that ive apologized for that should not have been written and i have not done again to be representative of my beliefs and writing
4187724 i dont think anybodys going to take jerome corsi all that seriously once they learn who this guy really is even people on the right wing havent associated themselves with him because of some of the pretty bigoted and outrageous things hes said in his career
4187725 now four years later he has come out with another book that is also riddled with distortions and falsehoods so the question is why on earth would anyone listen to what he has to say about barack obama
4187726 ive written against john mccain very strongly for the last four years on his immigration policy i wrote a series of articles in world net daily of john mccains connections with george soros the book is not written to support john mccain i am constitution party i make it very clear in the introduction ill be voting for chuck baldwin of the constitution party
4187727 this book is a legitimately published book its published with the investigative research in this book that is not being touched here all thats happening is im getting called names its an ad hominem attack
4187728 right now we dont have any indication of motive as far as it deals with mr gwatney
4187729 the manager asked him if he needed to talk at that point he turned in his badge and left the building

4187750 the equilibrium with the taylor rule the real wage falls while efficiency dictates that it rise following a productivity shock in effect in the taylor rule equilibrium the markets receive a signal that the cost of labor is low and this is part of the reason that the economy expands so strongly the correct signal would be sent by a high real wage and this could be accomplished by allowing the price level to fall however in the monetary policy regime governed by our taylor rule this fall in the price level is not permitted to occur any threatened fall in the price level is met by a proactive expansion in monetary policy

4187830 i think what happens in the days and months to come will determine the future course of u s russian relations
4187831 my personal view is that there need to be some consequences for the actions that russia has taken against a sovereign state
4187832 re examine the entire gamut of our military to military activities with russia and will make changes as necessary and appropriate depending on russian actions in the days ahead
4187833 this has become an increasingly difficult and complex job as more imports from more nations are now sold in the united states than ever before
4187834 thanks to safer vehicles aggressive law enforcement and our efforts countless families were spared the devastating news that a loved one was not coming home
4187835 i am convinced that honoring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4187836 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect senator obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again
4187837 national public figure fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want
4187838 if anybody wants to put a tail on me go ahead
4187839 if tomorrow president mikhail saakashvili signs these documents then the withdrawal of the russian troops can start
4187840 the united states of america stands strongly as the president of france just said for the territorial integrity of georgia

4187853 he is our player he is at our club he is a fantastic player so it would be great for him to stay

4187855 en ning n momento el partido sociaslita unido de venezuela psuv se ha planteado usar fondos p blicos para la realizaci n de la campa a con miras a la realizaci n de las elecciones regionales esto ser a un acto contrarevolucionario es una pr ctica que condenamos

4187860 any tournament director is always looking for the wow factor sometime during the event
4187861 we definitely have it with two sports icons that are both known as the king in their respective sports with arnolds history at our tournament and wake forest and richards record in nascar with a team based just down the road in level cross we have two piedmont triad legends that are among the greatest ever to compete in their sports it is a thrill and an honor to host them at the wyndham championship
4187862 we are anticipating a steady flow of news later in the year from our gold exploration projects
4187863 i was pretty embarrassed by all the prosthetics on my face
4187864 long ago we made a pact you and i to come together so that i could assist you in your time of reawakening your path led you to earth at this place and time where you fell asleep to the true knowledge of who you are and what you came here to do once we walked by the northern seashore as brothers and it was there you asked me to meet you here on this mountain to deliver you a message a particular intent of the code
4187865 i am to remind you to stay positive my brother
4187866 yes robert just as you did when you faced into that rogue storm moments ago you stayed positive when you could have just as easily cursed great oneness given up and lain your body down to die instead something deep within you allowed you to handle the crisis without complaint or reverting back to your old negative ways of thinking you stayed positive and laughed and in doing so you created a way out for yourself
4187867 are you telling me that i had something to do with making it out of that storm alive that doesnt make any sense i was totally at the mercy of it all
4187868 but here you are now alive and well how do you explain that
4187869 this much i know it wasnt luck that saved you it was the fifth intent
4187870 yes my brother even if you dont know it you tapped into the fifth intent you chose to stay positive while everything around you was falling apart
4187871 unlike many who would have allowed their doubts and negative thoughts to take over and ruin their lives you held steadfast to a positive outcome and trusted that you would be okay
4187872 everything in your world exists because someone thought of it first your thoughts are immeasurably more powerful than you give them credit for the fifth intent has been hidden from you so that others could keep you under their thumbs but now it is time for your people to fly free like the eagles and it is for you to play a part in this by teaching them how to stay positive
4187873 by telling them what happened to you out there in the storm you see my brother as they begin to view their challenges as gifts instead they will eventually come to realize that its wise for them to remain positive even when theyre in the middle of a crisis
4187874 i dont think most people are ready to hear that yet chief i said
4187875 the biggest barrier youll run into robert is that many of your people have gotten into the habit of negative thinking
4187876 so far your journey has shown you that all things are alive
4187877 you must learn to use your power wisely my brother so that you can deliver the code to your people
4187878 your world has seen enough of violence it needs someone who is firmly lined up with great oneness someone who can set a course for others to follow
4187879 perhaps if i tell you a story it will help you set your course in life and walk the path you chose for yourself long ago
4187880 it was in the year 1876 and my people the lakota sioux were engaged in a fierce battle with the blue coated soldiers along the
4187881 i went to his side and pointed this out to him but he was wanting to continue the fight he rallied the remaining young warriors and against my insistence he was readying to attack again i had to do something to stop it
4187882 and so while crazy horse and his men were preparing to charge i walked slowly into the center of the battlefield sat down crosslegged lit my sacred pipe and called upon my good friend intent
4187883 for over a quarter of an hour the soldiers fired upon me bullets plowed up the ground all around my body but none touched me you see my brother intent and i were old friends and i knew i could count on him
4187884 when i saw that crazy horse and the young braves had finally come to their senses i slowly put my pipe away and walked back to my horse my people followed me that day because they saw the power of my connection with intent
4187885 this is the third intent my brother you are to know that you can do anything when you have set your course in life you and all of your people are powerful beyond measure you can create anything you choose your heart can be at peace just as your world can be at peace but first you must say good bye to your apathy and begin to reacquaint yourself with your old friend intent

4188356 he acccepted the photos were just of woman and they had not been asked about the photos
4188357 he confirmed he had taken not just stills but some moving images
4188358 most shots are taken from behind so the women cannot be identified
4188359 some photos are of the top area of the females but mostly the pictures are of womens bottoms

4188388 a novel that since its publication in 1932 has probably been read by only two people namely james wood and joseph roth
4188389 in recent years the trend in ya fiction has been toward a proliferation of darker edgier fare aimed at a more mature audience
4188390 what we dont know from the essay is how easily kids are allowed to dodge the librarians best intentions entirely and simply go to the ya or adult books by themselves that would have been my own strategy as a sixth grader particularly if i had had a previous encounter with a librarian that made me feel snooped upon or deflected
4188391 bella and edward are no longer in high school theyre dealing with grown up family problems not teen problems when young readers were reading about people they could relate to in the earlier books they were willing to ignore the way so many characters roll their eyes chuckle and snore the improbabilities regarding plot and the scenes that went on way too long but bella becomes matronly in breaking dawn and edward seems as if he ought to be out playing golf

4188405 in talks about making cars cleaner and more fuel efficient with engineers here ive asked whether a small turbine turning at a constant rate wouldnt be an ideal way to power the generator of an electric motor driven car alas the noise high rpm and heat are still expensive problems and turbines small enough to serve such a purpose are prohibitively expensive compared to existing alternatives such as small diesels
4188406 perhaps the biggest drawback is in fuel economy even though the engine itself is relatively efficient it operates at a high rpm even while at idle
4188407 dont anybody mention the word turbine here we have no idea what caused this car to blow up spilled fuel maybe it has nothing to do with the turbine powered car visiting in town

4188411 the swift boat attacks were simply revelation of the truth the similarity does not exist here
4188412 one was about laying out the truth this one is about attempting to cast a new shadow on john mccain
4188413 i think that the pro life position is one of the important aspects or fundamentals of the republican party
4188414 and i also feel that and im not trying to equivocate here that americans want us to work together you know former pennsylvania governor tom ridge is one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro choice and i dont think that that would necessarily rule tom ridge out
4188415 i think its a fundamental tenet of our party to be pro life but that does not mean we exclude people from our party that are pro choice we just have a albeit strong but just its a disagreement and i think ridge is a great example of that far more so than new york city mayor michael bloomberg because bloomberg is pro gay rights pro you know a number of other issues
4188416 a chart or table that represents the semantic mapping of fields or data elements in one data standard to fields or data elements in another standard that has a similar function or meaning crosswalks enable heterogeneous databases to be searched simultaneously with a single query as if they were a single database semantic interoperability and to effectively convert data from one metadata standard to another see also metadata mapping below also known as field mapping

4188420 metadata is expected to follow existing and emerging standards in order to facilitate integrated access to multiple information providers over the web
4188421 and it is rare that the requirements of a particular project or site can all be met by any one standard straight from the box
4188422 how the components of a dublin core application profile relate to domain standards models and specifications in broader use by communities and to the w3c standard resource description framework rdf the default foundation for machine processable semantics in our time
4188423 description set profiles are based on the dcmi abstract model dcam inasmuch they specify how the entities of the dcam are used in a specific set of metadata in this sense the dcam constitutes a broadly recognized model of the structural components of metadata records the dcam in turn is grounded in rdf
4188424 description set profiles typically use properties and classes defined in standard metadata vocabularies such as the dcmi metadata terms metadata vocabularies in turn are expressed on the basis of the rdf vocabulary description language also known as rdf schema or rdfs
4188425 this is a really important reason to try and move aps up the stack to the community or domain level instead of just at the project level
4188426 when do we bring you into a project and why

4188433 streetcar is definitely going to create a reason for young people to come downtown
4188434 thats very evident in places like san francisco which never got rid of its streetcar system
4188435 it looks like its going to take you somewhere but its only designed to support downtown residents
4188436 if officials fall for the hype and dont ask the hard questions voters should vote them out
4188437 one happy consequence will be that streetcar customers who live in the area will be less mobile by choice
4188438 in years gone by people would move to cities to get a job
4188439 today young educated workers move to cities with a sense of place and if businesses see us laying rail down on a street theyll know thats a permanent route that will have people passing by seven days a week

4188479 the better the product the less time it takes to demo if your product demo takes more than five minutes to demo it probably sucks all the tiny little features that matter to you are of course important god is in the details however when presenting your company you dont have to show them
4188480 steve jobs does take the demo details to a fairly detailed level but you and i are not steve jobs there is only one steve jobs and there is only one apple youre never going to build something as cool as steve and as such there is no need for you to talk about your product for five or ten minutes
4188481 folks should be either blown away or intrigued by your core product if they are not somewhere in that spectrum you need to rebuild your core product
4188482 all that inner thinking is chaos when you try to explain it to another person its pure madness after 60 seconds of talking the best thing to do is answer the question with the most concise answer
4188483 hmmm thats a good question let me think about that for a second
4188484 im not really sure im going to have to think about that for a bit and get back to you
4188485 im not sure to be honest what do you think
4188486 ive never really considered that perhaps you can expand the question a little and we can explore it right now
4188487 im not sure how we would deal with a sudden spike in the cost of bandwidth we would have to collect more information and answer that question down the road
4188488 esto es una ruta que normalmente se transita por parte de los colombianos porque es m s r pida es m s segura y seguramente por tratarse de estas personas que dos son en uniforme el ej rcito venezolano est haciendo las averiguaciones correspondientes dijo padilla
4188489 los militares colombianos viajaban vestidos de civil y no portaban ning n tipo de armas los uniformes camuflados que les fueron decomisados los llevaban dentro de sus maletas
4188490 ma ma ma daughter of the mystic mountain you dance holding the brilliant gem of realization but when i try to grasp the diamond essence of awareness it appears to turn back into common stone
4188491 when they saw the courage of peter and john and realized that they were unschooled ordinary men they were astonished and they took note that these men had been with jesus
4188492 jesus is true and the principles found in his teachings work
4188493 es una pena porque como todo el mundo vio jefferson estaba en muy buen momento pero conf o en la fuerza del resto del equipo para superarlo
4188494 para un proceso normal de recuperaci n tenemos que calcular cuatro semanas
4188495 nuestro plantel es amplio tenemos otros delanteros y para ellos es una oportunidad
4188496 no volver a a presidir el forsur porque autoridades de ica fueron enemigos de la reconstrucci n
4188497 im sorry but i dont support this war this president and i dont support the military industrial complex
4188498 then you can blow them out your ass i am not propagandizing this war
4188499 the future of america is epitomized by the young people today they are basically the melting pot we are going to see in the future
4188500 oooh well second hand smoke kills didnt you know i dont want to be breathing that shit in while consuming copious amounts of the health promoting wonder drug jose cuervo and eating chicken wings fried in synthetic whale blubber with a side of processed ranch dressing im trying to keep young and virile here

4188504 you know youre shredding up your lungs right you know thats going to kill you right my dad died of cancer
4188505 after months of hard work in the studio we finally have the master version of our new album entitled dystopia
4188506 we are all very stoked by the new album as we feel that this is the best release weve ever done and were impatient to share our songs with our fans
4188507 were now ready to hit back the road starting with canadian summer slaughter
4188508 well then be on tour in the us with necrophagist and back again in the us with suicide silence and dillinger escape plan and we cannot wait to both play the new songs live and come back to the united states after a long time staying in canada
4188509 i still have a lot to learn as well so as to become a man who wont be manipulated by corrupting temptations to not let myself get stolen by tv cinema music books sports sake tobacco habits common sense traditions religions culture i have so much to learn
4188510 youre doing a lot of fiddling around on this one
4188511 have you read the specification on this person fire fighters have to be able to go for hours fighting fires or tending to a person that the usual everyday person would never touch while putting in the back of their minds the circumstances they have to be able to move at a seconds notice and not think twice of what they are about to do no matter what danger they have to be in top physical condition at all times running on half eaten meals and they must have six pairs of hands
4188512 its the three pairs of eyes a fire fighter has to have
4188513 one pair to see through the fire and where they and their fellow fire fighters should fight the fire next another pair here in the side of the head to see their fellow fire fighters and keep them safe and another pair of eyes in the front so that they can look for the victims caught in the fire who need their help
4188514 i already have a model that can carry a 250 pound man down a flight of stairs to safety from a burning building and can feed a family of five on a civil service paycheck
4188515 they can tell you the elements of a hundred fires and can recite procedures in their sleep that are needed to care for a person until they reach the hospital and all the while they have to keep their wits about them fire fighters also have phenomenal personal control they can deal with a scene full of pain and hurt coaxing a childs mother into letting go of the child so that they can care for the child in need and still they rarely get the recognition for a job well done from anybody other than from fellow fire fighters
4188516 its a tear from bottled up emotions for fallen comrades a tear for commitment to that funny piece of cloth called the american flag its a tear for all the pain and suffering they have encountered and its a tear for their commitment to caring for and saving lives of their fellow man
4188517 a broad multiclass multiracial movement is converging around obamas hope change and unity campaign because they see in it the thrilling opportunity to end 30 years of ultra right rule and move the nation forward with a progressive movement
4188518 one thing is clear none of the peoples struggles from peace to universal healthcare to an economy that puts main street before wall street will advance if mccain wins in november lets keep our eyes on the prize
4188519 this is the way cpusa works they basically try to hitch a ride on the latest left wing vehicle and hope it gets them somewhere it doesnt surprise me in the least
4188520 i think the bigger danger is what this tells us in terms of foreign policy more than anything else because the cpusa has been very consistently opposed to anything that advances american interests
4188521 actually i could have taken you any day of the week but i thought this medal matched my dress better
4188522 let us make man in our image according to our likeness let them have dominion over the fish of the sea over the birds of the air and over the cattle over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth

4188528 i heard your voice in the garden and i was afraid because i was naked and i hid myself

4188560 2 and she came to jerusalem with a very great train with camels that bear spices and very much gold and precious stones and when she was come to solomon she communed with him of all that was in her heart
4188561 she gave the king 120 talents of gold and of spices very great store and precious stones there came no more such abundance of spices as these which the queen of sheba gave to king solomon
4188562 it was covered with silken carpets adorned with fringes of gold and silver and studded with diamonds and pearls

4188568 in order to avoid last minute moves you should look down the road 10 to 15 seconds ahead of your vehicle a driver needs to look that far ahead to see hazards early constantly staring at the road just in front of your car is dangerous
4188569 if you look ahead you will be able to see important things that you cant see later on such as someone getting into a parked car an animal on the rampage or a small child running toward your vehicle

4188591 a nation that is afraid to let its people judge the truth and falsehood in an open market is a nation that is afraid of its people
4188592 the three parties are unable to reach a consensus on islam indeed we have differences which should be overcome before they break up the coalition we cannot depend on others in the long term we found that we obtained a lot of support from non muslims in the march 8 general election this is one reason why we did very well this time it is beyond our expectations
4188593 pas will not hesitate to leave pr if the number of non muslim mps in pr exceeds that of muslim mps as a result of defections from bn pas will not be part of the pr central government if the party cannot get any benefit by remaining in the coalition
4188594 some say dont mention islamic country if we want the support of non muslims now we have to talk about caring state to the extent of some preventing president datuk seri abdul hadi awang from talking about islamic country
4188595 is pas willing to join the government to be formed if its president becomes a mere youth minister and the role of ulama is just to issue fatwa and they are treated like a clog to be used only when a fatwa is required
4188596 why is hadi not mentioned as a leader who should get recognition where is the ulama leadership slogan
4188597 some are loyal to the pr colleagues and follow the instructions and voices of pr colleagues but do not heed the directives of the pas leadership when they are with pr they lose their voice for the islamic country struggle as though fearing that the non muslims will be uncomfortable
4188598 we should not be too engrossed to demolishing the umno old jahiliyah government on sept 16 and replacing it with a new jahiliyah government which realises the interests of outsiders like america
4188599 we should not forget that for 16 years anwar had become an obstacle to pas resurgence in the country some say we should not dig up the past but we should also look back once a while as we move forward
4188600 our original struggle is islam but now some have separated politics from religion some say the quran is the quran and politics is politics should we bring these people forward we should not sacrifice the struggle for self interest

4188619 there was something about this story that i felt so personally committed to
4188620 ive always had a lot of respect for average working people
4188621 bob wasnt an ordinary man he was probably a genius but as a person his lifestyle his family scale he was just an average guy so i felt like i understood that
4188622 whether you are bob kearns or ghandi or martin luther king if you go up against the forces you will pay
4188623 hes an addict in some ways he wants to give it up but he cant
4188624 i think they had a leg to stand on in a certain way
4188625 i think they thought we would have come up with this anyway based on the amount of time and energy and research and people we had on it
4188626 but i dont think they had come up with it yet and what bob kearns came up with whether or not it was the most revolutionary idea anyone ever had was bobs idea they were denying him his dignity
4188627 it shows that there is justice in the world that you cant steal something and get away with it

4188636 it is time for maldonado to take responsibility and reject this contribution if she fails to reject this contribution she is aiding and abetting this corrupt behavior

4188671 the first flight was a success and made the first in situ measurements of gases in a volcanic plume using meteorological balloons
4188672 with flight visualization using google earth we were looking at tropospheric volcanic emissions of sulfur dioxide carbon dioxide and water which can be hazardous to human and animal health and degrade ecosystems
4188673 we could count the rows of trees to find the balloon
4188674 we are fairly confident of three findings first this work is feasible for measuring sulfur dioxide so2 and carbon dioxide co2 in volcanic emissions for several hours after eruptions second there is a loss of so2 after one hour of flight away from the source which could reflect conversion to sulfate aerosol which may lower the earths temperature by reflecting away solar radiation and third there is a clear stratification of so2 above co2 within the plumes
4188675 one of the largest subdivisions in america is ocean view and it is downwind from the volcano on the west side of the island
4188676 we detected sulfur dioxide over the development several hours after it was erupted into the atmosphere

4188697 i love getting in the water and racing him i really do even when he does destroy me at certain points those memories are always in my head more than the good ones
4188698 we both like music different kinds of music we both like cars different kinds of cars
4188699 being on that bus for a month and a half we had a lot of fun
4188700 he was really starting to get into poker at the time so we played a lot of hands of poker there at the table on the bus i learned that hes far better than me at that and thats ok with me
4188701 for two years and now in my 20th trip to china weve gone through a lot of materials and a lot of training to get to this point
4188702 youre talking about a country not familiar with the game and when youre trying to make mlb quality fields its difficult
4188703 were talking about whats first base whats home plate when we first started second base was higher than the pitchers mound they drained it like a soccer pitch because thats what they were used to we said we dont do it that way water would have flowed across the mound to the plate
4188704 no doubt about it there was a big communications blip on learning the words what is the chinese word for batters box for home plate
4188705 i first came here in october 06 and then came maintenance training for the volunteers
4188706 out of the more than one hundred volunteers maybe 10 of them can actually throw a baseball theyre volunteering because its the olympics youre starting from square one
4188707 we got some great riviera bermuda seed donated from the usa
4188708 and then just this past friday we got 35 tons of diamond pro soil conditioner it came on a slow boat to china literally it arrived the day of the first practice you have to put it on for the stability of this clay
4188709 the mound material had to be shipped from san diego the mound and home plate clay is the same as on petco park
4188710 its beautiful theyve done a heck of a job to make these big league fields
4188711 ive been in a lot of venues and this is first class all the way i tip my hat to the chinese
4188712 were winning and the big league team is winning so that usually makes everything go ok
4188713 the most important thing is that we won a lot of games that season
4188714 unfortunately there wasnt a wild card back then because i think we would have been in the playoffs that year if there was
4188715 but that was a great year i got to play with two hall of famers that year which was a great experience and i still have a lot of friends from that team
4188716 ive been with the cubs for nine years now and i love every minute of it
4188717 i was real happy for bruce when it happened for him and to be able to do that and step in for the last 50 or so games of that season was a great experience
4188718 that was fun the guys had a lot to be proud of last year
4188719 it was good to get in the playoffs and even though we lost it was a good experience some of those players made it to the big leagues last season too
4188720 sammy fuld jake fox and guys like that were able to make it to the big club and help them out last september so that was nice too
4188721 if it happens it would be great i would love to manage in the big leagues i love my job now you really have to do things the right way and enjoy it
4188722 to manage in the big leagues you have to be extremely lucky and good at what you do you are trying to be one of only 30 people in the world to manage a big league club its a dream job
4188723 i made good friends with a lot of people there in milwaukee the fans are always great to me
4188724 i watched the last four games and im really happy that their fans are there to support them they have a good young team and im happy for those fans

4188729 it was a charity that when i was playing i quietly just supported
4188730 its a very successful charity that does great things for kids that wouldnt normally get the attention
4188731 nobody will ever take away the fact that i was an oriole
4188732 it was a sad day when i got traded but thats just the way it was when i got traded out it was really getting traded home but that does not remove the fact that im an oriole
4188733 when i come back its a great great feeling because i love to see how things have changed the city of baltimore has just had a great turnaround in 1973 i was at the groundbreaking for the inner harbor itself and then when i keep coming back and i see whats happened in those years its great and although it was stressful nobody can ever take away that i replaced brooks robinson and i did it and i did it as an oriole
4188734 theyve definitely been asking for a major league contract for quite some time i think weve tried to look at it both ways and thats what weve done were close and weve jumped some hurdles in the last 48 hours hopefully well continue to do that until we get something done but were not there yet
4188735 all i can say at this point is that the contract discussions are on going
4188736 until we get a deal i dont have any relief
4188737 i think you have to when youve gone this far
4188738 fortunately wed be taking the fifth pick in the country and we wouldnt be getting the 35th pick its a lot more palatable now than it was a few years ago prior to the last cba

4188742 now russias defeat of georgian forces who tried to retake the breakaway region of south ossetia and its backing of rebels who pushed georgian troops out of abkhazia will make it even less likely georgia will lift its opposition to russian membership in the world trading body
4188743 i cherish the great people i worked with at apple and i am proud of my contributions to its historic turnaround and current success
4188744 with this lawsuit behind me i look forward to addressing the greater challenges of social justice and economic disparity
4188745 one thing important about this case was that it involved a general counsel who fabricated corporate documents to conceal the fraud
4188746 thats the type of conduct the commission takes very seriously
4188747 gee somebody should compile all these great ideas and resources into a book
4188748 utterly failed to keep pace with the cost of living to support pensioners
4188749 our pensioner population should be entitled to retire with dignity and without the need to apply for means tested benefits
4188750 we used to have the best company pension provision in europe but we are seeing that dwindling
4188751 we are going to slip down the table as more employers switch from generous defined benefit pensions to less generous types of pension
4188752 the pressure is definitely downwards there is little chance of britain going up the rankings
4188753 the key risk for countries such as the uk is that companies are withdrawing defined benefit schemes because of the rapid rise in the costs of such schemes
4188754 by restoring the link to earnings and modernising the contributory principle we will make the state pension much more generous and fairer to women and carers
4188755 if the uk government can pay pensions to some expats abroad then they should pay indexed pensions to them all

4188762 we can begin to see how it is almost impossible to cultivate positive attitudes and beliefs when we are stuck in survival mode our heart is not open our rational mind is disengaged our consciousness is focused on fear not love making clear choices and recognizing the consequences of those choices is unfeasible we are focused on short term survival not the long term consequences of our beliefs and choices when we are overwhelmed with excessive stress our life becomes a series of short term emergencies we lose the ability to relax and enjoy the moment we live from crisis to crisis with no relief in sight burnout is inevitable this burnout is what usually provides the motivation to change our lives for the better we are propelled to step back and look at the big picture of our lives forcing us to examine our beliefs our values and our goals

4188784 eventually all novelists if they persist too long get worse writing great fiction involves some combination of energy and imagination that cannot be energized or realized forever strong talents can simply exhaust their gift and they do
4188785 the longer they deal and the more they know the better books they handle
4188786 today the sight that discourages book people most is to walk into a public library and see computers where books used to be in many cases not even the librarians want books to be there what consumers want now is information and information increasingly comes from computers
4188787 a bookmans love of books is a love of books not merely of the information in them
4188788 that is to say i collect hardly anything that is collectible not a thing anyone else would wish to collect
4188789 collecting is a way of linking past present and future objects from the past get collected in the present to preserve them for the future collecting processes present meanwhile articulating the mysteries of desire what people wanted and did not want drives what collectors want and do not want in anticipation of what future collectors will want or not want the mathematical formula connecting these equations of desire is mysterious and difficult but all collectors engage in such calculations usable things sometimes become collectible but collectible things rarely become usable
4188790 collecting is a constant reassertion of the power to own an exercise in controlling otherness and finally a kind of monument building to insure survival after death for this reason you can often read the collector in his or her collection if not in the objects themselves then in the business of acquiring maintaining and displaying them to collect is to write a life
4188791 the lessons of the collections is that collecting is not all pathology indeed collecting can come very close to what is involved in the making of art
4188792 my refuge from the present as from the past is collecting
4188793 none of my forgeries were to my knowledge ever subjected to any kind of scientific testing
4188794 the letters imputed to all the other celebrities were based on biographical data gleaned from various sources but the initial inspiration was always the discovery of an ur letter that i came across in my archival meanderings
4188795 my guilt over the original thefts is mitigated somewhat by the gathering in of the epistolary diaspora i cooperated with the fbi and the real letters of the drunken american writers were so far as i know all recovered and returned safely to their archival homes

4188813 las nuevas reglas son la consecuencia de un s ndrome de causa y efecto creado por unos pocos est pidos que desafortunadamente ha desacreditado la contribuci n silenciosa y sustancial hecha por muchos en la comunidad de grupos de la sociedad civil

4188825 aparte de ser una pesadilla log stica la principal preocupaci n que tienen muchos es c mo todas estas importantes y planificadas puestas a punto del edificio impactar n en el trabajo sustancial del organismo mundial particularmente su agenda de reformas y los objetivos de desarrollo del milenio
4188826 con considerable alteraci n anticipada de incluso el trabajo normal del personal que ser alojado en varios espacios rotativos el muy necesario liderazgo de la sede se ver seriamente restringido a medida que se acerca 2015 el a o fijado para cumplir los objetivos del milenio
4188827 puede usted imaginarse c mo una organizaci n con m s de 4 000 funcionarios desparramados por toda la ciudad podr a manejar de modo efectivo incluso parcial su responsabilidad de alto perfil para lograr estos objetivos
4188828 no conozco los detalles de la renovaci n y c mo se realizar pero tengo la impresi n de que ser un gran dolor de cabeza para todos incluyendo por supuesto a las organizaciones no gubernamentales
4188829 esto es principalmente no por mala planificaci n por parte de la onu seg n entiendo sino porque hay una enorme cantidad de trabajo de construcci n por hacer y es trabajo que ha sido postergado por mucho tiempo
4188830 el proyecto cumpli con un nivel de consideraci n para explosiones que volver al edificio muy seguro
4188831 es bueno que el trabajo real para eso haya comenzado ahora espero que el llamado capital master plan pueda mantener su marco de tiempo para completar las obras dentro de los pr ximos cinco a os
4188832 pienso que eso es poco pr ctico y poco realista
4188833 pero desafortunadamente ese rechazo ocurri cuando la onu se echaba atr s del esc ndalo de el programa petr leo por alimentos en iraq y mientras las relaciones de la onu con los legisladores del estado de nueva york estaban en su punto m s bajo
4188834 puede ser que los cr ticos digan que la alteraci n del trabajo de la onu no ser a notado en absoluto dada la agenda minimalista que ahora se persigue

4188858 so whaddaya think i say saakashvili is going to restore the territorial integrity of georgia five minutes before the opening ceremony starts in beijing and dare the russians to invade while the games are on
4188859 i said nothing about the possible russian response but if you had asked me i would say that moscow could not have taken it lying down
4188860 certainly the next white house will not be as supportive of saakashvili as this one and so if saakashvili wanted to reunite georgia he really had to do it this year and he was probably hoping the olympic games gave him the right cover

4188877 one of the things we learned with the sox is youve got to get the web community the bloggers to have an opinion and to comment
4188878 the bears wanted to remind everybody that there is a devout following for this team but its not just this team its your neighbors its your city
4188879 youre passionate about your team youre passionate about what you do for a living and youre passionate about your city
4188880 it was nowhere near as brand related as this was
4188881 this might not be something we have to do every year were obviously very fortunate where were not in need of selling tickets but that doesnt mean we still dont have an opportunity to strengthen the connection with our fan base
4188882 obviously there are a lot of people out there sending out messages about the bears that we have no control over so we wanted to make sure we were part of that conversation as well

4188904 thats shocking the academic debate is between some who say that junior enlisted ranks lean slightly republican and some who say its about equal but no one would point to six to one

4188933 for years the georgian government has failed to engage seriously with the needs and interests of its secessionist regions

4188951 omnivex initially started working with umbc in nov 07 but the installation did not really start to take shape until april 08
4188952 the project is ongoing and will expand over time as more information and capability is added to the system and expanded to other areas umbc designed its installation on a platform that gave it a strong base to build on for the future
4188953 omnivex has been very active in transportation with airports ferries buses and terminals but this is the first system that we have installed on moving trains
4188954 another major hurdle in this installation was network connectivity cellular communications was the best way to go but the network had to accommodate limitations in bandwidth transfer speeds and switching between towers since the train travels at high speed the player must be able to operate in a disconnected state for periods of time without any loss of performance to the viewer

4188977 basically we are simplifying and coalescing our efforts around atom as the single brand for internet devices
4188978 if an independent software vendor discovers that they have shipped a vulnerable activex control they should e mail us to work with microsoft to issue a kill bit disabling that control
4188979 this is right in line with microsofts presentation at black hat
4188980 they said many times that they are working as a coalition to better secure the windows operating system and everything which runs on it
4188981 while microsoft has issued a few kill bits in the past for third party products this is something we are going to continue to see going forward
4188982 you may reassign a software license but not on a short term basis i e not within 90 days of the last assignment
4188983 technically the virtual machine would have to remain on the same physical machine for three months
4188984 within a few months were going to see those changes
4188985 virtualization licensing and support lethargy curing the disease that stalls virtualization adoption
4188986 allowing standard edition windows server os licenses to be assigned directly to a vm and move with a vm without restriction is all that is needed for microsoft to offer the most nearly ideal licensing terms
4188987 vendors are working hard to come up with schemas that work well and are fair to them and the end customer
4188988 youve got the ability to spin up additional virtual machines as your processing demands increase
4188989 the difficulty with software licensing is how you keep track of how many virtual machines how many applications or how many iterations of the operating system youre running at any time its an interesting can of worms
4188990 its very inconvenient well probably have to address the issue at some point
4188991 there are still vendors who have no clearly defined licensing policy for virtual environments
4188992 you have to pay for all available cpus on a physical server
4188993 we have an enterprise site license for oracle so its not really an issue
4188994 as you start to deploy virtual machines you are deploying more operating systems that need to be licensed and metered
4188995 every time you tell your systems management tool that you want to spin up a new virtual machine all of a sudden youre deploying operating system and application licenses to people whether you like it or not
4188996 it would be really nice if we could just have a very simple licensing model thats not the case today
4188997 vendors are honestly trying to do the right thing here
4188998 the trick for them is to develop a model that is fair to them and protects their revenues is fair to their clients and is something thats going to be able to last for a few years they dont like to have to change licensing models on a whim
4188999 its a testament to the hard work and talent of the whole team looking to the future were keen to increase this lead further especially with the number of exciting games leading up to christmas and our now solid online presence thanks to x360s website and podcast

4189008 there was a desire on both sides to find a conclusion to this issue
4189009 this is a very important agreement this turns a new page in our relationship
4189010 this agreement signed today is designed to resolve the last major historical issue that has stood in the way of a more normal relationship between our two countries
4189011 under this agreement each countrys citizens can receive fair compensation for past incidents when fulfilled the agreement will permit libya and the us to develop their relations
4189012 the important role libya is playing internationally and expressed his hope that cooperation between the two countries would continue
4189013 warmly welcomed and strongly supports the application for anti trust immunity
4189014 anti trust immunity between oneworlds transatlantic partners would enable them to unlock even more of oneworlds potential enabling us to operate under the same rules as our alliance competitors
4189015 expand customer choice by supporting routes that would not be economically viable for the individual airlines
4189016 the joint business agreement will enable the airlines to reduce costs and attract new customers helping to mitigate pressure on fares from record fuel costs
4189017 this means that the airlines will have greater ability to invest in their products services and fleets employees and shareholders will also benefit from the agreement
4189018 there is no reason why fares should rise if this agreement is approved
4189019 make no mistake if this monster monopoly is approved it will be third time unlucky for consumers
4189020 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis

4189024 its by far the riskiest player in the auto industry at the moment
4189025 if you consider its difficult financial situation that it barely escaped bankruptcy and that it still faces that risk for at least the next two years and given the difficult market conditions chrysler is really in the third class league
4189026 its difficult to see how fiat could benefit from a tie up with chrysler fiat specializes in small cars and chrysler sells trucks their platforms wont match
4189027 fiat has launched new attractive car models and expanded into emerging markets

4189054 max is a promising young player who has done very well for us since i arrived at the club
4189055 we have fended off a 400 000 bid from one of our league one rivals for clive and he has now committed himself to our club by signing a new improved and extended contract
4189056 within our means we are doing all we can to attract the very best players and staff to colchester
4189057 he has pace which is a tremendous asset and will certainly give us an option
4189058 i have no idea where that story has come from
4189059 no one has approached us about paul konchesky because it is pretty obvious to everyone we are not interested in the slightest bit about selling paul konchesky
4189060 and if i was paul konchesky i would be very sad to see my name linked with a 2m transfer when i am a player who is worth a lot more than that
4189061 god only knows where that has come from there must be a reason for it someone must have an agenda and is using pauls name to further it
4189062 paul konchesky is not for sale he is our star left back
4189063 his name has never even been mentioned in the eight months i have been at this club
4189064 to be perfectly honest i had forgotten he existed i have no idea where he plays
4189065 one law firm informed us they saved 6000 per month plus the stress level is lower because there are fewer delays and errors in processing paperwork acrobat and adobe reader software are ideal for government agencies that want to streamline document processes by using electronic forms and digital signatures

4189068 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4189069 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4189070 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4189071 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4189072 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4189073 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4189074 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4189075 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4189076 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4189077 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4189078 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4189079 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4189080 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4189081 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4189082 and get deeper into more deals our brand is not as well known so we dont do as many deals but we can go head to head with these companies we compete well with them if we can get to the table with a customer our win ratio is 65 to 70
4189083 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4189084 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4189085 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4189086 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4189087 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4189088 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4189089 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
4189090 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
4189091 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
4189092 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
4189093 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
4189094 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
4189095 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
4189096 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
4189097 the goal of 100 mpge can be achieved very easily with hydrogen
4189098 one kilo of hydrogen has roughly the same btu content as a gallon of gasoline yet a kilo of h2 will take a vehicle about twice as far as a gallon of gasoline
4189099 because it was forced on the manufacturers they did not do a very good job of implementing the technology it just wasnt done right
4189100 the multi fuel concept is simple and works within todays infrastructure while creating the demand for more clean fuel infrastructure
4189101 when youre one step ahead of the crowd youre a genius when youre two steps ahead youre a crackpot
4189102 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4189103 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4189104 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4189105 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4189106 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4189107 go on houston just take the runs give them back or dont we dont care
4189108 we were looking forward to just relaxing because the year leading up to a wedding can be pretty exhausting but there was no rest for the wicked

4189110 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4189111 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4189112 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4189113 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4189114 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4189115 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4189116 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4189117 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4189118 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
4189119 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
4189120 coolearthsolar com has a patented idea for inflatable solar collectors that are much cheaper than polished mirrors to concentrate sunlight onto photovoltaic chips their design is 400x cheaper than polished aluminum mirrors will withstand 130 mph winds lasts a year repairs with tape takes 15 minutes to change out costs 2 per balloon or 18 cents per watt compared to 5 per watt for conventional installations and has a minimal effect on the ground underneath the array
4189121 our phase ii system will cost us 18 cents watt for materials 29 cents watt installed in a large solar farm compared with 5 w for conventional solar installations
4189122 our goal is to cut the cost of solar electricity to a price that is truly competitive with coal and other non renewable sources while generating profits for our users on par with todays best investments
4189123 when youre one step ahead of the crowd youre a genius
4189124 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4189125 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4189126 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4189127 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4189128 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4189129 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4189130 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4189131 who are open to doing something on the production side
4189132 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4189133 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4189134 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4189135 those rumors are just rumors and i dont think theyre going to stop no matter how many times i say no its not happening because somebody will say he said yes his eyes said yes his nose said yes there was a yes iness about him because people want it

4189146 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
4189147 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
4189148 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4189149 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4189150 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas

4189157 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4189158 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country

4189160 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4189161 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4189162 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4189163 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4189164 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4189165 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4189166 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4189167 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4189168 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4189169 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4189170 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4189171 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4189172 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4189173 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4189174 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4189175 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4189176 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4189177 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4189178 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4189179 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4189180 if they did surely the automobile manufacturers would be taking notice an implementing them into their vehicles for a competitive edge in the marketplace
4189181 when deciding on the publishers choice vehicle we often look for a car that symbolizes where the luxury and exotic market is headed the scorpion provides environmentally conscious consumers with a car that has the stand out design and performance of an exotic car but keeps carbon footprints at a minimum

4189187 quem revendo o antigo aprende o novo pode ser considerado mestre
4189188 before i entered college and earned a bs bachelor of science in engineering i was taking electrolytic capacitors and mounting them to the plus side of a distributor which would smooth out the electrical pulses going to the distributor and the spark plugs
4189189 i have an electrical background thats very heavily into automotive applications i have an extreme sensitivity to mechanical noise i can listen to an engine running and tell exactly whats wrong with it my hearing is so keen that when i worked at general motors they sent me to mexico and to germany and new york to fix engine assembly plants when i went to new york they were having problems with engines going in the repair loop so i looked at what they were doing thought a while then made changes to 22 machines and got the engine plant running faster than design intent the plant manager offered me a job right on the spot
4189190 after 30 years consulting for champion i have never seen a spark plug fire like yours you are going to turn the automotive industry on its ear
4189191 i was brought up by the nos nitrous oxide systems racing guys in california their theory was a spark plug either works or it doesnt and there is no in between after a lot of investigation i essentially found out that there was something special about spark plugs
4189192 during this time i went through a 55 gallon drum full of grimy used spark plugs
4189193 thats when i thought if thats what the spark plug wants to be then why not start off with that shape and see what it does
4189194 when i put a half a loop on the grounding side it seemed to fire a little better
4189195 but i was inspired to do this because i just knew there had to be a better way thats why spark plug companies hate me theyve got millions and millions of dollars tied up in research departments and i was able to come up with the firestorm prototype in my basement in just under two hours
4189196 if there is a vehicle that requires premium fuel and they install firestorm plugs and perform the modifications i suggest they could run regular fuel in the engine and it wont detonate hesitate ping or misfire the only reason you need higher octane fuel is for higher compression engines and if an engine is pulling a heavy load it has a tendency to go into detonation with a regular spark plug
4189197 i know it sounds like smoke and mirrors but this has all been documented when i was doing some of the early testing on this i hooked up an emissions analyser to the car and i had equipment in the car while changing air fuel ratios and idle speeds i was doing this at an automotive aftermarket speed shop the guys were coming over to see what i was doing i had the test vehicle running at 250 rpm engines do not like to idle at 250 rpm you cant do that with a regular spark plug but you can do it with the firestorm plug
4189198 it just loped along really smooth but it was constant no hesitation no misfires and when
4189199 the other amazing thing i discovered while testing the firestorm plug was that an engine can run further out in the rpm range in other words when they reach extremely high speeds the power curve starts falling off
4189200 bottom line i can pull more rpm and power out of an engine and still deliver better fuel economy because even at extremely high speeds of operation the firestorm plugs still produce plasma that burns all the fuel in the combustion chamber a regular plug with its itty bitty little spark can never fire well in a combustion chamber thats running at high speed that size spark cant keep up with the increased speed flow of air fuel mixture
4189201 i have coined the term residual ionisation to describe the effect of the firing of the firestorm spark plug
4189202 there is also residual ionisation left over in a firestorm spark plug however because of the huge surface area in the configuration of the domed centre electrode and the triaxial ground system when the residual ionisation rears its ugly head the charge coming down the centre electrode sees it and moves to the next area under the triaxial ground system that is residual ionisation free thats why the plasma appears to move around the dome in a circular motion
4189203 bosch conducted an eight week long durability test of my firestorm plugs against their best and they said that the firestorm plugs produced zero per cent gap growth and they predicted that the plugs will never wear out
4189204 what we did was sit down and decide what the best configuration was for firing then we set that aside and for the next seven months we designed knock offs and incorporated every one of them into the patent
4189205 well we would have to sit down and talk about the details and see what they want and work out a deal that everyone agrees on and no matter whos going to be involved i would like to be in charge of the quality control end of the manufacturing because if you dont make it right then its like shooting yourself in the foot before a race
4189206 i tell people i took the lowly spark plug from the stone age to the space age
4189207 now i know how you are running less throttle and getting the same speed youre producing ozone
4189208 after my 30 years consulting for champion i have never seen a spark plug fire like yours you are going to turn the auto industry on its ear

4189210 now if somebody wants to sue us they have an option to sue but im fairly certain that a judge will see it the way the way the citizens see it here

4189262 whats barack obamas energy solution nothing but a bunch of hot air really
4189263 barack obama wants you to inflate your car tires yes thats right inflate your tires thats barack obamas solution to the high gas prices we pay in new mexico every day
4189264 this is the same barack obama who told a crowd of wealthy san francisco liberals that people who live in small towns cling to their religion and guns because theyre bitter
4189265 now he opposes producing more oil and gas here at home and opposes lowering your gas tax this summer
4189266 we could save all the oil theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups
4189267 now he opposes producing more oil and gas here at home
4189268 largest selection and variety of tools in the united states for filling tires and checking tire pressure
4189269 if john mccain put more money into s s then he should get more money out that is completely fair
4189270 and in the same election thank you for this miracle diebold
4189271 strife between negotiators for sen hillary clinton and sen barack obama are exaggerated and the two sides are nearing an agreement on how clintons delegates will participate in the formal nominating process at the democratic national convention according to advisers to both democrats
4189272 just buy an suv and itll save you lots of money on gas
4189273 that people want to feel like o k its a catharsis were here we did it and then everybody get behind senator obama that is what most people believe is the best way to go
4189274 as relatively free of acrimony obamas convention managers and his political are acutely aware of the fact that at least 45 percent of delegates were stalwart backers of sen clinton during the primary
4189275 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
4189276 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
4189277 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
4189278 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
4189279 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
4189280 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
4189281 hed be a good man on a boat during a storm
4189282 obama does better against mccain with hunters and especially fisherpeople than did his two democratic predecessors vis a vis bush
4189283 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
4189284 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
4189285 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
4189286 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
4189287 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
4189288 just so you all know we did set a record
4189289 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
4189290 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
4189291 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
4189292 many of us are motivated by a deep disgust with and distrust of the dnc leadership
4189293 there will be no unity in the democratic party until the voices of the 18 million voters who support hillary clinton are heard and heeded until the voices of pumas are once again listened to by the leadership of the democratic party we will be guided by that defiance we will not be bullied brainwashed or bossed into falling in line
4189294 i woke up that morning and said holy smoke theyre not even gonna let her run and compete the obama campaign is gonna sit back and take the benefits of that crap from msnbcs mike barnicle and chris matthews and tucker carlson and maureen dowd and howard dean thats what did it for me
4189295 our goal is to get the dnc to follow the process and let the delegates vote for her nomination
4189296 theres a big difference between a hope and a goal
4189297 as he body surfs in hawaii media reports examine why obama
4189298 democratic presidential contender barack obama stepped off the campaign trail and into the hawaiian surf this weekend joking im going to go body surfing at an undisclosed location
4189299 as a kid in hawaii he said he surfed a little bit but was a kook
4189300 i can imagine a political campaign purged of all the current false assumptions and false pretenses a campaign in which on election day the voters went to the polls clearly informed that the choice between them was not between an angel and a devil a good man and a bad man but between two frank go getters the one perhaps excelling at beautiful and nonsensical words and the other at silent and prehensile deeds there would be in that choice something free candid and exhilarating the voter would make his selection in the full knowledge of all the facts as he makes his selection between two heads of cabbage or two evening papers or two brands of chewing tobacco
4189301 he is a mainstream democrat who will increase the influence of the public employee unions and the trial lawyers and the other special interests
4189302 if the gop were dogfood wed take it off the shelf
4189303 he also opposes school vouchers which the eas love him for
4189304 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
4189305 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
4189306 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
4189307 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
4189308 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
4189309 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
4189310 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
4189311 the russians have clearly overreacted but president saakashvili for some reason seems to think he has a hall pass from this administration i strongly suspect that scheunemann told saakashvili that the us would back his play
4189312 this isnt about how fast someone can download a full length movie
4189313 speed matters to our economy and our ability to remain competitive in a global marketplace rural development telemedicine and distance learning all rely on truly high speed universal networks
4189314 the test results demonstrate the critical need for the senate to pass s 1492 the broadband data improvement act to move the u s toward a national broadband policy
4189315 earlier this year the house of representatives passed a similar measure the broadband census of america act to support the collection of data about broadband deployment
4189316 construct an infrastructure with enough capacity for 10 mbps downstream and 1 mbps upstream by 2010
4189317 we are the only industrialized nation without a national policy to promote universal high speed internet access and it shows
4189318 most of our speed test users logged on with broadband connections such as dsl modem or fiber people with dial up connections didnt take the test because it took them too long so even these dismal statistics paint a rosier than reality picture of connection speeds across the country
4189319 well what right do you have to speak about them then
4189320 echo barack obamas call for a new economy with new energy
4189321 the vast expanses of glaciers massed on average 1 6 miles deep contain enough water to raise sea levels worldwide by 23 feet should they melt or otherwise slip into the ocean they would flood coastal capitals submerge tropical islands and generally redraw the worlds atlases the infusion of fresh water could slow or shut down the oceans currents plunging europe into bitter winter
4189322 this is distinctly alarmist and part of mr gores wake up call it is common ground that if greenland melted it would release this amount of water but only after and over millennia so that the armageddon scenario he depicts is not based on any scientific view
4189323 its going to be a whos who of the convention
4189324 the denver school of the arts in colorado pulls off the rare achievement of bringing 40 young people aged 14 17 on stage showing off some impressive performing skills and offering the audience a truly substantial and moving glimpse into the mind of the generation now trembling on the cusp of adulthood
4189325 you have to declare a party affiliation to vote in the primaries and that concerns me
4189326 are you afraid im going to register as a communist
4189327 a career legacy politician who fell hook line and sinker for the administrations case for a disastrous war and dragged much of our party with him would undermine both
4189328 i sort of remember looking at it and thinking someones got to do something about this
4189329 to my complete surprise and shock people were obeying my traffic signals
4189330 there were all kinds of impromptu block parties that happened all over the city restaurants did their best to accommodate their customers when something like a blackout occurs people generally are going to pitch together and help out everyone else it sounds kinda hokey but its the truth
4189331 the price of gasoline in the last year has had a bigger impact on peoples thoughts about conservation than the blackout
4189332 we never found in much of the research we had done that there was a direct connection between the big blackout and issues around using too much or too little energy
4189333 i think people are creatures of habit to some degree and i dont think theres any lingering effects in reduced consumption from the blackout
4189334 the individual customers out there i believe want to help
4189335 to me it was the blackout day that got me thinking more and more about the environment and everything ive been doing it was just amazing how much we could get done without electricity and we actually enjoyed having no power
4189336 there were a few things that wouldve been nice like having the hot water tank working but for everything else we became creative we started having fondue
4189337 it can be contagious if you know one person doing something then another is more likely to start doing it as well and so it creates a chain reaction
4189338 environmental problems have been ongoing for a very long time but now im seeing that people are taking it seriously and i think its only going to increase probably exponentially over the next little while
4189339 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
4189340 now you and i both know that theres a homophobia problem in the black community
4189341 blacks appear to be more likely than whites both to see homosexuality as wrong and to favor gay rights laws
4189342 with no close second the most supportive group for gays and lesbians
4189343 hes ready to take his fight down into the mud
4189344 asks a valid question of whether the relatively inexperienced obama is ready to lead
4189345 we all have a right to our own opinion including todd
4189346 oh ya i almost forgot to explain to carolyn and the others out there about
4189347 carolyn al is correct but it goes one step further mr weaver never intended to try and use the vi money for flood releif he wants to put a halt to anything to do with vision iowa and use the 5 8 million dollars that would have been the citys responsability and use it for flood releif
4189348 jb i forgot to mention that the speed limit on all trucks should be reduced to 45m
4189349 carolyn where to you get the idea that max wanted to use vi funds to aid flood victims

4189354 were going to carry bird baths and fountains and wind chimes bird seed grass seed annuals bushes trees kinda like siebenthalers
4189355 we want to offer more retail things to our existing customers to make it more of a one stop shop instead of lets go here then lets go to lowes then lets go to siebenthalers
4189356 what were trying to do as opposed to looking at the pessimistic way is to remain optimistic and grow our business through our customer base and offer better service
4189357 i think that were very conscientious of the customer service that we provide
4189358 ever since barack obama first ascended the national stage at the 2004 democratic convention pundits have been tripping over themselves to point out the difference between him and the average joe from the south side
4189359 he has no past he simply appears one day to help the white protagonist
4189360 colorblind barack obama would be the great black hope in the next presidential race if he were actually black
4189361 just as the negro friendly bill clinton had to gamble on retaining that base while reassuring whites that he knew how to keep blacks in line so mr obama has to reassure blacks he is unafraid to tell whites things that whites decidedly do not want to hear he didnt attain power through traditional black channels thats partially why whites can embrace him but blacks fear that one day hell go tiger woods on us and get all race transcendent

4189364 someone driving to work goes past a petrol station and sees petrol at a bargain price and thinks you beauty but when they drive home its gone up 10c a litre it makes people very angry
4189365 australians dont want that great volatility in prices but nor do they want to pay more for their petrol to do away with it
4189366 the government wants to see an end to the days when you drive past a petrol station in the morning and see a certain price and drive past in the afternoon and see a price 10c or 15c a litre higher
4189367 i just dont think its going to do what its meant to do
4189368 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
4189369 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
4189370 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
4189371 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
4189372 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
4189373 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
4189374 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
4189375 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
4189376 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
4189377 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
4189378 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
4189379 that doesnt meet my definition of a maverick you cant be a maverick when politically its important for you but not a maverick when it doesnt work for you
4189380 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
4189381 theres frustration there because theyre watching these childish ad campaigns and they know exactly how to answer it but theyre powerless to do so
4189382 could not be more clear between one candidate john mccain who has experience and has been tested in war and tried in peace and another candidate that has not between one candidate john mccain who has always put his country first worked across party lines to get things done and one candidate that has not between one candidate thats a talker and one candidate whos the leader america needs as our next president
4189383 clever negative advertising works that is reality the tactic meets with media and pundit disapproval and spawns accusations of negativity but the reality is that a clever negative ad can be devastatingly effective
4189384 they can buy a locomotive anyplace in the world they can buy it anyplace in the world but they buy it here because its the most fuel efficient and its the most environmentally sound and it requires the least maintenance
4189385 i want you and every american to tell the congress that when we start anew in january of 2009 lets sit down together republican and democrat libertarian vegetarian whoever it is lets sit down together and start working on these problems together and put our country first
4189386 now if youd just raise your hand we have some people with a microphone or if youd like to go back to work whichever
4189387 where did the internet come from besides al gore and by the way i have great respect for vice president gore
4189388 eighty four percent of the american people think that the countrys on the wrong track congress has a 9 percent approval rating now you get down to 9 percent youre down to paid staffers and blood relatives you cant get much lower than that
4189389 um call tom ridge to washington from whatever vacation he is taking and get him to work
4189390 who will be the next president of the united states
4189391 the most productive and most competitive worker in the world resides in the united states of america
4189392 drilling offshore isnt the answer either but its a bridge its an important bridge to exploit our own oil and natural gas reserves while were making this transition that we must make to energy independence
4189393 i liked what he had to say today i want to hear more of what hes going to do to solve our issues
4189394 its a very important thing to do in life vote for someone thats going to run your future
4189395 our 14 offices are part of a highly structured volunteer heavy plan to win in new hampshire
4189396 we are creating neighborhood teams with volunteers who are trained equipped and empowered to build a campaign organization in their own neighborhood
4189397 i think weve built on that grass roots effort from 2004
4189398 propensity to vote is in part based on enthusiasm but its more typically assessed using voting history and intention among other factors obviously for election outcomes all that matters is whether people vote not whether they do so enthusiastically a challenge for obama is to convert highly energized supporters there is currently an enthusiasm gap favoring obama into registered voters and then into actual voters
4189399 when youre talking about campaign funds they cant be used for personal use you cant use campaign funds to buy yachts or go out to barbados
4189400 friends can give gifts to people up to a certain limit beyond that its income to the recipient
4189401 whether its an in kind contribution if they were paying her for something that was not campaign work probably not
4189402 in countless public fora the bush administration has pledged its commitment to georgias territorial integrity that commitment has always been followed by the hope that all potential conflicts would be resolved peacefully administration officials insist that in private conversations at the highest levels they have told the georgians that their commitment did not include military intervention on georgias behalf and say they have repeatedly urged the georgians not to provoke the russian bear but this stance gives rise to a question at natos most recent summit the administration pushed very hard to grant georgia a place on the initial rung of the ladder toward nato membership european governments blocked that attempt but u s remains committed to getting georgia into the atlantic alliance the definition of nato membership of course is a mutual defense commitment an attack on one equals an attack on all are we ready to go into battle against russia to defend georgia in nato
4189403 this question has gotten pretty heavy coverage over the past week
4189404 massachusetts will lead the way in reducing the emissions that threaten the planet with climate change
4189405 yes i am saying and it is true that georgia had the legal and morally justifiable right to use force and launch attacks to preserve their union
4189406 tbilisi georgia it was a claim that could have provoked a dangerous kremlin response the united states is readying to take over airports and ports in the former soviet republic of georgia the claim by u s backed georgia president mikhail saakashvili on wednesday was swiftly shot down by officials in washington who denied any such designs on georgian soil yet it was the latest in a string of overstated pronouncements by the american educated georgian leader that are further fueling tensions with moscow
4189407 georgian officials said the russians had looted and bombed gori before they left moscow denied the accusation but it appeared to be on a technicality a bbc reporter in gori said russian tanks were in the streets while their south ossetian allies seized cars looted homes and set houses on fire
4189408 heres a deal if by aug 17th georgia is not part of nato defacto or otherwise you will post a humble apology to me in your profile
4189409 m ost of america understands that the competence bar is set so low for gov george w bush of texas that its practically lying on the ground
4189410 doesnt seem to realize that in the real world people hate eddie haskell
4189411 for every complex problem there is a solution that is simple neat and wrong
4189412 de facto slogan has become real men dont think things through
4189413 every day that the campaign is about race is a good day for john mccain
4189414 he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
4189415 like barack obama mark warner is not afraid to challenge the status quo to bring people together and get things moving
4189416 its that kind of spirit and innovation that resulted in his selection as keynote speaker on a night when we will be discussing how
4189417 remember that it was the democrats who created the kkk as their political action wing they were the same ones who kept segregation going with george wallace leading the fight democrats fought against the emancipation proclamation womens right to vote civil rights and the list goes on martin luther king was a registered republican they use the same plays that they did against lincoln same rhetoric it is amazing these are all facts that the dems dont want you to know they are purpetually reworking history it is proven that most of what they blame on republicans is actually what they are doing or have done
4189418 a source close to kaine said tuesday night before this mornings announcement about warner that the governor had seemed glum and believed that he would
4189419 the love of my life has passed me by my life is over
4189420 was consistently within the top 5 of his class as a whole
4189421 a source close to kaine said tuesday night before this mornings announcement about warner that the governor had seemed glum and believed that he would
4189422 the love of my life has passed me by my life is over
4189423 the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived or his imagination conceived
4189424 we are not going to base our campaign on the concerns of so called campaign strategists on cable tv
4189425 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
4189426 that doesnt meet my definition of a maverick you cant be a maverick when politically its important for you but not a maverick when it doesnt work for you
4189427 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
4189428 if somebody attacks you you have to frame the attack this is the same old politics or better yet the bush rove politics
4189429 at the same time you do that you have to counterattack you dont want to look like a whiner you want to look tough
4189430 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
4189431 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
4189432 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
4189433 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
4189434 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
4189435 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect
4189436 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
4189437 from their own website yes the owl is scamming you but yes you lefty libs are so desperate to believe in ghosts and goblins that you will look the other way when the obvious smacks you upside the head
4189438 deliver superior investment performance by taking a long term investment view and integrating sustainability research within a rigorous fundamental equity analysis framework
4189439 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
4189440 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
4189441 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
4189442 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
4189443 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
4189444 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
4189445 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
4189446 ricardo guimar es o marketing na vis o do branding
4189447 a new rasmussen poll of iowa shows that barack obamas lead is starting to slip
4189448 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
4189449 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
4189450 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
4189451 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
4189452 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
4189453 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
4189454 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
4189455 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
4189456 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
4189457 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
4189458 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
4189459 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
4189460 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
4189461 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
4189462 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
4189463 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
4189464 we took three days and the criticism lasted weeks and weeks it looked like we spent five weeks lying on the beach and we spent two hours
4189465 we could start seeing actual cooler temperatures in 2013 and beyond
4189466 the future of computing and consumer devices is increasingly visual and bandwidth intensive
4189467 lifestyles filled with high definition media and digital audio demand quick and universal data transfer usb 3 0 is an answer to the future bandwidth need of the pc platform amd believes strongly in open industry standards and therefore is supporting a common xhci specification
4189468 the public prosecution service and the police worked together with kaspersky lab on this case with full contentment
4189469 thank you for standing watch over my wifes heart thank you for guarding her purity
4189470 mr bhuuu works in an italian store that sells strange masks and wears cool t shirts
4189471 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
4189472 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
4189473 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
4189474 with this lawsuit behind me i look forward to addressing the greater challenges of social justice and economic disparity
4189475 its not just about being online and saying wouldnt it be great if
4189476 said chris hughes the 24 year old co founder of facebook who now directs obamas online organizing strategy
4189477 if the howard dean campaign was the wright brothers then obama was apollo 11
4189478 we knew that the internet and internet alone is not going to win elections if our people on the internet were not also organizing on the ground were not going to be effective
4189479 its about building a progressive movement in this country that has a future
4189480 they liberals are developing community and we are really not doing that
4189481 the right just doesnt get it and were missing the boat
4189482 four years ago it was pretty much the dark ages for progressives
4189483 but the new tools showed that you dont need 1 500 staffers to contact 10 000 people technology makes it all scalable and much quicker
4189484 thanks to all of the people who have made this remarkable movement possible
4189485 is bringing a great new hope that we can reclaim the birthright of this nation
4189486 could easily be described as hell so hot so deadly that only a handful of the teeming billions now alive will survive
4189487 with an almighty crash the ice split right between my feet and a 300 tonne block broke off fortunately i fell on to the main part of the chunk but now it started turning round so i ended up in the water i began swimming around the chunk hoping to find a point of access to the ice there was none i was not afraid of being so close to drowning but of deserting inge and our two kids and i was furious at having agreed to do the job without proper surveillance
4189488 the benefits of strong and early action far outweigh the economic costs of not acting
4189489 a degree of warming that would surely yield dangerous climate impacts
4189490 sea level changes of several metres per century occur in the palaeoclimate record in response to forcings slower and weaker than the present human made forcing this indicates that the ice may disintegrate and melt faster than previously assumed and that the warming may be delayed less by the ice than assumed
4189491 if humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilisation developed and to which life on earth is adapted palaeoclimate evidence and ongoing climate change suggest that co2 will need to be reduced from its current 385ppm to at most 350ppm
4189492 low cost solar power geothermal energy some non intrusive climatic engineering or genetically engineered carbon eating trees
4189493 that about 8 of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is absorbed by vegetation and returned to the atmosphere every year
4189494 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
4189495 ich beginne laut vorzulesen aus trotz v llig hirnrissig die falschen worte betonend bis er schreit
4189496 mal im ernst herr kaninchen hat das irgendeiner von den jungs vom rest der seminarklasse geschnallt
4189497 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
4189498 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
4189499 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
4189500 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
4189501 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
4189502 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
4189503 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
4189504 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
4189505 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
4189506 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
4189507 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
4189508 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
4189509 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
4189510 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
4189511 should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
4189512 whats the point of having this great military if you never use it
4189513 i dont know how to explain this but i feel like my foot just exploded
4189514 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
4189515 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
4189516 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
4189517 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
4189518 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem

4189523 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
4189524 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
4189525 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4189526 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4189527 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
4189528 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
4189529 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
4189530 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
4189531 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
4189532 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
4189533 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt

4189536 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
4189537 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
4189538 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
4189539 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star

4189543 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
4189544 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4189545 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
4189546 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
4189547 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
4189548 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4189549 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
4189550 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
4189551 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks

4189555 how can i teach my young students the values of venerating the rule of law and tailoring their lives to its laudable ideals when all around them are scoundrels in suits whose lives exemplify the cynical credo following the law is for suckers take for example detroit mayor kwame kilpatrick as detroit continues to implode the latest events in motown regarding this embattled mayor devolve to their inevitable end of infamy a prison term brief though it may be one has to inquire how can a man like mayor kilpatrick who is obviously guilty of multiple felonies continue as the leader of a major city like detroit and be the front runner for a third term in 2009
4189556 a week ago ronald giles a controversial judge on the 36th district court who was appointed by the mayor and is reported to be in kwames back pocket finally succumbed to national pressure and did the right thing after the mayor violated the courts order and his parole not to leave the city without alerting the court for the second time judge giles finally acted like a real judge rather than kwames crony and put the mayor in jail overnight on aug 7 a night in jail did not deter kilpatricks lawless ways for on aug 12 giles heard testimony that the mayor violated his bond for a third time and this time kwames crony behaved as taught gave a wink and a nod and did not put the mayor back in jail is this justice while in jail a week ago the wheels of justice were grinding on other acts of infamy to which the mayor would have to answer most recently the charges brought by michigans attorney general mike cox regarding an incident about two weeks ago where the mayor allegedly cursed out and shoved two michigan state police officers why the police were trying to serve a subpoena not to the mayor who was unexpectedly at the home of his sister ayanna kilpatrick but to the mayors friend and recipient of over 100 million in city contracts bobby ferguson a man with a criminal record who himself is on bond for numerous criminal acts including fraud bribery parole violation and assault last friday afternoon the mayors father former wayne county executive bernard kilpatrick paid the 50 000 cash bond to free his son i wonder how much of that money is illegal payola funneled to his dads consulting firm by mayor kilpatrick under the pretext of benefiting detroit do you see the naked cronyism and illegal transfer payments of taxpayer dollars from crook to crook to crook
4189557 liberalism or the apotheosis of the god state dominating every aspect of our lives is killing my people in detroit and is killing america unless we unite to prevent this menace of promoting the criminal and incompetent while demonizing the virtuous and honorable then dear reader i have just four words for you let the revolution begin

4189582 we must be willing to get rid of the life weve planned so to have the life that is waiting for us
4189583 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
4189584 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
4189585 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
4189586 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now

4189616 this is an important decision for football not only did the drc make us a very significant monetary award the decision also recognised the damaging effect incidents involving drugs has on football and the responsibilities we all have in this area
4189617 we never asked for a sum the only thing we ever said publicly was how much in our accounts mutu was worth when mutu left obviously he had a value in our account
4189618 that value was 13 million pounds 25 28 million but when we made our case to fifa we did not ask for a specific amount

4189623 at the age of 7 months babies will watch a fearful face for longer than a happy face and their attentiveness level as measured by eeg is higher after seeing a fearful than a happy face by contrast infants aged 5 months watch both faces when they are shown side by side for just as long and there is no difference in the intensity of attention in favour of the fearful face
4189624 our interpretation of this is to suggest that the brain mechanisms that specialise in emotional response and especially in processing threatening stimuli regulate and intensify the processing of facial expressions by age 7 months

4189627 this tells us that sleeps role in emotional memory preservation is more than just mechanistic
4189628 in order to preserve what it deems most important the brain makes a tradeoff strengthening the memorys emotional core and obscuring its neutral background
4189629 this tells us that sleeps role in emotional memory preservation is more than just mechanistic
4189630 in order to preserve what it deems most important the brain makes a tradeoff strengthening the memorys emotional core and obscuring its neutral background
4189631 emotional memories usually contain highly charged elements for example the car that sideswiped us on the ride home along with other elements that are only tangentially related to the emotion such as the name of the street we were traveling on or what store wed just passed
4189632 we were interested in examining whether sleep would affect memory for all of these elements equally or whether sleep might allow some of the event features to decay at a faster rate than others
4189633 our results revealed that the study subjects who stayed awake all day largely forgot the entire negative scene they had seen with their memories of both the central objects and the backgrounds decaying at similar rates
4189634 after an evening of sleep the subjects remembered the emotional items smashed car as accurately as the subjects whose memories had been tested only 30 minutes after looking at the scenes
4189635 by contrast sleep did little to preserve memory for the backgrounds i e street scenes and so memory for those elements reached a comparably low level after a night of sleep as it did after a day spent awake
4189636 this is consistent with the possibility that the individual components of emotional memory become unbound during sleep
4189637 you might say that sleep is actually working at night to decide what memories to hold on to and what to let go of
4189638 i dont think we are done yet we have still got one or two players possibly to come in

4189652 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia and insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
4189653 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4189654 i have to say that the reports are not encouraging about russias respect for this cease fire
4189655 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered

4189782 its been a very very difficult decision to make im hoping to have something here in the next couple of weeks make my final decision and go forward with it
4189783 when i talked to francois in june we both understood that the team was going to go forward regardless of what my decision was going to be and that enabled me to take as much time as i could
4189784 right now i know training camps approaching rapidly summers gone by pretty fast im going to make my decision here pretty shortly
4189785 the sports hernia could happen to anybody at any age
4189786 it just happened but after the surgery i felt good i was prepared it was a long rehab rehabbing for three months wasnt a lot of fun so it didnt make last season very exciting for me right around a couple of weeks before playoff time i really started to get my legs back and feeling like i was playing back to my old self so that hasnt really weighed on anything
4189787 optimized to run better on a wider range of pcs
4189788 its been a week for me on akavar i have taken off 6 pounds it totally reduces your hunger so instead of grabbing something fattening because im hungry i will eat something healthy i like it so far
4189789 i noticed the first day the first time i took it i was jittery and light headed but i noticed i had no desire to eat and when i did i ate wayyy less than i normally did i am on my third day and ive lost five pounds
4189790 i bought three bottles of akavar and theyve just been sitting there i took them for about a week really nothing stacker 3 and hydroxcut really worked for me not at the same time i lost about 13lbs first two weeks with stacker probably mostly water weight but i wouldnt have lost that otherwise
4189791 akavar does say you can eat all you want and still lose weight probably because it significantly reduces the amount you want to eat i agree that this wording can be misleading but there is a difference between anything and all akavar has only enhanced what i am already doing to be healthy and fit no one can just pop a pill sit on the couch eating cheesecake and expect to lose weight
4189792 i tried it and akavar like all the others was another scam
4189793 my first steps toward understanding team work and accountability came in little league when you look at our nation we work as a team playing little league helped me become an unselfish player and taught me to take the responsibility to be the very best i could be
4189794 when i was 14 desegregation allowed african americans to play in little league
4189795 i can remember at my first practice the coach asked me what position can you play basically i thought i could play them all
4189796 all the coaches where white and thats when i realized just how segregated alabama was
4189797 still things were beginning to change african americans could now compete directly with everyone else and i started to develop diversity with those relationships the playing field became level because the coaches wanted the best players to play and that was the first time had i had experienced that balance
4189798 i was a gym rat as a kid but i always had my parents blessing
4189799 sports played a big part in breaking down racial barriers and i saw that happening little league created a social outing for my family and it was a great opportunity to get involved
4189800 the first time i got my own little league uniform was unbelievable
4189801 in little league i learned what it was to be a part of the team and what it meant to sacrifice what you wanted to do for what was best for the team everything in life has disciplines and i learned discipline in little league
4189802 when i signed to attend alabama and play for coach bryant the baseball coach asked if i was going to go out for baseball
4189803 when i found success catching passes and the old demon of not waiting on the curveball pushed me to football any aspirations of playing college baseball went away

4189808 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4189809 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4189810 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4189811 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4189812 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4189813 i do not have time to waste on bill kristols musings
4189814 no he didnt ive improved only in the last year
4189815 it really affected my performance because the rain made my gun slippery and i missed several targets
4189816 rather than just playing catch up with everybody else which is what weve traditionally done
4189817 really what i tried to do was ride that train and make the most of that point in time rather than just playing catch up with everybody else which is what weve traditionally done
4189818 there is moreover a familiar pattern of internal dissonance even in the more progressive sectors of the press which tend to favor integration as a national ideal but when it comes to the decisions being made within their own immediate communities support those policies
4189819 turning to the decade long debate about school choice which has sometimes been promoted as
4189820 will increase stratification nothing in the way choice systems actually work favors class or racial integration
4189821 most charter schools are more intensely segregated than the average public school not less
4189822 charter schools are more segregated than the average public school seventy percent of black students in charter schools in 2002 2003 were in institution where more than 90 percent of the students were minorities while only 34 percent of black students go to traditional public schools with that degree of hypersegregation according to the harvard civil rights projects january 2003 study
4189823 in chicago by the academic year 2000 2001 87 percent of public school enrollment was black or hispanic less than 10 percent of children in the schools were white
4189824 i went back to leadership dearman says and i was talking to elisa dumesnil a former school counselor there and i said how oppressive has my life been for five years that i couldnt even go to the bathroom we didnt even have running hot water the phones didnt really work everything was hodgepodge there were mice and rats it just got to be depressing when he left leadership high school dearman thirty four years old and with a masters degree in education was making just over 40 000 two years later he makes that much in two months
4189825 no matter what you do no matter how hard you work and i worked as hard as i could there was this feeling that i couldnt be completely effective he said
4189826 it turned out that the other two african american teachers at leadership were leaving the same year as dearman one to pursue a graduate degree the other to work at another school
4189827 at the time leadership only had three african american teachers and they were leaving
4189828 ive consistently said i think we need to support charter schools
4189829 i think its important for us to experiment in terms of how teachers are compensated working with teachers but looking at how we can reward excellence in classrooms
4189830 my sisters a teacher so i am a strong supporter of teachers
4189831 but im not going to be bound by just a certain way of talking about things in order for us to move forward on behalf of our kids and i think a lot of teachers want to talk about how we can continue improving performance measures weve got to get beyond a lot of the traditional categories
4189832 the democratic party is a big tent and so there are a bunch of different positions that i might not agree with
4189833 on something like charter schools and experimenting with our school system to make it work i think that we really have to pay attention
4189834 the measure of the worth of the administration curriculum and methods of instruction of the school is the extent to which they are animated by a social spirit and the great danger which threatens school work is the absence of conditions which make possible a permeating social spirit this is the great enemy of effective moral training in the first place the school must itself be a community life in all which that implies social perceptions and interests can be developed only in a genuinely social medium one where there is give and take in the building up of a common experience in place of a school set apart from life as a place for learning lessons we have a miniature social group in which study and growth are incidents of present shared experience playgrounds shops workrooms laboratories not only direct the natural active tendencies of youth but they involve intercourse communication and cooperation all extending the perception of connections
4189835 there is an experiment being repeated at many schools and districts in los angeles california helena montana denver colorado and elsewhere

4189868 we can today confirm that we have advised the metropolitan police service that the actor christian bale should not face any charges following an incident which occurred in relation to his mother and sister at the dorchester hotel on 21 july this year
4189869 whilst the cps treats all incidents which take place in a domestic context seriously it is important that the views of complainants are also taken into account when making decisions in such cases
4189870 taking all the factors into consideration the decision has been taken that there is insufficient evidence to afford a realistic prospect of conviction and accordingly the police have been advised that no further action should be taken against mr bale

4189892 the utilities would constitute a gift because it is something that he up until recently was not paying
4189893 now that he has paid it he cant argue that it was included in the rent clearly it was a gift at the time because he failed to pay it adds to the issue that the ethics community should be looking at the whole arrangement was inappropriate and violated ethics rule

4189901 wheres the benefit for me what do i get out of this
4189902 its a very seminal period an opportunity to both celebrate 20 years of content and the fact that the source was a leader in chronicling the culture of hip hop
4189903 im on a mission to restore it to the community that gave birth to it and open the door to those that currently enjoy and influence that hip hop culture
4189904 its exciting because we believe that we can do it
4189905 we shared with him what we were trying to do the vision of hip hop and where we thought it needed to go and he thought it was refreshing and clever
4189906 were just going to expand on what the source has always done well
4189907 a core focus but not 80 percent of the book
4189908 i think that what were trying to do is evolve it as hip hop has evolved and become an international force to evolve it without losing its core essence that was the centerpiece of its earliest beginnings and greatness but it has to evolve just like hip hop has to evolve
4189909 it is a force nobody can deny the force or the power of the source but is it the same as it was five years ago no
4189910 it does not deliver with the same punch that it used to
4189911 if they are true to the dna of the publication
4189912 it left off so much of what is the key ingredients of hip hop and lifestyle now which is lifestyle fashion online new media international aspects of how people embrace content
4189913 if anything we want to restore it restore it to greatness and its no 1 spot
