7210000 mit startplatz zwei bin ich sehr zufrieden viel mehr war heute nicht m glich
7210001 we have three lifts in our first lap and we nailed all of them so that gave me the fire for the whole rest of the routine it was awesome the scores we really cant control them we can only do our best
7210002 were not swimming for a score were swimming for art were swimming for everything we put into the whole year and were swimming for an overall great performance thats memorable
7210003 our goal was to have a standing ovation when we were done and im pretty sure i saw some people standing up there so i think we accomplished our goal
7210004 a lot of us sacrificed a lot to get here and we dont regret it and we wouldnt change it for anything
7210005 thats what being an olympian is it is sacrificing for something that you love
7210006 im really happy to say im the winner from the beijing olympics
7210007 its history in kenya since 1968 kenya has tried to get to the medals in marathon and now its history
7210008 i wanted to represent the country as best i could and it pushed me i saw my family on the side in their hall t shirts as he entered the stadium it was meaningful it was a neat experience
7210009 i ran my heart out it wasnt quite as good as i hoped for you have to hand it to those guys the medalists they ran an incredible race i didnt think 2 06 was going to be possible they went out hard and got right after it if i went out with those guys i would have died
7210010 if we would have come out tonight and not played i would maybe have a different answer to that but we fought our hearts out so i have no regrets no looking back
7210011 just to let her know that were thinking about her and her family
7210012 wiz has sent us multiple e mails telling us that shes watching and that shes supporting us and it brightens her day being able to watch us
7210013 we just wanted to do well for wiz and beating china in a key preliminary game brought us closer and we just kept going from there
7210014 brazils always been great in volleyball i think they probably have more of a history than we do but i think the u s is definitely right up there
7210015 my hope is that the silver medal will open eyes to our program and help people see what we go through and how we fight and what we do its not an easy thing coming out here
7210016 oh boy i dont know i didnt think id be back for this one
7210017 i kind of fly by the seat of my pants so well see how it goes
7210018 we had the one day friday where it kind of came back thats why we decided to do what we did it has gotten better the treatment and stuff is definitely working
7210019 i cut a couple loose nothing tightened up after i let one go
7210020 thats the last thing you want to have happen in a preseason game it wasnt a very good sign
7210021 we lost two significant parts of what our offense hoped to be so not very good from that perspective
7210022 aw man those are frontline guys just to see those guys go down that takes the air out of the team
7210023 you get some injuries like this and now depth matters
7210024 if you dont have it you better go find out
7210025 not very happy with our backups as far as the effort and execution they played with
7210026 you know man some of the ugliest guys out there have the hottest girlfriends
7210027 it was more of the boys will be boys type of criticism so i knew they were just kidding around
7210028 you shouldnt worry about the boys you should just do whatever shop you want to do
7210029 some people didnt think i would be able to do some of the things like plumbing but i got the highest grade
7210030 the boys were surprised but not critical because they asked me for help
7210031 you always have something to prove as a female ive just come to accept it

7210060 as the world celebrates the opening of the beijing olympics people should pause to remember the atrocities in burma 20 years ago
7210061 this anniversary is testament to the burmese peoples enduring demand for freedom and to the worlds failure to end repressive military rule and china more than any other country has enabled the survival of the brutal burmese regime
7210062 the chinese government and the olympic movement should be ashamed to have a leader from this ruthless regime as an olympic guest
7210063 at the very least beijing should tell the prime minister that its time for political reform in burma as a responsible power china should put the burmese peoples welfare first ahead of profit from business deals and arms sales that only benefit the regime

7210077 nationally the number of hot days over 85 f were down 12 vs last year hot days over 90 f were down 24 vs a year ago and really hot days over 100 f were down a very significant 60 for the nation as a whole which explains the higher summer inventories for items like air conditioners fans beverages automotive batteries and other hot seasonal items

7210079 for south african sport in general i dont think its a failure its a good wake up call for the country
7210080 the lack of medals will i hope get people back home to put politics aside and have a good close look at what has happened here you cant tell me that we have 120 or 130 athletes who are that much less talented than the others they are competing against
7210081 i agree its not always about money but money and competing at international level has a lot to do with it money definitely does help the australians have worked out that every gold medal cost them a 40 million
7210082 the lotto gives r500 million to sport each year but only r50 million to sascoc and perhaps we need to approach them to channel that money better

7210097 playing wheelchair basketball for my country is simply the most amazing experience but to play at the largest multi sport tournament in the world the paralympics is particularly incredible
7210098 i went to the athens paralympics in 2004 but having watched the beijing olympic opening ceremony and some of the events so far i am certain that the beijing paralympics will be even more fantastic and i cant wait to get out there and get stuck into the competition
7210099 i could care less about the free food pay me what i am worth

7210111 no products can be taken by any riders unless they have prior authorization from the team doctor
7210112 he has made a mistake which can happen but its not good news for us or for him
7210113 jessica hardy is a friend and someone i have the utmost faith has never done anything other than the right way
7210114 why do you bother writing in that every two nights it only gets you in trouble
7210115 come on if we dont hurry up erinll have our heads again
7210116 what took you two so long man man ive been waitin like five minutes i hate waitin
7210117 look at all the people in here at 4 30 dont they have anything better to do then wake up early and eat
7210118 i mean theres not a whole lot they can do entertainment went down when the world fell into chaos brandi tv video games all fell apart they dont have much anymore even in the common area they only have a gym bar stage and games sitting room
7210119 id say time better spent on saving this place then eating
7210120 how are we supposed to purge the planet of the demons if we dont have enough people
7210121 they only look forward to becoming a cook or singer or bartender or a preacher of their faith not to fight theyre tired of fighting
7210122 honestly communism is what we should turn too have cecil choose who will do what that way we have more people helping out what really should be done
7210123 thats not what our countries stood for do you want to lose what little we have left of what used to be
7210124 what used to be is gone alida what is happening now is what we should focus on
7210125 unfortunately shes right brandi were trying to change the world back to what it was before if we dont remember how it was in the past what hope do we have
7210126 not so much that just the fact we have a room dedicated to the church so to speak where at certain times each religion gets to go over their religious beliefs every two days why not alternate between two religions each day
7210127 like one in the day and one at night each day
7210128 yeah it would make much more sense then dedicating an hour to your religion then leaving so the next religion can set up
7210129 its the way all religions agreed to do it again freedom and the rights factor
7210130 this is our life now brandi you should learn to get used to it
7210131 i wonder if well run out of food and fresh water one day
7210132 we have the underground water supply that was tainted by the lyn keeping us going for now its large but we dont know how long it will last as for food thats what the sykas are for
7210133 they replicate every kind of food weve ever had that was stored down here before the gre armageddon occurred so as long as the sykas stay intact so will our food supply
7210134 it cant replicate liquid we can replicate the ingredients used to make juice and everything but not the actual liquid part the water part we turn it into liquid it can only replicate solids gykas replicate gases but we havent created ones that replicate liquids
7210135 i dont know one of the researchers who designed this place i guess
7210136 your goal is to find out what the cause of the recent earthquakes are and get some data on the surrounding area of our base if you are confronted by an unknown entity shoot first those are your orders
7210137 look at all the cracks and fissures in the ground
7210138 the readings show the potential cause of the earthquakes are dead ahead so move it
7210139 do you think a reactor or something caused all of this
7210140 it would have to be very large for the earth to shake this much and constantly it just doesnt make sense
7210141 when erin pulled you out of the way it bared its unnaturally large teeth at us
7210142 if you are concerned about my well being its not a priority i can take care of myself
7210143 well yes i am by myself my com teammates and i have been separated we are investigating the planets surface
7210144 until we can locate your teammates its best if you stay protected even if your combat skills are high its still very dangerous
7210145 whats been going on with this team is absolutely goofy
7210146 aybar steps in for longoria and offensively we dont miss a beat
7210147 ive gone out to the mound to check a pitchers injuries but never for a cracked molar
7210148 i am comfortable with anybody that wants to gut it out
7210149 but if i feel thats not enough for us to win than i have to make some decisions
7210150 i dont know what his frame of mind is i know hes a very sensitive kid
7210151 hang in there dont look at your batting average just think about what you can do to help the team from now on
7210152 he is a sensitive kid but you have to be honest with him
7210153 i have a great relationship with him but i had to get in his face i got on him i rode him pretty good sometimes he doesnt like what you have to say but he appreciates the honesty
7210154 it was good i warmed up quick like a normal bullpen
7210155 i cut a couple loose and it felt good nothing tightened up after i let it go which is a good sign
7210156 thats when things get worse everything felt good free and easy
7210157 i dont really care i just want to play if they want to get creative then get creative
7210158 im pretty much open to anything at this point i just want to get back in there and help this ballclub win any way we can do it
7210159 physically hes fine hes just not throwing the ball the way we feel hes capable of throwing it obviously theres more work to be done
7210160 you have to be throwing the ball well to earn a spot we need their stuff to be right
7210161 i do not understand my own actions because i do not do what i want to but i do the very thing that i hate
7210162 we are prepared for this and we are expecting a formal announcement at the teleconference
7210163 terrorism is a problem all over the world it is not just limited to pakistan and keeping this in mind we have made the best possible security arrangements for the champions trophy in consultation with the icc security people so how can countries now say they cant come to pakistan
7210164 thats why we decided to do what we did it has gotten better treatment is definitely working
7210165 no no the team is playing good so i dont need to rush ill take a couple of more days i want to do everything take batting practice
7210166 he felt that if given a few more days that he would be much better prepared also saying that the team is playing extremely well without him
7210167 there is a different dynamic to our lineup when delgado is hot
7210168 by that i mean theres a different dynamic when hes carlos delgado and a lot of that just has to do with confidence when i watch him now i see him up there with the confidence i used to see when i played against him in 05 and the way he was when i thought he carried us offensively in 06 its not just that the guys in front of him get better pitches to hit and the guys behind him get better pitches to hit when hes hot pitchers always know where he is in the lineup
7210169 i am not going up there trying to hit one i am just trying to get a hit

7210172 sara coffey and robert mcbride are by far the greatest strength of the project
7210173 they have to be the most connected people in all of vermont maybe the most connected people ive ever known weve done things similar to this before but weve never seen such dedication as we have from these people
7210174 we recorded two pieces mostly electronic ambient music that jason composed
7210175 then we layered it with sound samples trains are social but oftentimes people have personal experiences on them everyone has vivid memories of trains they stare out windows think about their lives and we want to amplify that process
7210176 not every artist is cut out for this kind of project
7210177 but everyone in so percussion is smart talented and flexible from the get go theyve really gotten it that its connected to communities and that they have a residency to make work rural communities can serve as a wonderful lab for artists and the making of new work that is not created in a vacuum
7210178 one of the interests i have as a director of a nonprofit in a small rural community is to convey the importance of being able to put a project like this together through partnership
7210179 in bigger cities often artists work falls safely into the art ghetto or the gallery music scene when they come to a small town they have a chance to work with the community at large so it is a win win
7210180 one instrument will be a diatonic set of pipes a fencepost a phone
7210181 it has a sound of huge church bells and crazy overtones like chains and small sounds itll transition seamlessly with pre recorded sounds
7210182 were conscious that well be playing in front of a huge rail car
7210183 we cant just ignore the industry and machinery of rail yards we have to match the scale with our own music
7210184 where everyone is involved and tiny sounds become really beautiful

7210194 the jazz network has been amazingly great for me and my music ive also discovered some very talented individuals here on the jazz network and reconnected with old friends and fans jaijai did an incredible thing when she created this awesome network im extremely proud to be a member of the jazz network and to turn my friends and colleagues onto it
7210195 a beautiful flower delights and refreshes the hearts of all people equally no matter what soil it grows in that is the power of beauty the same is true of great art it is this spirit that the german poet heinrich heine sang of when he wrote that once the peapod bursts open the sugar peas inside are for everyone to enjoy
7210196 it was a pleasure to be featured on the jazz network main page
7210197 the creed of the heroic nerd is no experiment is so insanely dangerous that it cant be made slightly more insanely dangerous with a side experiment over the course of their 101 day journey storms howl and the sun beats down two men are almost lost at sea and they must fend off a whale shark that nearly capsizes their raft and when all that gets boring they decide to try catching sharks with their bare hands
7210198 for the purposes of this article i ran the numbers through multiple computer simulations it turns out that the only thing more macho than catching a shark with your bare hands would be storming a nazi machine gun nest using you own lit farts as a flamethrower
7210199 as they were passing along a by path which leads to the boarding house whence miss wheeler was going miss brewster suddenly drew a revolver and fired a shot almost point blank into the side of miss wheelers head
7210200 when told she was not she closed her eyes but said nothing
7210201 a crime is always worth a try given the best of literature the greeks etc
7210202 we were looking for vermont crimes that felt like they could make a play and started going through old newspapers at the library somewhere i remembered that an old friend in new york had a poster on her kitchen wall that was the brewster murder case
7210203 the montpelier daily record had distributed those posters in 1898 and it was a triangle murder case that had always seemed intriguing
7210204 we sat ourselves down in front of microfilm and got to know the press of that time the story the players the ingredients
7210205 there was standing room only the jury was all men and the trial was attended by women sobbing women and her brothers and her father who put up everything he had for a classy defense lawyer its a real womens story that could describe a womans experience today its undiminished and still resonates
7210206 it was a pioneering use of that defense she was put away in a waterbury insane asylum but under nixon a law came in that said no medical records from psychiatric hospitals can ever be released
7210207 we found as much as we could and also what happened after she left the asylum we searched her and had great help from some terrific people
7210208 they gave us the research keys and we found mildred thousands of miles from vermont
7210209 theyre lovely women and still have the quilt that anna had been working on when she was killed half made
7210210 the way certain misdeeds and crimes circulate through everybodys mouths and become the texture and the tissue of what they live on
7210211 and other things on it that were relevant to who she was like a full circle
7210212 the attraction of the story partly reminds me of a quote by susan sontag
7210213 i know its art if i dont understand it mildreds story is ultimately like this a lot seems obvious and familiar yet at the heart of it theres something mysterious that pulled me in and made me want to spend time with her the way you want to spend time with people who move or intrigue you
7210214 in the trial they were arguing on her family heritage
7210215 since mental illness was in her family and she was given to extremely strange behavior early in life everyone who knew her said she was a very strange person thats part of whats inscrutable about it the mystery of the motive what was there in it for her
7210216 it also doesnt mean she didnt know what she was doing when she pulled a gun out and shot this woman in the head
7210217 art is the queen of all sciences communicating knowledge to all the generations of the world
7210218 students who studied art scored significantly higher than the national average on sats
7210219 visual arts education greatly contributes to reading persistence and organization as well as reasoning skills required for success in math and science
7210220 music education specifically fosters stronger spatial reasoning necessary for solving mathematical problems creative scientific processes and developing general planning skills
7210221 effects of physical education and activity levels on academic achievement in children
7210222 numerous studies have shown positive relationships between academic achievement and both physical activity and sports participation
7210223 the arts give students the opportunity to be creative a fast disappearing skill in this age of reliance on test scores often i will give students a piece of equipment and say show me what you can do with this and they come up with things i never would have thought of when students are given the opportunity to think and explore on their own they come up with the most amazing ideas
7210224 arts education benefits the student because it cultivates the whole child gradually building many kinds of literacy while developing intuition reasoning imagination and dexterity into unique forms of expression and communication an education in the arts benefits society because students of the arts gain powerful tools for understanding human experiences past and present they learn to respect the often very different ways others have of thinking working and expressing themselves they learn to make decisions in situations where there are no standard answers by studying the arts students stimulate their natural creativity and learn to develop it to meet the needs of a complex and competitive society and as study and competence in the arts reinforce one other the joy of learning becomes real tangible and powerful
7210225 the rest of the internet is just one mouseclick away
7210226 wat zullen de gevolgen zijn voor mij persoonlijk als dit scenario zich de komende maanden in slow motion uitvouwt
7210227 you cant change america and give our workers a fighting chance when after 3 million manufacturing jobs disappear you continue to support tax breaks for companies who ship our jobs overseas
7210228 you cant change america and end this war in iraq when you declare that no one has supported bush in iraq more than i have you cant change america when you know your first four years as president will look exactly like the last eight years of george bushs presidency
7210229 we dont have to have four more years of george w bush and john mccain
7210230 the next us president is going to deliver the most significant moment in american history since franklin roosevelt he will have such an incredible opportunity not only to change the direction of america but literally to change the direction of the world
7210231 this is no ordinary election and this may be our last chance to reclaim the america we love america gave jill and me our chance it gave barack and michelle their chance to stand on this stage today its the time for all of us as lincoln said to put our feet in the right place and to stand firm
7210232 tien euro voor een truitje is een koopje ik ben een dief van mijn eigen portemonnee als ik het nu niet koop
7210233 ik ben een spaarzaam mens die uitstekend met geld om weet te gaan
7210234 we had a splendid village we had state of the art venues we have an impeccable operation and we had great performances
7210235 it is clear that has put the bar very high
7210236 there are issues london will not be able to equal
7210237 it is clear that the ability to bring in hundreds of thousands of volunteers in the different sites is something that number wise is not going to be easy for london
7210238 brought in the values of fair play and other values so i think that is the identity that has to be built around london london is also a very cosmopolitan city multiethnic multicultural multi religious so this is something you can also use as an asset
7210239 we are going to work on generating a party atmosphere
7210240 we have always urged china to give the widest possible access to the internet
7210241 we acknowledge that the situation has not been perfect but we acknowledge at the same time that the situation was a major change compared to before the games
7210242 you should not forget one thing it is not the ioc running the internet it is the chinese government running the internet
7210243 writing has laws of perspective of light and shade just as painting does or music if you are born knowing them fine if not learn them then rearrange the rules to suit yourself
7210244 all that i am aware of is a sensation or feeling that usually cant be defined the core of the painting is something beyond definition
7210245 london is a great place to study because its an art community unlike any other city
7210246 they have what are called sketch clubs and every six weeks each student can put three pieces up to be critiqued i met henry moore jacob epstein and julian trevelyan that way theyd come around and critique the work the ones who got a bad critique would go over to the pub and cry in their beer and get drunk
7210247 it was a superficial society and i couldnt cope with it so id just get drinks in me it was acceptable when you were 14 then so at the country club theyd mix you a drink
7210248 by the time i was 35 i was an all day drinker most people say how can you drink in the morning but for me it was how can you not drink in the morning but as i got more drunk i slowed down i spent time in the studio but i was not making good paintings
7210249 it took me til i was 56 for it to finally come into my fat head that the drinking was causing the anxiety by that point
7210250 a lot of people believe drinking liberates them but i dont think so
7210251 it was an ugly period of my life its a recognition of how terrible it was we were all pretty useless drunks
7210252 everybody in the picture is very self absorbed and into themselves its about ego trips with one guy just trying to hear himself talk and look tough pointing his finger at another guy who stopped listening an hour ago
7210253 it is one work based on most of my life
7210254 my touch of optimism for the people in the good old days is the tiffany lamp thats their potential it shows that they do have color and light
7210255 the central figure is not any particular woman in my life but a conglomeration of past girlfriends
7210256 first the painting was a bunch of oddball things that kept evolving and then it started to become a real place like dreaming i remembered a time when i was around 10 sitting on the edge of swimming pool and feeling really good and then realizing the carnival was coming to town the next week after i was almost finished with the painting i realized that it had to do with anticipation
7210257 take me out to the ballgame a summer of baseball in bennington
7210258 whenever the flags are installed im aware when an american death occurs in iraq
7210259 its not anti or pro war its strictly flags with no names and no images i have my personal opinions but the flag project is not the place i designed it to be interpretive
7210260 i always have a sign in front of the flags with the total of american fatalities in iraq and one person was offended by the number another person took me to task because i wouldnt hang a flag that had a peace sign on it
7210261 during community painting sessions i hear conversations between moms of kids fighting in iraq and peace activists
7210262 whats neat was that they get to know each other as people working toward the same goal so theres always a respect established it seems to have enabled people to start talking and one lesson ive learned is that its good for both sides of the issue
7210263 originally the concept was just for it to be public i wanted it to be unavoidable i initially pursued universities since its young people who really need to be engaged its their peers who are often over there in iraq but university after university turned me down
7210264 id like to show it at airports to greet returning soldiers or hang it across bridges
7210265 ive also thought about taking it to washington d c and maybe organizing volunteers to hold the strings as human poles
7210266 two guys who were about to be deployed felt that it honored soldiers that they wouldnt be forgotten
7210267 im feeling that the country is not as divided as the media would have us believe
7210268 the first few times i put it up i cried
7210269 now i notice im starting to get more hardened i was running on adrenaline at the beginning but this is the third year
7210270 nobody has touched it i think the flag is sacred to everyone especially with this meaning of loss
7210271 i had no intention of doing the mosaics but i became saturated with these stories and when someone said something that knocked my socks off id write it down in a notebook
7210272 theyre all different and they all contain something thats a little offensive derogatory a mix of emotions and words i became fascinated with the way people say things and their personal stories
7210273 this is a heart wrenching sad project that has brought me so much connection with different people it has been a truly awesome teacher and ive learned things about myself that i didnt expect
7210274 he is so sweet and became very interested in the project
7210275 hundreds of people feel ownership for this project and it compels everyone to confront both sides of the flag
7210276 you know annie im a marathoner and ive ridden my bike across the country and what i tend to do is not look too far ahead
7210277 its enough to make you scream what a well mismanaged scheme mr rumsfeld calls the shots and we all get what we got oh the baghdad dream
7210278 swimming to cambodia monster in a box this dude just flippin sits there and they film him while he talks theyre aint no sex or violence might not float your boat a water glass a table and a page or two of notes
7210279 i couldnt carry on a very lengthy dissertation about poetry
7210280 but i like worsdworth and poe my goal is to just keep the quality up some of these songs i hear on the radio arent even songs at all
7210281 i just admire people that can do a lot with a little i wish we had more of that because you get so many big bombastic productions less is more sometimes
7210282 the world is feeling really decadent these days you know everyone has too much money
7210283 and i was feeling decadent like this is just gross im out here with a six piece band and a tour bus and im singing songs about little people leading simple lives and i was starting to feel like it was all too big you know so many bands are all bling bling now so i just thought im gonna go really small
7210284 the hunger strike i have described as a dreadful ordeal but it is a mild experience compared with the thirst strike which is from beginning to end simple and unmitigated torture

7210692 holding statement when asked specifically about the alleged incident at his home
7210693 police are investigating an alleged altercation at a premises in cronulla this morning which resulted in a woman sustaining an eye injury the statement said
7210694 theres been no settlement in relation to government teachers and no settlement in relation to teachers in catholic schools ms matthews said
7210695 what were claiming is an introduction of a pay rate that would recognise additional pay for outstanding or excellent teachers
7210696 heres a guy who is interested in what i say and only occasionally checks out my rack
7210697 i cant believe i met a guy who looked like ryan gosling and we didnt exchange phone numbers

7210700 the curfew has been imposed to pre empt the rally
7210701 they are scared of our peaceful but massive demonstrations for freedom
7210702 the rally in lal chowk is to remind india of its promises
7210703 we cannot change the history of the 823 bombardment but we can create a peaceful future so the sacrifices of the soldiers and civilians are worthwhile
7210704 there is no winner in a war which only causes regrets and we cannot let people in both sides of the strait have the same regrets both sides paid terrible prices to learn the lesson
7210705 fighting intensified overnight with battles raging near the towns of datu saudi ampatuan and datu piang all in maguindanao province
7210706 we have done our best to embrace peace but the milf started the hostilities by pillaging villages and murdering innocent civilians in mindanao
7210707 now we are implementing the full force of the law and we will arrest those responsible for the traitorous attacks against civilians
7210708 this is a grim scenario and i dont even want to think about it but if the peace talks collapse then there will be war again in mindanao
7210709 the voice of reason is dwarfed by the voice of hatred and prejudice
7210710 the peace talks are slowly breaking apart and if this continues may god help us all
7210711 a group or a member of such a group or class enjoying intellectual social or economic status the best or most skilled members of a group
7210712 the belief that certain persons or members of certain classes or groups deserve favored treatment by virtue of their perceived superiority the sense of entitlement enjoyed by such a group
7210713 pointy headed intellectuals who cant even ride a bike straight
7210714 im from a military family ive moved around a lot actually the place i lived longest was in hanoi
7210715 a political gaffe it is said occurs when a politician inadvertently tells the truth
7210716 whether someone helps win you an election i think is kind of a side benefit you certainly want to pick someone who doesnt hurt you
7210717 but if i could prove i could play in instructional league and then come back here ill have a little peace of mind going into the offseason
7210718 if he feels great and throws well in instructional ball i wouldnt rule out the possibility of him getting on the mound before the seasons over hes worked hard and it sure would be a big step for him but not necessary
7210719 the way they adjust to pitches id say its comparable they go with the pitch well and could hit a tough pitch you think you could make a good pitch on them they find a way to get the good part of the bat on the ball
7210720 last night biden wanted to leave his driveway and drive straight to the white house and tell bush paraphrasing that he knows what the world needs
7210721 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7210722 i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me the fact of the matter is id rather stay as chairman of the foreign relations committee than be vice president
7210723 you cannot go to a 7 eleven or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent im not joking
7210724 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean
7210725 i mean thats a storybook man not a fairy tale
7210726 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy i mean thats a storybook man
7210727 and neither do we since noone wants to be on the ticket with me
7210728 articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7210729 the mainstream media has frankly put the security of our great country at risk with an obama coronation media like cnn amp msnbc is the only way obama managed to steal the dem nom its extremely concerning that so many americans could care less about who their candidate really is simply amazing and frankly scarey
7210730 i know ill pick the guy that doesnt endorse me thatll throw em off
7210731 leader who is ready to step in and be president
7210732 secondly do you want to live in a one party state because i have a few suggestions if so
7210733 that global warming is unequivocal and that human activity is the main driver very likely causing most of the rise in temperatures since 1950
7210734 with ties to the oil and gas coal and timber industries
7210735 with the possible exception of al gore i cant think of someone who generates as much excitement
7210736 mccain was the same for nearly seventy years then he changed
7210737 claiming that mccain suddenly transformed into a different bad man is not plausible
7210738 launching implausible negative attacks is not the new politics weve been promised
7210739 its not just something biden is making up back during the primaries i remember talking to a lot of people about how i thought the 2000 version of mccain might have made a pretty good president but the 2008 model not so much but then the 2000 version would never have won the republican nomination which is why he moved so far to the right
7210740 i think people in the united states can get a little irritated by my work
7210741 frustrated even they think im a clever clever boy but ive found its okay to be in a state of conflict and opposition you dont want to be too embraced
7210742 at least as long as i can get up and down the stairs
7210743 the three set in europe were told to me by other writers and my publisher while the newark story happened to my stepfather he was actually there when the mayor broke down and cried in the middle of the riot
7210744 a coup by legal and political means the reality is that al gore was elected which means were living in an alternate universe an alternate reality like owen brick in the real world there would be no war in iraq no torture at abu ghraib and possibly just possibly no 9 11
7210745 the idea that this great man should have to suffer the loss of such a fine son is appalling
7210746 i wrote man in the dark during a very short period of time
7210747 just four months it kept writing itself it was the most intense experience ive ever had as a writer
7210748 i write everything by hand paragraph by paragraph and then at the end of the day i type up what ive written usually 1 000 words on a typewriter when the book is done ill do handwritten corrections then retype it all on the typewriter i wrote a screenplay on a computer once and hated it so much that i vowed i would never do it again i got carpal tunnel and wound up having to wear a brace
7210749 most of whats on it is false ill give readings where the person introducing me will provide information that is simply wrong ill ask them where they got it and invariably theyll say the internet
7210750 novels are about inner life about the experience of being in the world from inside
7210751 films are about life from the outside rarely do they touch the depths of novels
7210752 once we were done we had a screening for the distributor after saying how much he liked it he added almost as an afterthought that it had no commercial potential at all thats just how it is these days especially in america theres no life left for marginal films
7210753 i dont know why im gravitating toward stories about death
7210754 its probably nothing more than a function of getting older
7210755 its good to inhabit a young person again especially in that era
7210756 his mailbox read the bill smith not bill smith but the bill smith
7210757 elections have changed dramatically over the years money power and name recognition are the three basic ingredients for a winner whether or not that candidate has any qualifications
7210758 this is fine for the corporate world or the entertainment industry but not for democracy
7210759 voters are bombarded with repetitive subjective messages about the candidates personality and biography
7210760 the system seems designed to focus their attention on what the candidates look like or who is ahead rather than what they promise theyll do for the country with an awareness of the techniques campaigns use and how to find better information people can look beyond what the candidates want them to see and understand the truth about the people who are looking to represent them and how they propose to represent them
7210761 detached alaskans promoting an unusual mixture of emotion and a smattering of science within the context of a scrambled worldview
7210762 during july and early august caribou can be seen violently shaking their heads stamping their feet and racing wildly over the tundra for no apparent reason they are seeking to evade warble or bot flies
7210763 the bill permits the board of game to allow a predator program for wolves and grizzly bears if the commissioner of fish and game finds an emergency where wolves or grizzly bears in an area are causing a decline in prey
7210764 pakistans president pervez musharraf the dictator who reinvented himself as a u s ally against terrorism resigned to avoid facing impeachment charges for illegally seizing power and mishandling the economy
7210765 judge denies mans bid for new trial says deputies didnt intimidate jurors
7210766 senator hillary clinton will be the headline prime time speaker and former virginia governor mark warner will deliver the keynote address on tuesday night
7210767 the former u s vice president is just desperate for attention because he has no friends
7210768 why dont we pass 1 3 trillion of that back to the people who pay the bills
7210769 people automatically assume that if it weakens the hazards go down with it but in the case of rainfall its not a function of wind speed
7210770 this is unprecedented in terms of the slow nature of this storm the large circulation and the fact that its impacted probably about 90 percent of the state with heavy rains and severe weather
7210771 ive made the selection and thats all youre going to get
7210772 getting away with murder how politics is destroying the criminal justice system
7210773 making the case for yourself a diet book for smart women
7210774 gore took what was a likely slam dunk and helped make it into a squeaker that went the other way
7210775 stole the marginal votes gore may have needed to clearly carry florida and the election
7210776 they dont want to look themselves in the mirror for betraying their finest progressive traditions and so they have to lash out at someone
7210777 theyre not going to blame themselves for selling out again and again and again
7210778 they make mistake after mistake after mistake because theyve lost their self respect they dont know who they are anymore theyve lost their identity
7210779 theyre basically appealing to the public by saying do you know how bad the republicans are people say they dont think that much of the democratic party but do you know how bad the republicans are if you define yourself by the worst instead of the best you can be theres something wrong with your psychological makeup as a party
7210780 gore is to the right of bradley on almost every important issue
7210781 he had at various times in his political career been a neoliberal tough on crime and communism a new agey environmentalist and techno futurist and an old fashioned bible thumping populist gores response to problems said a long time aide was to consult five pollsters
7210782 thats basically trying to be like the republicans but not quite like the republicans and still have a democratic image
7210783 gore advisers say naders appeal will dim as the election draws closer
7210784 theyre also counting on reform party candidate pat buchanan to nab would be bush votes
7210785 yeah what they should have said is hey the green party is for this this and this
7210786 its not my job to elect al gore or george bush
7210787 i think its an ego trip and people have lost sight of what the goals are
7210788 why didnt the democrats stop bush on iraq why did they surrender their declaration of war powers authority under the constitution and send it up pennsylvania avenue to the white house
7210789 it got so bad that everything bush did i was blamed for until i ended up saying gee i know someone who should share the blame with me barbara and george bush
7210790 they created him why dont you go back to the origins
7210791 he had called me and i think reached out to my campaign my sense is that mr nader is somebody who if you dont listen and adopt all of his policies thinks youre not substantive he seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work
7210792 ralph nader is trying to get attention he has become the perennial political candidate
7210793 i think its a shame because if you look at his legacy in terms of consumer protections its an extraordinary one but at this point hes somebody whos trying to get attention and his campaign hasnt gotten any traction
7210794 when i saw him at a book signing last year in a downtown bookstore i stood in line with 300 people
7210795 a tiny portion of america is casting half an eye towards us every now and then maybe we hope
7210796 all in favor of having the presumptive nominee be the actual nominee say more pork sausage please okay its unanimous sally could you bring everybody their own carafe of syrup and drop the check at microsoft at amp t and gms table over there in the corner thats a darling
7210797 last ditch effort to help save the planet from irrevocable change
7210798 with this enactment we demonstrate our proud heritage and traditions
7210799 every single one of those quotations came from the campaign of 1960 when the republicans attacked john fitzgerald kennedy
7210800 holding statement when asked specifically about the alleged incident at his home
7210801 police are investigating an alleged altercation at a premises in cronulla this morning which resulted in a woman sustaining an eye injury the statement said

7210803 what were claiming is an introduction of a pay rate that would recognise additional pay for outstanding or excellent teachers
7210804 i was the mayor of new york on september 11 2001
7210805 he was a pow of the north vietnamese for five and a half years
7210806 i definitely want to be a little more of a threat up there
7210807 i feel like one of them it reminds me of what we had in oakland
7210808 i feel im 22 or 24 my body is 30 but the state of my mind is younger
7210809 were not going to say we think were going to win the division right now but well sure give it a run
7210810 and if not well try to spoil someone elses day everyones written us off and thats fine with a youth movement i think young guys are showing theyre comfortable in their roles and not having a ton of pressure
7210811 setq mylistx list 1 2 setq mylisty list 3 4 setq
7210812 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
7210813 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
7210814 if you listen to barack obama and the people around him they certainly seem to be signaling that the choice will be someone who has instantly recognizable national security experience
7210815 that means joe biden maybe evan bayh not tim kaine of virginia and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore
7210816 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
7210817 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
7210818 they the heartland americans are bitter clinging to guns and religion and have atipithy toward those who dont look like them
7210819 they will try to make you afraid of me because i dont look like the other presidents
7210820 one night after being mistreated as a pow a guard loosened the ropes binding me easing my pain on christmas that same guard approached me without saying a word he drew a cross in the sand we stood wordlessly looking at the cross remembering the true light of christmas
7210821 leaving his shovel on the ground he slowly walked to a crude bench and sat down he knew that at any moment a guard would order him to stand up and when he failed to respond the guard would beat him to death probably with his own shovel he had seen it happen to other prisoners
7210822 not long ago in baghdad al qaeda took two young women who were mentally disabled and put suicide vests on them sent them into a marketplace and by remote control detonated those suicide vests
7210823 if that isnt evil you have to tell me what is
7210824 i have a long record of that support of alternate energy ive always been for all of those and i have not missed any crucial vote but my citizens in arizona know that when im running for the president of the united states i have to be out campaigning
7210825 if you were president and you knew that bin laden was in pakistan and you knew where would you have u s forces go in after him
7210826 larry im not gonna go there and heres why pakistan is a sovereign nation i think the pakistanis want bin laden out of their hair and out of their country as causing great difficulties in pakistan itself but i want to assure you that i will get osama bin laden as president of the united states and i will bring him to justice no matter what it takes
7210827 hey lou i just got this package from al gore he asked us to hide it
7210828 this idiots voting for mccain but he knows nothing about him
7210829 this guy has his facts wrong and hes voting for obama
7210830 and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore
7210831 if anyone says something about my surname i say we are not related i am ashamed
7210832 however nothing rallies the righties like a clinton a recent poll showed 49 of americans would never vote for hillary
7210833 barack obama has a good lead with women and an even greater potential to increase that lead
7210834 where he has shown the most room to grow is among these senior women
7210835 is not living up to his full potential with white older unmarried women
7210836 this is an issue that really demonstrates youre in touch with womens lives
7210837 opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems
7210838 a career legacy politician who fell hook line and sinker for the administrations case for a disastrous war and dragged much of our party with him
7210839 the most inexperienced ticket in the history of the world
7210840 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
7210841 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
7210842 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
7210843 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
7210844 youve gotta stand for something or youre gonna fall for anything
7210845 smack some sense into our so called president with my bare hands

7210852 somewhere along the line we were just fortunate to have developed more complex brains and social structures but other than that were all alike we and all the other animals
7210853 nothing and have been treated like im inconveniencing them even though i paid in full 2 months ago we have an 800 love seat and the supports crack like styrofoam on the arm rests and in the frame as you lean and move and live
7210854 eq3 is an internationally acclaimed business but it is locally owned and operated
7210855 look you cheap mother fucker you dont have to shop at ikea ever again
7210856 particularly in san francisco houses are smaller and income is less disposable
7210857 if your needs change later on a nightstand can become an end table
7210858 one of the biggest benefits is that a lot of people in cities are renters as you move multifunctional furniture can move with you
7210859 sometimes people want to use their bedroom for entertaining rather than it looking just like a bedroom multifunctional furniture gives you an option to define the space
7210860 the inn above tide is nothing short of breathtaking and romantic
7210861 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
7210862 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
7210863 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
7210864 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
7210865 i cant honestly expect to collect from every little guy grandmas selling quilts online and the like but i certainly will be targeting the big guys like google microsoft and smooth operator
7210866 but it appears that the democratic party at the top is hopelessly in the grip of corporate interests that favor war free market nostrums and corporate welfare
7210867 if id wanted to vote for a republican id vote for the real one every time
7210868 the same fate she would have suffered had she won the nomination
7210869 lets vote for ralph and fuck up another 4 years with mccain
7210870 amazingly courteous staff plus tasty food plus sunny restaurant with nice wine list during a tough work day five stars baby
7210871 lets walk around a bit and see what looks good
7210872 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
7210873 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
7210874 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
7210875 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
7210876 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
7210877 why in the world couldnt we have landslided this bumbling governor from texas with the terrible record
7210878 hey the green party is for this this and this did you know that the democratic party is also for this this and this why should you vote for the green party vote for us
7210879 oh now were going to have a lean and mean military budget
7210880 how do you think they are on the redirections of the country that people care about
7210881 you know they have half the market wed better look like them
7210882 what are you doing competing dont you know its a two party game a two major party game what are you doing competing
7210883 now you only have two on the ballot to choose from
7210884 gee you know what was kerrys excuse why didnt he win
7210885 gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
7210886 barbara and george bush they created him why dont you go back to the origins why dont you go back to ann richards who could have easily defeated him when he ran
7210887 oh i see so hes doing all this to win the election and then hell be different
7210888 well lets start with my disagreeing with barack obama disagreeing with himself
7210889 if i had my way and if i could single payer but i cant unilaterally so ill do this
7210890 oh well you know the republicans are filibustering or something
7210891 oh weve got more important things we have to do
7210892 russland kann sich ohne r ckgriff auf die nuklearoption nicht gegen einen angriff aus luft oder all verteidigen
7210893 mit dem freiwilligendienst ist die armee zur abfallgrube f r sozialf lle geworden
7210894 das russische milit r bleibt eine archaische dysfunktionale und ineffiziente organisation
7210895 eine modernisierung die moskaus berambitionierte ziele erf llen k nnte ist unwahrscheinlich
7210896 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
7210897 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
7210898 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
7210899 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
7210900 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
7210901 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
7210902 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
7210903 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
7210904 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
7210905 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
7210906 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
7210907 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
7210908 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
7210909 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
7210910 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
7210911 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
7210912 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
7210913 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
7210914 i have nothing but good things to say about my experiences with dr
7210915 im not that comfortable doing this but i have to do it
7210916 do i want to be a part of a new and possibly glorious religious experience
7210917 do i want to have great sex day in and day out with a group of people who believe that they have to have sex with one another day in and day out
7210918 i wonder who i would end up sleeping with here
7210919 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
7210920 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
7210921 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
7210922 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
7210923 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
7210924 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
7210925 zeb i think the main difference is gore is a politician whos learned to manipulate science while suzuki is a scientist whos learning to manipulate politics
7210926 it is no crime to be ignorant of economics which is after all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a dismal science but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance
7210927 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
7210928 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
7210929 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
7210930 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
7210931 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
7210932 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
7210933 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
7210934 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
7210935 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
7210936 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
7210937 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
7210938 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
7210939 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
7210940 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
7210941 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
7210942 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
7210943 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
7210944 never vote for a junior senator running for president regardless of who he she might be
7210945 start of a new day in america under obama start to loose freedom start to loose liberty keep growing government bigger and bigger start of socialism in the american government
7210946 as a lifelong democrat who will be voting for mccain this fall
7210947 jades had this three years even on this occasion a smear test was an after thought
7210948 the tumour is the size of a tomato how was it missed jade is obviously absolutely devastated but trying to remain positive
7210949 she said to me sue ive had some big challenges in my life but this is by far the biggest ever and its not one i want to lose
7210950 the next five days are huge in my life and im terrified i know i am facing a fight for my life but i am determined to come through this
7210951 the golden triumphs of the present british team can only serve as further inspiration to those who will be working hard over the next four years to make the london games a shining example of olympic success
7210952 as the olympic games in beijing draw to a close i have been particularly impressed by the british and commonwealth athletes who have taken part in this memorable competition and who have contributed so much to the spirit of these remarkable games in the various disciplines
7210953 like so many people around the world i have followed their endeavours with great interest and admiration to all the participants and to everyone who has supported them so well i send my warmest congratulations
7210954 as a nation we now look forward to holding the olympic games in london in 2012
7210955 the golden triumphs of the present british team can only serve as further inspiration to those who will be working hard over the next four years to make the london games a shining example of olympic success
7210956 the surgeon doing our wound healing trial remarked how an increase in collagen was helping to heal wounds
7210957 we wondered if it might work on fixing wrinkles and lines on the face so we had some copper woven pillows made up and noticed that over a few days of lying on a cooper pillow lines on the face started to soften
7210958 it has been the most fantastic discover the fabric has an impact on all lines but is best at ironing out the finer lines
7210959 we want industry to come up but we dont want farmers to be sacrificed
7210960 i would like rsp and forward bloc to join the agitation
7210961 we dont want anybody to move out of west bengal but at the same time we will not bow to any kind of pressure
7210962 in principle we would like ratan tata to concede to our demand for the return of 400 acres forcibly taken away from unwilling farmers
7210963 what we have found is we can take the red tomato molecular form of lycopene and by processing it and heating it in combination with added oil we can change the shape of the molecule so it is configured in this bent form
7210964 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
7210965 demand for concrete and steel hasnt dropped off because there are still a lot of projects under development that use these materials particularly public projects
7210966 the partnership connects leading researchers and research laboratories in nanocomposites biopolymers and polymer processing and allows us to share equipment and expertise
7210967 there are a number of collaborative research projects underway such as a joint project on nanostructured drug delivery materials
7210968 uq phd graduate dr kayleen campbell worked on these materials at qub now back at uq we are assessing the important biological interactions of these nanomaterials
7210969 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
7210970 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
7210971 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
7210972 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night

7210974 barack obama has chosen paris hilton as his vice presidential running mate
7210975 welcome to obama mobile you will now be one of the 1st notified when the vp candidate is selected
7210976 barack will announce his vp candidate choice through txt msg between now amp the conv tell everyone
7210977 dear supporter today our campaign joins in a historic partnership with al gore together we will move america forward yes we can
7210978 there is incredible enthusiasm for senator obamas vice presidential announcement and unfortunately some people have used that enthusiasm and sent out hoaxes
7210979 we can assure supporters these texts are not coming from the campaign and their data is secure
7210980 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
7210981 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
7210982 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
7210983 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
7210984 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
7210985 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
7210986 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
7210987 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
7210988 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
7210989 because of possible first amendment violations requests for reporters phone records are supposed to receive an even higher level scrutiny before they can be approved usually requiring the approval of the attorney general or other high ranking justice department officials

7210998 they criticize themselves constantly interrupt themselves continually in their own course come back to the apparently accomplished in order to begin it afresh deride with unmerciful thoroughness the inadequacies weaknesses and paltrinesses of their first attempts seem to throw down their adversary only in order that he may draw new strength from the earth and rise again more gigantic before them recoil even and anon from the indefinite prodigiousness of their own aims
7210999 men make their own history but they do not make it as they please they do not make it under self selected circumstances but under circumstances existing already given and transmitted from the past

7211002 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
7211003 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
7211004 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
7211005 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
7211006 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
7211007 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones
7211008 the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe
7211009 industries no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe
7211010 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
7211011 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature

7211024 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
7211025 if money is no object were very close to having no technological obstacles to providing the electricity from solar and wind sources
7211026 if money is an object the 10 year timeline is not realistic
7211027 well be much more able to make solar reasonably close in cost to current generators of electricity if you take into account the lifetime of the system and no fuel charges
7211028 the cost of not trying to reach gores goal will be even greater than seeking to accomplish it
7211029 its going to be a challenge given the limited funding and time
7211030 would deal a devastating blow to the u s renewable energy industry just as it is beginning to take off
7211031 the tax credits are needed to make the projects pan out tep is very supportive of the extension
7211032 if the plan is accepted by the palestinians it will kill the palestinian dream to establish an independent state
7211033 this plan is impossible and there is no way that we can accept it
7211034 the plan is completely rejected not only would it not prepare the ground for an everlasting peace between israel and the palestinians but it would give rise to a permanent atmosphere of escalating tension

7211047 we are blessed by the fact that our friend and neighbor is also our number one supplier of foreign oil
7211048 the amount of energy that you have to use to get that oil out of the ground is such that it actually creates a much greater impact on climate change as well as using much more energy than even traditional petroleum
7211049 if american mayors want to send their money to unstable undemocratic countries in the middle east instead of to canada that will be their call if they want to pay a premium for iranian saudi iraqi oil that will be their call
7211050 do you think americans are going to be paying a buck or a buck fifty more because somebody said that our carbon footprint is higher than oil from kazakhstan
7211051 you have to consider the environmental impact in a broader context
7211052 there is significant economic benefit from the development of oil sands the oil sands represent a very secure reliable long term source of supply to the united states people in the u s will have to judge whether that supply stacks up to other alternatives
7211053 they say no no were going to do research and really clean up our act well you cant give these guys permission to go ahead on the promise that something is going to happen in the future
7211054 for 40 years a couple of oil companies worked on the tar sands extraction process not its environmental impacts it was albertas massive expansion of tar sands leasing over the last few years ignoring serious unanswered environmental and public health concerns that created this mushrooming crisis
7211055 it would be the equivalent of several hundred exxon valdez oil spills
7211056 im just one of a chorus of people that are concerned
7211057 while we dont disagree that the resources should be exploited for human consumption we are saying it should be done in a way thats manageable responsible sustainable there are gross negligent environment and health issues being observed

7211251 i think it motivates the guys to prepare well but the big thing is if you think about a championship way back in january that can wear you down
7211252 its our responsibility as coaches to help these guys break it down one day at a time one practice at a time just prepare to be in position for the challenge
7211253 well i know from our standpoint where it comes from is we played the national championship the last two years and havent been successful so is that fair i think thats fair we havent been successful should that paint a picture of our whole conference i dont think so but it also makes me feel a little disappointed that our performance in two championship games i guess brushes with a wider brush or whatever they say but i dont think its fair but what i think doesnt matter and what you think doesnt matter either
7211254 well if that happened again that means we were the big ten champions and i would never be disappointed about being the big ten champions i would be very proud of that
7211255 if we got to the game and didnt win it and didnt play as well as we were capable of playing or didnt prepare as well as we were capable obviously i would be disappointed in that so i guess that was a bad answer

7211292 the feds decision tuesday to slash both the federal funds rate and the discount rate by a half percentage point to 4 75 percent ignited a massive rally in u s stocks and a move away from lower risk government bonds that scenario played out overnight in the asian and european sessions and into wednesdays u s opening

7211294 but lower rates tends to feed inflation which is the bond market hates many analysts had expected the fed to cut rates by just a quarter percentage point which likely would have elicited a more positive response in the bond market

7211309 ik ben teruggekomen naar springfield om jullie te vertellen dat ik die leider heb gevonden
7211310 expert op het gebied van buitenlandpolitiek wiens hart diep geworteld is in de werkende klasse
7211311 obama hoopt met biden zijn eigen beperkte ervaring op het gebied van buitenlands beleid te compenseren ook hoopt hij met biden arbeiders die grotendeels voor senator hillary clinton stemden voor zich te winnen
7211312 introduceerde obama de voorzitter van de senaatscommissie van buitenlandse zaken
7211313 volgens obama heeft biden jarenlang voor verandering in washington gezorgd maar heeft washington biden niet veranderd
7211314 vroeger moesten we het hebben van een paar toppers nu hebben we meer verschillende sporters die prijzen kunnen pakken dan in het verleden
7211315 altijd als het mis gaat zoals in het geval van theo bos hoor je dat het een mentale kwestie is
7211316 maar als jamaica en de verenigde staten tijdens de estafette hun stokje laten vallen hoor je niemand er zullen best individuele sporters zijn die er baat bij hebben maar we moeten er niet een te groot punt van maken
7211317 maar eerst gaan we deze spelen uitgebreid evalueren we willen een vliegende start hebben richting londen
7211318 we willen structureel bij de beste tien eindigen dat blijft onze doelstelling
7211319 the towers are completely down now and the demolition has been carried out as planned the site is now completely safe
7211320 one tower came down completely as expected and then there was about one third of the other one left standing but angled away from the viaduct as the demolition experts designed it to
7211321 people were looking at it saying are we supposed to be able to see it but the demolition crew went to the site and manipulated what remained so that it has now completely come down

7211340 torpark gives users the ability to access the internet anonymously in public places but can be detrimental in a corporate environment
7211341 by adding torpark to network composers signature base we are providing network administrators greater control over their organizations network and the use of their resources
7211342 we live in a time where acquisition technologies are cherry picking and collating every aspect of our online lives
7211343 torpark continues hacktivismos commitment to expanding privacy rights on the internet and the best thing is its free no one should have to pay for basic human rights especially the right of privacy

7211345 sometimes i think about dressing in terms of a story or a place environment
7211346 go ahead and order a pizza for delivery and ill be home by nine
7211347 but the number is programmed in the phone and we typically order and pay over the internet
7211348 oh right and how do i pay for this because we usually use the internet and i have no money
7211349 oh ok but the pizza only costs twelve what about the difference and how do i tip him we usually use the internet you know
7211350 i saw him it seemed like the halls cleared out and i saw him coming through the doors and i took cover and i waited for him to get closer and i came out of cover and i identified myself and i engaged him and i took him down

7211356 a group is the pattern formed when a series of shots not less than three is fired at the same aiming mark with the same aim hold and trigger operation
7211357 a group is the pattern formed when a series of shots not less than three is fired at the same aiming mark with the same aim hold and trigger operation
7211358 is measured by the group where hitting close to bulls eye does not affect precision rather than the fact that all bullets in the group landed very close to one another
7211359 a group is the pattern formed when a series of shots not less than three is fired at the same aiming mark with the same aim hold and trigger operation
7211360 dennis henigan of the center to prevent handgun violence drops the ball in front of a roomful of reporters while trying to prove the efficacy of saf t lok a purportedly easy to use combination lock in the guns grip
7211361 again i learned from massad ayoob what has become known throughout the self defense industry as the tueller drill to our amazement everyone in our class demonstrated that any person no matter his age or physical condition can cover twenty one feet from a standing start and plunge a knife into a target in an average of 1 5 seconds
7211362 im sorry your honor i thought i was in ohio
7211363 which reprimand carries with it certain inter departmental consequences beyond just a notation in their personnel file
7211364 its a concealed carry permit dont you know what concealed means
7211365 the state code doesnt specify concealed carry its simply a handgun carry permit
7211366 do you think you know more about the law than me ive been a police officer here for 7 years
7211367 in this case since we teach the handgun carry permit course where i work im sure i know this law
7211368 i dont care what you teach you cant go around carrying a gun where people can see it where do you work
7211369 my probably cause is that youre carrying a gun out here inciting a panic and thats all it takes for you to sleep in jail tonight
7211370 find some other reason to take me in disorderly conduct or inciting a panic ill make some reason
7211371 is this loaded one in the chamber do you think you can just walk around like that with a loaded gun out in the open

7211373 whats your problem why are you carrying so many knives
7211374 when i carry off duty how do you think i carry my gun its concealed has to be concealed by law you think the laws any different for you and me ive been a police officer here in for seven years and ive never seen anyone with a permit open carrying
7211375 is that how you think i should deal with you

7211430 the last time i checked putting a sign up that says dont bring your weapons in here someone who has ill intent on their mind they could care less
7211431 i think it makes sense for texans to be able to protect themselves from deranged individuals whether theyre in church or whether on a college campus or wherever
7211432 i was not aware that i was being stalked until it was too late
7211433 i hide it till the last second then shank em
7211434 i hide it till the last second then shank em
7211435 in my opinion this is the best naked choke that you can attempt it is the quickest and the safest
7211436 the 10 brazilian jiu jitsu moves every cop should know
7211437 i didnt realize that i caused you problems but i am sorry if it did
7211438 i dont know what is eating at you i dont think i really am your problem i was comfortable that i was making a safe turn even though you were speeding but i have been civil enough to apologize to you repeatedly
7211439 now if you are going to hit me have at it if not i am going inside but dont mistake my good nature for fear you are jacking with the wrong person
7211440 you heard me i said you are jacking with the wrong guy
7211441 stop now you are out of control get hold of yourself
7211442 you cant just attack me because you think i m a bad driver
7211443 i have apologized but i am not going to let you jump me for no good reason
7211444 i am not your average white guy you are real close to dying do you know that i eat hot tempered boys like you for lunch
7211445 i didnt want any trouble but now youve pissed me off so if you feel froggy leap
7211446 if it werent for the civilian sales i wouldnt be here theres a lot of defense contractors that would not be here
7211447 the 50 has an excellent record you know as far as the abuses with 50 caliber rifles they are so few if any that all other calibers ought to aspire to have as good a record as it has
7211448 and its a long rifle when you hear people say its a criminals weapon this is 5 and a half feet tall or something like that this is not a weapon that a criminal would use
7211449 this gun is designed and built to smash things up and to set things on fire
7211450 its a battlefield weapon yet it is sold as freely on the american civilian market as a 22 bolt action rifle
7211451 it has been our sad experience that it is the nature and disposition of almost all men that as soon as they gain authority over another they immediately begin to exercise unrighteous dominion
7211452 you should not examine legislation in the light of the benefits it will convey if properly administered but in the light of the wrongs it would do and the harm it would cause if improperly administered
7211453 look i had three guns i could have shot him
7211454 just keep hitting them in the face theyll drop the knife
7211455 when you consider that it doesnt include another four years of secondary education plus five more years of medical school if he wants to follow his previously stated goal to grow up to be a doctor like his daddy this will come as an interminably deep chasm of drudgery and imprisonment to connor
7211456 its difficult to know the effect on his psychological well being when he grasps the full truth that his education will be followed by approximately four decades of work bills and taxes during which he will also rear his own children to face the same fate all of which will of course be followed by a brief almost inconsequential retirement and his inevitable death
7211457 even a 50 year old adult would have trouble processing such a monstrous notion
7211458 these complex self organized plasma structures exhibit all the necessary properties to qualify them as candidates for inorganic living matter
7211459 i would hesitate to call it life the reason why we published this paper is not because we wanted to suggest this could evolve into life but because we wanted to start the discussion once more of what exactly do we mean by life
7211460 the facts are we still dont have a good definition of what life is
7211461 we still stumble on what it means to be alive and that means that these complex molecules are in a never never land between the living and the merely reacting
7211462 i have found it liberating and more so than i thought it would be
7211463 has given me in writing total complete absolute journalistic control this is unprecedented in my experience
7211464 one should not underestimate i probably did underestimate the chaos factor
7211465 i understand how some people may view it that way i dont
7211466 as long as god gives me my health and even if my health deteriorates i want to do news
7211467 i dont want to see his legacy be the last story he had on television he has brought so much to this industry to be remembered that way would be really unfortunate i think hes got several good laps left
7211468 to stay at a place even as storied a place as cbs news and not be able to do work or very much work was not something im interested in
7211469 i hate the phrase middle class regular americans who are neither in poverty nor well off people struggling to make it meet the house payments make their car notes
7211470 we are deeply concerned that our son nigel brennan may have gone missing near mogadishu in somalia on saturday
7211471 he is a freelance photographer who arrived in kenya just over a week ago
7211472 we understand that the australian government is making urgent contact with relevant somalian authorities as well as the canadian french and british embassies to help locate nigel
7211473 this is a difficult time for our family and we ask everyone to respect our privacy
7211474 we are also in contact with foreign governments with interests in somalia to seek their cooperation and assistance
7211475 israeli establishment went bankrupt having no answer to the solid and strong information on the al aqsa institutions activities in regards to the damage caused to the holy sites in general and to the al aqsa mosque in particular

7211479 se renato russo vivesse nos anos 2000 seria o emo dos emos
7211480 it isnt just cynically giving them something for nothing its motivating them to do something beneficial for themselves
7211481 its about giving parents teachers and schools an extra hook
7211482 the real challenge is giving children something they can engage with so they get pulled up during assembly and told well done
7211483 what we have learned from children and teachers alike is that children as young as eight are becoming increasingly sophisticated in their use of the internet
7211484 but where the natural innocent naivety of children collides with the open and often unrestricted nature of the virtual world then their safety is always going to be called into question
7211485 regrettably they have resorted to distasteful and condescending language that appeals to our fears rather than our hopes
7211486 i sincerely hope that theyll turn away from such reactionary disparaging rhetoric
7211487 es das gem tliche menschenbild der sozialstaatsromantiker zerkratzt wird das erschleichen von sozialleistungen am unteren rand der gesellschaft weitgehend ignoriert
7211488 what the liberals are doing is targeting a handful of specific things in our savings package in order to play politics
7211489 they are playing with fire because if they punch holes in the budget surplus the end result is that it is harder for the rba to reduce interest rates
7211490 the key people in the frame here are the liberal party
7211491 dr nelson is fond of describing himself and the liberal party as the alternative government its about time they started acting like an alternative government
7211492 there are a number of small and important measures to which we are opposed and as a matter of principle we will oppose them
7211493 none of those tax increases 20 billion of tax increases in the budget were foreshadowed by the government prior to the election
7211494 if youre fighting inflation the last thing you do is increase taxes on alcohol cars software and other functions of business

7211496 the curfew has been imposed to pre empt the rally
7211497 they are scared of our peaceful but massive demonstrations for freedom
7211498 the rally in lal chowk is to remind india of its promises
7211499 the railway was mined and that was the reason for the explosion
7211500 during the telephone conversation between the russian and french presidents there was no discussion about replacing russian peacekeeping troops by an osce mission in the buffer zone
7211501 there were no changes in the position of russian peacekeepers overnight but we are expecting that they will withdraw from poti today

7211505 every journalist is united on this you can tell by their actions
7211506 nbc has received in the mail a package sent by cho seung hui on the morning of the attacks the package consists of dvds pictures and writings which he wanted nbc to broadcast out of respect for the victims and to avoid in any way encouraging other acts of violence motivated in any way by the desire for national publicity nbc will not broadcast the information in the package at this time instead nbc will turn over copies of the materials to law enforcement officials and then take time to think through how if at all the information in the package should be made public so as to help prevent similar tragedies
7211507 israeli establishment went bankrupt having no answer to the solid and strong information on the al aqsa institutions activities in regards to the damage caused to the holy sites in general and to the al aqsa mosque in particular

7211529 i had always thought of her as ageless timeless and 100 percent cast iron damage proof
7211530 ich habe immer von ihr gedacht dass sie alterslos zeitlos und hundert prozent gusseisern ist
7211531 ich muss ihr diese schlechte nachricht immer und immer wieder mitteilen
7211532 nur empfehlen schauen sie ihrer krankenkasse genau auf die finger und wechseln sie die kasse wenn sie mehr geld von ihnen verlangt
7211533 kassen die gut wirtschaften werden ihren versicherten geld zur ckgeben k nnen kassen die schlecht wirtschaften werden zuschl ge verlangen m ssen

7211535 unfassbar welche dimension der illegalen weitergabe von kundendaten sich in diesen tagen auftut
7211536 are not holy like the holy quran and the hadith
7211537 political parties do not make promises they only arrive at understandings
7211538 sometimes 50 percent successful and sometimes more than that but are still considered successful
7211539 sheikhs preachers and society in general make people feel that you should be stiff im very happy i learned about islam abroad i know other expatriates who feel the same way they tell me if they had learned about islam after coming here they would have never converted
7211540 it is simple to conclude that anything which conflicts with mercy does not run parallel with the mission of the prophet peace be upon him i see muslims do know the rules and regulations but they miss the element of mercy which is the essence of islam
7211541 it was by the mercy of allah that thou wast lenient with them o muhammad for if thou hadst been stern and fierce of heart they would have dispersed from round about thee
7211542 encyclopedia of scientific miracles of the holy quran and prophetic sunnah

7211800 the jewish shops were already demolished and plundered the mob was just attacking the public houses
7211801 in the course of its long history israel has always had an admirable minority which protested against the errors of the majority of the nation a vast dualism is the very essence of this singular peoples life it has been divided so to speak into two opposing families of which the one represented the narrow malevolent hair splitting materialistic side of the genius of israel the other its liberal benevolent idealistic side the contrast has always been striking
7211802 that a rich collection of materials accumulated in my portfolio valuable not only for my special object but as illustrating the condition of the hebrew population generally
7211803 afford convincing evidence that the kahal and beth din rule the private and social life of the jewish population in a great measure independent of the talmud and that their own private ordinances supported by the penalty of the kherem excommunication are of far greater moment to the modern jew than the talmud they show as clearly as possible in what way and by what means the jews notwithstanding their limited rights have always succeeded in driving alien elements from the towns and boroughs where they have settled to get into their hands the capital and immovable property in those places and to get rid of all competition in commerce and trades as has been the case in the western provinces of russia in poland galicia romania by what miracle it could come to pass that whole departments of france were found to be mortgaged to the jews in 1806 as napoleon tells champagny in his letter of november 9th of that year although they formed only an insignificant minority in the empire in all sixty thousand finally what is most important to us these documents contain the plain answer to the question why the labor and money expended by our government in the course of the present century on the reformation of the jews have brought no result
7211804 if he is born in the month of nisan which is ruled by the archangel uriel may he be accursed of that archangel and his angels
7211805 may the lords calamity hasten to overtake him god the creator
7211806 considering then the gentile population of its district as its lake to fish in the kahal proceeds to sell portions of this strange property to individuals on principles as strange
7211807 about the possession of a house and lot of ground belonging to the un circumcised hatter zvansky
7211808 seeing that jochiel michael has not yet paid in full the sum due for those shops
7211809 a convent formerly possessed by carmelite monks but now occupied by franciscans
7211810 in most of the towns of the western provinces there are no butchers but jews and only that meat is sold to christians which is not found k sher
7211811 at the profound loathing with which jews regard the food of christians knowing as they do that much of the meat which is sold them is actually no better than carrion
7211812 ye shall not eat of anything that dieth of itself thou shalt give it unto the stranger that is in thy gates that he may eat it or thou mayest sell it unto an alien for thou art a holy people unto the lord thy god
7211813 to unsheathe his knife before it has been so paid
7211814 are forbidden under penalty of the most terrible kherem to put it in their pockets but must slip it into a locked box with a slit in the top
7211815 to be taken from the box money a hundred zlotys a little over ten dollars to buy coffee and sugar for presents to the authorities at easter
7211816 ordained by the chiefs of the city to go the usual round at easter the necessary sums to be taken from the box money
7211817 bought four loaves of sugar best quality eighty two pounds in all
7211818 a hundred rubles to be employed in the purchase of rye and other grain
7211819 the police both urban and rural and all other local authorities are bound to render their aid and assistance when such is required in legal form to see that the box duty be paid by the jews without opposition or fraud
7211820 jews are forbidden to go to law before a gentile court of justice or gentile institution of any sort this prohibition does not lose its force even in cases where the gentile laws coincide with the hebrew laws nor even should both sides wish to submit their case to a gentile court he who violates this prohibition is a villain such an act is considered equal to blasphemy and rebellion against the entire mosaic law
7211821 that through all the time of their exercising the function of judges in the oral court they will be guided by the directions and instructions of the beth din and kahal also that they will unconditionally obey all their commands with respect to the cases which will be submitted to the court
7211822 and all the resolutions signed by the committee shall be by said judges carried out punctually during a whole year all this has been done with the common consent in accordance with the laws and ordinances at each sitting of the committee one of said two judges must of necessity be present in order to consult together concerning the cases to be decided in said court
7211823 when the men and the women in holiday attire have taken their separate stations in the synagogue which is lighted by the wax tapers held by each person and the leader of the choir cantor has taken his place then the most notable members of the assistance open the ark reverently take out the thora while the choir thrice repeat the celebrated kol nidreh to an ancient traditional chant the congregation repeat it aloud with them judging from the pomp and reverence with which the jews prepare for this act an outsider would naturally conclude that it is the very center piece of the whole yearly cycle of spiritual exercises but if he knew the language he would find that the words pronounced with such awe inspiring ceremonial such religious concentration and profound reverence are not words of prayer at all but an act by which the entire nation renounces all promises oaths and obligations given by each of its members in the preceding and all such as will be given in the coming year with this public renunciation of a nations plighted word the whole moral base of social life does indeed fall to pieces it is a fact so utterly revolting that the greatest authorities of the talmudic world itself have risen in protest against it but not even they could prevail against the force of custom and the kol nidreh renunciation maintains its place among the most honored hebrew rites
7211824 to students of law we venture to think that these documents will offer not a little interest but we especially recommend them to the study of those who are curious to find out the real causes of the universal murmur of reprobation which has always been heard against the jews from the surrounding world and of the persecutions to which they have been subjected through eighteen centuries i e ever since the kahal has ruled this unhappy people
7211825 from the center of the earth to the summit of the heavens
7211826 at the present time when we live under the rule of alien nations and too great an accumulation of hebrew population may lead to collision with them every jew who comes to a city and wishes to settle in it is a foe to those who already dwell there therefore the local kahal is given the right to close the door before the new comers to attain which object it is lawful for it to employ any means whatsoever even to the power of the go m the local administration
7211827 no one shall dare to serve at circumcision feasts refreshments consisting only of cakes and whiskey
7211828 before and after a wedding each of the families is allowed to give only one feast
7211829 there must not be more than three musicians at a wedding and they are not allowed to eat more than three times
7211830 only relatives to the third degree the two next door neighbors on each side of the house and three from across the street the teacher of the hosts children
7211831 in order to preserve the talmudic court beth din from the disrespect which in punishment for our sins has of late made itself felt to prevent our foes from sitting as judges over us which heaven forbid and to bend audacious apostates and rebels so that every jew may be submissive to the talmudic law and court
7211832 accounts for the great number of litigations always on hand in christian courts they are generally nothing more than legal fictions used by the beth din or kahal to compel the obedience of refractory members of their communities
7211833 by any means whatsoever even through the power of the go m
7211834 the rumor was spread that the king had issued orders to massacre the jews
7211835 i hate this skirt i hate my clothes i have nothing to wear my hair sucks and i look like crap today why cant i just look like jessica simpson or mischa barton why does it have to be like this

7211841 when you get problems often deaths it is when you get breaches of protection orders
7211842 better enforcement by the police and courts and better access to programmes will improve safety in families and encourage people to seek help to change their abusive behaviour

7211943 you must merely obey what the state says you have no right to follow your own moral guide
7211944 these were doctors who did not feel right morally about performing the procedure they actually treated the lady in many aspects but at a certain point said no we cant participate in this for moral reasons because the person is not married and referred her to another doctor who would have provided the treatment but just couldnt do it immediately
7211945 imagine somebody who runs a store for maternity clothing who refuses to serve single women or gay women because the owner believes that it is immoral for such a woman to have had sex let alone to have a child
7211946 up until the 1960s the courts general view was that the free exercise of religion clause in the u s constitution does not give anybody the right to exemption
7211947 discrimination against healthcare professionals on the basis of their sincerely held ethical standards
7211948 it is less than aols 850 million purchase of bebo a similar media networking site
7211949 im not against it i dont think its the most important thing for doctor who
7211950 a movie is one 90 minutes a year so yes so long as it never gets in the way of the show if it gets in the way of the show thats appalling
7211951 its been in the cinema with peter cushing it would be good to see it in the cinema so long as its great and fantastic
7211952 its a practical issue this is a show thats hard for even the young super fit david tennant to keep up with it might kill someone over 60
7211953 if the doctor turned into an old man you would be a bit p off even william hartnell the first doctor had trouble back then he was often ill and forgot his lines
7211954 please dont let these horrifying images be the last i see
7211955 fasten your seat belts its going to be a bumpy night
7211956 not at all i was a good friend of davids even before he got the role of the doctor and hes the most delightful chap
7211957 plus theres the fact that we come from the same area of scotland
7211958 id love it if the next doctor who was also scottish
7211959 hed crack up the daleks with a few well timed gags then afterwards they wouldnt be so morose
7211960 they might even come to the conclusion that you dont have to rule the universe to have some fun
7211961 after it was cancelled i fought for years to make executives change their minds so its good to know that i was right all along
7211962 luckily ive had my own wee bit of fan fervour last year i was also in stratford acting opposite ian mckellen in king lear
7211963 loads of doctor who fans came along to watch and get autographs afterwards
7211964 i didnt mind that they still thought of me as a time lord
7211965 it just meant that the doctor was steering people towards shakespeare which is no bad thing
7211966 people who listen to the music might think its sweet but in reality its about people being threatened with torture and execution
7211967 although its set in japan gilbert and sullivan were actually writing about the britain of the victorian era
7211968 we were doing a lot of nasty stuff back then with our empire
7211969 these days you could look at the mikado as a piece about american or russian imperialism
7211970 i decided to do it for a bet me and my school friend danny sweeney bet each other that wed go down and tell the local priest that we wanted to train for the priesthood
7211971 my pal chickened out but out of bravado i went through with it then stayed on for four years
7211972 eventually i decided that i preferred chasing skirt to wearing one
7211973 but it made great training for acting since both involve wearing a great costume and performing in front of a captive audience
7211974 i suppose you could also say doctor who is a religious show
7211975 hes a being from outside our world who is willing to risk his own life to save us all
7211976 i was an actor working at the roundhouse in london at the time
7211977 the rolling stones were playing there so i was asked to work the stage as a bouncer
7211978 this was in the innocent days before violence was invented
7211979 so i just danced about the stage next to the band then went for drinks with them afterwards
7211980 so no one better dive onto the stage during the mikado
7211981 or i really will be using my bouncer training to make sure that a few heads really do roll
7211982 i had to push the pace to tire the other runners i had to push the pace because my body gets tired in the heat when i slow down
7211983 it feels good to make history here it feels good to make history for kenya and win the gold
7211984 you can see from this tournament how we need to upgrade the level of the judges
7211985 that experience is going to make this experience that much better
7211986 if you go back 12 months brand china was in tremendous difficulties with toxic toys and a number of other issues
7211987 chinas amazing haul of gold medals has mirrored its spectacular economic growth to signal to the world that china has truly arrived
7211988 from the grandeur of the opening ceremony to the self assured way chinese athletes expected to win in so many events china exceeded every expectation
7211989 companies like li ning that are looking to expand globally are going to use the olympics as a chance to do that
7211990 it wont do much to lift growth as the chinese economy is so huge
7211991 before the games people were anticipating a business boom in tourism benefiting hotels airlines and local restaurants
7211992 now its becoming clear that the impact wasnt all that big i dont think industries like that are likely to benefit greatly from one month of olympics and paralympics
7211993 analysing the one off macroeconomic impact or the economics of the games is not really an issue of such great importance
7211994 the beef was disgusting the cow smelled and i dont even eat beef cooked let alone this raw beef
7211995 i cant hold it with the gloves i will get mad cow disease
7211996 quick hands you might have to stick your hand in the cows ass
7211997 oh my god i cant can you stick your hand in the cows ass
7211998 i dont have quick feet i will not be able to run after the cow
7211999 if you give these people the chance they will squash you like a bug
7212000 brandon is cute i realize that and i appreciate it
7212001 i feel like im back in junior high bullies trying to put me down they disgust me
7212002 i wonder who charla and mirna get married to who
7212003 i cant wear my shoes because my feet are so puffy
7212004 todav a sigue el enfrentamiento hemos atacado y destruido cerca de 40 b nkeres de milicianos y un campo de entrenamiento
7212005 tenemos informes confirmados de que 50 milicianos han muerto mientras 10 de nuestros soldados fueron hechos m rtires
7212006 no podemos huir por un lado est el toque de queda y por el otro los milicianos nos emplean como escudos humanos cuando nos atacan qu podemos hacer
7212007 no me conformaba he arriesgado y volver a a hacerlo

7212018 its so crazy that youre pregnant i was talking with so and so the other day and we are so not in that place
7212019 but this is cash money its a small boutique group of artists with a very similar fan base
7212020 theres a core group of consumers that associate with the specific cash money brand
7212021 a hat we thought of a native american head dress before we thought of a hat

7212027 the people in our union who are skeptical about barack obama
7212028 joes about as good a messenger as we can get to those groups
7212029 and once youve got a good messenger the issues cut in our favor
7212030 joes as well known as anybody in southeastern pennsylvania with the possible exception of me
7212031 i was an irish catholic kid from scranton with a father who like many of yours in tough economic times fell on hard times but my mom and dad raised me to believe its not how many times you get knocked down its how quickly you get up
7212032 ladies and gentlemen thats your story thats americas story its about if you get up you can make it
7212033 is genuinely a friend of mine ive known john for 35 years he served our country with extraordinary courage and i know he wants to do right by america
7212034 but the harsh truth is ladies and gentlemen you cant change america when you boast and these are johns words that on the most important issues of our day ive been totally in agreement and support of president bush
7212035 oh no what if my number is higher than the first week
7212036 ya know the only person who knows if my number is lower or higher is the person who writes the number down in my little booklet
7212037 mientras hillcrest labs tiene un gran trato de respeto por nintendo y wii creemos que la compa a japonesa se encuentra en una clara situaci n que viola nuestras patentes hemos tomado cartas en el asunto y medidas legales para proteger nuestros derechos de propiedad intelectual

7212039 to use the stick method instead of talking and convincing
7212040 curfew is in force please dont come out of your homes
7212041 the curfew has been imposed to pre empt the rally
7212042 they are scared of our peaceful but massive demonstrations for freedom
7212043 the rally in lal chowk is to remind india of its promises
7212044 this may be the best eagles album the eagles never made

7212047 munteanus idea of how humanity will evolve to be able to communicate with machines is a deeply fascinating one
7212048 munteanus prose is tightly woven and written without apologies for the complex language and scientific terms that are bounced around which is refreshing she assumes a smart reader a reader not afraid to pick up a dictionary or at least flip to the back of the book to see she included it in her glossary of terms i p chaos theory and how it played out in the plot
7212049 gods law strictly forbids validly married but divorced catholics to keep company as if they were free to marry again when one is not free to marry steady company keeping becomes a serious and unneccesary occasion of sin and therefore a grave sin in itself
7212050 father thomas is a martyr he sacrificed his life for the poor and marginalised but he did not die in vain because his body and his blood enrich the church in india particularly the church in andhra pradesh
7212051 p thomas is a martyr said msgr marampudi archbishop of hyderabad on hearing of the brutal murder the indian church is shocked and deeply saddened by this barbarous killing the result of a growing climate of intolerance and violence against christians in this country
7212052 priests and nuns continues the archbishop of hyderabad have for decades been at the service of the least fortunate in india and this makes them targets of forces of evil who do not want the marginalized and impoverished to become empowered
7212053 and his witty sense of humor and dry sarcasm is really appealing
7212054 im looking at photos of him right now from 1977 and he looks so cool
7212055 i really cant stress enough how cool this is for him and for delaware
7212056 i mean hes overseas talking to some of the biggest gangstas in the world
7212057 as serious as he is he sets himself up for great parody and he can take it he has a good sense of humor
7212058 hef was staring at my chest because i had my bunny outfit on but he was very lovely and charming he has some scenes in the film and i thought he was pretty good at playing himself
7212059 i kissed anna nicole she came to my rocker chick show she was wearing one of those dotted net see through things with roses on her bullet bra underneath it was when she was doing trimspa and she looked really beautiful
7212060 rose had the kind of macho rock persona that kurt detested
7212061 her defaming of our national anthem in 1990 gave us insight into who she is and what she is capable of saying and doing
7212062 its consistent with her healthy lifestyle and values she likes to invest in healthy products
7212063 i wish i had been nude from the time i was 12 until i was 28 i looked great i so wish i had listened to my mom and grandma when i was 18 and would complain about some little tiny bump or feeling bloated i used to scoff and say no i feel fat today now the jokes on me
7212064 this group first wanted to have the prayers at a hindu temple but the temple priest refused them permission
7212065 did you know that the police gave this splinter group escort to the chinese temple other than during thaipusam when have the police ever extended any kindness in assisting in anything related to hindu worship
7212066 and what did badawi suddenly chance on this hindu prayer in a chinese temple bro whats really happening is this splinter group has been bought over by najib and are trying to break the spirit of makkal sakti the brothers and the two sisters who were arrested were trying to stop this splinter group from undermining makkal sakti
7212067 perhaps there is a mentality that you cant beat city hall
7212068 im not a crybaby about what goes on in the world
7212069 people like my mom you expect them to be upset people who are doing a lot of saving now versus people who are done saving are two very different groups
7212070 i shop at the 99 cent stores there are ways of saving money
7212071 they grew up with the mentality that you make the best of what is handed to you they dont worry they wont make it to rome or paris this year they will settle for a car trip
7212072 the feds rate cuts geared to aiding ailing homeowners with adjustable rate mortgages have come at the expense of savers and retirees dependent on fixed income
7212073 for the past 12 months there has been a double whammy for savers as interest rates have fallen and inflation has increased
7212074 i was outraged these companies make their decisions and their bets and they should be responsible for that they should not be bailed out on the backs of the taxpayers
7212075 we really want to get the message out to people
7212076 i got back the standard form letter thank you for your comment
7212077 well lets see i just spent my whole life training for a 10 second event in which i would win 19 20 times but hit the hurdle to get third cant beat that joe
7212078 im just happy i could come out here compete and take a medal home for my country its not the color i would have liked but thats the olympics for ya

7212083 where youre in a denial you go back to help you front the post then you deny on the other side then youre back to help then a guy comes down the lane and you step in and take a charge and close out the intensity of it was unbelievable
7212084 and our guys saw it they just looked at it and said were going to get
7212085 of the 58 561 comfort taxi booking fee receipt photo
7212086 like the recent batman sequel which has become the highest grossing film of the year thus far mr robinov wants his next pack of superhero movies to be bathed in the same brooding tone as the dark knight creatively he sees exploring the evil side to characters as the key to unlocking some of warner bros dc properties were going to try to go dark to the extent that the characters allow it he says that goes for the companys superman franchise as well
7212087 what about escalation we start carrying semi automatics they buy automatics we start wearing kevlar they buy armor piercing rounds and youre wearing a mask and jumping off rooftops
7212088 these greeting stamp sets are perfect to use on any holiday card having these two stamp sets in my stamp collection guarantees that ill have that perfect holiday greeting i need no matter the season
7212089 thats like talking to somebody about sex whos never had sex
7212090 weve never had sex what would we know its about
7212091 its unfortunate that they havent won and obviously we would like to be the team to change that
7212092 but in the same breath we havent been playing here for 100 years so its not like its a big deal for us anyway
7212093 whats happened in that last 99 years hell ive only been here one year so ill take responsibility for only one
7212094 the whole 100 year thing started as far back as last year and built in the playoffs
7212095 and then right after we lost to the arizona diamondbacks the questions started up again
7212096 isnt there enough pressure we dont need 100 years piled on top too
7212097 if youve been a fan growing up you kind of know what its all about
7212098 as a player its totally different its more of a so what than anything else
7212099 they could lose and theyd be just as happy coming out here drinking beer and going to the bars
7212100 the wounds are still there the fans that are over the top optimistic those are the fly by the night fans the true blue fans hold back because theyve been hurt so many times
7212101 when the fans left the ballpark it was like they were leaving a wake
7212102 it was unbelievable the letdown and the frustration it was an open air morgue
7212103 if we continue to swing the bats like this the rest of the year we aint going to win that many
7212104 id rather be a lovable winner has a nice ring to it doesnt it
7212105 youve just got to keep moving on or else this game will take you down
7212106 the most talented team with the least amount of preparation
7212107 other u s teams may have had more chemistry more time to prepare more time to be with one another but as far as putting together 12 players getting together for a week and preparing for the olympics i think its pretty special
7212108 it would be shameful to take all the credit for myself
7212109 i hesitate to use the word survive but to thrive through the transition period of our younger players and still be our leader going into the gold medal game and perform as well as she did i think that really speaks volumes for lisa and her place and her legacy here
7212110 there was never a question that the open player was going to get the ball and take a shot
7212111 there was never a question they were committed to defending which was a problem for us at the world championships
7212112 they put us under the heat and we werent able to handle it
7212113 they are more than ready to take the torch donovan said
7212114 its anticlimatic for me you dont have to suit up you dont have to prepare
7212115 i was out at the silk market three four hours before the game
7212116 any coach should want to coach an olympic team assistant or head coach
7212117 id like to be at the top of my profession
7212118 we probably had three or four days of practices with this particular group of women i guess that speaks to maybe the best talent assembled
7212119 i dont need guidance ideas or someone telling me what or how to make cards
7212120 if i copy someones ideas than they arent mine theyre theirs
7212121 if you hadnt http www google com url q http www youtube com watch 3fv 3dg8wlmn6vwiy amp vgc rss amp usg afqjcnezzhonpw8zg2xdcirydeaaeym7pq

7212123 youve just got to keep moving on or else this game will take you down
7212124 ive got a lot of confidence especially with the guys hitting out there and playing defense behind me the way they are
7212125 but were still building and trying to take it day by day
7212126 you try to stay positive but obviously it was frustrating
7212127 but this is a good group of guys who have a lot of heart and we didnt think it would last long
7212128 we havent been swinging the bats the last month or so so its a good sign that its changing
7212129 there are lots of ways to get out of a funk one blooper one bleeder and you get your confidence back
7212130 my mind set is on preventing runs instead of seeing how many runs were scoring
7212131 when we get our big guys hitting it makes it much more fun for us on the bench to watch
7212132 you see tears theyre tears of happiness though we came a long way this tournament
7212133 protecting the person youre serving is part of your ministry
7212134 youll discuss this with the usher captain on the phone the night before
7212135 he will have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7212136 articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7212137 it is regrettable that it was over so fast because i wanted to give china a really spirited bout but the most important thing is just that i got the gold medal
7212138 recently i have been eating pizza and hamburgers i enjoy western food pizza tastes pretty good
7212139 we didnt really imagine the kind of growth that we could achieve
7212140 you dont need a huge infrastructure to win an election
7212141 you do need that kind of infrastructure to change the country to overcome the huge special interests and have the creativity and boldness to do big important things
7212142 imitation is a sincere form of flattery we appreciate it even when those of a different ideological persuasion imitate us
7212143 they cant come up with five crisp statements based on the founding of this country to explain their philosophy
7212144 government shouldnt be telling any man or any woman when they should and shouldnt start their families
7212145 het labyrint is het meest zuidelijk deel van het recreatiegebied rond de wijk de stad van de zon het is een samenstel van watertjes het water van de plas wordt daar doorheen geleid om te verversen wethouder van den heiligenberg groenlinks wil er helemaal geen honden en zelfs geen weidevogels hebben want vooral hun uitwerpselen zijn schadelijk voor de kwaliteit van het water honden weren kan eenvoudig door bordjes te plaatsen weidevogels zullen zich daar niet veel van aantrekken maar door het planten van struiken zijn vogels wel te ontmoedigen om daar te gaan zitten broeden
7212146 but this year its probably one of my bigger goals just to be able to go out there every five days put up quality starts a lot of innings and to feel good afterward
7212147 thats something ive been able to do if i can keep repeating that every five days ill be able to go through a season healthy
7212148 my main focus is going out there every five days
7212149 its being able to see what my body is capable of doing how it feels in between starts do every exercise and stretch and strengthening program i possibly can thats something ive been able to do
7212150 i want to be able to do that for the remainder of my career because i dont want to have jamie moyer over there trump me
7212151 he probably lost it right off the bat i told our guys to get going
7212152 if someone passes out the first reaction is overwhelming fear that if someone were to go for help everyone would get in trouble for drinking
7212153 hay is for horses arent you glad that you are a jackass
7212154 you can always tell a mans connection with its moustache

7212158 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
7212159 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
7212160 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
7212161 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
7212162 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
7212163 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
7212164 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
7212165 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
7212166 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
7212167 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
7212168 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
7212169 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
7212170 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
7212171 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
7212172 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
7212173 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
7212174 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
7212175 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
7212176 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
7212177 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
7212178 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
7212179 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
7212180 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
7212181 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
7212182 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
7212183 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
7212184 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
7212185 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
7212186 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
7212187 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
7212188 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
7212189 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
7212190 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
7212191 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
7212192 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
7212193 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
7212194 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
7212195 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
7212196 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
7212197 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
7212198 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
7212199 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
7212200 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
7212201 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
7212202 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
7212203 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
7212204 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
7212205 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
7212206 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
7212207 ive got a lot of confidence especially with the guys hitting out there and playing defense behind me the way they are
7212208 but were still building and trying to take it day by day
7212209 you try to stay positive but obviously it was frustrating
7212210 but this is a good group of guys who have a lot of heart and we didnt think it would last long
7212211 we havent been swinging the bats the last month or so so its a good sign that its changing
7212212 there are lots of ways to get out of a funk one blooper one bleeder and you get your confidence back
7212213 my mind set is on preventing runs instead of seeing how many runs were scoring
7212214 when we get our big guys hitting it makes it much more fun for us on the bench to watch
7212215 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
7212216 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
7212217 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
7212218 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
7212219 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
7212220 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
7212221 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
7212222 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
7212223 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
7212224 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
7212225 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
7212226 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
7212227 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
7212228 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
7212229 who are open to doing something on the production side
7212230 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
7212231 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
7212232 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
7212233 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
7212234 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
7212235 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
7212236 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
7212237 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
7212238 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
7212239 for him to come up with the big hit in the first inning definitely got us out in front and i think that was huge
7212240 he definitely got some big hits for us the first of the year
7212241 sometimes i think we forget how hot chase utley and burrell were they were just absolutely on fire and they were a huge part of our offense
7212242 well see i like it they did a good job the last couple of days as long as were winning thats good enough for me
7212243 thats like talking to somebody about sex whos never had sex
7212244 weve never had sex what would we know its about
7212245 its unfortunate that they havent won and obviously we would like to be the team to change that
7212246 but in the same breath we havent been playing here for 100 years so its not like its a big deal for us anyway
7212247 whats happened in that last 99 years hell ive only been here one year so ill take responsibility for only one
7212248 the whole 100 year thing started as far back as last year and built in the playoffs
7212249 and then right after we lost to the arizona diamondbacks the questions started up again
7212250 isnt there enough pressure we dont need 100 years piled on top too
7212251 if youve been a fan growing up you kind of know what its all about
7212252 as a player its totally different its more of a so what than anything else
7212253 they could lose and theyd be just as happy coming out here drinking beer and going to the bars
7212254 the wounds are still there the fans that are over the top optimistic those are the fly by the night fans the true blue fans hold back because theyve been hurt so many times
7212255 when the fans left the ballpark it was like they were leaving a wake
7212256 it was unbelievable the letdown and the frustration it was an open air morgue
7212257 if we continue to swing the bats like this the rest of the year we aint going to win that many
7212258 id rather be a lovable winner has a nice ring to it doesnt it
7212259 up to yesterday 74 applications had been withdrawn after amicable settlement between the parties and authorities
7212260 he said he was being treated well and felt ok
7212261 is in line with beijings promises to the international olympic committee to adhere to the olympic traditions such as free expression outside the sporting venues
7212262 it must be the most cynical interpretation of the freedom to protest that you follow the rules apply five days in advance then are turned away or put under house arrest or worse
7212263 how desperate do you have to be to file a protest that would result in likely detention
7212264 dont just represent themselves in some cases they represent thousands of people who have similar problems
7212265 but being evicted in the middle of the night because a developer paid off a communist party official
7212266 were a sports organization we stay clearly within our role which is to bring sport to host countries
7212267 were not an organization that is best placed or has the capacity to deal with human rights issues
7212268 in china like in other countries to apply for a demonstration you have to obey the law
7212269 that would be a pretty negative legacy if the chinese government had found a way for people to peacefully protest and it had lived up to its promise that could have shown the government the way to deal with the chronic national problem of protests
7212270 this is the single issue that most concerns the chinese government the chinese communist party because it goes to control
7212271 wang xiuying is almost blind and disabled what sort of re education through labor can she serve
7212272 but they can also be taken away at any time
7212273 take back one year of the tax cuts for americans who make over a million dollars a year and put this money in a dedicated homeland security and public safety trust fund to implement the 9 11 commission recommendations and invest in law enforcement
7212274 we should complement this pressure by presenting a detailed positive vision for u s iran relations if iran does the right thing
7212275 it could be in the air for 8 10 hours and theres potential harm if it is carrying a large amount of toxic material
7212276 of course we watched it as closely as we did anything that was on our radar screen
7212277 what if this individual could not sell to the military
7212278 would he then turn and sell it to the highest bidder
7212279 docs and local police are still looking to find the family
7212280 i dont agree with the one size fits all policy he is a small baby 2 49 kilograms five pounds eight ounces and they give the same dose to babies twice his size i just wanted time to get more information about the vaccine
7212281 itll be something thatll have to be assessed once that child is located
7212282 i am a strong believer in vaccinations being voluntary but not getting this baby vaccinated is a form of child abuse
7212283 in kenya we have many medals but im glad to have this one
7212284 we didnt expect anything like what you have witnessed to occur
7212285 last year at the all city competition he kexin moved from one team to another and during the process of registering during the move there appeared this age discrepancy
7212286 so it was the appearance of a mistake in the process of transferring teams that the misunderstanding appeared however i can right here accurately say that the ages of the members of our gymnastics delegation entirely conform to the requirements for participation in the beijing olympic games
7212287 docs and local police are still looking to find the family
7212288 i dont agree with the one size fits all policy he is a small baby 2 49 kilograms five pounds eight ounces and they give the same dose to babies twice his size i just wanted time to get more information about the vaccine
7212289 itll be something thatll have to be assessed once that child is located
7212290 i am a strong believer in vaccinations being voluntary but not getting this baby vaccinated is a form of child abuse
7212291 it could be in the air for 8 10 hours and theres potential harm if it is carrying a large amount of toxic material
7212292 of course we watched it as closely as we did anything that was on our radar screen
7212293 what if this individual could not sell to the military
7212294 would he then turn and sell it to the highest bidder
7212295 for those who say its not played enough around the world thats a joke
7212296 look at the far east look at north america look at south america everybody plays it with the exception of europe and africa and im sure the game will grow there like it has everywhere else
7212297 i really do hope it comes back because i want some other american baseball players to have the opportunity that ive had
7212298 it would do good for baseball like every sport to have the stars
7212299 we have lebron james in basketball we had michael jordan scottie pippen and magic johnson on the dream team that trend has continued in basketball and we have all the stars of the nhl so we would love to have as many stars of the major leagues as possible id love to see alex rodriguez
7212300 we dont have to shut down baseball to do it
7212301 but ill go home with a bronze and be happy about it and the memories ill have for the rest of my life being in beijing being at the olympics it was a once in a lifetime opportunity just awesome
7212302 we had ups and we had downs just wanted to end on a high moment
7212303 it doesnt make up for it but its a start to the healing process
7212304 we won more medals it just didnt come from where everyone else thought it should come
7212305 a lot of things happened in this olympics that we werent expecting
7212306 but well use that to build on i know next year at the world championships its going to be different
7212307 you are unlikely to see games of this stature ever again
7212308 on one hand people will understand china better with all its challenges they will remain critical on many issues that is their right on the other hand the chinese definitely have experienced that they cannot live in splendid isolation
7212309 you should not look on the international olympic committee to solve the worlds problems
7212310 its the principle of the ioc that it doesnt make comments on countries laws
7212311 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
7212312 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
7212313 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
7212314 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
7212315 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
7212316 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
7212317 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
7212318 if they start enforcing the caps were going to have to change service
7212319 this isnt really an issue thats just going to be about frontier
7212320 virtually every broadband provider has been suddenly discovering that theres this so called bandwidth crisis going on in the united states
7212321 if they continue to make the necessary investments theres no reason they cant keep up
7212322 i dont see how they came up with their numbers
7212323 i was so angered by their sneakiness that i paid off and terminated my citicard account immediately
7212324 less risky borrowers will have to absorb the costs posed by riskier borrowers if issuers cant price everyone based on the risk they pose
7212325 now more than ever we need to end unfair and deceptive credit card lending practices that make it difficult for consumers to control their credit and manage their debt
7212326 instead of teasing people with low introductory rates giving cards to anyone who breathes and then hitting them with fees and penalties on the back end lenders can still price for risk they just have to do it on the front end
7212327 ive since decided to simply use cash and only use a credit card as a last resort
7212328 extremely important not to overlook the insurance value that the position provides
7212329 the purpose of our hedging is not to try to win a las vegas style bet it is to reduce risk associated with fuel price volatility by buying a form of insurance against a potentially harmful price increase
7212330 a small business needs to be so conscious of cash flow
7212331 to keep more of the profits for us thats just a good way to be
7212332 at the end of the day we did this for financial reasons
7212333 to send something by air its about a 34 percent surcharge on ground its about 10 percent
7212334 i wish i had known that stores like bed bath amp beyond let you order from home and pick up your things
7212335 dont bring too many sweatshirts because youre going to buy and get school apparel
7212336 without knowing the specifics i cant say why that happened but we havent changed our policy on musical instruments we do let customers carry on instruments if they fit within the overhead bin requirements if they dont they are required to either check it or if they wish purchase a seat
7212337 ship your stuff the cheapest way a week or two before then itll be there when you get there
7212338 i really clicked well with them and they had a great vision for how they saw me fitting into their program
7212339 for him to come up with the big hit in the first inning definitely got us out in front and i think that was huge
7212340 he definitely got some big hits for us the first of the year
7212341 sometimes i think we forget how hot chase utley and burrell were they were just absolutely on fire and they were a huge part of our offense
7212342 well see i like it they did a good job the last couple of days as long as were winning thats good enough for me
7212343 of any team we should know how hard it is to get there and win that game
7212344 i thought he might end up going but i wasnt sure he ever wanted to go
7212345 theres pressures so when he decided to stay obviously i was excited because hes a great kid and a great leader
7212346 i remember when i told him i was coming back
7212347 i firmly believe that if i get hurt that wasnt gods plan for me to play football
7212348 my dad was in and out with wrestling so it wasnt like we went to church every sunday
7212349 i used to pray and read a lot of bible in high school
7212350 freshman year when you dont have mom and dad there all the time youre on your own and maybe you dont read as much i kind of put that on the backburner
7212351 ever since then ive put my trust in a higher authority
7212352 its not the last place a person might own but a great place to spend three to five years as a young single to build equity and move up
7212353 youre in a small space with great amenities and the resources of the city
7212354 what its doing is providing middle income housing without a subsidy
7212355 this year a lot of people are trying to save money
7212356 he likes the sling style not too big not too small
7212357 i dont think im a typical back to school shopper i dont feel when theyre going back to school its necessary to go shopping except for the backpack because his was literally falling apart
7212358 hell wear the same clothing to school that he wears in the summer
7212359 normally i would go to the mall but im staying closer to home
7212360 but if i have money in my pocket i spend it
7212361 right now a lot of people are on the line
7212362 sundays thats the only fun part about the nfl to me
7212363 throughout the week its a job in the off season its a job everything that deals with football up until sunday is a job and a business on sundays thats the one time you get to put all that aside and just play the game
7212364 i love the challenge of it the play calling part of it the strategy the whole deal
7212365 its just a different feeling when you put your heart into something that you love doing the only other feeling like that for me is when im in church and getting excited just the energy sometimes i get the chills i feel it before every game
7212366 its all different depending on the time of the game
7212367 for a 1 oclock game everything is happening real fast you have to get up real early and you dont really have time to think about anything you prepare yourself the night before you make sure youre hydrated i really dont like night games because it seems like it takes forever to come around a 1 oclock game you wake up bam bam bam lets do it
7212368 i cant sit here and lie to you and tell you i dont the way we play were an aggressive defense so we have to be on our game at all times some opponents i definitely get a little nervous about its not a lack of confidence or preparation but you always want to go out and do your best and when a lot of pressure is put on you youre the guy that everybody is counting on
7212369 my hands are literally trembling but it has been that way for years for some odd reason ive been able to make an extra point almost feel the same way as a last second field goal its good for the last second field goal i dont think its so good for the extra point
7212370 most of the work is done during the week you exhaust it and then you get to the point where you just go ok im there im done and its over i go back through the game plan one more time sunday morning then drop it for a couple of hours and go over and play
7212371 and were laughing we may be laughing with the receivers and youll see guys with their ipods
7212372 i dont get into all that if the game comes down to a pregame speech youre probably going to get killed after the first hit those guys dont remember any of that stuff you get all that done during the week thats when you start building the bully by the time you get to game day then you just cut it loose
7212373 ive never gone into a game where i just felt like we were in trouble
7212374 i never felt that way i think its because as an offensive lineman you are playing against a better athlete 99 percent of the time and you find a way of beating that guy you just find a way to do it whether its by preparation angles whatever thats kind of the same approach i take with coaching games
7212375 when i get over to the stadium i get into the hot tub get a good stretch and then go out on the field and run around and get acclimated to the weather
7212376 when the officials give their two minute call i head out dodge a couple cheerleaders and try to get a couple more kicks in
7212377 im always the last guy called when they introduce the offense
7212378 you have to understand that youre going to have highs and lows
7212379 when you have highs you dont want to get overly excited and when you have lows you dont want to pull yourself down in the dumps you always have to have confidence that one play can get you back in your rhythm again
7212380 i always feel like my job out there is to get everyone involved in making plays and you want them to feed off making those plays so they bring energy to the huddle
7212381 some guys are good when theyre out of their mind hugh douglas was better that way for me that doesnt work ive got to stay focused on the job at hand blowing up doesnt help yelling at players and screaming at coaches thats not my deal it doesnt work for me and i dont think it works for the guys around me
7212382 i take it to heart because i know how much work we put in and its not a good feeling i usually talk about it for a couple of days me and brian westbrook talk about what we could have done or what we should have done
7212383 the whole next week is so much better with a win
7212384 everyone is in a better mood winning makes the bad things go away its the best kind of medicine you can take
7212385 the sick part of the game is whether you win or lose you go back and you analyze everything
7212386 its a weird deal but you do feel a lot better after wins than you do after losses my wife would probably tell you that after a loss im right back at the novacare complex im not good with that ill go home and try to hang out but im not good with it thats the only time i probably take stuff home
7212387 our whole sideline erupted and you could see the other sideline deflated i think its a great boost for us and you can build off that for sure i wish it was the regular season
7212388 we feel like they can be great returners for us and were anticipating a lot more things from them as the season goes along
7212389 both of those guys are really good returners and thats one of the reasons we brought them in
7212390 desean runs that punt back right before the half so i dont have to go out there and run the two minute drill its just an entire momentum thing you start riding on that kind of stuff something sparks and there you go we have an opportunity to score some points with those two guys and thats something we havent had in a while
7212391 when you see people perform well it certainly runs and radiates throughout the whole team
7212392 i have to say thats the first time ive seen two return touchdowns
7212393 im a very versatile player and i feel like im capable of doing whatever is needed whether its getting open as a receiver or taking punt returns to the house
7212394 coach reid was like get out of here what are you guys doing
7212395 coach reid is cool he was just joking around there are some things you have to do sometimes when youre feeling good and winning things like that happen
7212396 but this year its probably one of my bigger goals just to be able to go out there every five days put up quality starts a lot of innings and to feel good afterward

7212419 this turmoil is not going to go away quickly and will require serious efforts to overcome it
7212420 a year ago there was a real sense of uncertainty and confusion people were perplexed by the turmoil that had come on quite suddenly i would say the mood this year is one of greater clarity lets call it a bit more somber
7212421 the financial storm that reached gale force some weeks before our last meeting here in jackson hole has not yet subsided and its effects on the broader economy are becoming apparent
7212422 thats where we are today in the middle of a financial crisis with the economy sliding into recession with monetary policy at maximum easing and fiscal transfers impotent
7212423 more than a year into the most challenging financial crisis of our times we now face a complex and interlocking combination of rising inflation declining growth tightening credit conditions and widespread liquidity tensions
7212424 these adjustments will not be painless and ensuring that they take place in an orderly manner will pose substantial challenges for policymakers

7212436 we are deeply concerned that our son nigel brennan may have gone missing near mogadishu in somalia yesterday
7212437 he is a freelance photographer who arrived in kenya just over a week ago
7212438 we understand that the australian government is making urgent contact with relevant somalian authorities as well as the canadian french and british embassies to help locate nigel
7212439 this is a difficult time for our family and we ask everyone to respect our privacy
7212440 we are also in contact with foreign governments with interests in somalia to seek their cooperation and assistance
7212441 look we cant afford the forty billion that china has spent on the games were going to do it our own way on the cheap if thats okay with the rest of the world
7212442 los atletas africanos salieron a imponer un ritmo muy fuerte sabiendo que con la temperatura bamos a reventar
7212443 no tiene nada que ver la marca se hizo lo mejor que se pudo me esforc desde el primer momento
7212444 los latinos intentamos estar en el grupo intent estar en el segundo grupo pero el ritmo fue r pido y con la alta temperatura nos desgastamos
7212445 hubo un momento en el que decid abandonar pero de puro coraz n terminamos la competici n
7212446 faltando un mes tuve una peque a lesi n donde tuve que bajar mi rendimiento me mantuve a puros trotes y fue lo que me fallo al final como que di mi cien por ciento antes de la competencia llegue antes al 100 y eso fue los que nos fall
7212447 al final ya nada m s era terminar a como de lugar ya no estaba con posibilidades terminar a como de lugar ya en el kil metro 35 37 ya no pod a dar un paso
7212448 hicimos nuestro mejor esfuerzo pero tiene que haber un ganador y un perdedor y tenemos que seguir trabajando
7212449 muy peleado est n los mejores del mundo hicimos nuestro mejor esfuerzo y hay que seguir trabajando es el punto clave
7212450 por supuesto que puedo batir el r cord del mundo si hago una buena carrera puedo correr en 2h04
7212451 quiero ir al marat n de berl n a batir el r cord del mundo el pr ximo a o as que me perder los mundiales porque son casi al mismo tiempo
7212452 en kenia tenemos muchas medallas y ahora ya tenemos una de oro en marat n
7212453 if they beat us in the ashes you want to go back and get them in the next series dont you
7212454 top five will be the objective again im sure but personally i think our objective should be to beat the british even at home
7212455 we are on the same page as the federal government the prime minister understands the importance of our olympic team and other international teams to the reputation of australia
7212456 hes able to reflect in the glory of it when hes overseas
7212457 im sure a lot was achieved by him here by sitting behind george bush at the swimming and meeting with other world leaders achieved as much as at any round table
7212458 coinc entre le d bat sur les droits opposables et celui sur limp t mondial
7212459 ziel ist es das stadion in eine festung zu verwandeln die eine basis f r viele punkte liefert
7212460 er hat gut trainiert und die freiheiten genutzt die er in leverkusen nicht hatte ich hoffe dass er sich austobt
7212461 wir m ssen die aufbruchsstimmung die hier herrscht mit in das spiel nehmen die anspannung ist da aber das ist positiv das ist ein vorstartzustand der sich wenn es losgeht entl dt wenn wir 92 93 minuten leidenschaft und einsatzwillen hochhalten werden wir das spiel gewinnen
7212462 der rauswurf in k ln hatte mir wehgetan ich war mit leib und seele fc trainer wir hatten eine tolle mannschaft ich hatte lange mit dem fc im kopf nicht abgeschlossen
7212463 er war in einem schlimmen k rperlichen zustand als er im sommer zu uns kam hatte sechs kilo bergewicht er muss jetzt den willen zeigen gro es potenzial hat er
7212464 unser ziel ist es nach dem auftaktsieg gegen k ln nun auch in bochum zu gewinnen ich hoffe dass wir im vergleich zur letzten saison noch stabiler sind und auch nach r ckschl gen zur ckkommen k nnen das zeichnet mannschaften auf hohem niveau aus
7212465 fue el ltimo est mulo que necesit bamos para ganar el partido ante lituania
7212466 ante el hecho de que manu no pod a jugar salimos con todo
7212467 vinimos todos a beijing con la idea de que manu no jugaba pero entr en calor con el resto de los jugadores y sali a los partidos de primera ronda y cuartos de final
7212468 el llor porque no pod a jugar y por eso quer amos todos homenajearlo
7212469 para m lituania fue un de los mejores equipos del torneo disciplinado y con jugadores con mentalidad poderosa
7212470 estoy emocionado por todo no solo por lo que pas en el terreno de juego
7212471 puso su coraz n en esta empresa los ltimos cuatro a os y tras la tragedia que sufri su familia me alegro de que pueda estar aqu y de que pueda experimentar esto con nosotros porque es un componente vital si no el m s importante de este equipo
7212472 a pesar de que me vean llorando me siento feliz porque una medalla ol mpica aunque sea de plata tiene mucho valor quer amos el oro pero lamentablemente el equipo de los estados unidos jug mejor que nosotros
7212473 vamos a volver a ganar esta es una derrota pero seguiremos adelante
7212474 after the turn of events in the last ten twelve days morally and democratically i felt i should resign and that is why i handed over my resignation to the governor
7212475 este oro ha sido tan dif cil como el de atenas
7212476 no se pueden comparar ambos torneos atenas y pek n porque en realidad es lo mismo nuestro conjunto sigue su desarrollo adem s cada vez los equipos se preparan mejor para cada cita ol mpica la competencia es mayor ambos oros fueron dif ciles de conseguir
7212477 est abrumado por la emoci n es ver que al final todo sale bien y ha sido un largo camino a n no asimilamos esta victoria
7212478 la verdad es que nos cost un a o intenso para llegar a donde hemos llegado hicimos algunos cambios algunas innovaciones en la ejecuci n y en la m sica para poder mejorar ha dado resultado
7212479 el xito y esta medalla supera las previsiones m s optimistas nuestros esfuerzos han tenido resultado es el xito m s glorioso para la gimnasia r tmica de china
7212480 los equipos ruso y bielorruso est n a otro nivel pero nosotras tenemos nuestro particular estilo tenemos a n muchas cosas que aprender de ellos empleamos m sica de la opera de pek n que ha creado una intensa atm sfera para los espectadores ellos entienden nuestra cultura y nuestra historia a nuestros antepasados
7212481 no hemos visto el trabajo de las rusas y las chinas creo que en el primer ejercicio en el de cuerdas todo estuvo muy igualado no hubo grandes diferencias en el combinado de aros y mazas creo que cometimos algunos errores
7212482 argentina sigue con los huevos de siempre nunca bajamos los brazos se lo decido a toda argentina

7212487 estoy muy contento esto es incre ble mi sue o era llegar a este momento lo conseguimos con mucho trabajo y sufrimiento sab amos que ten amos que buscarlos arriba y no dejarles jugar
7212488 se rompieron un mont n de t picos sobre este equipo
7212489 vinimos por una medalla y la conseguimos fant stico estamos muy contentos esto era muy importante para nosotros
7212490 siempre tiramos todos para el mismo lado siempre lo dimos todo en cada partido
7212491 pocas veces he formado parte de un grupo como este somos todos amigos y pensamos siempre en positivo
7212492 my scores thirty six im the big loser hardy har har har
7212493 hizo bien su pelea y la estrategia que se hab a propuesto mientras yo no logr tirar los golpes en la media y en la corta distancia
7212494 me sac de concentraci n cuando me di cuenta que los golpes de mi rival se quedaba en la guardia y se los anotaban en el cuarto asalto eso me saco totalmente de combate trat de forzar la pelea para empatar pero no pude
7212495 me siento triste porque se me escap el oro pero cuando pase un tiempo s que me sentir contento y orgulloso con esta medalla de plata
7212496 meritocrazia 4 proposte concrete per valorizzare il talento e rendere il nostro paese pi ricco e pi giusto
7212497 thats why i have been urging these states to agitate much more with the central government to argue their case before us to factor in the importance of developing ne and determine what our strategy should be for development of the region
7212498 now we are focusing on linking the region to south east asia on the basic assumption that south east asia begins in north east india and efforts are on to make the region a gateway to the prosperous south east asian nations
7212499 esta victoria es una gran invitaci n para el choque con el deportivo
7212500 ante el equipo espa ol no deberemos forzar la m quina y tirarnos adelante habr que jugar con inteligencia m s que con coraz n

7212507 it is remarkable we should be really proud back home there is real enthusiasm for the olympics
7212508 its inspiring to see the level of organisation in china
7212509 its a challenge they have set a very high standard and weve got to do better
7212510 i think it is the best organised olympics everybody says so but as the focus moves today to 2012 then people will look at london look at britain afresh and theyll see that were a tremendously diverse country theyll see that were totally focused on inspiring people through sports
7212511 the british public would find it strange if there was no british team
7212512 this will then not provoke a long and endless discussion of the four british associations
7212513 the issue is whether would affect the autonomy of the individual associations
7212514 i talked to mr blatter about how we could find a solution to this and i am confident fifa will give the assurances that the scottish welsh and irish associations want
7212515 i am also confident that when the people of scotland wales and northern ireland know that matches will be taking place outside london they will approve of this idea
7212516 we all want to see a great britain football team its the right thing to do to have a successful olympics
7212517 try to commit myself to something that is four years ahead
7212518 im absolutely flattered that my name is being mentioned about managing the great britain team
7212519 would i take it if they offered it to me absolutely i would be a fool not to ive had some great managerial jobs during my career but there is no doubt this would be the icing on the cake
7212520 the fact it is being held on my old stamping ground in east london makes it even more appealing
7212521 filmar las batallas es muy caro es algo inalcanzable para la industria de hoy
7212522 lo quiso hacer vicente aranda en libertarias con el frente de arag n y tambi n lo intent pedro lazaga en la fiel infanter a en tiempos del franquismo y con m s apoyos para hacer un cine b lico que exaltara su causa pero es impensable encontrar apoyos para contar el asedio de madrid la batalla de teruel est totalmente fuera de nuestras posibilidades adem s el cine espa ol bueno lo que queda del cine espa ol que es m s bien poco es un cine cag n un cine de cobardes hay poco riesgo
7212523 toda ficci n pero tambi n el documental es anacr nica es decir incorpora los problemas de su tiempo en la reflexi n sobre el pasado
7212524 a veces lo hace de manera muy expl cita otras m s encubierta
7212525 siempre hay alg n personaje que naci entonces que luch entonces que parti despu s de entonces dos ejemplos los ltimos de filipinas 1945 nada tiene que ver con la guerra y con todo el numantinismo que segrega es incomprensible sin el aislamiento al que est sometido el franquismo en esas fechas tampoco se entiende el esp ritu de la colmena sin tener presente la guerra el sepulcral silencio de los personajes el terror la fantas a que relaciona a frankenstein con la pesadilla del maquis
7212526 en realidad se han hecho muy pocas pel culas que traten espec ficamente de la guerra civil
7212527 para que pueda haber dos o tres grandes pel culas tienen que haberse rodado muchas y no creo que sea el caso
7212528 hemos hablado poco de la guerra y lo hemos hecho con susto en el cuerpo
7212529 incapaces de ir m s all y de mirar la guerra como lo que es un espejo de lo que vivimos la mayor a de las pel culas que se han hecho sobre el conflicto han tenido una mirada apaciguadora hablan de la guerra como si perteneciera al pasado y no est tan claro que esto sea as y me refiero no s lo a la guerra civil sino tambi n a otras guerras que han terminado por generar en este pa s una tradici n de humillados y ofendidos
7212530 cada vez quedan menos de los que participaron en la guerra o que simplemente la vivieron
7212531 ahora llegan nuevas generaciones y vienen con otra distancia para mirar las cosas
7212532 hubo una poca despu s de los tres a os de guerra y de lo que ocurri antes y sobre todo de lo que ocurri despu s en que lo que importaba era cuidarse y hacerse mimos y en la que los espa oles ten an que reencontrarse unos con otros
7212533 la memoria de la guerra civil se ha confundido con la memoria de la represi n franquista y ello ha mistificado mucho las cosas
7212534 la memoria es un instrumento una herramienta m s de la historia necesaria pero no aut noma y adem s s lo funciona porque lo hace el olvido darle todo el poder significa sumirse en la irracionalidad en lo pasional y no lleva a ninguna parte
7212535 saben ustedes lo que se hac a memoria recuerdo sesgado de las represiones de los rojos etc tera
7212536 son ellos los que sienten en el fondo de su esp ritu la semilla superior de la raza los elegidos para la gran empresa de devolver a espa a su destino
7212537 todos esos lugares revestidos de santidad cayeron bajo el empuje de las masas encendidas de coraje y alumbraron con sus llamas el alba roja de que estaba ti ndose el horizonte espa ol
7212538 otra cosa es entrevistar a quienes vivieron la guerra escuchar sus voces y documentar lo que los libros y los documentos oficiales no cuentan pero al servicio de la comprensi n
7212539 hay que olvidar la idea de que la guerra civil espa ola necesita una gran pel cula
7212540 por qu es una tragedia relativamente cercana y ser vivero de ficciones y objeto de documentales porque adem s se posee un material gr fico y cinematogr fico abundante de lo que estoy seguro es de lo que no hace falta la pel cula que quiera decir todo sobre la guerra la pel cula de conjunto
7212541 justamente se trata de eso de enfrentarse a lo que pas de encararse con sus conflictos de tratar de aquello con normalidad lo que no tiene sentido es ocultar la guerra hacer como si no hubiera existido
7212542 es dif cil hacerse una idea cierta de lo que ocurri en el 36 demasiadas contradicciones memorias borradas cortocircuitos intereses pol ticos de ocultaci n a uno y otro lado
7212543 con la mirada de un ni o asombrado ante el humor hiperb lico y el horror desnudo con que los militares tambi n algunos curas recordaban sus vivencias
7212544 quedan por filmar las vidas de la pasionaria y de jos antonio la retirada de las tropas republicanas y su entrada en francia en los campos de concentraci n el tema del espionaje en los dos bandos
7212545 muy interesante apartarse de los frentes e incluso de las retaguardias bombardeadas y analizar los movimientos de la poblaci n civil que circulaban seg n cambiaban esos frentes
7212546 en mi opini n la actitud de la iglesia durante la guerra fue ignominiosa

7212573 dreams are answers to questions we havent yet figured out how to ask
7212574 fighting is still going on we hit and destroyed over 40 militants bunkers and a training camp
7212575 we have confirmed reports that 50 militants were killed while 10 of our soldiers were martyred
7212576 killed more than 130 apostates wounded more than 100 and destroyed three barracks and several vehicles
7212577 this turmoil is not going to go away quickly and will require serious efforts to overcome it
7212578 a year ago there was a real sense of uncertainty and confusion people were perplexed by the turmoil that had come on quite suddenly i would say the mood this year is one of greater clarity lets call it a bit more somber
7212579 the financial storm that reached gale force some weeks before our last meeting here in jackson hole has not yet subsided and its effects on the broader economy are becoming apparent
7212580 as they drove towards the camps their vehicle came under attack by gunmen who overpowered the security personnel accompanying the journalists
7212581 its so tragic to see fake prada on an 11 year old junkie they at least ought to have the opportunity to wear the real thing even if its just one simple piece
7212582 if you were to say who is the unluckiest person i know in the world
7212583 said ted kaufman bidens chief of staff for much of his first 22 years in the senate
7212584 if you were to say who is the luckiest person i know in the world
7212585 fighting intensified overnight with battles raging near the towns of datu saudi ampatuan and datu piang all in maguindanao province
7212586 we have done our best to embrace peace but the milf started the hostilities by pillaging villages and murdering innocent civilians in mindanao
7212587 now we are implementing the full force of the law and we will arrest those responsible for the traitorous attacks against civilians
7212588 this is a grim scenario and i dont even want to think about it but if the peace talks collapse then there will be war again in mindanao
7212589 the voice of reason is dwarfed by the voice of hatred and prejudice
7212590 the peace talks are slowly breaking apart and if this continues may god help us all
7212591 they dont really believe that the theater missile defense components in poland and in the czech republic although they are very small are in fact in the end really intended for iran
7212592 the other piece of this is that the russians have opposed the general national military defense program of the united states for a very long time
7212593 and they put the two things together they think this is the camels nose under the tent that the united states is putting in place in alaska now in central europe and who knows where next the components of an effective for a much more extensive ballistic missile defense system that would be directed against russian nuclear capabilities
7212594 the president traveled to georgia august 13 when there was a rally in tbilisi and stood beside georgian president mikhail saakashvili and said now we see the real face of russia
7212595 here is the president of poland clearly suggesting that russia is a serious military threat to all its neighbors that is obviously going to lead to the action that its has taken that is to defend itself as best it can
7212596 the russian military actions in georgia not only broke through whatever resistance the polish government had to doing the deal without getting further satisfaction on the terms of the deal but in addition pushed both sides to build in these extra defensive measures which are clearly directed against russia
7212597 no one raises any question but that the patriot missile battery or batteries that are to be put in poland plus the joint administration and patrolling of them by both u s and polish forces is designed for russia
7212598 if the russians should do anything to attack those missiles and american lives are at risk then that would mean that the debate about whether or not the united states would actually do something to protect members of nato would become academic
7212599 and indeed because american troops were there it would serve as a trigger and the united states would react
7212600 i was very surprised i knew jamal was very strong and expecting to win the race i was not expecting to be a gold medallist
7212601 i just stayed behind them and then the last 300 i tried to push
7212602 i feel so lucky to win a silver im so excited that i performed so well here i sacrificed a lot for this event and second place in the olympic games is beautiful
7212603 the idea was that i would just try and go out there and just run
7212604 sometimes when you come into a race with the plan to lead and you dont end up in the lead you panic so i needed to take the race as it was going to come i found myself in the lead and i said lets just go to myself
7212605 it was a tactical error that messed me up i found myself too deep in the crowd and i has to come out and find room to print to the finish but it was a little too late for the gold
7212606 for the last 10 years ive been training in italy because for middle distance and short distance races its not always good to train at high altitude places like kenya
7212607 my father was also an athlete who ran in the 5 000m and he encouraged me a lot to take up athletics
7212608 my plan was to pick up the pace very fast and indeed it was a fast race after hard work and so much effort im very happy to achieve the double

7212650 als je bijvoorbeeld de hele dag gerookt hebt en je probeert een paar uur te slapen
7212651 aan de andere kant werd ik volop meegezogen in het leven in de scene
7212652 vooral ook omdat ik geen verantwoordelijkheid meer voelde kwam dat leven in de scene mij goed uit ik kreeg nu andere dingen aan mijn hoofd nooit eerder had ik in die mate en zoveel coke gebruikt en was de hero ne mijn hoofdmiddel geweest dat was nu de wit geworden en daar genoot ik zeker in het begin van het was kicken en nog eens kicken terwijl ik thuis die base nam en daarna achter mijn computer ging zitten dan bleef ik gewoon gaan en zat er uren achter te spacen met die coke op ik kreeg naar mijn idee enorm veel inspiratie met schrijven
7212653 ik werd 5x op ander medicatie ingesteld van de bijwerkingen van alle pillen werd ik doodziek bij 1 antidepressivum had ik een flowerpower gevoel maar die bijwerkingen verpestte dat weer dus ook met dit middel moest ik weer stoppen na 5 pogingen zonder baat te hebben gehad bij medicatie ben ik er mee gestopt mijn psychische klachten namen daardoor toe noch af wel voelde ik me lichamelijk fitter
7212654 ik bivakkeerde het liefst in een schemerwereld uit pure angst
7212655 we zagen het donders goed hoor als we gingen wandelen in een rij en mensen elkaar aanstootten als we passeerden
7212656 dat mijn huisarts zo aandrong op een consult bij een psycholoog vond ik destijds onzin die slapeloze nachten en sombere buiten zouden wel weer over gaan ik psychische problemen gewoon doorgaan dacht ik
7212657 toen ik bijna niet meer sliep en at begon het langzaam tot me door te dringen dat er echt iets aan de hand was ik ging in therapie
7212658 its only rock nroll butt i like it like it yes i do
7212659 geniet van elke dag want het kan immers je laatste zijn
7212660 its only rock nroll butt i like it like it yes i do
7212661 nu slik ik iedere dag nog steeds 10cc methadon het is gewoon een medicijn voor mij gelukkig krijg ik het via de apotheek zodat ik niet meer naar een programma hoef iedere dag en met de scene word geconfronteerd ik leef nu verder heel normaal en regelmatig
7212662 ik heb nog steeds last van beelden van het misbruik en de consequenties van het openbaar maken er van af en toe in therapie blijft nog noodzakelijk toch functioneer ik nu al 10 jaar als betaald hulpverlener binnen de ggz en heb mijn leven weer aardig onder controle
7212663 ik was maanden volkomen apathisch de wereld ging aan mij voorbij
7212664 ik ben begeleid gaan leren een schot in de roos
7212665 na het afsluiten van de studie kreeg ik direct een betaalde baan haptonomie heeft me geholpen weer in contact te komen met mijn gevoel
7212666 en er kwam wel wat meer bij kijken dan alleen stoppen met methadon ik moest nog meer stappen ondernemen zeg maar een stappenplan maken en wat vooral ook belangrijk was ik moest mijzelf ook aan die bepaalde afspraken gaan houden zoals meer discipline en regelmatiger leven maar nog meer dingen zoals het stoppen met contacten maken in de scene en er voor in de plaats cleane vrienden krijgen dat was een doel apart maar in de eerste plaats moest ik met bijgebruiken stoppen
7212667 its only rock nroll butt i like it like it yes i do
7212668 het eerste verhaal dat ik schreef ging over de manier waarop ik die begeleid leren opleiding beleefd had
7212669 een groot nadeel van een methadonprogramma is dat je er iedere dag heen moet en iedere dag zie je dan dezelfde mensen die allemaal volop gebruiken en scoren en van alles doen om aan dope te komen met de nodige verhalen van iedereen
7212670 daardoor kreeg ik die gesprekken met k k heeft mij achteraf zo gepusht om door te zetten vooral toen ik wekelijks terugviel dan een paar dagen niets en dan weer wel ik kon gewoon niet in een keer stoppen maar k bleef in mij geloven als ik dan vertelde dat ik weer had gebruikt dan zei hij dat dat helemaal niet erg was hij stelde mij dan gerust en ik hoefde mij niet schuldig te voelen wat wel zo was maar dat zei hij telkens hij bleef in mij geloven ik heb daarom heel veel aan hem te danken en mede door zijn pep talk ben ik helemaal afgekickt
7212671 zelf zocht en vond ik de psychiater die ik nog kende van het ziekenhuis
7212672 het vervolgprogramma van een half jaar in rotterdam overschie de eerste drie maanden heb ik mij heel goed kunnen aanpassen en heb serieus geprobeerd vol te houden en niet meer terug te vallen dat is nog wel een paar keer gebeurd maar je krijgt tegenwoordig de kans om het opnieuw te proberen
7212673 tijdens die begeleid leren opleiding werd ik omringd door allemaal maatjes die ook na alle ellende weer iets op wilden starten
7212674 de docent van een opleiding is heel belangrijk geweest zij bleef in mij geloven ook toen ik de opleiding wilde afbreken ze vertelde me dat ook meerdere malen omdat ik haar durfde te vertrouwen ging ik toch door
7212675 its only rock nroll butt i like it like it yes i do
7212676 its only rock nroll butt i like it like it yes i do
7212677 its only rock nroll butt i like it like it yes i do
7212678 een groot nadeel van een methadonprogramma is dat je er iedere dag heen moet en iedere dag zie je dan dezelfde mensen die allemaal volop gebruiken en scoren en van alles doen om aan dope te komen met de nodige verhalen van iedereen
7212679 ik hield het psychische lijden vooral in stand door de oorzaak geheim te houden
7212680 ik had het geluk dat mijn divisiemanager geloofde in ervaringsdeskundigheid
7212681 op een gegeven moment na jaren eigenlijk toen ik voor de tweede keer was teruggevallen op mijn 40 ste heb ik mij erbij neergelegd ik zou altijd methadon blijven slikken ook op aandringen van mijn psychiater die dat verstandiger vindt voor mij is het nu gewoon een medicijn iedere dag neem ik mijn pilletjes in en ik krijg het nu via de apotheek dus ik hoef die scene ook niet meer in
7212682 ik ben nog steeds bezig met het zoeken naar een behandeling waardoor die beelden verdwijnen ze lijken wel gemetseld in mijn brein maar ik zal er iets op vinden
7212683 ik kon het toen niet ik kon niet stoppen of stabiliseren in feite was ik wel gemotiveerd alleen was het onmogelijk voor me om het waar te maken ik was nog maar net begonnen met druggebruik dat betekende dat ik er nog niet aan toe was om de knop weer om te draaien nogmaals en echt waar ik wou oprecht van de drugs af maar ik genoot gewoon nog van het gebruiken en vooral van die wit het was zeker in het begin heel erg kicken en een geweldig gevoel een overweldigend gevoel dat ik telkens weer tot in het oneindige wou ervaren en meemaken
7212684 uiteindelijk werd ik ernstig depressief opgenomen in een psychiatrisch ziekenhuis
7212685 je ziet het niet meer zitten maar je hebt toch twee kinderen
7212686 toen besloot ik helemaal geen communicatie meer te hebben en hield mijn mond dicht
7212687 bij mij kwam de ommekeer toen ik langzaam maar zeker steeds kwader werd
7212688 ik ging steeds meer gebruiken en steeds meer verwijderde ik me van harry en de kinderen terwijl ik iedere dag eigenlijk wou stoppen werd ik meegesleurd in de dagelijkse spiraal van scoren en gebruiken om afkickverschijnselen te voorkomen deed ik het tegenovergestelde
7212689 ik was wel gemotiveerd maar toch kreeg ik mezelf niet in beweging
7212690 wel kreeg ik na een tijdje gesprekken met k k bleek later een hele goede hulpverlener en heeft zoveel invloed op mij gekregen dat ik mede door zijn motivatie en pep talk uiteindelijk clean ben geworden maar eerst moest ik er nog achter komen dat men toen weinig voor mij kon doen en dat het in de eerste plaats erop aan komt dat jezelf moet helpen en stappen moet ondernemen om niet meer te gebruiken
7212691 een hulpverlener zei eens met verheffing van stem je ziet het niet meer zitten maar je hebt toch 2 kinderen deze opmerking bezorgde me alleen nog maar meer schuldgevoelens
7212692 als ze me behandelen zal ik me beter en niet depressief en minder alleen gaan voelen
7212693 door die folder kwam ik op het cad ik had hoge verwachtingen van de hulpverlening zij zouden al mijn problemen oplossen zij wisten wel raad zij konden mij helpen zelf hoefde ik daarvoor niets te doen dacht ik als ik hierop terugkijk denk ik nu dat ik toen totaal in het diepe werd gegooid ik wist niet wat ik kon verwachten
7212694 jij je problemen zelf moet oplossen en wij je daarbij alleen kunnen ondersteunen
7212695 alleen mijn familie had ik nog vooral mijn vader en mijn oma
7212696 voor mij is het belangrijk geweest dat mijn relatie stand hield mijn man bleef me trouw zorgde voor de kinderen en hield het huishouden draaiende daarnaast heeft hij mij nooit verwijten gemaakt
7212697 its only rock nroll butt i like it like it yes i do
7212698 ik weet wie ik ben ik ben het licht net als alle andere zielen
7212699 dit is toch echt gaaf maar weten wie ik ben is n ding maar ik wil erv ren wat het is om het licht te zijn
7212700 er is echt niets om bang voor te zijn tenzij jij ervoor kiest om dat te zijn want weet je we verzinnen het allemaal we doen alsof
7212701 want zonder het tegenovergestelde kun je niets ervaren je kunt geen warm ervaren zonder koud geen boven zonder beneden geen snel zonder langzaam je kunt geen links zonder rechts ervaren geen hier zonder daar en geen nu zonder toen dus
7212702 bedoel je dat het goed is anderen te laten zien hoe speciaal ik ben
7212703 het is heel goed maar onthoud speciaal betekent niet beter iedereen is speciaal ieder op zijn of haar eigen manier alleen zijn velen dat vergeten zij zullen dan ook zien dat het goed is voor ze om speciaal te zijn wanneer jij ziet dat het goed voor jou is om speciaal te zijn
7212704 speciaal zijn heeft heel veel kanten het is speciaal om aardig te zijn of zachtmoedig of creatief of om geduldig te zijn kun je nog meer bedenken waarin je speciaal kunt zijn
7212705 ik kan een heleboel manieren bedenken om speciaal te zijn
7212706 het is speciaal om hulpvaardig te zijn om te delen om vriendelijk en zorgzaam te zijn voor anderen
7212707 en je kunt al deze dingen zijn of elk ander deel van speciaal dat je wilt zijn op elk moment dat is wat het betekent om het licht te zijn
7212708 ik weet wat ik wil zijn ik weet wat ik wil ervaren
7212709 ik wil dat deel van speciaal zijn dat vergevingsgezind zijn heet
7212710 dat is wat ik wil zijn ik wil vergevingsgezind zijn ik wil mijzelf ervaren als vergevingsgezind
7212711 alles wat ik heb gecre erd is perfect er is geen enkele ziel van alle creaties die minder perfect is dan jou kijk maar om je heen
7212712 ik wil mijzelf ervaren als vergevingsgezind ik wil weten hoe dat deel van speciaal voelt
7212713 ik kan in je volgende aardse leven komen en iets doen wat jij kan vergeven
7212714 jij die van zon ongelooflijke perfectie bent jij die trilt van zon snelheid dat het zon helder licht cre ert dat ik het niet kan evenaren wat kan je reden zijn dat jij je vibraties wil verlagen zodat jouw licht donker wordt wat kan de reden zijn voor iemand die zo licht is om in mijn leven te komen en jezelf zo zwaar te maken zodat je dit slechte kan doen
7212715 je hebt hetzelfde gedaan voor mij herinner je het je niet meer o we hebben gedanst samen jij en ik vele keren je herinnert je het alleen niet meer we zijn allebei alles geweest we zijn het hoge en het lage geweest het linker en het rechter we zijn het hier en het daar geweest het nu en het toen we zijn het manlijke en het vrouwelijke geweest het goede en het slechte we zijn beide het slachtoffer en de dader geweest zo zijn we samen gekomen jij en ik vele malen eerder steeds de ander de exacte en perfecte gelegenheid te geven om te uiten en te ervaren wie we werkelijk zijn en daarom
7212716 kom ik in je volgende leven en zal de slechte zijn dit keer ik zal iets heel slechts doen en dan kan jij jezelf ervaren als degene die vergeeft
7212717 ik zal mijn vibraties moeten verlagen heel zwaar worden en deze niet zulke leuke dingen doen ik zal me anders moeten voordoen dan ik in werkelijkheid ben en daarom wil ik je als dank om een gunst vragen
7212718 wat kan ik voor jou doen je bent zon engel dat je dit voor me wilt doen
7212719 iedereen is een engel herinner altijd ik stuur je niets dan engelen
7212720 op het moment dat ik jou het ergste aandoe dat je je kunt voorstellen op dat precieze moment
7212721 o dat doe ik dat beloof ik ik zal je altijd herinneren zoals ik je hier en nu zie
7212722 want weet je ik zal zo hard bezig zijn met doen alsof dat ik mijzelf zal vergeten en als jij me niet herinnert zoals ik echt ben kan ik het me misschien voor heel lang niet herinneren en als ik vergeet wie ik ben kan jij ook vergeten wie jij bent en zullen wij beiden verloren zijn dan hebben we een andere ziel nodig om langs te komen en ons te helpen herinneren wie we zijn
7212723 ik zal je herinneren en ik wil je bedanken dat je me dit cadeau wilt geven de kans om mezelf te ervaren wie ik ben
7212724 oh well thats it the library doesnt have what im looking for
7212725 ive had kind of a dry summer i had a slow meet in boise so it felt really good to be back on top and win again
7212726 she kind of hopped out of there when the race actually started but she recovered quickly
7212727 about 50 yards she just decided she wanted to run she kind of surprised me i didnt think she was going to run that well
7212728 i havent called her yet to tell her i ran second on her up here
7212729 im going to tell her they better fly her up here to ride her
7212730 that would be wonderful if i could win leading rider again
7212731 i missed the first weekend so thats going to be tough
7212732 i think ive picked up the offense pretty good since the first day of camp i think the coaches did a really good job of preparing me and preparing all the quarterbacks to run this spread offense
7212733 i think weve both done a good job throughout camp
7212734 its been a good battle casey is a great quarterback he does a really good job and hes been really helpful to me too its not like we have a rivalry or anything were both good to each other
7212735 when youve got two athletes at the same spot both will end up playing in the game
7212736 i think its great for the kids and great for everybody ive been preaching since ive been here depth depth depth now you have depth at the highest profile position on the team
7212737 i dont think anybody sees it as a problem i think everybody sees it as a blessing
7212738 it looked like he drove the field well and had some crisp throws
7212739 it was a little slow start but i thought we did a good job picking it up i thought my last scrimmage on wednesday i did a lot better
7212740 its not going to come fast enough for me my last year was real tough and ive just been waiting for an opportunity to play i cant believe im actually going to get to play a game in a week
7212741 ive been around winning programs i think thats probably the biggest thing
7212742 im used to being on teams that win a lot of games ive been around some pretty big time programs so i think were going to have the same thing going on here i think we can get it turned around
7212743 what to expect when youre expecting a simplified sfx menu
7212744 when you win 21 straight regular season games and the fact that we havent lost a big sky conference game since 05 that speaks volumes about the work thats getting done by our assistant coaches and our players
7212745 when we produce our depth chart next week youre going to see a whole bunch of freshman on it
7212746 when youre playing a lot of freshman and newcomers it takes time to get it all going im real interested to see if we can put it all together by sept 6
7212747 our rushing game was okay and we did some good things in our passing game our intensity was very good especially considering weve been practicing hard for a couple of weeks now
7212748 weve had a good 14 straight days of camp and its nice to finally to get out here and instead of not getting a lot of a contact get some live drills in
7212749 weve been waiting for it all camp its about time
7212750 we myself included have a lot to work on were just going to keep preparing for cal poly and keep pushing hard through the next week
7212751 eastern montana and billings in particular have been awfully good to us
7212752 weve had great success with them and its been a lot of fun frankly being a small town eastern montanan myself thats pretty rewarding
7212753 i dont know if this is true but i like to believe weve recruited more kids from the state of montana than any coaching staff in modern history at this university
7212754 there are a lot of teams id rather play than cal poly
7212755 we have some idea of what they do but theyre hard to prepare for thats a rough opener
7212756 if they beat us in the ashes you want to go back and get them in the next series dont you
7212757 top five will be the objective again im sure but personally i think our objective should be to beat the british even at home
7212758 were just in a low point right now but guys are still working hard and doing what we need to do
7212759 they swung the bat real well tonight the pitchers threw well and kept us off balance
7212760 all it is with josh its just a matter of confidence
7212761 the more he goes out there the more he sees it he can dominate with his stuff and the quicker hell get to where hes supposed to be hes just going to be a work in progress thats all
7212762 he did a good job knocked off the cobwebs and did a nice job for two innings
7212763 we try to get them in there and get their feet wet so theyre able to help us when we need it
7212764 i had to get the legs moving a little bit
7212765 the airs a little thin around here but i hit it well i probably should have stayed at second but i went to third anyway
7212766 i thought it was just a matter that their starter was hitting his spots
7212767 it was tough for us to get anything mounted on any of the guys we had a couple of bright spots obviously with the bat but overall we didnt have much of a chance tonight
7212768 linebaugh had to go home his wife gave birth and i think hes got school so he wont be back so he santana came in to take his place
7212769 i take them to my car a 6 pack at a time
7212770 once ive given them all away im intending to do it all over again i feel kind of like im like the johnny appleseed for murphys saloon in north texas
7212771 my next goal is to listen to all the podcasts
7212772 so to re iterate my qualifications for biggest fan i have

7212812 we come more and more to see through the follies and vanities of the world and to appreciate the real values we load ourselves up with so many false burdens our complex civilization breeds in us so many false or artificial wants that we become separated from the real sources of our strength and health as by a gulf

7212827 if i went into a room with 100 people in it and didnt know any of them id weasel my way into somebodys conversation
7212828 for four days that was as good as ive ever hit it
7212829 she told me it was all there for me to win on this tour
7212830 i liked watching the masters the last couple of years to see what they had done to the course but its not exciting for me to watch golf on tv its tough to watch guys when you feel like you should be doing what theyre doing
7212831 im named for kris kristofferson the country singer slash actor
7212832 my mom thought he was cute i think the movie the rose in which kristofferson played opposite bette midler was coming out at the time and thats where my name came from
7212833 you gotta like the guy who brings you presents every christmas
7212834 i guess the degree is for digging all that dirt at harbour town and kiawah island
7212835 wherever weve built golf courses its had an impact on the economy in those areas
7212836 they go to the ocean course to tpc sawgrass and every time i ease off on the difficulty at a resort its not financially successful
7212837 pga west in palm springs calif oh thats the worst hardest course in the world and it gets the most play theres got to be a reason
7212838 i was going to put in a little par 3 there and we had a lot of organic material with one pocket of sand and we kept digging out the sand
7212839 when we were done i said ive got no place to put a green so alice said stick it in the middle of the hole from which the organic material was excavated bulkhead it and make it an island green
7212840 we piled the old organic back under the bulkheading put a little sand on top and there it is
7212841 my only worry was we might end up someday with a 17 hole golf course
7212842 my bride has played with babe zaharias beth daniel ben hogan and still plays good golf
7212843 but at our club she plays ladies day with three ladies who cant break 120 so when it comes to par 3s she wants me to make them distinctive and hard the reason being so she can stick the ladies tee somewhere where they can play that hole better than men from the back tees
7212844 when i built kiawah she looked at 17 and said thats not strong enough youve got to put a pond there i said you cant put a pond on a hole next to the ocean so she went to scotland ireland found holes with ponds next to the ocean well if i wanted to eat
7212845 i had to dig that pond at 17 at kiawah
7212846 but i just had to dig it out she gets the blame for it
7212847 it wont be no different tomorrow night and the next night
7212848 i mean ill probably watch tv get something to eat hang out you know i aint got no routine if you aint noticed that just golf
7212849 i hit a lot of good putts that found the hole and a lot of good putts that didnt
7212850 it was definitely the best round ive played all year it was really nice
7212851 the course has been there for the taking all week
7212852 im really happy with the round because i feel it kind of threw me back in the mix
7212853 i just really burned the edge of the hole so much especially the first two days
7212854 friday i couldnt get a putt to go in thats golf sometimes its frustrating but i was making good strokes and good putts all the same i went out there saturday and finally made a few
7212855 every time i got over the ball i felt really good a lot of days when you putt well you dont feel good over all of them but i really did every time i stepped to the putt it was very very comfortable
7212856 i cant lash at a lot of drivers because theres a lot of run outs
7212857 youve got to play to your strength and thats my driver
7212858 youve kind of got to be careful i wouldnt say i throttled back but i thought well i was thinking well and going through my game plan pretty well just be smart would be a good theory
7212859 im not sure what were going to do to celebrate
7212860 i just wanted to get home i havent really slept in two nights a little before my final round on sunday but it was nervous sleep
7212861 paul was at home watching the results on the computer hitting the refresh button about a million times
7212862 there was water on the right and i knew if i didnt play well i could end up with a double bogey
7212863 before the 5 iron shot i took a deep breath i was almost crying but after the shot all the pressure went away and i realized i had a win
7212864 i missed my conditional card for 2008 by a shot
7212865 for a couple of weeks after that i was so disappointed
7212866 but i got over it i wanted to give myself another chance this professional golf has been my dream for a long time
7212867 ive learned my swing so now i know what im doing wrong when im not hitting it well
7212868 its been a long time ago since it felt this way i would have good rounds but then one day it would be hard again
7212869 i felt as long as i could par in i should be fine
7212870 i wanted to give myself short second putts nothing long
7212871 i know i can do it now it feels great to pull it off
7212872 might make it even sweeter the fact i had just a one shot lead
7212873 i kind of had a little chuckle to myself on the 18th tee
7212874 it was like well youve been talking about this its time to put up or shut up you talked a good game about just getting up there and ripping it and all that stuff and darned if i didnt do it
7212875 i saw craig earlier in the week and they were talking about a time capsule that they have buried by the courses putting green near the wall and i tried not to let myself think that if i could win here i could get my plaque up there on that wall
7212876 almost every day if i had a chance to get lunch if i wasnt playing late i would get a plate and go up in craig harmons office and we would sit up there and just talk about nothing
7212877 and billy was there until saturday morning and thats a great memory to have here this will probably be my last championship here
7212878 oh 59 his age then that will be a stretch
7212879 maybe winged foot that has a lot of harmon history too but no right at this moment i cant imagine another
7212880 the history that is here i dont know if you guys reporters have been into the historical room or whatever they call it but its got film pictures of all the championships that have been here not many clubs have something like that
7212881 so yeah that 18th hole flag is going to look good on my wall
7212882 i was five strokes behind and in a stretch of that birdie putt and playing 16 and 17 im tied for the lead
7212883 but it will definitely go down in the hall of jay
7212884 that kind of got me jump started i seen one go in and youve got a par 5 right behind it and i knocked it on in two there and made two good putts and walked away with another birdie
7212885 every time he opens his mouth i start laughing the guys full of jokes hes a positive guy so its nice to be around
7212886 i think your defending champion norways suzann pettersen has gone a little unnoticed
7212887 i think shes really starting to round into shape winning last weeks swiss open she hasnt won on the lpga tour this year yet but she comes in playing very well
7212888 statistically ochoa is not that much different from where she was last year
7212889 and i can tell you when lorenas name goes up on the leaderboard it doesnt go up without other players noticing i think that also plays a factor in her dominance they know theyre not going to get a free pass because this gal likes to win and she likes to win big
7212890 not surprising she had all the tools it was a matter i think of having a little more confidence down the stretch learning from the mistakes she had made in the past
7212891 a player that made everybody better in so many ways
7212892 the lpga is in the middle of these tv contracts putting a package together and lorena being the dominant player and annika not there to push her it leaves a bit of a question mark
7212893 the common denominator is both are power players i think annika is much more calculating more a point a to point b player who never seemed to make a big number
7212894 lorena always keeps you on the edge of your seat because theres that big number potential there
7212895 a little sort of phil mickelson arnold palmer flair there
7212896 but ochoas desire is going to be a lot like annika
7212897 her desire to play compete and be no 1 is whats going to keep her on tour keep her dominating
7212898 the best thing you can do is know your preparation is going to lead you into playing well in majors and stick to that
7212899 i knew certain shots were going to be needed for those major championships a lot like the way nicklaus did
7212900 i thought that helped me out and the timing is probably pretty similar for paula
7212901 thats for players who have earned their right into the field
7212902 but you have to put the ball in play there are places you cannot hit the ball at bulle rock and play well
7212903 i couldve done better if id made a few more putts
7212904 thats okay momma you can hit me any time you want to im okay with it
7212905 its ok everything gonna be alright what do you want to eat for breakfast
7212906 but daddy they give me medicine that causes trouble i dont want trouble

7212909 what the liberals are doing is targeting a handful of specific things in our savings package in order to play politics he told network ten
7212910 they are playing with fire because if they punch holes in the budget surplus the end result is that it is harder for the rba to reduce interest rates
7212911 the key people in the frame here are the liberal party he said
7212912 dr nelson is fond of describing himself and the liberal party as the alternative government its about time they started acting like an alternative government
7212913 there are a number of small and important measures to which we are opposed and as a matter of principle we will oppose them dr nelson told the nine network
7212914 none of those tax increases 20 billion of tax increases in the budget were foreshadowed by the government prior to the election he said
7212915 if youre fighting inflation the last thing you do is increase taxes on alcohol cars software and other functions of business

7212951 when i was first walking through the arrival gate i was just looking for him then i recognised his smile as i walked towards him i felt overwhelmed it was just a flood of emotions i put my hands to my lips i felt faint like i wasnt breathing
7212952 i didnt think id make it to him its like ive been in a dream for the last two years and now im waking up and its real
7212953 he proposed to me in a restaurant in london we were having a really deep conversation and i thought things were going really well then he looked like something else was on his mind and he just got up and left the table i was a bit worried id said something wrong then he came back with the ring and just proposed to me there and then
7212954 i said yes straight away took his hand and said i will never leave your side
7212955 i wanted the ring to be really special i bought a 400 welsh gold ring with the word cariad inscribed on it which is welsh for darling
7212956 it was so nerve wracking when i proposed i carried the ring everywhere because i didnt know where or when i was going to do it
7212957 we met in a nightclub in second life on january 11 2005 when i saw joe for the first time i thought wow look at this avatar he looked really good i told him i thought he was hauntingly beautiful
7212958 we got married on january 31 2005 three weeks seems long in a virtual world the first week we were together i realised we had something that was more than just virtual we wanted to commit to each other
7212959 i had a boyfriend at the time but if id had a vehicle and a job i would have left him when i met joe it was one big escape for me and a way of having a social life the spark between us was just overwhelming
7212960 i can 100 per cent be myself around him and he knows everything about me being with him has been really wonderful im dreading going back to the states
7212961 i used to sleep on a chair by my computer so i could fall asleep listening to her voice
7212962 i used to laugh about online relationships and now im having one of the most long lasting ones you could imagine
7212963 one thing that surprised me when we met is that hes shorter than me im 5ft 6 ins and hes 5ft 6ins in second life hes 7ft 8ins when im in three inch heels thatll be fun its ok really i like men who are shorter than me
7212964 its been fun finding out about the quirks he has that i didnt know about hes so picky im one of those people who washes things a million times a day and ive never met a man who was pickier than me before he said before we met that he hoped his habits wouldnt put me off but it doesnt
7212965 being with joe has been really wonderful weve gone around newtown together and its been a lot of fun we havent argued at all we probably argue more in second life
7212966 oh yeah we did it on the first night i dont think he expected that on the first night but i couldnt help it after being betrothed for two and a half years
7212967 and oh my god it was so much better than i expected he is just as amorous in real life as he is on the internet just as romantic and caring it was really wonderful

7212978 the graceful transition between moves the subtle fade effect when a couple switches positions makes for a more seamless visual display compared to second life
7212979 im a 42 year old straight guy married 15 years no kids i love my wife and i have remained faithful recently i opened a second life sl account and created an avatar alter ego for myself i created an sl account with a female avatar because although im straight and comfortable with my gender and sexuality ive always fantasized about being transformed into a beautiful woman and having sex with other beautiful women sl allows me an opportunity to explore this fantasy of being a lesbian and also lets me engage in types of fantasy sex play i would not normally do in real life rl such as bdsm multiple partners and anonymous sex i laid down some ground rules for myself 1 i would not form a partnership in sl 2 i would not under any circumstances discuss or reveal any details of my rl with anyone 3 i would not form emotional relationships with other avatars i have followed these rules to the letter my wife knows i have an sl account but thats it shes made it clear that she considers sex in sl to be adultery i disagree i see it as a form of user controlled porn so long as i follow the three rules above i only go on sl when she is not at home and i do not spend time in sl when i could be with her we have a normal sex life although shes not as ggg as she was when we were first married shes grown more conservative personally and sexually not politically as shes grown older i love my wife very much and i want my marriage to last but sexually im more adventurous than my wife and sl allows me to express that side of myself without any rl adultery nevertheless dan i feel guilty my wife would not be happy understatement of the young century if she knew of my sl activities and i hate lying to my wife yet at the same time im having so much fun i am exploring fantasies i never could in real life with a smoking hot female avatar ill never be should i come clean close down my sl account

7212990 since the boll weevil theres been no pest as challenging as this one without a doubt
7212991 you tend to exaggerate whatever is hot at the moment
7212992 but having said that this is a bear its resistant its very prolific it grows very fast its very competitive and its relatively hard to control to start with
7212993 its happy as it can be when other crops are suffering
7212994 an old mennonite farmer told me theres always going to be thorns and thistles
7212995 you control one thing and another crops up crab grass was our biggest nemesis for years and now its pigweed

7213031 publicar las fotos de nuestros hijos no fue una cosa que se nos ocurriera de un d a para el otro de la nada la idea vino de las estrategias que hab amos ido creando desde la dictadura para dar visibilidad a lo que nos pasaba inicialmente sac bamos solicitadas muy costosas y muy censuradas que eran m s que denuncias intentos de que aquellos que sab an algo nos lo contaran nos hablaran empapel bamos las paredes de buenos aires con las fotos de nuestros hijos y tambi n de los nietos cuando los hab an secuestrado ya nacidos

7213034 no son anuncios ni obituarios ni solicitadas son algo distinto algo que todav a est siendo inventado los llamamos recordatorios porque as los conocemos expresan la necesidad no s lo de recordar a nuestros familiares amigos y compa eros desaparecidos sino de dar pruebas de su existencia y c mo no detenerse ante una carta dirigida a otra persona pero entregada a uno

7213042 i often enjoy your writings but find it terribly hurtful for you to dismiss the sacred scriptures as being mythological the way that the myths of hercules thor kali and krishna are i dont understand how you can ignore the evidence presented in the scriptures that god exists and that he sent his only son to save us other legends do not tell about such things as the signs and wonders such as when jesus was baptized and the holy spirit descended upon him like a dove with the heavens opening up and god proclaiming this is my son in whom i am well pleased for the sake of your soul and others i wish you would consider your vows taken as a priest more seriously please explain why you feel it necessary to say such hateful things about jesus what prompted you to turn your heart against him

7213050 the council or its agents to make inquiries to corroborate this claim
7213051 the intrusiveness of the surveillance is kept to a minimum only doing the least amount necessary to obtain the information required

7213094 today with life expectancy at 78 plus if you retire at 64 youre leaving 20 percent of your entire life for retirement a very long stretch
7213095 so perhaps a rule of thumb would be for retirement to remain set at around 90 percent of the steadily elevating life expectancy
7213096 when its a child or a family member with special needs people are pretty hard and fast that theyll do all they can
7213097 you dont want to keep it parked there at 2 percent for a long period of time when the cpi is running 5 to 6 percent

7213100 the nomination of sen barack obama as the democratic partys candidate for president of the united states is a historic event in the lives of african americans so it is important for tv one to be there for our audience
7213101 while viewers can get coverage of the convention from any number of networks we plan to cover the convention from a uniquely african american perspective
7213102 in addition to platform disagreements and what senator obamas running mate is likely to say in his or her acceptance speech well talk about the parties the fashion the food and the people as well as the funny and off beat moments that happen on the convention floor
7213103 if i ever play in an olympics i want to play with her

7213105 ive worn this uniform for the last time and im leaving with my fourth gold medal
7213106 i showed them the way in some ways in games and practice and im handing it over to them its their time they have to keep it going
7213107 that is what basketball is all about its about passing the torch
7213108 your legacy of course starts with gold medals and you look at somebody like lisa and she has four
7213109 but he flew them up to me and ive had them with me ever since and in my head i just kept saying im going to have four gold medals and im going to put them on and wear them all
7213110 and then here i am still playing this is my livelihood and to be able to represent my country four times its just more than i can ask for
7213111 i figured that it must have been a slow news week which is hard to believe considering the russians invaded georgia and the olympics were getting started
7213112 we had one arch out of more than 2 000 collapse
7213113 and while it was the 12th largest arch in the park theres many more that are better known than wall arch

7213125 unfortunately we were not included because we were not close with the head of the association
7213126 only those who have strong connections with the group leaders were relocated relatively new settlers were chosen over us it did not matter that we had been living there since 1988
7213127 given the increase in fares we all decided to stay here for the moment
7213128 it is shameful but yes some middle class families have acquired land under the cmp
7213129 if you really look into it it is really unfair to the urban poor eventually one owner built a two storey which cost more than php 500 000 usd 11 400 if you can build a house costing that much then you are definitely you are not poor
7213130 it is just a matter of political will of our leaders
7213131 provide shelter to millions of homeless filipinos and at the same time address the critical problem of squatting in urban areas
7213132 we already have good laws on housing but these need to be implemented well

7213137 we are deeply concerned that our son nigel brennan may have gone missing near mogadishu in somalia yesterday
7213138 he is a freelance photographer who arrived in kenya just over a week ago
7213139 we understand that the australian government is making urgent contact with relevant somalian authorities as well as the canadian french and british embassies to help locate nigel
7213140 this is a difficult time for our family and we ask everyone to respect our privacy
7213141 we are awaiting advice from the somali government a spokeswoman said
7213142 we are also in contact with foreign governments with interests in somalia to seek their cooperation and assistance
7213143 what the liberals are doing is targeting a handful of specific things in our savings package in order to play politics he told network ten
7213144 they are playing with fire because if they punch holes in the budget surplus the end result is that it is harder for the rba to reduce interest rates
7213145 the key people in the frame here are the liberal party he said
7213146 dr nelson is fond of describing himself and the liberal party as the alternative government its about time they started acting like an alternative government
7213147 there are a number of small and important measures to which we are opposed and as a matter of principle we will oppose them dr nelson told the nine network
7213148 none of those tax increases 20 billion of tax increases in the budget were foreshadowed by the government prior to the election he said

7213153 well i was right on one account the nist national institute of standards and technology has finally released after nearly 7 years its finest work of fiction to date concerning the collapse of world trade center 7 on the afternoon of september 11 2001
7213154 it now appears likely that bush is cleaning up the remaining unsolved mysteries before he heads to crawford texas bush knows well enough that he cannot be prosecuted criminally while still in office however the federalist papers a collection of eighty five essays written by james madison alexander hamilton and john jay sets the precedent for prosecution after a president leaves office now that the anthrax attacks have identified a villain the remaining mysteries to clear up are the following the mysterious collapse of wtc building seven in the late afternoon of september 11 2001 and the hide and seek game with osama bin laden the remaining events will surely be cleared up in the coming weeks as well as low gas prices so the torch can be passed to john mccain so the same story with the same theme and plot can be continued for the next one hundred years until all of the oil is drained from the middle eastern spigot
7213155 the reason for the collapse of world trade center 7 is no longer a mystery it did not collapse from explosives or fuel oil fires
7213156 weve had trouble getting a handle on building no 7
7213157 the specifics of the fires in wtc 7 and how they caused the building to collapse remain unknown at this time although the total diesel fuel on the premises contained massive potential energy the best hypothesis has only a low probability of occurrence
7213158 first known instance of fire causing the total collapse of a tall building
7213159 sunder proceeded to stumble through some convoluted explanation for why only fire could be responsible seeming caught off guard and uncomfortable
7213160 tons of molten metal was found 21 days after the attack
7213161 steel doesnt begin to melt until 2 700 degrees which is much hotter than what these fires could have caused
7213162 there are holes in this story that you can drive a truck through
7213163 at any given location the combustibles needed about 20 minutes to be consumed
7213164 we built in enough redundancy to allow entire portions of floors to be removed without affecting the buildings structural integrity

7213167 adults under 21 are deemed capable of voting signing contracts serving on juries and enlisting in the military
7213168 but are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
7213169 an informed and dispassionate public debate over the effects of the 21 year old drinking age
7213170 most studies that i am aware of indicate that the 21 year old legal drinking age has reduced alcohol related fatalities among young people
7213171 until the data indicates otherwise i dont believe we should reverse current policies
7213172 were not for it one bit as an intelligent adult it seems clear that changing the age wont change anything about binge drinking
7213173 in louisiana alcohol is part of our culture its in front of us since were very young
7213174 until we change that until we educate the younger generation better it wont change
7213175 the services we provide except wellness will be housed in this unit
7213176 we can do things like provide wigs and scarves prostheses and nutritional supplements weve also set it up with a laptop and printer so that if someone has a particular type of cancer the personnel in the unit can look up information and print it out for them right there
7213177 we have negotiated with hospitals and doctors offices in those areas for parking space
7213178 we wanted to put it where it would be easily accessible for patients
7213179 fay is expected to move west or west northwest through monday this would place the center of fay near southeast louisiana by late sunday or early monday
7213180 in the end though we are going to have a united front
7213181 i cant wait to get back and get the job done
7213182 i was very deliberate there were so many attributes in both of them
7213183 i want to be able to network with folks throughout the country on issues that are near and dear to me
7213184 thats been a problem for us people who have been voting republican in the state have democratic needs
7213185 we wanted to begin this year with a sense of community and a sense of revival
7213186 thats a huge number out of 1 080 students im really excited about that
7213187 i love the sounds of what is this late summer
7213188 theres nothing like being able to cast that vote as a delegate on the floor and be a part of history
7213189 i was born with this right but until 1965 the right was not there
7213190 its history to me just to be involved in the process but major history to be a woman and black and be a part of this process
7213191 it sort of tells me youve worked hard and now you can see that the country is changing because millions and millions of people are working hard or have worked hard to see something happen in these united states
7213192 i like to see the involvement of the 18 to 30 year olds in the democratic process
7213193 i love it this is a revolution this is a revolution and i think a lot of it i think people snicker but its divine intervention god is putting us together to help each other
7213194 im supposed to vote however hillary clinton wants me to vote right now i have in my mind no other alternative unless she releases us to vote for someone else
7213195 i fully expect her to give us guidance at that point
7213196 we have to get everyone behind the same candidate and the same causes that hillary and obama have shared through this process
7213197 they have so much more in common than differences weve had so much apathy across the country because people have lost hope in politicians theyve been let down by their so called leaders and i think barack obama has so much support because people are hoping again
7213198 its about having a voice in what you believe in
7213199 and give them a sense of security that he can solve the problem while also allowing people to feel secure about their jobs
7213200 the two main issues for me are healthcare and education
7213201 i can only speak from what happens in the 7th congressional district i just see so many people in desperate need right now with the rising costs of health care i know what its like for a family of four just to pay health care
7213202 it starts at 7 30 a m in the morning and i was told be prepared to stay up past 11
7213203 i get to meet maybe the first black president of the united states i get to hear dynamic speakers im a social scientist ive always been fascinated by history and the political process and to get to be a part of that its a dream come true
7213204 en ei voi kisata siit mitk olympialaiset ovat suurimmat ja kauneimmat

7213208 but it was quickly becoming irrelevant in the minds of young people
7213209 smoke filled bars twenty year olds do not find that attractive
7213210 i would invite all veterans to come stand with us
7213211 that may be as simple as mowing the yard or helping with health care or just being a friendly face and a smile when they are down
7213212 people come home and the brotherhood the camaraderie is gone right when you may need it the most
7213213 we may need to change the ways we deliver the information
7213214 but the needs of todays veterans are the same as the world war i veterans we know that
7213215 in my mind i was a republican but i had not filled out the paperwork
7213216 youd think a party that was trying to lead would try to be more inclusive and bring more minorities into the party
7213217 i am confident that carl will be a solid conservative vote when he is elected
7213218 has based his campaign on fiscal responsibility and has bemoaned illegal immigrants driving without auto insurance while doing the very same thing himself
7213219 he has run a great campaign and yet he is still incredibly vulnerable because he is such an unknown quantity to so many americans
7213220 the paris hilton ad run by the mccain campaign was exactly what is already on peoples minds
7213221 all that he obama is interested in is big crowds and bright lights
7213222 we worship an awesome god in the blue states and we dont like federal agents poking around in our libraries in the red states
7213223 we coach little league in the blue states and yes weve got some gay friends in the red states we are one people all of us pledging allegiance to the stars and stripes all of us defending the united states of america
7213224 i think its exactly as close as people think it is
7213225 its dead even because he hasnt been able to make the case their biggest weakness is their hubris
7213226 a business cant compete a student cant compete our workforce cant compete
7213227 theyre not the latest and greatest and they have their difficulties
7213228 why didnt we do something 10 years ago five years ago three years ago one year ago beats the heck out of me
7213229 its the most obvious thing that we would invest a small amount of money to get our kids not just the hardware but all the software all the visual curriculum and all the teacher development
7213230 people think were much more connected in terms of the internet highway than we are
7213231 my resources are there for lesson planning for sharing ideas and getting amazing curriculum
7213232 theyre not dazzled by doing this its just natural to them they do amazing things
7213233 i just know im on a mission to find out what happened to my child
7213234 when the little dog was cut in half they had a silent witness offer for 5 000 the next day
7213235 we feel nothing has been done this is our child we need answers
7213236 i heard her scream like a scream like she was really scared
7213237 a guy rushed me with a mask and stuff and we started struggling
7213238 i heard a shot pop and i got up and turned on the light and there was blood everywhere
7213239 the groups operating in europe dont need a lot of money the cost of operations is very low
7213240 but they are very skilled at obtaining money and using criminal systems to do it they can collect thousands and thousands of dollars or euros in a few weeks it is beyond our control
7213241 it got the entire financial bureaucracy started on a wild goose chase
7213242 theres a complete disconnect between this approach and the underlying reality of how terrorism is funded
7213243 their valley metros rates went up and we were growing by leaps and bounds
7213244 its just kind of an incentive we offer to employees
7213245 studies show that students who have studied latin for at least two years score 200 300 points higher on sat and gre college exams
7213246 the only chance republicans have to beat harry mitchell is by running a positive issue oriented campaign about the future
7213247 this brings out that part of us that always wants to be free
7213248 its not every day that you see a motorcycle gang that goes to temples
7213249 secure in their reputation as the rottenest motorcycle gang in the whole history of christendom
7213250 all at once a voice said put your lights on high beam
7213251 take it off at every stop and brush your hair cause your scalp really wants it
7213252 theres a feeling in this group you wont find in any other because of how close the temple makes us
7213253 we believe that the lord is lookin out for us
7213254 heavenly father can make this bike run i know he can
7213255 cause its getting dark and weve gotta get out of here
7213256 my first wife died and heavenly father knew i needed mary we have such a great life together thank you mary
7213257 has anyone talked to you about sex about the t r a and sex
7213258 youre heart to heart youre vibrating for hours down the road if its not sex its the closest thing to it
7213259 youre finally old enough and the kids are grown and you can do what you want
7213260 we didnt tell em we had a motorcycle for a long time
7213261 usually the younger two get out all the sandwich stuff
7213262 i get a combination of things that are easy but at the same time are good for them
7213263 one of the things obviously is that mom needs to know what the kid is going to be willing to eat
7213264 if the child is part of the planning then he will be more likely to eat
7213265 it serves a dual purpose its a good source of protein as well as a dairy
7213266 to reduce pressure on prices we need to increase the supply of oil especially oil produced here at home
7213267 consider opening portions of the outer continental shelf for drilling with appropriate safeguards and without taxpayer subsidies to big oil
7213268 no matter if the country was big like america or china or small like some of the african countries i didnt even know we showed the same respect to them all
7213269 we raised the flag played the national anthem and took a group picture i think in my heart the olympics are the stage to bring countries and people together
7213270 i made a lot of friends i enjoyed the feeling in the village everybody was happy
7213271 we had three choices beef chicken a vegetable and a soup
7213272 when i went to the cafeteria for athletes guess what theirs was a hundred times better they had so many choices fruits vegetables they had chinese food american food pizza mcdonalds everything you can name
7213273 my mom is 75 and she yelled like young people
7213274 i was so happy to see her so excited i was excited too
7213275 one of the reasons for it was the debris that accumulated on the fence itself
7213276 while the bush administration may claim its taking environmental impacts of the border wall into consideration building wire mesh fences across washes prone to debris laden floods is fundamentally flawed
7213277 it doesnt take an expert hydrologist to anticipate the potential for these walls to become like dams
7213278 especially in flash flood type of storms where a lot of water and debris are generated very quickly and can pile up against the fences very rapidly
7213279 at what point do you say were not going to do this because it costs too much
7213280 well find something in our budget to pay for the difference because obviously we have to have these services
7213281 he just had the foresight to put this together and start working through these issues now
7213282 i could no longer study because i dont have a social security number so i started working full time
7213283 there have been some scholarships from private funding that students have gotten thanks to the generosity of some donors
7213284 that solved the problem for a year but not in the long run
7213285 we have had a lot of phone calls from parents and students who now are seeing their chances are becoming more limited
7213286 it seems they feel bad that by coming to the u s and trying to give their children a better life they now face this obstacle
7213287 i need to see if theres a place for me here and im afraid i wont get used to being here
7213288 besides i was afraid at college because i saw the migra immigration law enforcers there twice
7213289 this is not only about being humanitarian or doing a charity it is about investing in something healthy for our community future
7213290 they will be second class citizens and that is contradictory
7213291 they are people who grew up here they are an important part of their communities
7213292 it is remarkable we should be really proud back home there is real enthusiasm for the olympics
7213293 its inspiring to see the level of organisation in china
7213294 its a challenge they have set a very high standard and weve got to do better
7213295 i think it is the best organised olympics everybody says so but as the focus moves today to 2012 then people will look at london look at britain afresh and theyll see that were a tremendously diverse country theyll see that were totally focused on inspiring people through sports
7213296 the british public would find it strange if there was no british team
7213297 this will then not provoke a long and endless discussion of the four british associations
7213298 the issue is whether would affect the autonomy of the individual associations
7213299 i talked to mr blatter about how we could find a solution to this and i am confident fifa will give the assurances that the scottish welsh and irish associations want
7213300 i am also confident that when the people of scotland wales and northern ireland know that matches will be taking place outside london they will approve of this idea
7213301 we all want to see a great britain football team its the right thing to do to have a successful olympics
7213302 try to commit myself to something that is four years ahead
7213303 im absolutely flattered that my name is being mentioned about managing the great britain team
7213304 would i take it if they offered it to me absolutely i would be a fool not to ive had some great managerial jobs during my career but there is no doubt this would be the icing on the cake
7213305 the fact it is being held on my old stamping ground in east london makes it even more appealing
7213306 die olympischen spiele in peking waren f r adidas ein riesiger erfolg sowohl in china als auch weltweit
7213307 was markenpr senz w hrend der olympischen spiele angeht so waren wir in allen sportarten eindeutig die f hrende marke wir haben erstklassigen service und attraktive produkte geboten die speziell f r peking entwickelt wurden auch in der kommunikation haben wir durch unsere kampagne together in 2008 impossible is nothing akzente gesetzt sie hat beim cannes festival den ersten goldenen l wen f r china gewonnen somit haben uns die olympischen spiele in peking einen gro en schritt voran gebracht in unserer mission die f hrende sportmarke der welt zu werden
7213308 wir haben bereits die uefa euro 2008tm in sterreich und der schweiz genutzt um unsere f hrende position im fu ball weiter auszubauen und jetzt haben wir bei den olympischen spielen erneut gezeigt dass die marke adidas das herzst ck des sports ist durch die plattform der olympischen spiele 2008 in peking hat adidas hinsichtlich umsatz marktanteil und wahrnehmung der marke in china die marktf hrerschaft bernommen
7213309 unsere olympische reise geht weiter wir haben bereits mit den vorbereitungen f r die olympischen spiele 2012 in london begonnen wo adidas erneut official sportswear partner sein wird
7213310 wir sind auf dem besten weg unser ziel f r den konzernumsatz in china von mehr als 1 milliarde bis 2010 zu erreichen
7213311 die erfolgreichen olympischen spiele in peking hinterlassen ein verm chtnis f r den sport in china und f r alle marken unseres konzerns daher bin ich berzeugt dass wir in den kommenden jahren weiterhin dynamisches wachstum in diesem markt verzeichnen werden

7213320 in der schule war ich immer au enseiter und das ist auch lange so geblieben
7213321 ich habe ihn immer als laune des schicksals bezeichnet weil ich schauspieler geworden bin ohne an ruhm und reichtum zu denken
7213322 egal welches gericht sie zubereitete es hat mir immer gut geschmeckt
7213323 sie hat mir nie verraten was es tats chlich war ich vermute die geheime zutat war ihre liebe
7213324 irgendwann habe ich lautstark verk ndet dass in unseren vier w nden keine demokratie herrscht sondern eine autokratie was meine frau oder ich sagen das gilt es gibt keine diskussion warum das so ist

7213331 he has more experience at a parochial school than i have so he has insight that i dont have
7213332 its exciting to have him the way he handled himself through the lean years and the way he handled himself when he was successful well it speaks a lot about him he was gracious when he lost and it made him more motivated to work harder and he was humble when they won
7213333 one thing he inherited from his father besides the ability to coach is his ability to talk
7213334 you are unlikely to see games of this stature ever again
7213335 on one hand people will understand china better with all its challenges they will remain critical on many issues that is their right on the other hand the chinese definitely have experienced that they cannot live in splendid isolation
7213336 you should not look on the international olympic committee to solve the worlds problems

7213345 i was afraid the helicopter was going to blow up but i didnt know how to shut it off
7213346 the first time it flew over it didnt sound right it was making a rapping sound
7213347 he came down and then went up about 100 feet and that is when i saw him go down
7213348 its a great thing to honor the people on flight 93 by putting together all three attack sites the pentagon the world trade center and pennsylvania
7213349 its a shame it was a beautiful day a perfect day
7213350 they had a police boat driving down the coast 20 yards out and lifeguards collecting the needles with shovels plastic buckets and paper bags
7213351 i know ben stiller has said that hes making fun of actors not people with disabilities still the movie is geared toward a younger crowd and i fear a lot of those teenagers will leave the theater thinking retard is an ok word to use
7213352 i have a mentally handicapped brother and when we were growing up all i heard was the word retard
7213353 people called him that and other cruel names it was terribly painful for both of us
7213354 i hope she will get it in time to wear to the convention

7213357 im a self proclaimed workaholic all i do is work
7213358 im always working on my craft as a songwriter working on trying to find that best song
7213359 i go home spend time with my family sit on the couch watch television and eat doritos
7213360 its really not that difficult its just a matter of taking your time
7213361 its been my life dream to get my home off the road
7213362 to see something so large and heavy being moved so delicately is unbelievable these guys are like surgeons theyre amazing
7213363 ive told everyone theres one thing i want to do before i die
7213364 people are coming in here all the time asking for him
7213365 either he owes them money or they gave him a down payment on a job and he ran out on them
7213366 beaten so badly that he would have to be hospitalized
7213367 cimino provided women from a local gentlemens club to act as ring girls and cocktail waitresses
7213368 look maybe in delaware county they thought he was a tough guy from downtown
7213369 but downtown we knew who frankie was he was nobody
7213370 he was funny if you sat here talking with him youd be laughing but you could never believe anything he told you
7213371 i think in four years he changed the name of his company six times
7213372 he told me not to cash it for a week
7213373 i waited a couple of days then went to the bank they told me there was no money in the account
7213374 unfortunately weve been operating in a system of crisis management and wed like to go to one of strategic planning
7213375 new jersey commission on rationalizing health care resources final report
7213376 theres a lot of meat left in the reinhardt commission report that hasnt been acted upon
7213377 its enough money to stay alive but not enough money to grow
7213378 it sounds like in my opinion were going to be limping along with this charity care problem and no health care reform for a number of years
7213379 gerade in diesen f r die spd schwierigen zeiten k nnen wir einen erfahrenen fahrensmann wie ihn bestens gebrauchen

7213397 u s sen barack obamas presidential campaign paid more than 800 000 to an offshoot of the liberal association of community organizations for reform now for services the democrats campaign says it mistakenly misrepresented in federal reports
7213398 barack obamas failure to accurately report his campaigns financial records is an incredibly suspicious situation that appears to be an attempt to hide his campaigns interaction with a left wing organization previously convicted of voter fraud for a candidate who claims to be practicing new politics his fec reports look an awful lot like the old style chicago politics of yesterday
7213399 all of this just seems like an awful lot of money and time spent on political campaigning for an organization that purports to exist to help low income consumers
7213400 acorn has a long and sordid history of employing convoluted enron style accounting to illegally use taxpayer funds for their own political gain
7213401 now it looks like acorn is using the same type of convoluted accounting scheme for obamas political gain
7213402 assist persons and organizations who advance the interests of low and moderate income people
7213403 we are organized specifically not to make money but we make money there are no profits we have a staff of 60 people around the country and that eats up our entire profit were not a for profit corporation but we are not a group like a united way
7213404 acorn has a lot of different partner organizations we are a partner but we are separate
7213405 researchers at the university of melbournes burnley campus are examining the suitability of australian native plants in green roofs shallow rooftop gardens which are becoming increasingly popular internationally for their environmental and energy saving benefits green roofs have amazing potential but have not yet been evaluated under australian climatic conditions we will be examining the suitability of selected native plants for green roofs by measuring their survival growth rate and response to drought stress
7213406 a canadian study found that a green roof reduced daily energy use during summer by 75 90 compared to a control roof the installation of green roofs could therefore form an important adaptive response to climate change by directly and indirectly reducing the energy demands of urban buildings
7213407 we will establish an experimental green roof and monitor its effect on roof temperatures and the building energy budget by comparing it to an otherwise identical control roof
7213408 green roof plants used overseas are typically from arid mountainous or coastal environments plants need to be robust and low in height so they dont get blown off the roof have good drought tolerance like exposure to full sun and are easily maintained
7213409 we have selected a range of australian and exotic species to trial that meet these criteria including herbs and grasses that grow in the native grasslands west of melbourne and succulents from arid inland regions
7213410 cities in the uae arent growing in a way that their design respects this environment this climate
7213411 we want to do urban design in such a way that is as if it grew here naturally we want to create an identity here
7213412 the strategy was to maintain the existing landscape to preserve it in its most original form
7213413 this hasnt been done in dubai most of the buildings here could be anywhere in the world but we have a unique climate it makes sense to design with it in mind
7213414 we want different types of families people of different ages different incomes and different ethnicities to live here
7213415 we want to use the sun as passively as possible meaning we dont want to build a big alternative energy machine said mr ali with pvc panels we can direct energy to the grid and light spaces like the lobbies of buildings and parking areas which will be underground
7213416 people want to be able to say they are being green the building is green
7213417 but we need to sustain sustainability and that means more education and laws
7213418 fields of plenty a farmers journey in aearch of real food and the people who grow it
7213419 here is where we make granola and butter cookies and the galaxy cookies for the planetarium
7213420 here were cutting up the croissants for tomorrow here are the pastries
7213421 this crop these are all heirloom varieties was seeded maybe in the middle of july
7213422 by the time we take them down the vines will have stretched maybe 60 feet and look like spaghetti all over the damn place
7213423 the sun just came out weve had no sun for four days nothing but rain
7213424 when i built the original greenhouse my goals was to get tomatoes in the winter
7213425 i ran the exhaust pipes of these ovens that are going all the time throughout the buildings beneath us here up into the greenhouse
7213426 for instance i thought theory one was that in order to have a really good tasting tomato you had to grow it in soil
7213427 i brought in twenty different people everybody had a different opinion
7213428 i found that i couldnt really measure any difference between growing with these 500 watt sodium lights and spending 18 000 on electricity and during the period that we werent getting tomatoes which was january and february we didnt get them with lights either
7213429 but tomatoes didnt like fifty to seventy they liked sixty to seventy five but all the greens loved it so after one or two unsuccessful years with tomatoes i went to greens in this greenhouse
7213430 i had opened a little restaurant that was on the other side of the street
7213431 my original idea was that we were going to do something very special and grow fresh food for it all year round
7213432 because theres nothing in the zoning code in new york city that permits this i dont know what we got it under but i do know that it was something other than greenhouse theres nothing called greenhouse in manhattan this is the gold coast in new york the apartments go for millions of dollars here this was an anomaly
7213433 is a relic of efforts to settle the west allows mining companies to claim federal lands for 5 an acre or less and then take gold silver lead or other hard rock minerals with no royalty payments to the public treasury thanks to the anachronistic 1872 mining act mining companies including foreign companies extract billions of dollars worth of minerals a year from federal lands royalty free change is regularly blocked by western lawmakers
7213434 obama said the legislation favored by environmentalists places a significant burden on the mining industry and could have a significant impact on jobs he also opposes the proposed fees
7213435 we are absolutely delighted with the unicorn grocery project but are just as pleased with the amount of interest it is generating
7213436 green roofs are a key part of the biodiversity action plan for greater manchester and we are planning some big projects to meet our targets for encouraging the black redstart
7213437 to say that these are interesting times is an understatement i dont want to use the word explosion of green roofs but watch this space we are working very hard to increase the number of green roofs and north west development agency is very keen to see more it is the plan that all new schools will have green roofs

7213443 glauben sie dass die in tiflis stationierten us milit rberater georgien zum waffengang ermutigt haben
7213444 so weit w rde ich nicht gehen aber jedermann wei dass es diese us milit rberater in georgien gibt eine stationierung die ich nie f r besonders klug gehalten habe und es w re schon merkw rdig wenn diese experten keine informationen gehabt h tten entweder waren sie sehr unprofessionell oder wurden regelrecht get uscht kaum denkbar

7213447 wenn der staat versucht chancengerechtigkeit herzustellen dann untergr bt er damit die entscheidende motivation f r sozialen aufstieg indem er den eltern die verantwortung f r die zukunft ihrer kinder nimmt
7213448 statt einer gerechtigkeitsgesellschaft brauchen wir eine aufstiegsgesellschaft und das bedeutet einen wandel in den k pfen nicht in der verteilung materieller mittel das schl sselwort liberaler bildungspolitik lautet also nicht chancengerechtigkeit die letztlich ein anspruchsdenken gegen ber dem staat bedient sondern leistungsbereitschaft und zwar nicht nur bei den sch lern sondern genauso bei den eltern
7213449 unsere gesellschaft befindet sich heute in einem zustand in dem weite teile von ihr erst wieder den wert von bildung lernen m ssen die gesellschaft ist hier wie in vielen dingen gefragt nicht der staat oder die politik
7213450 grundlage der gerechtigkeit ist die gleichheit aller menschen in ihrer von gott gegebenen w rde und freiheit
7213451 gerechtigkeit fordert die anerkennung der pers nlichen leistung und anstrengung ebenso wie den sozialen ausgleich gerechtigkeit verlangt gleiches gleich und ungleiches ungleich zu behandeln
7213452 auch politisches handeln st t wegen der unzul nglichkeit der menschen an grenzen
7213453 gerechtigkeit schlie t die bernahme von pflichten entsprechend der leistungsf higkeit des einzelnen zum wohle des ganzen ein
7213454 die so verstandene leistungsorientierte gerechtigkeit wird zu einer erfolgsethik die besagt derjenige der erfolgreich ist ist gerechterweise erfolgreich derjenige der trotz erbrachter leistung nicht erfolgreich ist ist gerechterweise nicht erfolgreich

7213461 the improvement in online customer service is a great example of how customers are driving change and adding value throughout the sales funnel from awareness to pre sales to guided selling to post sales service when i started following the online space in the mid to late nineties customer service at least from a systems perspective was all about enterprise employee facing crm systems that werent built to include or even involve the customer in the product discovery and sales process today in what i call the web too ohhh business climate smart companies realize that the customer is also a key part of the product discovery effort both direct marketers and multichannel sellers are embracing emerging technologies and business practices where the customer actively participates as instigator influencer and increasingly as online video engages us all impresario customer reviews social networks that scale word of mouth discovery and other improvements in product discover via search and richer interfaces are all pulling the customer into the center of the selling circle the smart money realizes customers will engage themselves if the seller will facilitate buyer collaboration by investing in some relatively inexpensive new technologies and online services good customer service is this and more today simply put it is the ability to work with customers the way they want you to work with them

7213463 we are deeply concerned that our son nigel brennan may have gone missing near mogadishu in somalia yesterday
7213464 he is a freelance photographer who arrived in kenya just over a week ago
7213465 we understand that the australian government is making urgent contact with relevant somalian authorities as well as the canadian french and british embassies to help locate nigel
7213466 this is a difficult time for our family and we ask everyone to respect our privacy
7213467 we are awaiting advice from the somali government a spokeswoman said
7213468 we are also in contact with foreign governments with interests in somalia to seek their cooperation and assistance
7213469 if they beat us in the ashes you want to go back and get them in the next series dont you
7213470 top five will be the objective again im sure but personally i think our objective should be to beat the british even at home

7213484 on your way to the hospital did it cross your mind that your life was never going to be the same
7213485 in the next few months you should continue to see a slowdown even in asia china is slowing down buyback activity may not pick up until early next year
7213486 a slowdown in buybacks unless there is some dramatic external change would be because corporate asia does not want to run its cash reserves down any further
7213487 earnings downgrades particularly for 2009 have got a way to go the big picture problem is we have never had a credit crisis like this so no one is quite sure how long it will depress western demand
7213488 the pace of buybacks will depend on managements view on the economy so if the economy deteriorates more sharply then the company will need to retain more cash
7213489 so far the consensus is earnings growth and economic development will improve over 2008

7213701 the justification for a university is that it preserves the connexion between knowledge and the zest for life by uniting the young and the old in the imaginative consideration of learning the university imparts information but it imparts it imaginatively at least this is the function which it should perform for society a university which fails in this respect has no reason for existence this atmosphere of excitement arising from imaginative consideration transforms knowledge a fact is no longer a bare fact it is invested with all its possibilities it is no longer a burden on the memory it is energizing as the poet of our dreams and as the architect of our purposes thus the proper function of a university is the imaginative acquisition of knowledge a university is imaginative or it is nothing at least nothing useful imagination is a contagious disease it cannot be measured by the yard or weighed by the pound and then delivered to the students by members of the faculty it can only be communicated by a faculty whose members themselves wear their learning with imagination in saying this i am only repeating one of the oldest of observations more than two thousand years ago the ancients symbolised learning by a torch passing from hand to hand down the generations that lighted torch is the imagination of which i speak the whole art in the organisation of a university is the provision of a faculty whose learning is lighted up with imagination this is the problem of problems in university education and unless we are careful the recent vast extension of universities in number of students and in variety of activities will fail in producing its proper results by the mishandling of this problem

7213765 what are you talking about the mill used over 1 million tons of chips a year
7213766 with respect to the wood supply for our project the argument made by mr listen is completely erroneous the former fraser mill and the groveton mill used far more wood chips than our project will require we are working with cousineau forest products a company keenly involved in providing a significant portion of the wood chip requirements of the former mills when you analyze the wood procurement plan for the former mills it is clear that biomass needs to come not only from the immediate vicinity of the plant but also from longer distances as well as long haul and rail we have developed a similar plan for our project and our economics are radically different than those of a greenfield plant like mr listons supposed project so we can pay more for biomass and still make a profit indeed when you develop a financial model for a project like berlin you specifically look at the economic impact of a radical increase in fuel prices since fuel represents such a large part of the projects operating costs

7213818 es geht nicht mehr um politische appelle es geht vielmehr um die konkrete umsetzung des von der landesregierung formulierten ziels den fl chenverbrauch einzud mmen
7213819 k nftig wird im elr ein deutliches gewicht auf fl chensparendes und kologisch sinnvolles bauen gesetzt
7213820 von diesem jahr an stehen j hrlich 50 millionen euro statt bislang 40 millionen euro zur verf gung
7213821 es geht darum den landschaftsverbrauch zu reduzieren indem inner rtliche geb ude und grundst cke aktiviert werden
7213822 jetzt geht es nur noch um die frage wo und wie gebaut wird das einkommen der bauherren spielt keine rolle mehr
7213823 urspr nglich war melap als einmalige aktion gedacht um die nachhaltige entwicklung von d rfern und gemeinden weiter zu st rken starten wir jetzt aber eine zweite runde
7213824 die b rgermeister in den 13 bisher beteiligten modellgemeinden haben rund 50 prozent des inner rtliche potenzials untersch tzt
7213825 wir brauchen einen bewusststeinswandel bei kommunalpolitikern und planern aber auch bei b rgern und bauherren mit dem ziel verantwortungsbewusster mit grund und boden umzugehen
7213826 wenn der dorfkern reaktiviert wird dann wird die ganze dorfgemeinschaft lebendiger

7213828 those who have a personal agenda or with narrow and negative perspectives
7213829 personal agendas with a narrow and negative perspective but it does not make them wrong or me right
7213830 a new york biomass developer laidlaw energy group is looking to raise about 100 million in expansion capital via a merger or initial public offering within the coming year
7213831 lets face it suing a small town of 2 000 people for 30m because they wont give you a permit doesnt ring true in too many circles not even with folks with money
7213832 i have a hard time accepting any use of that property that does not allow for the traditional use by local residents
7213833 first is the possibility that some well to do dude wishing to get away from it all buys the whole town and builds his get away castle right in the middle of his kingdom as the rich get richer and more paranoid this is happening all over the country just a few miles from the berlin airport his royal highness can jet in and be safe and hiding from his daily routine threats in a few minutes with electronic devices securing the borders of the kingdom and behind locked gates our access to the property would come to an end with the signature on a check made to mr dillon
7213834 i have a hard time accepting any use of that property that does not allow for the traditional use by local residents
7213835 communism argues that only collective ownership of the means of production through a polity though not necessarily a state will assure the minimization of unequal or unjust outcomes and the maximization of benefits and that therefore private property which in communist theory is limited to capital should be abolished both communism and some kinds of socialism have also upheld the notion that private property is inherently illegitimate this argument is centered mainly on the idea that the creation of private property will always benefit one class over another giving way to domination through the use of this private property
7213836 this sector of the market is really really strong right now
7213837 dual listings offer the advantage of trading in more than one jurisdiction to appeal to a more diverse group of shareholders
7213838 we feel the economics arent there for greenfield because we can acquire these assets at or near liquidation value the significantly lower capital cost of our projects allow for better returns
7213839 i feel it should be a community city owned forest and berlin should annex the lower township
7213840 there is absolutely no problem with providing woodchips to berlin for its proposed power plant there is no lack of supply there is an over abundance woodchips could also come from maine where there are massive quantities dont listen to certain posters who are trying to spread doubt and fear the truth is berlin will have plenty of fuel for their boiler and the wood type used does nothing to impact the lumber industry laidlaw could build 25 biomass power plants in nh and all would have plenty of fuel check out google earth and look at all that green
7213841 if this thing really goes im going to get a piece of the business
7213842 the most important aspect as this new council moves forward is to invoke the will of the citizens of the city of berlin
7213843 at 140 i just dont know how to explain it were surprised
7213844 much of what were seeing today could have been prevented or ameliorated had we chosen to act differently
7213845 they will work if you coerce the entire system and if you pretend the american people are japanese and europeans
7213846 our culture favors driving long distances in powerful vehicles and the car as a social expression
7213847 weve got to fix it or our standard of living will change within a decade
7213848 oil was too damn cheap its too high now and its going even higher i hope im wrong but the problem is we cant catch up soon enough
7213849 it was one of the most frustrating issues in my senate career
7213850 but had we passed that bill wed be using three million barrels less oil a day now
7213851 the american auto industry has sold the cars people wanted
7213852 youre going to blame the auto industry for that or the american consumer he likes it sitting in his driveway he likes it big he likes it safe
7213853 a society can work can function and can grow even at higher fuel prices
7213854 its a way of life you get used to it
7213855 this was a stark lesson and people decided the gas tax was the third rail of public policy
7213856 that caused a sea change and after that no one had any sympathy for the oil industry
7213857 by the time there is panic people need to realize this there is no quick fix on this by the time you panic it is way too late
7213858 we are investing in our business at record levels around 25 billion this year
7213859 the 1990s were something of a lost decade for american fuel efficiency
7213860 its part of a long pattern in which democrats and republicans have not wanted to wade into this issue
7213861 the auto companies didnt see the handwriting on the wall
7213862 the auto companies would go to people and say if you vote for cafe standards the auto plant in your district could shut down they got the message
7213863 nothing was ever said directly but it would go through the minds of members that detroit might respond
7213864 way over the top you dont just pull up or put down auto plants
7213865 we talked with our friends and indicated what it did with jobs you want support
7213866 its a shame were doing this now instead of 10 or 20 years ago
7213867 it was always my hope they would just do it without a mandate
7213868 republicans arent all wrong when they talk about increasing supplies of oil there are opportunities in the gulf of mexico
7213869 they all said to us dont change cafe itll come when its supposed to thats baloney
7213870 but lets face it little was being done they are suffering the consequences and could go broke just like the airlines
7213871 we have seen more of a shift in the market than in 20 years of cafe people are buying what they need
7213872 ive been a little surprised at what has not been done or what has not been talked about to get a handle on the consumer situation
7213873 most of where we are is because of fundamentals and concern about the future
7213874 to his project is not based on solving the energy crisis or being green its about wishing for a new identity
7213875 forget about the wood supply that will not help the transmission line issue is not one to hang your hat on either
7213876 the mill would be operating just a few blocks from my offices
7213877 this is like being in a boxing ring and leading with your chin
7213878 what is an extremely powerful message in this report is the need for human society as a whole to start looking at changes in lifestyle and consumption patterns
7213879 no matter its size or thickness no piece of paper can be folded in half more than 7 times
7213880 and as you stare sadly at your block of folded paper you tend to agree
7213881 the world was a great place when i made the twelfth fold
7213882 a new era is beginning it will be the era of darkness we have turned our backs to the light and stepped from its path ahead of us looms nothing but the long long night a time without warmth or comfort
7213883 this planet is so unusual that at first we thought it was a false alarm something that appeared to be a planet but wasnt
7213884 but we eliminated every other possibility so we knew we had a really weird planet
7213885 we estimate that it has a high surface gravity around 15 times greater than the earth
7213886 if earth had such an elliptical orbit it would be really strange like going from mercury to mars
7213887 it is possible that hat p 2b is interacting with another planet further out that we havent seen
7213888 you dont go out there to do something as stupid as to win an award
7213889 we are capturing the sound for posterity we do not know where the music is going to be heard
7213890 san francisco schools earned bragging rights on state standardized tests again this year performing better than the state as a whole across every grade in both math and english but any celebration was clouded by the subpar proficiency of the districts african american students who continued to fall further behind their peers

7213896 it was her caring nature and hard work and she taught me that if you are going to learn to be successful you have to be there for the kids
7213897 i like to see their growth from when they first start to what they become
7213898 our school was on fiscal distress and we have not had a budget for art supplies last year i spent maybe 80 in art supplies
7213899 during our open house i pointed out the full shelves it means a lot to us
7213900 students are always excited about art class they have to peek at the tables to see what project were going to do before class starts
7213901 this is a fabulous opportunity for our stu dents to use art supplies they might not be able to use usually our budget allows for basic art supplies but this has special items like a lot of different types of paper self drying clay so we wont have to use a kiln glitter paints and broader brushes
7213902 art helps students with their creativity and their left brain function which completes the whole learning package after theyve been to art class theyre more focused in class
7213903 it is an abundance of art supplies that is going to touch the lives of more than 900 stu dents some of the items include face paint some really neat clay and sidewalk chalk whichis something the kids just love
7213904 the program started because we were sick and tired of watching our teachers pull money out of their own pockets to buy art supplies when they dont make that much money in the first place
7213905 and a lot of arkansas families are poor so they shouldnt have to pay for it either
7213906 and with art supplies youre not talking about reusable resources
7213907 they run out every year so ultimately it should be a budget thing not some nonprofit trying to help but until then well try to help because its a chronic problem
7213908 its been a pretty crazy ride here for the last few weeks
7213909 but all of the guys have really pulled together and supported each other
7213910 im not going there to die im going to validate my reason for living
7213911 i am an l a baby and never had plans to move
7213912 we didnt leave because we didnt like it we just felt pulled
7213913 my husband got a job as an engineer with the arkansas department of environmental quality and our house in california sold immediately it was meant to be
7213914 since ive been home it has gone by so fast
7213915 i felt like the 80 percent that was falling by the wayside were my children we own our time now family affairs and church programs basically our lives set our pace now
7213916 we would break open the book and see what the baby looked like at that point we were also able to take the week of his birth and treat it as a family learning experience we didnt have to hurry to make up tests etc it was an important event life didnt have to just go on as usual
7213917 we go to first baptist church in clinton and with 400 to 500 members it is considered big around here
7213918 our friends would freak out if they saw the bee branch population sign 69
7213919 for the past year i woke up about 7 a m and started class at 8 25 a m its a school youve got to do the work but mom always communicates what she expects in our language
7213920 i enjoyed taking science with my dad on saturdays i especially liked my fish labs when athenas friends were spending the night i held up the dissected bodies and asked them if them if they wanted to help
7213921 seriously we found a tiny fish in its stomach and when we dissected a frog we found a beetle
7213922 yes i want them to make good grades but most importantly the goal is to learn progress depends on retaining information and learning new skills because i want to prepare them for college the tests are closed book although after noting the grade they are allowed to open the book to re do they have the opportunity to amend their tests
7213923 she constructs lots of different cultures and languages in her head athenais more of a traditional storyteller
7213924 i really want to be a writer of short stories and i enjoy reading it would be so cool to write books for others my books would be fantasy adventures
7213925 i think movies have more impact on the world today than any other medium
7213926 i love being able to cater to my childrens individual needs
7213927 i think when they are confident in who they were created to be they will fit better in our community
7213928 i loved my career and i earned good money and i really miss that sometimes i know my family in california thinks im a little whacked but i am so grateful homeschooling came into our lives i missed so much of their early years im making up for it now
7213929 do you think im gonna make my bed for the next year
7213930 i heard them one night a long time ago when i was fishing here with an old river ratwho lived in a shantyboat down by the mouth of the white
7213931 the old man said that sound you hear is the sound of the orchestra that drowned every year their ghosts come back and play the same eerie melody over and over again
7213932 well you and me both k now its ju st a bu nch of freshwater drum making that noise
7213933 thats how they got the name drum every year when theyre ready to spawn the males start singing to their sweethearts and making that strange noise every time i hear it though i think about that old mans story and i can almost see that old paddlewheeler coming up the river and hear that orchestra playing inside
7213934 sounds like a lot of fun especially during this heat wave when nothing else is biting much
7213935 why dont you take me and show me how its done
7213936 we havent had a problem we have a supportive basketball program
7213937 if it got to that point of not caring it would be time to go
7213938 it would be hard to leave now because i love being around these kids
7213939 when it dies there no constitution no law no court can save it
7213940 the first year i was at glenwood i stood at the end of the hallway every day for two weeks and asked every student their name but there was only 208 students
7213941 at sheridan that is nearly impossible we have 4 200 kids in the district the total population of sheridan is 3 800
7213942 when i first started college i was a businessmarketing major then i matured and realized all the people that were graduating with that degree were working in los angeles miami or new york
7213943 i didnt want that i wanted to stay in arkansas i knew i could get a job in education
7213944 the first year centerpoint consolidated one of the bus drivers quit i couldnt find a replacement so i had to drive a bus that meant that my day began early and ended late
7213945 after i finished with my bus route i began my duties as principal that included taking care of the discipline tardies mad parents media award presentations phone calls and personnel i was also athletic director which meant my nights were spent at a ballgame or track meet
7213946 i have been at mount moriah for 12 years so when i took this job i sat down and spoke with the congregation about what we were going to do i told themi didnt want to be a burden but we worked it out and i was able to continue as their pastor
7213947 i know its been a burden to them but they have been a blessing
7213948 i dont balance everything very well the church has been gracious and my family puts up with a lot
7213949 scheduling is a nightmare but my wife and i have worked out a system
7213950 my family just knows how my job is but we always find time to spend together whether its a family vacation or a lunch break
7213951 i love to go into the classroom when the students are doing some kind of special activity like reading macbeth or playing trivial pursuit in geometry i dont get to see very many kids during the day so thats always nice
7213952 i am very big on teacher morale i want to improve that and i want to improve our test scores
7213953 i want the school to score 71 percent in literacy and 81 percent in math that is an immediate goal
7213954 jesus said unto him thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind
7213955 i can do all things through christ which strengthens me
7213956 i made a resolution that i would retire at 65 and volunteer
7213957 brother mckamy was a constant friend and advisor to all ofthe mission team members on our guatemala trip
7213958 it was obvious that he was loved by the hondurans that he had previously worked with and was greatly respected by all who knew him
7213959 landscape vistas and flat water have always drawn me to them to paint
7213960 i love the far view where the elements of the landscape can change dramatically depending on the light clouds weather wind and other natural elements so it was and is that i work outdoors above and along the arkansas river in all kinds of weather to capture the everchanging scenes and moods of the river valley
7213961 as a preteen i was involved in a lot of group activities boy scouts football basketball i found i needed time each day to be myself to recharge my batteries i would often go out in the woods into the fields and what i saw interested me i was curious about all i saw outdoors once i took paper pencil and pens and drew what i saw that seemed to click for me and ive been doing it ever since
7213962 but since weve been in arkansas i find that i can paint outdoors almost all year in the summer i get up early before the sun gets too hot and when the light is just right and get most of my work done before noon
7213963 and during the rest of the year i find i can work outdoors generally with relative comfort
7213964 on rainy days i go exploring finding places i can paint when its not raining
7213965 outdoor work tends to be fresher and simpler and makes more of a direct statement than what you create if you have an unlimited amount of time to spend on the painting
7213966 i took a youth class and after our class we were allowed to stay and see what the adult artists were doing they were all very willing to take young people and explain to them what they were doing it was like a magic carpet ride for me it was a very good learning experience
7213967 but eventually i had to talk myself out of choosing art for a career
7213968 i was married and had a child on the way there are very few people who can make a living as an artist very few and far between
7213969 but ive kept working taking classes where and when i could
7213970 i consider art as a journey not as a destination
7213971 since then i have been able to create art and teach art
7213972 last summer i painted all watercolors last summer was particularly productive i painted 45 paintings in 60 days all on the spot and all early in the morning
7213973 two of the granddaughters may have been gifted with the creativeness of art
7213974 when they come to the studio sage house i cant keep them in supplies they certainly take the volume approach to creating art thats fine if only we as adults could paint like little children theyre not concerned about the outcome just turn them loose and watch them have fun
7213975 i paint because im interested in seeing things better myself and in showing others my observations
7213976 if thats what i can do to help enrich peoples lives i feel im fulfilled as an art
7213977 i perform as conway twitty we also have a roy orbison and a couple of elvises
7213978 i sang all all i want for christmas is my two front teeth people really loved to hear that little boy singing
7213979 i had a little ukulele and id stand by my brother larry who played guitar my sister kathy played the piano mom played the upright bass and dad fiddled
7213980 i love it here my wife has her business studio 1 salon im here at city hall the girls are in school just down the road were all right here in a one mile radius
7213981 if you want to get involved withyour town get on the planning commission youll have a head start on whats going on within the community
7213982 i look at running a city as a business and run it like one i take it one step at a time otherwise it could become overwhelming
7213983 this should cut down the amount of time a builder has to wait from two months to a couple of weeks there are retailers and businesses that want to getin here
7213984 i think communication is our weak point but thats going to change in september were sending out a quarterly newsletter to all our residents it will have the reports the city council hears at our meetings from the departments such as police fire and water it will also have information on proposed ordinances so residents can know whats going on in their town
7213985 were just trying to make sure the chamber the school the businesses were all on the same page and working together as one
7213986 that just felt right and thats where we live now

7214001 oh thats a cultural thing theres nothing we can do about it
7214002 the underlying beliefs values and assumptions held by members of an organization and the practices and behaviors that exemplify and reinforce them

7214014 i was struck by one story the book about a man who went to his fireplace and told it

7214031 no bobby and i arent going to run off hunting again at least not for a while anyway
7214032 you remember that incubus bobby and i tracked down a few weeks back
7214033 well the woman the incubus was after joyce was a tourist staying at the motel with some friends their rented vehicle was tampered with stranding them in the middle of nowhere but placed them conveniently enough near the motel the incubus was doing its haunt
7214034 you and bobby tracked down the bugger and ended its sorry existence right
7214035 yeah we did but not before it attacked one of joyces friends the first night they stayed at the motel joyce was the second target and we managed to save her and the other two women with her before the incubus got to her
7214036 joyce and i werent expecting it we thought it was just the shock of finding out a friend of theirs was victimized by an incubus but later on she told me she was used to dealing with bump in the night creatures and thought that when she took the trip with her friends shed have a respite from those
7214037 of course she didnt get the respite she wanted regardless bobby and i hung around the tourists for a few days making sure that they were safely delivered to where they were supposed to be it was a two day drive and bobbys van provided enough room so we werent cramped
7214038 ok so what was it that you and this joyce lady werent expecting
7214039 joyce and i eloped and now were moving to california because she has a house there and a daughter whos attending her first year in college

7214097 remember when gay meant happy and fag meant cigarette language is constantly evolving and changing and so is the acceptability of certain words especially profanity
7214098 i grew up around bikers old hippies plant workers sailors fisherman all of that
7214099 its not like ive been around nothing but polite speaking people my whole life
7214100 sometimes i dont realize it until someone points it out
7214101 the rule book went out the window in the 1960s and it was every person for him or herself
7214102 we were all left to our own devices to make up our own rules about language sex socially acceptable behavior gender loyalty and much more
7214103 they burned their bras got jobs took control of their bodies with birth control pills started divorcing in great numbers smoked cigarettes and other stuff and started swearing
7214104 the f word became commonplace among comics richard pryor george carlin among others
7214105 public expression of the f word became more acceptable as a result

7214111 i think he can be ready but right now i dont believe he is the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7214112 this is bullshit this is malarkey this is outrageous for the president of the united states to go to a foreign country to sit in the knesset and make this kind of ridiculous statement
7214113 should negotiate with terrorists and radicals as if some ingenious argument will persuade them they have been wrong all along
7214114 about marking a moment in time a moment when the eyes of the world will turn towards london when the beijing olympic games close and the focus turns to the next olympic games summer host city
7214115 as a nation we now look forward to holding the olympic games in london in 2012
7214116 the golden triumphs of the present british team can only serve as further inspiration to those who will be working hard over the next four years to make the london games a shining example of olympic success

7214119 i do not support roe versus wade it should be overturned
7214120 the thought of his being president sends a cold chill down my spine hes erratic hes hotheaded he loses his temper and he worries me

7214122 but this son at least this son i know why he died he died so we could have a home for the jewish people in the land of israel and he has a grave here on mount herzl in jerusalem and that is not a reason to cry it is a reason to sing
7214123 small miracles of the holocaust extraordinary coincidences of faith hope and survival

7214127 thank you for praying those that i dont know and those that i know thank you for being there for me
7214128 i never saw the kid until the police showed me a picture

7214131 who seemed a little sad the last time we spoke on the phone
7214132 answer a fool according to his folly lest he become wise in his own eyes
7214133 the goal for each of the parties at these conventions is to create a huge propaganda moment
7214134 that demonstrates the values they represent and the leadership qualities of their candidates
7214135 the extra points added by the convention comprise the bounce and size matters
7214136 major slippage is bound to occur think 18 wheeler highway wreck squared
7214137 the two f words for democrats will be family and flag
7214138 obama has to erase any doubts about his religion his values his readiness and his patriotism and he has to show that the obamas are the ultimate american family
7214139 there has never been an election cycle like this one its literally light years from what it was four years ago and that has to do with the relentless scrutiny of the internet
7214140 today these conventions involve so many little nuanced things and everything every word that is uttered can be interpreted in myriad ways its just relentless
7214141 issues of central concern to the family and the home
7214142 a return to the clinton years and the clinton values
7214143 the republicans are united at the moment and democrats still have a lingering hillary hangover
7214144 fire up their supporters to be for obama then it will unite the party and hell get that bump
7214145 its their job to inspire the people that were supporting hillary to rally behind barack then obama has to close the deal with the rest of the country
7214146 the goal is coming out of denver with a strong statement that democrats are unified i dont think anybody is taking anything for granted here
7214147 every single day we have to earn the confidence and trust of americans we have to be out there and connected in terms of what they need in solutions
7214148 we will need to come out united and energized and moving forward for barack obama

7214163 if you want to be moshiach you must be properly outfitted
7214164 no difference to me what i wear on my head

7214180 she doesnt know yet that she has been married added jtili of the girl who is about to begin her fourth year at primary school
7214181 i got by on this one walking a lot of people knowing me and word of mouth im just trying to do the best i can for el segundo and i think people recognized that
7214182 he likes the photocopied look because that demonstrates i believe a certain type of fiscal conservatism
7214183 however one could make an argument that demonstrating your ability to raise money and support for yourself would also demonstrate your ability to advocate for the city
7214184 it depends on what kind of campaign you are running
7214185 if you are running a campaign for the first time and the voters dont necessarily know you as well it will require much more money
7214186 i chose to raise money from my neighbors and my friends because i am more effective at that and i can do that fairly quickly as opposed to having the time to walk door to door
7214187 was it worth it to be on the city council for another four years absolutely
7214188 i want to make sure this city is in as good condition as possible and i want to make sure this city has a very bright future
7214189 i tried to hop the fence and i got caught
7214190 its like fort knox you jump one fence and theres two more to jump theyve got guards theyve got cops theyve got people on horses there arent any infiltration points
7214191 somebody offered me 100 to look the other way and let him go over the fence
7214192 i wouldnt do it its not worth it theres only one way to do a job and thats the right way
7214193 these tickets are out of my price range way out of my range
7214194 and this is about the only free thing you can do at the festival
7214195 the streets were a mess the music is too loud and the park is fenced off golden gate park is a park not a concert stadium the city is supposed to be the guardians of the park not the broker for it
7214196 ive lived here for over 20 years and these are the worst folks in golden gate park ever screaming in the streets afterwards throwing shopping carts down the street running stop signs and there is absolutely no security to be seen hopefully this event will never be allowed again
7214197 this thing was dangerous with people pushing through a narrow 20 foot gap anxious to get to the next band in time people were desperate for bathrooms they were running past the guards through the woods just trying to find a place to pee
7214198 the park is trashed garbage everywhere not sure how they got a permit for the music to be so loud i love radiohead but that was ridiculous i think the neighborhood has had enough of these mega events leave no trace my a
7214199 i am not arguing for officers to be disciplined necessarily but this new system doesnt seem fair
7214200 it seems to invite arbitrary application and appears to minimize what could potentially be an important violation of policy one of the problems with the lapd discipline system has always been the tendency to allow these loopholes that mack trucks can go through
7214201 if it is something egregious something that clearly on the face of it requires a penalty to show the seriousness and to ensure that it wont happen again we will take that action
7214202 whether it works or not is all in the execution
7214203 if community members see this as a department being more lenient on officers its going to undermine their faith in the discipline system and in turn the department
7214204 there are two ways at looking at employees you develop or discharge them
7214205 i am focusing on creating solutions for when employees go astray
7214206 the way i look at suspensions is that it shouldnt be for your first offense or second offense if they are something low level but it should be the wake up call to tell you that you are right on the edge of being fired
7214207 a lot of it depends on officers coming forward admitting the mistake and trusting the process
7214208 but it has to be applied on a uniform basis department wide its a concern if officers accused of the same breach of a rule are treated differently
7214209 who is going to properly monitor to ensure uniformity i am not sure
7214210 there is a danger that without the imposition of appropriate discipline in cases of clearly negligent conduct a significant tool in promoting the utmost of care in adherence to department policies procedures and regulation may be removed
7214211 both of those people had been very involved in the restoration we have all that background knowledge all of the history
7214212 the thing thats been interesting with playa vista and i hated to see it when it began is to see something grow from a development into a community i think basically im very optimistic
7214213 i had been involved in a few things before that small neighborhood things so i was getting into that arena of course it wasnt until playa vista came up that i went headlong into the whole thing
7214214 we had no money we were just beginning we had to try to figure out how to reach the public on this issue
7214215 it left only 72 acres undeveloped that they admitted was wetlands
7214216 because of all the years ballona had been abused it was a very difficult task to prove that was really wetlands
7214217 unless and until we determined it wouldnt have an adverse effect on the wetlands
7214218 i think most of us had heard about the compromise and thought oh the wetlands are saved
7214219 ruth lansford bless her heart im sure she worked hard but she was our main opponent
7214220 she did get it all started my position is she worked hard and she came up short
7214221 you make a deal and at the time you realize that if you had followed the lawsuit through to the end you could always lose
7214222 if you knew lansford you couldnt fault her in any way
7214223 its just really nice to see how its all evolved
7214224 what the liberals are doing is targeting a handful of specific things in our savings package in order to play politics he told network ten
7214225 they are playing with fire because if they punch holes in the budget surplus the end result is that it is harder for the rba to reduce interest rates
7214226 the key people in the frame here are the liberal party he said
7214227 dr nelson is fond of describing himself and the liberal party as the alternative government its about time they started acting like an alternative government
7214228 there are a number of small and important measures to which we are opposed and as a matter of principle we will oppose them dr nelson told the nine network
7214229 none of those tax increases 20 billion of tax increases in the budget were foreshadowed by the government prior to the election he said

7214231 we are deeply concerned that our son nigel brennan may have gone missing near mogadishu in somalia yesterday
7214232 he is a freelance photographer who arrived in kenya just over a week ago
7214233 we understand that the australian government is making urgent contact with relevant somalian authorities as well as the canadian french and british embassies to help locate nigel
7214234 this is a difficult time for our family and we ask everyone to respect our privacy
7214235 we are awaiting advice from the somali government a spokeswoman said
7214236 we are also in contact with foreign governments with interests in somalia to seek their cooperation and assistance

7214238 we cannot change the history of the 823 bombardment but we can create a peaceful future so the sacrifices of the soldiers and civilians are worthwhile
7214239 there is no winner in a war which only causes regrets and we cannot let people in both sides of the strait have the same regrets both sides paid terrible prices to learn the lesson
7214240 the cross strait rapprochement since the kuomintang took office has laid a foundation for peace and the two sides will further their cooperation on this basis
7214241 for those of us who are second amendment believers michael bane had a few words and more links to illustrate exactly why biden is so repugnant both biden and obama are determinedly anti second amendment despite obamas frantic attempts earlier in the year to position himself as pro second amendment his to lose in january salon announced of mccain that the his to lose
7214242 we cant vote for a conservative we might as well vote for the liberal sure hell trash the country but it may make it easier to get true conservatives elected into congress in 2010 and a conservative may be a more palatable candidate in the 2012 presidential elections
7214243 our estimate is that 3 000 families 18 000 people were displaced by the fighting yesterday

7214253 the tuba is a very integral part of the band its very important to have a strong person playing it
7214254 it was just amazing the amount of air that corey can move into that instrument he was so impressed that kids four or five years older than him cant even move the air that he does
7214255 corey likes it so thats whats important i think hell have fun for as long as he wants to play it

7214259 kevin was more than generous in letting me move slowly
7214260 he was ok with me sharing the office for a little while now we are sharing a school
7214261 the staff is great i know the community i know the school culture i couldnt have asked for a better place to start
7214262 he has a lot more years under his belt than his age might indicate hes goal oriented age is irrelevant
7214263 from the beginning i was thinking along the lines of a principal i owe a lot to her and her coaching and teaching of me
7214264 i was thrilled to hear that he was coming back
7214265 i was saddened by losing the other principal but i know that troy has energy and enthusiasm
7214266 its really a joy to have him back we know his style the transition should go very smoothly
7214267 im not convinced the revenue will come in the way it is predicted
7214268 i think the people of howard county will understand that its not wise to put locations for slots in the state constitution
7214269 right now weve just decided who is going to be multimillionaires in maryland
7214270 i think people are aware we had to raise taxes this year and if this doesnt pass it could mean that same thing possibly again
7214271 theyre probably better than we would have expected going into the assessment
7214272 with that the school system will be able to better address schools in need
7214273 has broad experience as a classroom teacher and a school administrator
7214274 we hope that police presence around the schools will send a message to drivers to slow down
7214275 students throughout the region will be walking and driving to and from school and we want to make sure every one of them arrives safely
7214276 if an eggplant or a tomato is picked that day and served to you that evening what could possibly be better than that
7214277 we are getting high quality organic vegetables so high in quality that we are even selling to competitors
7214278 there are times when i start thinking about what we could make by selling retail instead of wholesale
7214279 this is the only job that is difficult to turn away from
7214280 we have a superstition that you only approach a fig tree in the morning when angels are near
7214281 how many times do i have to tell you that
7214282 the railway was mined and that was the reason for the explosion
7214283 during the telephone conversation between the russian and french presidents there was no discussion about replacing russian peacekeeping troops by an osce mission in the buffer zone
7214284 there were no changes in the position of russian peacekeepers overnight but we are expecting that they will withdraw from poti today
7214285 we cannot change the history of the 823 bombardment but we can create a peaceful future so the sacrifices of the soldiers and civilians are worthwhile

7214292 we are disappointed that china has not used the occasion of the olympics to demonstrate greater tolerance and openness
7214293 the world learned more about china and china learned more about the rest of the world and together we shared the excitement and drama of the games
7214294 the reply we received from authorities was that this was an application of chinese law
7214295 the ioc is not a sovereign organization and we have to respect chinese law
7214296 i pushed and pushed i had to to tire the others
7214297 my plan was to push my body to the limits

7214299 the railway was mined and that was the reason for the explosion
7214300 i think its a combination of how our commodities versus rios commodities have developed
7214301 and i think its fair to say that investors are still waiting sitting on the sideline a little bit to see how we clear our regulatory pre conditions on this deal
7214302 its very hard to speculate on things that we dont think are going to happen and that are not the base line that we are planning around
7214303 what the liberals are doing is targeting a handful of specific things in our savings package in order to play politics he told network ten

7214317 since june this year he claimed to register shop owners for tax purposes he was charging them between r500 and r1 000 for registration
7214318 it is absolutely scandalous that sascoc did not lift a finger to make things easier for natalie heavens above she has enough obstacles
7214319 she is one of the games darlings due to her incredible guts but her own people snub her
7214320 i wish i had started this stuff five years earlier id be making bank
7214321 but hindsite is always 20 20 and im 100 percent certain there is still lots of money to be made last year alone domain sales for gaming website design companies topped 10 million dollars which tallied up to be a record setting year
7214322 weve heard of other businesses temporarily loosing their domain name to hackers
7214323 but after a couple days the name is recovered and doubly secured by the respective company at their domain name registar
7214324 were getting all the gold we can find and turning it into diamonds
7214325 if you buy ralbovsky kostelnick com youre the only one who can have that address it is entirely unique and therefore by virtue of its rarity it immediately can accrue value you may find that you get tons of email offers for your domain name this will allow you to sort out whos serious and whos just fooling around and then after youve found a good gaming website design industry buyer youll surely make some great profits
7214326 one of the most amazing gaming website design related sales we had was in last septembers auction
7214327 though the domain didnt go for much money bidding was very spirited with some 50 people getting in on the action in the end the gaming website design domain went to a well established marketing firm who did not disclose their future plans for it
7214328 email is so ingrained into the backbone of the gaming website design internet sector that many forget about it when buying a domain
7214329 but when you think about it you want a domain that people can remember and a domain that is free of any blacklist status so that you can use it to freely communicate with gaming website design customers
7214330 with the power of the search engines these days its not the end of the world if you dont get a glitzy domain name just seo your site to the best of your abilities and slowly but surely people will beging to remember your sites presence on the internet when making gaming website design related buying decisions
7214331 i was a little bit nervous in the beginning of the third set i got my rhythm back i was really pumped up when i had to be really enjoyed the moment in the end
7214332 nine times losing ive got a lot of runner up trophies in my office in my house these are the ones i need to get
7214333 its not easy to win the gold medal weve worked very hard
7214334 its the most glorious day for rhythmic gymnastics in china
7214335 i knew the russian and belarussian teams are at a higher level but we have our style
7214336 we used peking opera music which creates a nice atmosphere for the spectators they understand our background
7214337 i really really feel upset we didnt live up to our expectations
7214338 we heard allegations in the media about the ages and we took that very seriously and we asked the international federation to organise an inquiry themselves
7214339 the eligibility of the athletes is the responsibility of the federation not the ioc but we considered it to be a very serious issue
7214340 the international federation requested all documents like family books and entries of schools and things like that and these have been received
7214341 at first sight everything seems okay however the fig wants to study them thoroughly because they are in chinese and then they will report to the ioc as soon as possible
7214342 always believed this issue needed to be addressed by the fig and ioc
7214343 i dont want to talk about this subject any more because those who know me they know that im 16
7214344 how can i do more explain more no matter what people say im still 16
7214345 i had to push the pace to tire the other runners i had to push the pace because my body gets tired in the heat when i slow down
7214346 it feels good to make history here it feels good to make history for kenya and win the gold
7214347 you can see from this tournament how we need to upgrade the level of the judges
7214348 that experience is going to make this experience that much better
7214349 this election is going to be decisive definitely if anwar wins we will be one step closer to taking over the government
7214350 from our assessment we are leading we have to win big it will mean the people reject racial politics
7214351 it is un malay to make these allegations anwar has a family and he has five daughters
7214352 politics is one thing but you are shaming a family man i am afraid that if we go overboard in attacking him and accusing him of anti malay it will backfire we will lose votes we saw that happen in the march polls
7214353 you actually dont know what you are missing out on if you dont associate with children
7214354 theres lots of older people out there like myself they could give so much if they knew what to do
7214355 we get so many immigrant children who dont have that elderly person contact any more so they just love it
7214356 we would actually love a few more grandpas to come along if theyre brave enough
7214357 they tend to build things and just can be a different perspective to the grannies
7214358 this is an endorsement for the governments military campaign against the terrorists tamil rebels

7214361 to start from the pole here for the first time for sure is very nice
7214362 for sure we have a great car we showed that at some races this year
7214363 we showed that at the last race unfortunately some things happen
7214364 fourth place is not what i was looking for but its definitely not the end of the world
7214365 i could have been higher up the grid but on my last run in the q3 third and final qualifying round i locked the wheels at a few points and lost valuable time
7214366 it was nothing dramatic but at this circuit a small error is very costly i still think i can be in the fight for a win
7214367 its a good starting position for us tomorrow on sunday
7214368 felipes going to be hard to beat but well certainly push for it

7214385 jawel man maar zie je niet dat ik knetter stoned ben morgen als ik terug ben van school zoek ik je op
7214386 is er al meer bekend over de dader en de motieven
7214387 de politie wil voorlopig nog niets zeggen in het belang van het onderzoeken maar ooggetuigen die een glimp van de dader hebben opgevangen zeggen dat het gaat om een blonde man van middelbare leeftijd een ander feit is dat op het moment van de arrestatie de dader het moordwapen bij zich droeg
7214388 pim fortuyn is op klaarlichte dag neergeschoten op het mediapark in hilversum nadat hij op weg naar zijn auto was samen met vj ruud de wild de dader is na een korte achtervolging overmeesterd door de politie
7214389 ooggetuigen beschrijven de dader als een blonde man van middelbare leeftijd
7214390 politiebronnen melden dat zij het moordwapen bij de dader hebben aangetroffen
7214391 dat is niet het onderwerp van deze les tarik maar als je op tijd gekomen was had je dat wel geweten
7214392 de wereld is een stuk normaler geworden zonder die flikker
7214393 jongeman pak je spullen en vertoon je gezicht hier niet meer
7214394 ik weet dat jullie van hem hielden omdat hij zei wat jullie dachten vuile idioten
7214395 maar vertel farid nu we hier zijn en openhartig met elkaar spreken waarom zou ik me leven wagen om een dealer te beroven
7214396 je waagt je leven niet man het is een simpel klusje zoals ik al zei
7214397 elke dinsdagavond krijgt hij een kilo coke thuisgeleverd op dat moment is hij altijd alleen thuis zelfs zijn telefoon staat uit
7214398 de eerste klant aan wie hij verkoopt ben ik en dat is altijd op woensdag middag dus woensdagochtend moet de klus geklaard worden
7214399 mooi verhaal farid maar je hebt niet gezegd hoe we binnenkomen en of deze gozer yeter schietwapens heeft
7214400 je denkt al na over de uitvoer dat vind ik wel relax van je
7214401 ik neem aan dat die gozer een wapen thuis heeft ten eerste het is een dealer en ten tweede een turk die hebben allemaal wapens zelfs ik en adil hebben er n
7214402 ik wou het hier eigenlijk later over hebben als we bij mij thuis waren maar ik merk aan jou dat je er serieus over nadenkt en dus mee wil doen
7214403 ill literally turn to the president and say mister president how can you say that knowing you dont know the facts
7214404 were we not senators id rip your goddamn adams apple out
7214405 i refuse to believe the majority of people believe this malarkey
7214406 the new rules are always going to take a bit of time for people to accommodate for
7214407 stuey and im not defending him but he probably isnt aware with how serious the ffa and the referees are about verbal challenges to their decisions because he hasnt been here
7214408 as much you can talk to them about it unless someone actually experiences and sees something its a bit harder to absorb
7214409 they are definitely the toughest opponents weve had in a qualifier
7214410 i know people expect us to get through but its not as if were playing a mickey mouse team the belgian league has a lot of quality and their champions are used to getting into the group stages
7214411 they caught us a bit cold in the first leg their manager said we were sleeping but they deserve credit for the way they played they were spot on tactically hitting us on the counter attack we didnt play well and we know well have to improve tactically
7214412 any side which can keep fernando torres and robbie keane as quiet as they did in the first leg has quality we didnt have any chances in the game
7214413 torah is life for those who vocalize it with their mouths

7214415 u2 a lo largo de los ltimos a os ha desarrollado un grupo de personas que mantienen un ojo vigilante sobre la banda
7214416 para m estar tocando todav a para la audiencia que ha comprado nuestro primer disco es un logro porque a pesar de que el grupo ha crecido no hemos perdido a nuestra audiencia o viceversa me he dado cuenta que hay muchos m s niveles en el que las personas tienen en cuenta al grupo ahora y es un poco una locura
7214417 existe ese extremo y a continuaci n tienes personas que les gusta la banda porque piensan que larry es fabuloso o porque les gustan nuestras chaquetas
7214418 qu significa m s para m que el lbum vaya directo al n mero uno donde estamos viendo los rostros de la gente en las filas frente a nuestros conciertos la gente que hab a estado durmiendo bajo repisas en las estaciones de ferrocarril la gente que ha venido recorriendo toda europa para vernos
7214419 somos muy duros con nosotros mismos nos examinamos constantemente puedes esperar que la presi n venga de las compa as discogr ficas y del management o de los medios de comunicaci n pero en realidad hemos aprendido a hacer frente a eso bastante bien se trata de cosas que rechazamos no lo aceptas eso es importante tienes que ser tu propio editor en war hemos tenido que seguir tirando cosas fuera porque nos parec a que est bamos en peligro de parodiarnos a nosotros mismos estaba esa cosa que se ha convertido en el sonido de u2 y pensamos que deb amos avanzar creo que lo hicimos y ahora tenemos que considerar pasos mucho m s radicales estoy muy entusiasmado acerca de war lo siento como nuestro primer disco
7214420 i dont like being in the press too much for various reasons
7214421 id rather let my work speak for itself most musicians feel that every time theyre in a magazine newspaper or on television theyre in the public eye i think its more important to have you work put out so people will discuss you because of it its the primary reason you are here in this industry being a musician and wanting people to listen to your music
7214422 its always good to keep a certain kind of mystery going when youre a public person someone asked me a question some time back tell me five things that your fans dont know about i responded by telling her that i only let my fans know things that i want them to know and id rather have them know me because of my music my personal life is my personal life
7214423 those eight albums speak for themselves because one album is completely different from the other
7214424 whether its ali azmats or kaavishs or maryam kizilbashs or it could be abbas premjees album theres so much diversity that anyone who listens to my work will know my diversity as an artiste and like i said fans see your work as a reflection of your personality
7214425 for most hard earned musicians their aim is not to be the front man it never has been
7214426 the thing is that the pakistani mentality will have to change at some point and the question is are you the person that is going to make the difference when i joined noori i didnt chose to be the front man im generally quite shy in public i can be a lion around my friends but when im on stage im a mouse
7214427 yes as long as im playing my drums im fine but if someone were to ask me to say something on stage ill be very nervous because im not that kind of person
7214428 i just showed him how to practice a couple of bass lines
7214429 even now at this point in time people label me as a certain status musician but i still feel like im learning its not a race its just a choice on how far and how fast you want to go some people take time while others learn it quickly theres no hurry
7214430 i dont see the point why one would compare me to other musicians whether as a bass player or a guitar player if someone can execute something great then thats great and if they cant then better luck next time if i were to see a musician playing very well i wouldnt feel bad about it if that person can do it so can i and i could probably do it better so its more of a question of you put up or you shut up
7214431 ali azmat is a rock star im not a rock star i dont have that kind of a lifestyle im just very straightforward

7214459 in the description of modes of thought and modalities of belief we find a mistake that is in fact general to anthro pological descriptions of religious representations the mistake consists in describing such ideas from an epistemic rather than a cognitive view point describing a set of ideas from an epistemic viewpoint consists in viewing them as an attempt to say something about the world as constituting some form of knowledge however vague inconsistent or actually false of the world for instance the fang representations de scribed above in some detail can be said to constitute a certain view of the supernatural world which aims to account for otherwise inexplicable occurrences in contrast describing a set of representations from a cognitive viewpoint consists in showing what processes lead people to entertain the thoughts they actually entertain the question of whether they constitute a system represent the world explain it and so on is irrelevant in a cognitive study religious representations are almost invariably described in epistemic terms in anthropology they are ex plained as abstract intellectual systems not as mental representations actually entertained by human subjects
7214460 people who are receptive to the influence of art cannot set too high a value on it as a source of pleasure and consolation in life nevertheless the mild narcosis induced in us by art can do no more than bring about a transient withdrawal from the pressure of vital needs and it is not strong enough to make us forget real misery another procedure operates more energetically and more thoroughly it regards reality as the sole enemy and as the source of all suffering with which it is impossible to live so that one must break off all relations with it if one is to be in any way happy the hermit turns his back on the world and will have no truck with it but one can do more than that one can try to re create the world to build up in its stead another world in which its most unbearable features are eliminated and replaced by others that are in conformity with ones own wishes but whoever in desperate defiance sets out upon this path to happiness will as a rule attain nothing reality is too strong for him he becomes a madman who for the most part finds no one to help him in carrying through his delusion it is asserted how ever that each one of us behaves in some one respect like a paranoic corrects some aspect of the world which is unbear able to him by the construction of a wish and introduces this delusion into reality a special importance attaches to the case in which this attempt to procure a certainty of happiness and a protection against suffering through a delusional remoulding of reality is made by a considerable number of people in common the religions of mankind must be classed among the mass delusions of this kind no one needless to say who shares a delusion ever recognizes it as such i do not think that i have made a complete enumeration of the methods by which men strive to gain happiness and keep suffering away and i know too that the material might have been differently arranged one procedure i have not yet mentioned not because i have forgotten it but because it will concern us later in another connection and how could one possibly forget of all others this technique in the art of living it is conspicuous for a most remarkable combination of characteristic features it too aims of course at making the subject independent of fate as it is best to call it and to that end it locates satisfaction in internal mental processes making use in so doing of the displaceability of the libido of which we have already spoken p 26 but it does not turn away from the external world on the contrary it clings to the objects belonging to that world and obtains happiness from an emotional relationship to them nor is it content to aim at an avoidance of un pleasure a goal as we might call it of weary resignation it passes this by without heed and holds fast to the original passionate striving for a positive fulfilment of happiness and perhaps it does in fact come nearer to this goal than any other method i am of course speaking of the way of life which makes love the centre of everything which looks for all satisfaction in loving and being loved a psychical attitude of this sort comes naturally enough to all of us one of the forms in which love manifests itself sexual love has given us our most intense experience of an overwhelming sensation of pleasure and has thus furnished us with a pattern for our search for happiness what is more natural than that we should persist in looking for happiness along the path on which we first encountered it the weak side of this technique of living is easy to see otherwise no human being would have thought of abandoning this path to happiness for any other it is that we are never so defenceless against suffering as when we love never so helplessly unhappy as when we have lost our loved object or its love but this does not dispose of the technique of living based on the value of love as a means to happiness there is much more to be said about it
7214461 itll never come to that youll always have friends and family

7214470 generally speaking the teams that have women are more enthusiastic particularly when theyre winning theyre a lot shriller
7214471 you put the meat on at 10 oclock at night and sit around and drink until youre done and thats not a womens thing
7214472 its nice to see the women are starting to get involved in this sport
7214473 with most teams in the past the women have come along to do the dishes weve got a flip show here she diva q runs the show and she orders her husband around
7214474 he takes a lot of ribbing from the other guys because his wife leads a team but hes so secure in his own manhood that it doesnt faze him at all

7214479 oberste priorit t hat die antwort auf die bitte von max mosley in seinem brief vom 3 juli
7214480 ich werde der arbeitsgruppe f r das technische reglement vorsitzen
7214481 meine aufgabe ist es im bereich des technischen reglements vorschl ge auszuarbeiten oberste priorit t hat die antwort auf die bitte von max mosley in seinem brief vom 3 juli
7214482 es gibt keinen grund warum die teams nicht trotzdem zusammentreffen sollten
7214483 wir m ssen die basiskosten f r die autos verringern
7214484 wir m ssen die basiskosten f r die autos verringern sodass die kosten selbst dann geringer sind wenn man selbst ein echter konstrukteur ist im moment ist das sehr teuer daher haben teams wie toro rosso einen alternativen weg gefunden und daher haben echte konstrukteursteams wie williams wirtschaftliche schwierigkeiten
7214485 denn man muss gegebenenfalls das team aufstocken und die notwendige unterst tzung finden wir erreichen langsam einen punkt an dem wir zus tzliche leute einstellen m ssen und das kostet geld au erdem muss man ja erst einmal die richtigen leute finden aber es ist grunds tzlich schon m glich wenn es f r die teams wirtschaftlich sinn macht
7214486 nach dem f rchterlichen wochenende das allan mcnish und ich am n rburgring hatten ist es toll wieder ganz vorne zu sein f r mich ist diese pole etwas ganz besonderes weil ich in dem training vor dem qualifying gar nicht zum fahren gekommen bin ich habe mir etwas sorgen gemacht aber auf meiner ersten fliegenden runde habe ich sofort gemerkt dass das auto gut ist und mir liegt ich musste nur attackieren in der letzten kurve hatte ich einen ziemlichen powerslide ich habe bef rchtet dass mich das die pole kosten w rde aber am ende hat es doch gereicht
7214487 mehr konnten wir uns nicht erhoffen wir haben beide autos vorne dindo capello und marco werner haben beide einen au ergew hnlichen job gemacht beide autos in die erste reihe zu bringen ist auf dieser strecke die normalerweise nicht die beste f r uns ist klasse wir sind sehr zufrieden mit unserem renn setup und starten vom besten platz hoffentlich regnet es morgen nur nicht
7214488 ich bin eigentlich ganz zufrieden marco werner ist nat rlich entt uscht weil definitiv mehr drin gewesen w re das haben wir alle gesehen aber so ist das im motorsport manchmal hat man gl ck manchmal pech ich w rde unseren tag als gl ck im ungl ck bezeichnen nach den vorkommnissen gestern k nnen wir mit startplatz zwei zufrieden sein wir haben ein gutes auto f r das rennen ich freue mich auf morgen
7214489 nat rlich sind wir zufrieden beide autos in der ersten reihe zu haben ich selbst habe einen ziemlich dicken hals auf herrn montagny der mich zwei zehntelsekunden gekostet hat es h tte eine pole sein k nnen aber das wichtigste ist dass beide audi vorne sind
7214490 das war eine tolle teamleistung vor allem nach dem was gestern passiert ist beide autos waren zum qualifying wieder in einem guten zustand und beide fahrer haben eine fantastische leistung gezeigt gl ckwunsch an die fahrer und das ganze team f r die harte arbeit
7214491 this proposal is a hat trick for america its good for our environment good for our national security and good for families
7214492 our addiction to oil has only gotten worse and drivers are suffering each time they fill up their tank encouraging the use of natural gas will help end our dependence on foreign oil and save money for families across the country
7214493 coming from a producing state i believe this legislation will spur economic growth and job creation
7214494 most importantly it will increase the nations energy independence while providing hard working americans with a cheaper cleaner alternative to the rising cost of gasoline there are also provisions that greatly encourage market development so that current and future ngv owners have more locations that serve their vehicles

7214521 the idea is that we do want michael to stay all of us we have just got to get to the point where we have got an agreement and thats got to be right for both parties

7214523 it will run its course i think we are pretty close but we will find out on wednesday and we will see

7214532 but we sent him to germany and they have done a wonderful job he has come back and he feels great
7214533 people do miss penalties but since i have been manager of bolton we have missed the three penalties we have had all with different takers

7214567 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
7214568 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
7214569 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre
7214570 una grave falta tica si estos productos son reorientados a otros mercados donde no hay controles respecto a estas extremadamente peligrosas sustancias t xicas
7214571 producci n y uso de sustancias qu micas y bienes de consumo
7214572 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
7214573 y d nde est el famoso estado de derecho sirve acaso para algo
7214574 estamos ante un hecho delictual o m s bien pol tico
7214575 claramente se trata de un simple hecho delictual lo peor ser a darle un cariz pol tico a estas acciones vand licas repudiadas por la ciudadania
7214576 extra o hecho delictual donde los malhechores no roban nada y lo que parecieran visibilizar m s bien son consignas
7214577 quien no entiende a la buena entender con toda la fuerza del derecho
7214578 estamos ante un hecho delictual y perseguiremos crimin lmente a los responsables
7214579 seremos m s severos en la represi n no se va a tolerar ning n tipo de impunidad
7214580 62 hect reas una yunta de bueyes una vaca parida semillas y madera
7214581 the days of the loyal twenty year employee are gone most people will have at least 10 jobs in their lifetime
7214582 best candidate because he she couldnt be interviewed until several weeks from the initial contact
7214583 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
7214584 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
7214585 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana
7214586 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso
7214587 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
7214588 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
7214589 there is such a terrific spirit about the place and among the players and that spirit will really help us go so far
7214590 it was a good game it ebbed and flowed we had our good moments in the match and they had their good moments
7214591 aston villa are a very good side with carew up front they had got great power and have players with great pace and ability around him and im sure villa will finish in the top eight without a question of a doubt
7214592 but it was a fantastic atmosphere today which helped the players and we have got to make that a regular occurrence here
7214593 its a place we have got to win games if we are going to push on what happens away from home will be difficult but it is important that when we are at home we get the crowd behind us and be as competitive as we were today
7214594 its a great three points for us and it was great to win it the way we did at the end
7214595 the thing with the throw ins is that they can take something away from the football we played
7214596 sometimes we get labelled as one dimensional which we are not but i wouldnt swap it for anything
7214597 you speak to martin oneill and i think he will admit that his side didnt enjoy defending against it
7214598 but i thought we mixed it up well and played some good stuff
7214599 villa are a good side and we have to accept that sides are going to come here and have their periods of dominance
7214600 i am still very positive because the fact is we have been beaten today in the last minute of the game
7214601 over the whole period i thought we should have got at least something from the game after we scored two very good goals
7214602 it is too early to start cutting up players as it were we have played two games in the premier league and weve scored six goals
7214603 so scoring doesnt seem to be our problem at the moment we scored a lot of goals last season and conceded quite a number
7214604 if we could cut down the number we conceded wed have a better chance of getting more points so thats something well work on
7214605 i think that it will take a bit a little bit of time for some players to get to know each other
7214606 we have three new players and also a centre back in martin laursen who has not played for the last few months
7214607 but thats not to say we should not have defended the late throw in better than we did so obviously i am disappointed with that and it has cost us a point today
7214608 that is a very interesting question you should ask the club
7214609 he didnt play because he wasnt in the right condition this is what he told me before the game when i spoke to him so he did not play
7214610 well have to wait and see tomorrow sunday well speak to the player and then well make a decision on his future
7214611 its a situation that is very personal there are players able to play under these circumstances and others whose head is not right berbatov is in the latter category
7214612 well have a meeting with the player and clarify a few points and see if there is a decision to be made
7214613 well meet primarily to know if he is in any state to play in the next match or we have to find another solution
7214614 he hasnt got any power if he is no condition to play the game he in not going to play that is the same as any other player
7214615 we wont be dancing in the streets in sunderland for beating tottenham away from home well have a cup of tea and sandwich as normal
7214616 we fancy our chances and were happy with the progress were making players showed the other side to them
7214617 the character of the players is there for everyone to see we have that and you can criticise in other areas but not character
7214618 when youve won the game you say berbatovs a talented boy but darren bent is also a good player
7214619 someone told me he scored on his debut for liverpool but i couldnt careless what he did in the past
7214620 its a good start djibril only trained with us yesterday and he was always going to be on the bench he gives us good options if things arent going our way
7214621 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7214622 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7214623 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
7214624 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
7214625 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
7214626 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
7214627 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
7214628 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
7214629 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
7214630 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
7214631 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
7214632 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
7214633 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
7214634 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
7214635 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
7214636 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
7214637 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
7214638 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
7214639 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
7214640 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
7214641 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
7214642 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
7214643 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
7214644 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
7214645 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
7214646 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
7214647 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano
7214648 desmiento cualquier vinculaci n con patria roja no hemos recibido ninguna llamada del congresista isla no tenemos nada que ver con hugo ch vez no tenemos nada que ver con ning n partido pol tico porque stos lejos de solucionarnos los problemas nos traen m s
7214649 ellos paran la movilizaci n y nosotros reiniciamos el di logo
7214650 existe una soluci n en el fondo del problema que un ente arbitral como el tc puede resolver sobre la nulidad o no de estas normas lo que ah tenemos es una luz sin que esto impida que se extiendan con mayor profundidad los mecanismos de concertaci n y di logo
7214651 the days of the loyal twenty year employee are gone most people will have at least 10 jobs in their lifetime
7214652 most dangerous job in business its the chief marketing officer
7214653 the no asshole rule building a civilized workplace and surviving one that isnt
7214654 so the house has to investigate the tangguh lng contract because this contract is the most dangerous this contract is the worst so far
7214655 we have made very clear to the u n envoy that the mission should not discuss the upcoming 2010 elections as the nld does not recognize the military backed constitution
7214656 the u n envoy was wasting his time on matters that he was not supposed to deal with
7214657 this is about getting your supplies off the page and using them in new ways
7214658 im shocked by the video when i look at amy i think for christs sake just get a grip of yourself enough is enough
7214659 as the police know amy is a drug addict and she has now been caught twice on film taking illegal drugs they should arrest her and put her behind bars
7214660 rehab clinics are a waste of money unless you want them to work amy doesnt want to give up drugs so shes got to learn the hard way in prison
7214661 police have to act she is making a mockery of the law it has got to stop the price amy has got to pay is losing her freedom
7214662 prison has helped blake give up drugs and hes doing brilliantly in edmunds hill
7214663 she says lifes a living hell and without protection she might meet the same end as di
7214664 jades had this three years even on this occasion a smear test was an after thought
7214665 the tumour is the size of a tomato how was it missed jade is obviously absolutely devastated but trying to remain positive
7214666 she said to me sue ive had some big challenges in my life but this is by far the biggest ever and its not one i want to lose
7214667 there are two directions you can go with this research some might say this suggests that parents should have their kids attend places of worship
7214668 or if we use it to help explain why religious participation has a positive effect on academics parents who arent interested in attending church can consider how to structure their kids time to allow access to the same beneficial social networks and opportunities religious institutions provide
7214669 it was very relaxed and everyone had a great time
7214670 after the mucca debacle paul doesnt want to bring anyone to meet the family unless he is certain
7214671 its very hard to speculate on things that we dont think are going to happen and that are not the base line that we are planning around
7214672 like the guys who get together for coffee at a local shop in the morning around a table or at a counter and every one has an opinion about something and the current events is usually the subject now take that table and expand it as far as your mind can think
7214673 russland kann sich ohne r ckgriff auf die nuklearoption nicht gegen einen angriff aus luft oder all verteidigen
7214674 mit dem freiwilligendienst ist die armee zur abfallgrube f r sozialf lle geworden
7214675 y ou can whet ones appetite but you eat at home
7214676 putting up permanent facilities and checkpoints are inconsistent with the ceasefire agreement
7214677 he will have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7214678 the american dream under eight years of bush and mccain that american dream is slipping away
7214679 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader a leader who can deliver
7214680 no one has supported president bush in iraq more than i have
7214681 support tax breaks for companies who ship our jobs overseas
7214682 you cant change america when you know your first four years as president will look exactly like the last eight years of george bushs presidency
7214683 ive been disappointed in my friend john mccain who gave in to the right wing of his party and yielded to the very swift boat politics that he once so deplored
7214684 folks campaigns for presidents are a test of character and leadership
7214685 thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about its a pretty hard experience he will have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7214686 die lassen sich nicht dadurch abschrecken dass ein strafrahmen um ein jahr hinaufgesetzt wird
7214687 wir haben immer angek ndigt dass die ergebnisse vor dem sommer vorliegen und das werden sie auch
7214688 in der gesamtfassung vorliegt werde ich diese studie dem nationalrat bermitteln
7214689 der 300 kreisverkehr in nieder sterreich steht symbolisch f r jene ziele die wir mit den kreisverkehren in unserem land erreichen wollen verkehrssicherheit lebensqualit t und standortqualit t
7214690 an gesellschaftlichen veranstaltungen teilzunehmen f llt mir schwer keiner wei das besser als meine frau
7214691 dieses gef hl das geschehen von au en zu beobachten
7214692 in der schule war ich immer au enseiter und das ist auch lange so geblieben
7214693 ich habe ihn immer als laune des schicksals bezeichnet weil ich schauspieler geworden bin ohne an ruhm und reichtum zu denken
7214694 egal welches gericht sie zubereitete es hat mir immer gut geschmeckt
7214695 sie hat mir nie verraten was es tats chlich war ich vermute die geheime zutat war ihre liebe
7214696 irgendwann habe ich lautstark verk ndet dass in unseren vier w nden keine demokratie herrscht sondern eine autokratie was meine frau oder ich sagen das gilt es gibt keine diskussion warum das so ist
7214697 aber um die liebe wachsen zu lassen muss die schauspielerin ihre romanze hegen und pflegen wie eine zarte blume
7214698 heilige pflanze segne diese liebe m ge sie warm sein wie die sonne und stark wie die erde unter meinen f en sodass er nah an meinem herzen bleibt
7214699 damit sich auch die seele ffnet damit sie liebe leidenschaft und licht zul sst
7214700 so wie der mond am himmel langsam zunimmt wird die vision ihrer liebe die sie mit dem kochen des tees beschworen hat allm hlich realer werden
7214701 ich sehe dass die liaison zwischen keanu und winona kein strohfeuer ist
7214702 winona und keanu sind leidgepr ft haben aber alles was sie f r eine langfristige beziehung brauchen sie sind reifer und weiser geworden und ich sage ihnen eine positive zukunft voraus
7214703 estados unidos y europa est n teniendo algunos problemas financieros y eso puede afectar un poco el comercio internacional
7214704 la carne que en a os anteriores se vendi principalmente a estados unidos hoy encuentra mejores condiciones en rusia y se destina all
7214705 mientras la evoluci n de la argentina permanece como factor de riesgo para uruguay el pa s ha hecho un buen trabajo en desacoplarse de su vecino
7214706 de todas maneras si la argentina tuviera dificultades serias uruguay no ser a inmune a alg n grado de contagio probablemente mediante un enlentecimiento del crecimiento econ mico
7214707 you know when you are somewhere that you shouldnt be for too long it becomes easier to grab hold of stuff that you shouldnt
7214708 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
7214709 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
7214710 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
7214711 thats the kind of way we were used to playing last year that was something we needed to see
7214712 that gives us a little confidence with the season around the corner
7214713 i tried to bait the guy a little bit but he did a great job and got underneath the ball
7214714 it was nice to see him regroup after the interception
7214715 to come out of the two minute situation with points is a positive that gave us a shot in the arm
7214716 we could have done a ton more we didnt go that deep in the playbook as long as we get into the rhythm and feel good about each other and what were doing the skys the limit
7214717 well probably start looking at cleveland probably more in depth now and start preparing for them
7214718 everything offensively went well passing game the run game just the way we moved the ball down the field
7214719 find peace in the holy city of jerusalem and offer aid to families in distress
7214720 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
7214721 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
7214722 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7214723 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7214724 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7214725 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
7214726 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
7214727 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7214728 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7214729 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7214730 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
7214731 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7214732 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7214733 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7214734 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
7214735 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
7214736 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
7214737 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
7214738 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
7214739 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
7214740 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
7214741 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
7214742 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
7214743 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
7214744 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
7214745 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
7214746 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
7214747 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
7214748 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
7214749 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
7214750 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
7214751 hey if i take you out ill have to take the offspring and you know how i hate taking the offspring out in public
7214752 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
7214753 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
7214754 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
7214755 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
7214756 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
7214757 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
7214758 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
7214759 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
7214760 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
7214761 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
7214762 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7214763 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7214764 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7214765 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
7214766 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7214767 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7214768 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
7214769 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7214770 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7214771 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7214772 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7214773 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7214774 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7214775 how can i feed my family how can i give my children a future
7214776 thats what i am asking god every day every single day
7214777 the restaurant is just down the street from the police post that was blown up
7214778 his office is across from the courthouse you know the one where that attack happened
7214779 sometimes people look like they want to cry when they are paying for their groceries
7214780 they are searching their handbags and their pockets for every single coin i look away when this happens
7214781 my schoolwork is affected because it is too hot and too dark to study inside my home
7214782 i sit out on the roof until the light fades too much for me to read anymore i want to become educated and better myself but it is very hard
7214783 unless the government appears to the outside world to be competent and stable which it most certainly does not at the moment foreign investment wont be coming back and economic recovery will be very difficult
7214784 and a bad economy generates support for the insurgency even in pakistan where people on the whole really do not want to be ruled by islamists
7214785 but the extremists are seen as the main alternative to the government so in bad times people turn to them
7214786 this has reinforced the very cynical feeling pakistanis have had for many years about the relationship with the united states theyll use you and then theyll ditch you
7214787 one to america one to canada two more to the u k
7214788 we dont even bother to hope anymore that somebody will come to protect us
7214789 they dont come out and say they want us off the land but they are forcing us off
7214790 they put a kalashnikov to my chest and said do you have money gold or a car
7214791 i started crying and one of them said dont worry we wont do anything wrong to you
7214792 the militias are still coming theyre still driving through and robbing us
7214793 when cars come through were just hiding there is nobody to protect us and were very scared
7214794 the soldiers dont say anything to us they only enter in houses and ask for food and drink
7214795 who has anything to give them but what they can find they take
7214796 they were entering into yards and making inquiries and if they found them they shot them
7214797 it was horrible of course but i told myself i had to do it
7214798 please you havent been out of commission so long that you dont remember this part have you
7214799 he put nearly six hours trying with you and not thirty minutes later hes with her damn watch after i bet he comes over and tries to get your number
7214800 not after hes been sucking face with some other chick a few feet away come on and look now hes with another woman
7214801 hillary clinton has said repeatedly that barack obama and she share a commitment to changing the direction of the country getting us out of iraq and expanding access to health care
7214802 its interesting how those remarks didnt make it into his ad
7214803 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
7214804 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
7214805 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
7214806 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
7214807 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
7214808 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
7214809 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7214810 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7214811 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7214812 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
7214813 i totally give petey credit he was on it from the get go
7214814 hes so gentle and hes very motivated to play with other animals he would play with fish if he could
7214815 the lost pet chronicles adventures of a k 9 cop turned pet detective
7214816 her mission is to develop a nationwide program that trains both fee based detectives and volunteers so there is a community when an animal gets lost a base of people who can respond
7214817 there is this attitude when people lose a pet that you can just go get another one when a child goes missing there are 500 people out there ready to volunteer are you going to say that to someone about their child i dont want to come off in an inappropriate way but these animals are family members theyre not replaceable
7214818 i really felt like it was one of those messages like a cosmic thing a wake up call saying theres a great need for this service
7214819 think lost not stray if an animal is sickly looking hungry or mangy people will assume it has been abused or neglected or that its just wandering but maybe theres a loving family who has been desperately looking for this pet
7214820 by the time i called pam i had tried everything it was nice just having someone to call
7214821 clear skies ahead boise leaders predict healthy valley outlook in 2008
7214822 we have had an almost unparalleled two decade run of just blistering economic growth and weve grown very accustomed to it
7214823 now were going through an episode of cyclical correction that happens from time to time
7214824 how could we have been so stupid in all honesty we should have all realized what was happening sooner
7214825 but none of us know how to predict the turning points
7214826 we are not immune to whats going on on the national front
7214827 knock both pillars out at the same time and its a pretty difficult situation
7214828 we slowed down enough that it snapped back and you have the same multiplier effect on the downside as you do on the upside
7214829 that 650 million just disappeared its gone to oil producing companies and big oil companies
7214830 we have seen employment go from zero to thousands and were afraid that well see it go from thousands to zero
7214831 there is no doubt that the semiconductor business is going through tough times but until we have better information i am not going to predict the demise of micron
7214832 a lot of the businesses said we havent given up on idaho but were not making that decision now
7214833 they see people fishing in the river and they freak out this is a cool city

7214836 thats something that normally occurs in every economy and sometimes a little downturn may be good the growth weve experienced in the last several years has caused problems too it may be good to slow a little bit so we can catch our breath
7214837 i cant justify doing that at the expense of our citizens when they have little or no capacity to provide more support for government
7214838 you tend to your knitting you invest in education you have as fair a tax structure as possible and you get creative with partnerships

7214848 the towers are completely down now and the demolition has been carried out as planned the site is now completely safe
7214849 one tower came down completely as expected and then there was about one third of the other one left standing but angled away from the viaduct as the demolition experts designed it to
7214850 people were looking at it saying are we supposed to be able to see it but the demolition crew went to the site and manipulated what remained so that it has now completely come down
7214851 oh gosh i will miss so many things obviously people like the couple im living with my friends at school but also things like our bandroom i have so many memories there in that room

7214856 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development

7214879 the olympic games in beijing were a huge success for adidas both in china and around the world
7214880 we were clearly the leading brand in terms of visibility across all sports during the games we provided first class service and exciting products that were especially made for beijing we also made our mark in communication with our campaign together in 2008 impossible is nothing that won the first ever golden lion for china at the cannes festival so the olympic games in beijing brought us another giant step closer to our mission to be the leading sports brand in the world
7214881 we already used the uefa euro 2008 tm in austria and switzerland to grow our football leadership and now we demonstrated at the olympic games again that we are the brand that is at the core of sports with the platform of the beijing 2008 olympic games brand adidas has become market leader in china in terms of revenues market share and brand perception
7214882 our olympic journey will continue as we have already started to prepare for the london 2012 olympic games where adidas will again be official sportswear partner
7214883 we are well on track to reach our sales target of more than eur 1 billion for the adidas group in china by 2010
7214884 these successful olympic games in beijing will leave a legacy for sport in china and for all brands of our group therefore i am convinced that we will continue to achieve dynamic growth in this market for the years to come
7214885 die olympischen spiele in peking waren f r adidas ein riesiger erfolg sowohl in china als auch weltweit
7214886 was markenpr senz w hrend der olympischen spiele angeht so waren wir in allen sportarten eindeutig die f hrende marke wir haben erstklassigen service und attraktive produkte geboten die speziell f r peking entwickelt wurden auch in der kommunikation haben wir durch unsere kampagne together in 2008 impossible is nothing akzente gesetzt sie hat beim cannes festival den ersten goldenen l wen f r china gewonnen somit haben uns die olympischen spiele in peking einen gro en schritt voran gebracht in unserer mission die f hrende sportmarke der welt zu werden
7214887 wir haben bereits die uefa euro 2008tm in sterreich und der schweiz genutzt um unsere f hrende position im fu ball weiter auszubauen und jetzt haben wir bei den olympischen spielen erneut gezeigt dass die marke adidas das herzst ck des sports ist durch die plattform der olympischen spiele 2008 in peking hat adidas hinsichtlich umsatz marktanteil und wahrnehmung der marke in china die marktf hrerschaft bernommen
7214888 unsere olympische reise geht weiter wir haben bereits mit den vorbereitungen f r die olympischen spiele 2012 in london begonnen wo adidas erneut official sportswear partner sein wird
7214889 wir sind auf dem besten weg unser ziel f r den konzernumsatz in china von mehr als 1 milliarde bis 2010 zu erreichen
7214890 die erfolgreichen olympischen spiele in peking hinterlassen ein verm chtnis f r den sport in china und f r alle marken unseres konzerns daher bin ich berzeugt dass wir in den kommenden jahren weiterhin dynamisches wachstum in diesem markt verzeichnen werden

7214904 the plane was rocking back and forth until i suspected it was going to fall
7214905 i saw people smoke explosions i think that is what woke me up because i had lost consciousness
7214906 i thought that if help did not arrive soon i would die
7214907 the plane would not fail to the point of causing a tragedy
7214908 most likely whatever the malfunction of the probe was it is probably not related to what happened

7214911 if i can pay it off i can get a newer car a bit sooner its really boring but its normal
7214912 but really its all about rainy nights in november when youre trying to think of new jokes
7214913 i dont know if its going to make that any easier but it might make more people come to see the shows and thats good
7214914 in a really scary pub in newcastle where they were all sat with their arms folded saying come on then woman

7214916 it was things like what if i want kids what if nobody fancies me any more and all these things that most people have probably thought
7214917 even if they werent in a marriage everybodys split up with somebody and had all of these horrible thoughts i answered mine throughout the course of the show
7214918 its about entertaining the audience theyre the people whove paid their money

7214935 its very hard to speculate on things that we dont think are going to happen and that are not the base line that we are planning around
7214936 were liverpool worthy champions what do you mean the question is not whether they were worthy the question is whether we were worthy to watch this final
7214937 i think i know what im going to be when i grow up
7214938 if all my other jobs fall through you know being a rock star and a botanist and oh yeah being mayor too if those fall through i think im going to be a chef
7214939 great idea connor you can use one of the kids cookbooks we have and ill help you make dinner this weekend
7214940 i look at all of you today and i cannot help but see myself twenty five years ago at my own barnard commencement
7214941 many a man who has known himself at ten forgets himself utterly between ten and thirty
7214942 if people can be educated to see the lowly side of their own natures it may be hoped that they will also learn to understand and to love their fellow men better a little less hypocrisy and a little more tolerance toward oneself can only have good results in respect for our neighbors for we are all too prone to transfer to our fellows the injustice and violence we inflict upon our own natures
7214943 youve got a convention hall filled with thousands of delegates all of them enthralled by ted kennedys video presence
7214944 given that the filmed tributes done for both jack and bobby at the conventions in 64 and 68 have now become classics i think its fair to say that this video will also be impeccably produced and very powerful the kennedys dont do it any other way
7214945 so imagine what would happen at the instant that video fades to black the lights in the hall come up and who is standing there center stage but ted himself the living heart and soul of this party even if he didnt say a word the place would go absolutely nuts
7214946 if theres any way to get teddy to denver i have to believe they will
7214947 if youre asking me do i think it will happen
7214948 id have to say no do i hold out a hope and prayer absolutely
7214949 i mean look at what happened when teddy arrived at the capitol after his surgery to cast a vote that broke a potential tie on the medicare issue the whole chamber people on both sides of the aisle stood and cheered think of that moment and magnify it by 10
7214950 do i think its a net loss not having teddy there
7214951 no but it would be a huge huge gain if he did make a surprise appearance
7214952 when the living icon of the democratic party in effect passed the torch to him with the kind enthusiasm and energy that both ted and his niece caroline did that day barack obama was validated it was more than an endorsement it was a tremendous affirmation what ted kennedy did was say that obama represented the future
7214953 the man has been through so much these past couple of months that its just not reasonable to expect him to make an appearance
7214954 the alarm bells will be ringing 15 years from now
7214955 i would say its probably close to the 20 percent range
7214956 the spiking is way too high and it needs to be stopped
7214957 were paying for more than we are going to get and we understand that
7214958 weve always been dedicated to finding a long term solution to solidifying the pension fund
7214959 i want to see exactly how the contract would address the pension shortfall
7214960 how do we grow out of this deficit is there a way to fix it i just dont know the answer
7214961 if things play out the way they are going its not going to be pretty next year
7214962 il y a du grabuge en perspective parce que le capitalisme et les capitalistes fran ais sont en train de craquer ce quil leur faudrait cest une bonne vieille r volution
7214963 cette fois la crise capitaliste est s rieuse profonde grave la plus grave depuis les ann es 50 il y a suraccumulation de capital surproduction croyez moi le patronat panique s rieusement la preuve les patrons ne sont plus daccord entre eux
7214964 pour nous autres r volutionnaires les conditions sont r unies pour laction
7214965 ce nouveau parti verra le jour fin janvier a t il pr cis ses structures sont en train de se mettre en place et quelques mois plus tard il y aura les ch ances europ ennes auxquelles nous participerons plus que jamais
7214966 pour une autre europe une europe cologique f ministe humaine avec un salaire minimal pour tous une europe des services publics aussi et une europe ouverte
7214967 et pour ces lections a dit le postier de neuilly il ne sera pas question de se faire satelliser par les socialistes fran ais ou europ ens nous nous battrons avec courage sans mollesse sans concessions la conviction est dans notre camp
7214968 le cio et les jeux olympiques ne peuvent imposer des changements des nations souveraines ou r gler tous les maux du monde
7214969 mais nous pouvons et nous le faisons contribuer un changement positif par le sport
7214970 a lot of our conversations are right here at the dinner table or in the car or wherever
7214971 in the public schools i think retirement planning should be something thats taught from a young age it should be required
7214972 you should be there about 5 30 i love you
7214973 but his hairs gray almost white and i said if youre going into the job market should you color your hair
7214974 whenever most people are convinced we are really bad off and its going to be like this forever thats usually when the economy starts to get better
7214975 by 2013 you should be feeling pretty good about economic growth
7214976 energy is going to be an ongoing issue from now on
7214977 the whole idea of global shipping is problematic because of the costs
7214978 what things are going to look like for working people really depends on what policies are put in place
7214979 i think right now were sort of poised to make some changes that might help turn around that trend
7214980 its hard to identify when a bubble is going to burst
7214981 well most likely be sowing the seeds of the next recession
7214982 i wouldnt hesitate to use the bully pulpit of the office
7214983 i know what a balance sheet is i know what a budget is
7214984 im an average working woman that just decided to take her career one step further
7214985 the idea of insurance is to protect people from catastrophic costs
7214986 at some point people arent going to consider themselves insured if theyre at risk for a huge amount out of pocket just because they have one disease rather than another
7214987 the reality is that this is where the pharmaceutical industry is focusing their research
7214988 the costs might be out of the ballpark but in the past without that drug the person might not be living or not living any type of quality of life
7214989 it gets to the fundamental question of what is insurance
7214990 at some point in our lives we may all join that small pool of users of high cost care
7214991 if i end up having to pay for those last two infusions i would have to file for bankruptcy
7214992 they want to keep employees and be good employers but there is a lot of pressure on the cost of health care right now
7214993 were trying to make sure that the benefit is kept affordable for the other 1 000 employees in the company
7214994 is a drug that costs 100 times more 100 times better
7214995 today we dont know because there is no independent entity that makes those comparisons
7214996 these tiering policies dont accomplish that they just stick it to the chronically ill
7214997 we have to recognize that we can only spend so much on health care
7214998 what are the options other than turn off the lights and say goodbye
7214999 in some instances manufacturers are charging exorbitant prices for single source drugs and prices keep increasing dramatically
7215000 i ask you how could the wealthiest nation in the world allow their disabled to go without medications specifically designed to promote their quality of life
7215001 this is going to go on until the day i die
7215002 ill be this 90 year old lady fighting for her copaxone
7215003 nuestros efectivos no pueden ni acercarse a la zona porque todo est en llamas y se producen constantes detonaciones de las municiones
7215004 roccacolomba sicilia 23 settembre 1963 morta la mennulara al secolo maria rosalia inzerillo domestica della famiglia alfallipe tutti ne parlano perch tutti hanno in qualche modo avuto a che fare con lei perch tutti sanno e non sanno perch c chi la odia e la maledice e chi la ricorda con gratitudine se non con venerazione ne parlano soprattutto gli alfallipe del cui patrimonio la mennulara stata da sempre e senza mai venir meno al suo ruolo di domestica oculata amministratrice
7215005 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
7215006 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
7215007 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
7215008 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
7215009 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
7215010 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
7215011 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
7215012 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
7215013 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
7215014 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
7215015 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
7215016 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
7215017 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
7215018 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
7215019 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
7215020 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
7215021 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
7215022 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
7215023 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
7215024 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
7215025 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
7215026 he has hurt me a lot every time he bathes me he puts things in me he had sex with me more than once its all the time in the bath
7215027 thats the disservice they did to my mom and my family
7215028 to not even give a standard time frame of taking it to a grand jury is ridiculous
7215029 push it forward so that these individuals can try to protect themselves because theyre very vulnerable
7215030 we should have presented it to the grand jury probably in late 2007 or early 2008
7215031 this case regrettably wasnt addressed in a timely manner and we have taken some in house steps to ensure that situations like this do not occur in the future
7215032 when you deal with thousands upon thousands of felony cases occasionally one is going to be mishandled and unfortunately that appears to be the case in this situation
7215033 she displayed symptoms of having just a minor case of alzheimers
7215034 she was able to give me a clear concise description of what had happened to her she was able to identify the suspect in a photo spread and identify him by first name
7215035 and never found a single thing to support what this family was saying
7215036 slowly as the months went by i felt apparently the case didnt matter
7215037 he was considered one of the finest employees at james l west when this occurred
7215038 when you couple that with ms doores passing the whole thing is a tragedy anyway you slice it
7215039 of all the cases i have prosecuted in the hundreds over the last 12 years the kind of case that presents the most problems is allegations of sexual assault in a facility where probably the only witness of the crime is the victim herself
7215040 i think with all elderly victims time is of the essence
7215041 la valanga si staccata allalba sul versante francese e ha coinvolto una cordata di alpinisti provocando nove dispersi e tre feriti poi trasportati allospedale di chamonix
7215042 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
7215043 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
7215044 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
7215045 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
7215046 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
7215047 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
7215048 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
7215049 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
7215050 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
7215051 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
7215052 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
7215053 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
7215054 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
7215055 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
7215056 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
7215057 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
7215058 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
7215059 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
7215060 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
7215061 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
7215062 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
7215063 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
7215064 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
7215065 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
7215066 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
7215067 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
7215068 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
7215069 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
7215070 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
7215071 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
7215072 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
7215073 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
7215074 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
7215075 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
7215076 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
7215077 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
7215078 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
7215079 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
7215080 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
7215081 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
7215082 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
7215083 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
7215084 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
7215085 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
7215086 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
7215087 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
7215088 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
7215089 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
7215090 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
7215091 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
7215092 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
7215093 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
7215094 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
7215095 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
7215096 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
7215097 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
7215098 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
7215099 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
7215100 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
7215101 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
7215102 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
7215103 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
7215104 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
7215105 this is a planning took where all things are going
7215106 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
7215107 het voortraject was het grijze gebied waar meer aandacht voor moet komen men wilde meer aandacht voor drang in de wet
7215108 als de forensische zorg niet goed genoeg werkt dan plakken we er wat anders aan vast
7215109 niet enkel dwang maar ook slimmere alternatieven ingelijfd zijn zodat die slimmere alternatieven beter uitgevoerd kunnen worden om dwang te verminderen
7215110 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
7215111 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
7215112 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
7215113 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
7215114 si considera come termine di paragone tradizionale per la quantificazione della proteinuria in gravidanza quando il valore considerato significativo una proteinuria di almeno 0 3 grammi al giorno per le urine devono essere refrigerate e la raccolta richiede una notevole accuratezza da parte della donna e del personale medico perch in caso di approssimazioni il risultato pu essere ingannevole
7215115 la proteinuria un dato chiave nella gestione della preeclampsia ma le attuali valutazioni cliniche sono tuttaltro che perfette come possiamo migliorare questa situazione cot e colleghi concludono che il test utile per escludere una proteinuria significativa ma non ne raccomandano luso per la sua quantificazione tuttavia la quantificazione non cruciale per gli ostetrici perch una volta che la soglia superata viene fatta la diagnosi la chiave consiste nellescludere la proteinuria e il rapporto tra proteine e creatinina si comporta bene in questo senso la rilevazione di una proteinuria superiore alla soglia in una donna gravida con ipertensione permette di differenziare tra unipertensione gestazionale relativamente innocua e la preeclampsia e impone un considerevole aumento della sorveglianza che spesso comprende il ricovero le ripercussioni sociali e finanziarie per la donna e le conseguenze economiche per il sistema sanitario sono considerevoli

7215117 underneath anger is hurt but its much easier people feel less vulnerable expressing anger than they do expressing hurt
7215118 nigeria produces almost 45 of the greenhouse gas emissions in africa from its gas flaring by oil firms in the niger delta while south africa produces as much from industrial pollution
7215119 nigeria emits 20 billion cubic metres of gas flares annually accounting for 13 of the global 150 billion cubic metres of gas flares every year and making it second in the world after russia
7215120 the emissions from nigeria and south africa huge as they seem can by no means compare to the emissions from the industrialised countries the countries should do something about them at least for the sake of their immediate communities
7215121 this explains why south africa insists that developed countries should take the lead in emissions reduction before developing nations cut down their own emissions
7215122 it doesnt make sense for nigeria and south africa for instance to reduce their emissions while the industrialised nations who are largely responsible for climate change do not make any efforts at reducing theirs
7215123 the atmosphere is a common space for all and our emissions are infinitesimal compared to those in developed countries
7215124 the best and most beautiful things in the world may sometimes be those things that can be seen and touched but to be truly beautiful must be felt with the heart
7215125 dude 4 good looking chicks just walked into the hotel and there headed to the 2 3 4 5 6th floor

7215128 the election results will affect his momentum whether he can move forward or not
7215129 it is pivotal he has to be in the parliament because it will change the dynamics a victory will be a step in the process
7215130 apakah manusia cukup begitu saja mengatakan kami telah beriman sedangkan mereka tidak di uji
7215131 saya akui dakwah yang bapak uraikan sudah mantap tapi kenapa istri bapak sendiri belum masuk islam
7215132 sesungguhnya engkau muhammad tidak akan memberikan petunjuk pada orang orang yang engkau cintai kecuali aku allah yang bisa memberikan petunjuk kepada orang yang aku kehendaki
7215133 apabila telah datang pertolongan allah dan kemenangan dan kamu lihat manusia masuk agama allah dengan berbondong bondong maka bertasbihlah dengan memuji tuhanmu dan mohon ampun kepadanya sesungguhnya dia maha penerima taubat
7215134 yes if you can catch him before he leaves at 4
7215135 we were a bit disappointed with the way we handled the situation there dambulla
7215136 we wanted to execute certain plans which we couldnt but that game has gone the wicket and conditions are different here and all the batsmen are ready for the challenge
7215137 it is a different wicket and looks firm the ball will probably come nicely on to the bat so definitely there will be more runs it is all about getting used to the conditions and the performance on the day
7215138 in one day cricket bowlers do come into the play create opportunities and put pressure but batsmen have more responsibility as they are the ones who control the game because runs on the board are vital
7215139 he has been bowling for the last two days and looking good right now he has a very good chance of playing the match on sunday
7215140 he and murali have been doing the job for us for a long time to get 400 wickets is a great achievement
7215141 both the young players virat kohli and badrinath played really well in the last match
7215142 it was good to see young players coming in and feeling comfortable in the international set up its very important for indian cricket that we have competition for places
7215143 we are discussing various combinations at the moment and would like to be pretty flexible we will take it game by game
7215144 enough of this i am going to choose another way
7215145 to fully understand my unconscious actions of this past life i will need to experience what i did to others to have that level of compassion i did not have before
7215146 did you see what she did now what a horrible thing what is wrong with her
7215147 i am so grateful i have learned a different way that is so much more supportive and i will apply those principles to my life right now
7215148 i am going to fix this for you i am going to make you happy
7215149 no one needs fixing and if i thought they needed fixing on some level i must believe i need to be rescued also we all just have to remember it is about our attachment to the outcome only our own thinking needs adjusting
7215150 you know i found that its much easier for me to put this sign up than go get more 5s from the bank people usually pay with a 20 but when i put this up people are happy to pay with 5s
7215151 whats the worst thing that would happen if i didnt do it
7215152 yeah i would love to start that book but i have to pay off these credit cards
7215153 i would love to buy a house but i just cant afford it

7215177 it seemed that my wife shirley was always pregnant until we found out what was causing it
7215178 yes i did a great job raising him and he is an amazing person that will create anything he desires he doesnt need me to dictate from the patterns created by an old worn out societies beliefs mine and previous generations he needs to forge ahead like the arrow being released from the bow my bow and find new worlds and ways to be at peace with himself and his purpose
7215179 you are not good enough as you are but you have potential just wait until i fix you
7215180 my problem is i see the potential in everyone and everything i could see the potential in my husband what we could have become but he just wasnt willing to reach for the stars with me
7215181 isnt that what we do see the potential potential is what we looked to in our partner when we were 25 but we cannot do this anymore
7215182 you are not perfect yet but if you just do as i say you can become my perfect partner and we will live my perfect life and we can write the book on lived happily ever after
7215183 i am not perfect yet i am always looking to fulfill my potential and someday if i do all the right things it will happen
7215184 you need to blog about this this is not for just you there are many of us that need this insight
7215185 ive spent most of my life living in potential the potential of who i might become
7215186 was closer to what he felt was correct in his heart
7215187 it is so wonderful that you make at least 40 000 pesos a month
7215188 i make 40 000 pesos every month with ease and grace
7215189 dont come any closer to the inner circle of my world
7215190 you dont have to create an experiment that needs to be difficult to obtain exactly what you are looking for you only need to surrender and to trust that you deserve an abundant and joyful life beyond your most cherished dreams and beyond the illusion of struggle
7215191 just be in oneness by not doing anything but breathing and witnessing the beauty of the all in every moment every situation that is presented before our eyes and ears and fingertips
7215192 you will understand you will be amazed once the bitterness is no more
7215193 chasing the illusion is getting stuff what we really want on a soul level what lies does the secret keep you believing
7215194 now what i have all this stuff and i still have a hole within and a wanting not fulfilled
7215195 now i got all this stuff i thought i wanted and i am still left with the hollowness of knowing something important is missing what i am left with is just more stuff to be responsible for that sucks away my freedom
7215196 wow i wonder what my creator has planned for me if not this
7215197 there is still another way an elevator to bypass even that consciousness because it is still a doing or trying to get something out there belief whereas i know there is nowhere to go or nothing to do but accept the wisdom that all is already present it is about allowing what already is
7215198 show me my highest good show me my most divinely lead job career path relationship position in the world the universe the original intention of the design of humanity my intent is to know what you my divine creator intended as my most divine birth right my divine journey guided by your intent you wisdom let it be as it is
7215199 why in the universe would i want to stay the same
7215200 you already have everything you want you just need to allow it
7215201 that is your birthright allow what already is acknowledge your abundance of wealth allow your dream home allow passion allow joy by just removing the veil that you have carefully shrouded it with by listening to those who know not but remember everything you desire is only a reflection of what you really want it is only a reflection of your desire to come home
7215202 for this or something better for the highest good of all with ease and grace i totally surrender to my god self
7215203 solution and the problem always rests in the same space
7215204 well if you had told me what was going on in your marriage i would have behaved differently but you never told me
7215205 well thats not fair ann if i had know then what i found out from different people later i would have thought and acted differently
7215206 mom you dont get it it is not about what you knew or didnt know this is my life and my journey i just needed you to say something kind whether you understood or not whether you felt i was right or wrong that shouldnt have mattered it wasnt about whether you approved or disapproved of my actions it was about just needing you during a very painful time to just be my mom to say something like ann i dont understand why you are doing this but i am here for you i know this must be an extremely emotional and difficult time for you and if i can help you with your children or if you need someone to talk to i am here for you but no mom instead you supported a man that never even cared for you and all you still do is to continually justify your past criticism of me
7215207 my mom is still alive we still have time to heal this conflict but what about her
7215208 even though your parents are dead you cant let it go even though they left you a lot of money and they didnt have to you cant find it in yourself to forgive them and look at the things they did right
7215209 im tried of hearing about what your parents did wrong please tell me something good about your parents anything please
7215210 well my mom was a really good cook but she never allowed me in the kitchen to learn or help

7215277 non viewers perceive television to have power they believe it can steal time can affect consumer behavior and can influence how autonomous children are
7215278 based on the interviews the surveys and the time use diaries it appears that those who do not watch television not only reject television in order to keep sex violence shallow news coverage and consumerism out of their lives but also to encourage family interaction their childrens independence and creativity and a wise use of their time

7215306 probably more than 20 percent of the global tb burden may be attributable to smoking
7215307 smoking may increase the risk by about 20 percent of either getting infected getting the disease or dying
7215308 the evidence is mounting and coherent even a small effect would create a large and cumulative increase in infection disease and death this is very important information and now we have it
7215309 among people infected with tb effective tobacco control can lower the number of people that go from latent infection to disease to death

7215323 to improve public health in hungary yes i would suggest people give up smoking and eat more vegetables of course
7215324 it sounds like i like to study and study and study
7215325 for instance three months ago i was in a self service restaurant at lunchtime and smokers were sitting in the non smokers section smoking
7215326 we asked the waiter to ask them to stop but he said sorry he couldnt do anything
7215327 this is one of my dreams to organize a nationwide campaign against tobacco use with governmental support
7215328 we started the campaign to explain to people why it is important to not misuse this emblem
7215329 a serious situation might happen and people wouldnt know that the red cross means an operation to help in a disaster or armed conflict
7215330 a swedish vaccine against nicotine will be tested on 400 people in three nordic countries
7215331 the tobacco industry has had plenty of time to get ready for the new requirements there is no justification for more excuses when human lives are at stake
7215332 we applaud india and the united kingdom for taking this important action to protect the health of their citizens and encourage other countries to follow their lead
7215333 scientific evidence indicates that picture warnings increase public awareness of the many ways tobacco use harms the human body and encourage smokers to quit these warnings also help counter tobacco marketing that falsely portrays tobacco use as glamorous and appealing
7215334 the law has totally failed because the responsible structures in the albanian government have not been mobilised to ensure its application in practice
7215335 though a few fines have been imposed on bars they have not been collected and also there are other businesses that have tolerated smoking
7215336 but some people use their lungs to smoke up cigarette smoke
7215337 i remember when i first saw sponge the image of the thick black cancer causing tar being squeezed from the sponge was sharp and confronting
7215338 i was probably about seven when it first went to air and i still remember the ad
7215339 its a bit like the grim reaper ad of cigarette advertising
7215340 as late as 1983 the tobacco industry and its lawyers were still denying the existence of scientific and medical evidence that smoking makes you sick
7215341 when we did a dry run testing smokers we found good results especially amongst a generation that hadnt seen it before
7215342 con la costituzione del gruppo giovani allinterno di sistema moda italia una nuova generazione di giovani imprenditori o meglio di imprenditori giovani vuole riaffermare la centralit dellindustria tessile moda nella scena economica italiana
7215343 crediamo che i punti di forza di sistema moda italia siano la sua rappresentativit e la capacit di permettere un continuo incontro confronto al suo interno tra imprenditori di diverse sezioni merceologiche tra loro necessariamente collegati
7215344 im afraid that i myself am quite boring i cant imagine anyone who would want to play me
7215345 ive got no doubts or fears if you love what you do and work at it others will too
7215346 in light of this commitment the commission has concluded that the proposed transaction would not significantly impede effective competition
7215347 there is no good reason why a switch from tobacco products to less harmful nicotine delivery systems should not be encouraged
7215348 ages 18 to 25 are critical years when one third of smokers start and others who began smoking as adolescents either stop smoking or become regular smokers
7215349 the main effect is to recruit new smokers from among young adults
7215350 movies encourage them to experiment and once they start experimenting with cigarettes other factors take hold movies create the expectation that smoking will turn out okay
7215351 bars and clubs were typically places where people could go and smoke so in a sense that acted as a positive sort of encouragement or endorsement for smoking more cigarettes

7215359 one repairer commented that the deposition of dirt could be substantial enough to affect the pitch of the reed
7215360 two others claimed that if a musician tended to play in a particular key that this could be determined from the distribution of dirt around particular reeds
7215361 laboratory experiments confirm that nicotine alters the structure and function of the brain within a day of the very first dose in humans nicotine induced alterations in the brain can trigger addiction with the first cigarette
7215362 while smoking one cigarette will keep withdrawal symptoms away for less than an hour in longtime smokers novice smokers find that one cigarette suppresses withdrawal for weeks at a time
7215363 one dose of nicotine affects brain function long after the nicotine is gone from the body
7215364 the important lesson here is that youth have all the same symptoms of nicotine addiction as adults do even though they may be smoking only a few cigarettes per month
7215365 we always knew that the smoking ban would have a negative effect on the state of our streets
7215366 try not to worry about my health i go for a cat scan on october 4th i should have the results about a week later the appointments are taking a long time so i must not be in such dire shape or they would rush them im glad you never really had the desire to smoke what do your lungs look like after all of those years of second hand smoke i cant wait to see you and patti more often gotta go for now love forever mom
7215367 its a bit premature to work out where you draw the line but effectively if youve got sand in between your toes you are not allowed to smoke
7215368 if the council took it the next step after public feedback then yes those sorts of places parks reserves outside of council buildings are all potentially up for grabs
7215369 this is just the first step to get some feedback from the public
7215370 my view is these types of laws prohibiting things in public places are not necessarily the way to tackle an addiction and health problem
7215371 if we are trying to tackle a littering problem littering infringements are the way to go
7215372 many smokers believe that opening windows in the car and smoking in separate rooms will protect their children
7215373 the fact is this offers no protection to young children the only way to ensure a smoke free environment is to smoke outside the house and to not smoke at all in the car
7215374 children exposed to second hand smoke in the home and car are at a much higher risk of sudden infant death syndrome sids respiratory infections ear problems and more severe asthma
7215375 this message is an important one as a lot of people are still smoking in their homes and a lot more are smoking in cars
7215376 aboriginal people spend a lot of time travelling in vehicles and dont always understand the risks they think it will be ok if they have the windows down
7215377 obviously quitting is the best possible way to protect your family from second hand smoke but if you are not ready to quit just yet ensure that no one smokes in your home or car
7215378 its up to the adults to look after children as they cant remove themselves from situations where people are smoking we hope this campaign will empower parents to implement rules that other family and friends will respect
7215379 the heavy smokers in deprived areas we have not been successful in stopping because we need much more money for cessation services and different ways of bringing people into cessation services not just in health for instance at debt counselling and sexual health counselling
7215380 the reach of the current cessation services do not go far enough we need to change that
7215381 boys are going into sport which acts as a deterrent but girls are more affected by body image peer pressure and role models you see kate moss smoking all the time it is still perceived as glamorous it is depressing but it is
7215382 smoking bans do not encourage people on low incomes to give up smoking
7215383 i am heartened that public support for smoke free work and public places in europe remains so high this can only strengthen the momentum towards making european public and work places smoke free by 2009
7215384 towards a europe free from tobacco smoke policy options at eu level
7215385 we have been in final talks with the international olympic committee and other groups to fine tune draft regulations that will be released on thursday
7215386 we are very much at the beginning stage of the battle against tobacco in china and a smoke free olympics will hopefully help us get the message out
7215387 the dangers of smoking are there but a smoking ban could cause instability
7215388 part of the problem is that the tobacco industry is run by the government
7215389 this complicates the whole issue and leads to government policy that is not clear cut
7215390 i am just one person and my power is limited but i will carry on to the very end
7215391 this finding backs up recently released research showing most young smokers regret taking up the habit
7215392 it is heartening to see a gradual decrease in the number of young women who are smoking and an increased number of pregnant callers to the quitline
7215393 there is a desperate need to convey to smokers the potentially devastating health consequences of tobacco use and we shouldnt sanitise this message
7215394 people who smoke are about twice as likely to have a stroke than someone who has never smoked yet fewer than one in ten smokers are able to identify smoking as a cause of stroke
7215395 this campaign might not be easy to watch but the health effects of smoking are rarely pretty this is an accurate portrayal of one of the many disturbing health consequences of smoking and smokers are entitled to know the truth
7215396 someone would need to have this type of surgery if they have been found to have a narrowing or blockage in the artery in their neck the operation clears out blockages from the artery in the neck that might otherwise break off and lodge in the brain
7215397 over 70 of patients who have had this operation at st vincents hospital in the five years between 2002 and 2006 were current or former smokers and in the past two years all of the patients under 50 years of age were smokers
7215398 smoking doubles the risk of most arterial disease and causes patients to present earlier in life sometimes decades earlier smoking also trebles the risk of complications following vascular surgery
7215399 the quit campaign provides a very effective and strong message about the link between smoking and stroke
7215400 awareness of the link between smoking and stroke gives smokers another reason to think twice about lighting up and hopefully leads them to quit smoking

7215412 i believe it is our duty to adopt this as soon as possible
7215413 too often in the past our government has sided with the tobacco companies when they challenged other nations tobacco control measures as violations of trade agreements
7215414 u s ratification of the treaty would send a strong message to the rest of the world that we will not support these efforts and instead put protection of public health ahead of tobacco industry interests

7215471 since vitamin d is produced in the skin through solar or uv irradiation and high serum levels have been shown to correlate with a reduced risk of ms this suggests that vitamin d may regulate the immune response and may promote a hosts reaction to a pathogen
7215472 evidence has shown that the maintenance of an adequate vitamin d level may have a protective effect in individuals predisposed to ms
7215473 one device of vitamin d action may be to preserve balance in the t cell reaction and thus avoid autoimmunity

7215482 we are also in contact with foreign governments with interests in somalia to seek their cooperation and assistance
7215483 what the liberals are doing is targeting a handful of specific things in our savings package in order to play politics he told network ten
7215484 they are playing with fire because if they punch holes in the budget surplus the end result is that it is harder for the rba to reduce interest rates
7215485 the key people in the frame here are the liberal party he said
7215486 dr nelson is fond of describing himself and the liberal party as the alternative government its about time they started acting like an alternative government
7215487 there are a number of small and important measures to which we are opposed and as a matter of principle we will oppose them dr nelson told the nine network

7215529 people automatically assume that if it weakens the hazards go down with it but in the case of rainfall its not a function of wind speed
7215530 this is unprecedented in terms of the slow nature of this storm the large circulation and the fact that its impacted probably about 90 percent of the state with heavy rains and severe weather

7215535 prescription sleeping pills can be important in certain situations but they can cause a lot of adverse effects and are not a long term solution for older people sleep medication can increase the risk of falling as well as interfering with other medicines
7215536 sleeping pills are not the best way to solve underlying problems like depression or painful conditions that are interfering with a good nights sleep
7215537 most people know that coffee cola or black tea can interfere with their sleep
7215538 but many do not realise that alcohol is one of the major causes of a bad nights sleep

7215560 here you graduated from college so you should be able to figure out this file
7215561 i was young and just graduated and thought i could kill the world
7215562 she really put me straight she made a point of indicating that experience is equitable to going to college and she was right
7215563 never stopped dreaming of a house with a white picket fence days spent baking or playing bridge or volunteering at the local library
7215564 your grandfather and i just figured we should treat people decently bar

7215568 and yet i knew that men who might easily have been my brothers could still inspire their rawest fears
7215569 than i can my white grandmother a woman who helped raise me a woman who sacrificed again and again for me a woman who loves me as much as she loves anything in this world but a woman who once confessed her fear of black men who passed by her on the street and who on more than one occasion has uttered racial or ethnic stereotypes that made me cringe
7215570 she was really a very liberal person liberal in politics and i think liberal in thinking
7215571 frankly that story when it was in the book i felt didnt need to be in there
7215572 from our grandmother he gets his pragmatism his levelheadedness his ability to stay centered in the eye of the storm
7215573 i used to think i dont know whos the supervisor here me or her
7215574 when stanley was still alive they would go on cruises around the islands and theyd do nothing but play bridge
7215575 she couldnt give it away because no one wanted it
7215576 when this is done people are going to say oh my gosh
7215577 a house that has character stands a good chance of growing more valuable as it grows older while a house in the prevailing mode whatever that mode may be is soon out of fashion stale and unprofitable
7215578 its certainly an unusual way to come into a home particularly at the turn of the century
7215579 i try to do something that inspires you to look at it
7215580 if they dont sound better than they look i dont know what the point is
7215581 its just amazing what hes able to do with a piece of wood
7215582 we have a lot of different artists we have water color we have oil we have mixed media wood jewelry just a little bit of everything so for anything that someone would want theres something here for them
7215583 my work is really kind of an exploration between straightforward sculpture straightforward function and then really playing with the line between pragmatism and sculpture
7215584 so thats why you have some here that like the big pieces are just sculpture and then you have the pot up there thats very much just a functional object but then a lot of them just really kind of equivocate between being something that has potential use but then its also very much sculptural in form
7215585 theres a fire on the horizon which would be eden burning then theres a pitcher spilled in the front that can denote loss and if you look in the tree theres a snake thats scaring away a bird from its nest so theres a lot of angst ridden symbols in there normally i do things that deal with light and atmosphere so thats a little bit of a push for me
7215586 were trying to look for a midwest farm scene im looking for something specific
7215587 im very specific we have a lot of art pieces but i like the particular oils and landscapes and then some of the photography pieces and there were some good ceramics there too
7215588 we are addicted to energy and that addiction is not going to be cured for many years unless we address it seriously
7215589 and until it is were going to be living with energy price volatitliy its a fact of life
7215590 i think at this time were very much focused on the current rate case which were very much concerned about being able to do things that enhance our reliability and customer service
7215591 still going to be a pain for winter no matter what
7215592 once you introduce things like greenhouse emissions and likely policies to reduce that the cost of burning natural gas will increase
7215593 because they dont live here and theyre just trying to make a buck
7215594 its not like were on a mandate to see more greenspace and deny a rebuild
7215595 that is a positive change that clarifies the intent of the mayor and the city council
7215596 as the rebuilding party or as the neighborhood people i could be on either side of that situation
7215597 a clear eyed pragmatist who will get the job done
7215598 into the right wing of his party and yielded to the very swift boat politics he once so deplored
7215599 hell have to figure out which of his seven kitchen tables to sit at
7215600 i know that joe will campaign well for senator obama and so i think hes going to be very formidable
7215601 ive always respected joe biden but i disagreed with him from the time he voted against the first gulf war to his position where he said you had to break iraq up into three different countries we really have different approaches to many national security issues
7215602 he strengthens baracks foreign policy experience and can attack john mccain like barack cant because barack is the kind of individual that believe in being above the fray
7215603 but i knew that wasnt going to happen it didnt seem like a good fit
7215604 i guess this is what he has to do to combat the constant attacks of hes too young too inexperienced
7215605 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
7215606 hes an expert on foreign policy whose heart and values are firmly rooted in the middle class he has stared down dictators and spoken out for american cops and firefighters
7215607 instead night after night week after week year after year he returned home to wilmington on a lonely amtrak train when his senate business was done he raised his boys first as a single dad then alongside his wonderful wife jill
7215608 if obama loses racism is the only reason mccain might beat him
7215609 nem os provedores nem o sistema de justi a do brasil entraram em contato conosco s sabemos de blogueiros e usu rios brasileiros preocupados quanto censura de seus blogs
7215610 in order to improve the quality of instruction at the college and university level all faculty should be required to spend time working outside the academic world in professions relevant to the courses they teach
7215611 this is the closest team ive been around since ive been here
7215612 guys just hanging out not just on the field but off the field
7215613 when you are harried by day and haunted by night by the fact you are negro living constantly at tip toe stance never quite knowing what to expect next and you are plagued with inner fears and outer resentments when you are forever fighting the degenerating sense of nobody ness then you will understand why we find it difficult to wait
7215614 dont you think that if something were ever to happen between us that our friendship will be ruined
7215615 do you think it would ruin our friendship if something happened
7215616 the itunes library has been moved to itunes library damaged itl
7215617 he has this air of perfection and joe biden is more down to earth
7215618 it just speaks volumes about how barack obama doesnt stand for anything
7215619 most people feel that if she wanted to press to be vice president she would have made a bigger push for it

7215622 negli occhi della gente si vede quello che vedranno non quello che hanno visto
7215623 ma quanto vive luomo vive mille anni o uno solo vive una settimana o pi secoli per quanto tempo muore luomo che vuol dire per sempre
7215624 toglimi il pane se vuoi toglimi laria ma non togliermi il tuo sorriso dura la mia lotta e torno con gli occhi stanchi a volte daver visto la terra che non cambia ma entrando il tuo sorriso sale al cielo cercandomi ed apre per me tutte le porte della vita
7215625 alcuni dicono che la pioggia brutta ma non sanno che permette di girare a testa alta con il viso coperto dalle lacrime
7215626 e credere in te soltanto giurare in te soltanto riporre in te soltanto la mia fede la mia forza il mio orgoglio tutto il mio mondo tutto quel che sogno e tutto quel che spero
7215627 vorrei tornare bambino perch le ginocchia sbucciate fanno meno male di un cuoreinfranto
7215628 sussurra al mondo ci che sei ma urla a te stesso per capirti
7215629 we were living in new jersey and working in new york
7215630 the cost of living was crazy the boat just always felt like it was sinking in some way whether it was not having enough time to spend with our girls not having enough time to spend with each other or not having enough time to keep the house clean we just got tired of the rat race
7215631 african american teen girls are avid readers way more than they get credit for
7215632 what they are looking for when they pick up a book are characters that look like them or speak to their experience
7215633 in every generation there is a chosen one one girl in all the world one born with the strength and skill to hunt the vampires

7215637 bei aller vorsicht k nnen wir behaupten dass es f r frauen ein hohes brustkrebsrisiko bedeutet wenn sie mehr als ein traumatisches ereignis in ihrem leben durchstehen mussten
7215638 it is clear that they were kidnapped because their schedule was to come back to the hotel before 12 in the afternoon and we dont have their whereabouts
7215639 i have decided to raise no objections under australias foreign investment policy to chinalco acquiring a shareholding interest of up to 14 99 percent of rio tinto plc on the basis of chinalco making two undertakings
7215640 tomorrow ill go back home and tell my family all my stories from the competition
7215641 the injury continued from then so when i was fighting today i felt a lot of pain in my shoulder and i decided not to force myself
7215642 i am very happy because i won the first boxing gold medal for my country
7215643 after a very good preparation i wanted to deliver to the spectators but i did not expect that my opponent would get injured
7215644 i told myself when you get gold you can cry
7215645 i dont even think we played our best volleyball today but we were able to grind it out
7215646 i think a couple of things are happening that werent happening before
7215647 people are staying longer in the team so now the team is stronger
7215648 their recalcitrant members were the ones who started this which caused the death of innocent civilians
7215649 it is the job of the armed forces and the police to provide security and protection
7215650 short of that there will be no let up in government offensives
7215651 we have not scuttled the negotiations but we need a proper ceasefire mechanism that we should follow
7215652 we want to continue peace negotiations but not at the expense of our laws
7215653 we have gone a long way for peace but not at the expense of our innocent civilians
7215654 reaching the ncaa tournament is what you play for and if the team strives to reach that level we have a legitimate shot to get there
7215655 our team goals have come as much from the players as they have from the coaching staff the players are excited for the season and they want to be successful
7215656 through relevant i reach a demographic that has strong faith morals and passion but disagreements politically
7215657 it wouldnt be wise for me to be seen as picking a political side when ive consistently said both sides are right in some areas and wrong in some areas
7215658 i am both muslim and christian just like im both an american of african descent and a woman im 100 percent both
7215659 so why would i spend time to try to reconcile all of christian belief with all of islam
7215660 at the most basic level i understand the two religions to be compatible thats all i need
7215661 all i know is the calling of my heart to islam was very much something about my identity and who i am supposed to be
7215662 excluded from true christianity are all the so called churches that persecuted people blah blah etc
7215663 at the end of the day there has to be right doing
7215664 laporta a pr sent ses excuses et ne m ritait pas a
7215665 lpfan64 al parecer los xicos de espa a les dijeron a los muchachos de lp en el m amp g q esta web existe
7215666 im not able to do the job i want to do and im not able to do what the church needs i suggested if it would be agreeable to them i would stay on the staff as a writer and occasional preacher and they said fine
7215667 it was a very emotional meeting a very sad meeting but we all sensed it being gods plan
7215668 for there shall arise false christs and false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders insomuch that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect
7215669 and i give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand
7215670 spiritual execises of ignatius loyola founder of the jesuit order
7215671 nevertheless i have this against you that you have left your first love
7215672 whatever is good whatever is right whatever is noble whatever is praiseworthy think upon such things
7215673 how long will you keep us in suspense if you are the christ tell us plainly
7215674 i told you and you do not believe the works that i do in my fathers name bear witness about me 26 but you do not believe because you are not part of my flock
7215675 i have shown you many good works from the father for which of them are you going to stone me
7215676 it is not for a good work that we are going to stone you but for blasphemy because you being a man make yourself god
7215677 everyone who is fully trained will be like his teacher
7215678 what can and should a pastor do to foster enthusiasm for missions in his congregation
7215679 with foreign missions on the decline at least in the us
7215680 theyre beautiful historic homes but its rare on a moving project that you have this many at the same time
7215681 i would have been a little bit startled if i hadnt expected it
7215682 its just what you can do and how hard you work
7215683 he is a wunderkind who was sophisticated not only about raising money but the political process
7215684 i knew barack obama was going to be the next president
7215685 there was just something in my heart that really led me to believe that
7215686 even living here as long as i have i often have to sit and think about it for a minute which way do i want to go
7215687 some assumed that the inner beltline was i 440 and the outer beltline was i 540
7215688 there was a good percentage of folks who liked them and there was also a good percentage who thought it made it more confusing
7215689 i have a feeling that inner and outer is probably going to stay part of the conversation
7215690 for democrats its important that they frame the public understanding of obama favorably and make it stick in the minds of the public
7215691 obama is a newcomer kind of a work in progress there is some unease among a lot of swing voters they need to introduce obama and produce a simple compelling narrative that sticks in the minds of the public
7215692 its a world we better figure out because we cant ask our students to come into a classroom put those things aside and sit in a row and think were interesting
7215693 there has been a tendency to use technology as a substitute for curriculum
7215694 technique and how to ideas have taken the place of deciding what it is exactly we want these children to learn
7215695 but i have nothing against the technology if its in the service of grown ups facing their responsibilities to decide what the students need to know precisely if they did that these technical gadgets will be valuable
7215696 it gives kids a chance to use things they already use in real life and make that connection in school
7215697 we did have to take a hard line approach to that
7215698 you can restrict all kinds of stuff and you can drive yourself nuts trying to police all of it they culbreth are probably kind of opening themselves up to something
7215699 these teachers say this pilot signals their commitment to our students to meet them where they are as opposed to where the teachers are comfortable
7215700 they scream they sing they fall down they take their clothes off they cross dress they vomit
7215701 it is only the british people not the germans or the french
7215702 these people are giving a bad name to their country
7215703 many arrests are due to behavior caused by excessive drinking
7215704 i think that in their country they are like prisoners and they want to feel free
7215705 its because of british culture no one can relax so they become inebriated to be the people they want to be
7215706 i do not in my head want to think that it can get any worse

7215720 its a failure the prime minister is not a powerful person who can make a decision to revive the talks the worst thing is not being able to see aung san suu kyi

7215776 after two decades of rising costs home owners are now putting energy efficiency near the top of their remodeling concerns
7215777 the only way to bring green into 120 million existing households is through remodeling
7215778 americans spent more than 230 billion last year in home remodeling with energy efficient and sustainable products representing an increasing share of the market
7215779 simply putting in that low e window doesnt solve the problem
7215780 home owners need to look at the whole room and eventually use a whole house approach to maximize efficiency

7215830 uma medalha de ouro e outra de prata ol mpicas dois t tulos mundiais seis t tulos da liga mundial foram oito anos brilhantes minha tristeza independente de eu ficar vai ser perder o conv vio com esses jogadores que eu aprendi a amar a respeitar
7215831 i take them to my car a 6 pack at a time
7215832 once ive given them all away im intending to do it all over again i feel kind of like im like the johnny appleseed for murphys saloon in north texas
7215833 my next goal is to listen to all the podcasts
7215834 so to re iterate my qualifications for biggest fan i have
7215835 its amazing this is what i get paid to do and this is what i work for
7215836 this is all i really know to go out there every fifth day and do my job
7215837 obviously i want people to hear the album and love it
7215838 but when it comes down to it i dont care because this is a totally unfiltered expression of who i am and what i do
7215839 this was a totally different experience and one that felt emancipating
7215840 first i got out of the old label which was major now im just so happy not to be caught up in that big machine thats breaking down for a while it felt like i was on deck of the titanic and i was just supposed to play the violin for myself on the ship as it was going down i know that i was feeling that way and could tell the people at the company were feeling that too but no one could admit it there was bullshit going down all around me and i was extremely happy to get out of it all of course then i had to figure out what the hell to do i knew i wanted to make another record but how
7215841 before long i had an epiphany because i even reached out to other writers and it wasnt working
7215842 i thought maybe im not being specific enough about what i want finally i just went with my gut instinct keep it up soulful happy and real i dont want to do anything but that i dont want to try to accommodate what i think other people want so i was super clear to myself and from that moment everything flowed
7215843 we decided to get back to the roots of recording we all set up in one room and communicated with each other rather than playing to something that had already been laid down to tape so in five days we had fifteen songs down leave the mistakes and keep the vibe
7215844 we completed the whole album in basically three weeks im so excited in a way i havent been in a long time it feels like so much has come together right this time and i think its because im not trying to prove anything anymore
7215845 everything seems based on fear at the big labels today and you cant get music made like that you cant do anything like that this was the opposite of that
7215846 we were going to put it out ourselves solely through go funk yourself records
7215847 then concord got word of it and that we were doing it ourselves and approached us about going through the recently relaunched stax records so we invited them into the studio and played them a few things and they were like we have to have this and it was so nice to hear enthusiasm coming from a company based on what we were doing not based on what we could be doing
7215848 stax is the epitome of what im about that was the original integrated soul music thats the vibe that moved me about soul music when i was twelve and it moves me still
7215849 i want to get on the bus and just go for it playing live is when it all comes together its my thing the part i love the most
7215850 i love the road but when i stopped wanting to pack my bag and get on the bus that was a telltale sign it was time for a change
7215851 so with a heavy heart a deep respect for where she came from and an artists hunger to evolve heidi newfield flew the trick pony coop
7215852 right away we just clicked right away i think he got my song sensibility and was right on track with it loved that i wanted to step out from what i had been doing kind of get out of the bar room for a minute
7215853 thats the way i feel like a record should be made
7215854 its been creative and fun and professional and just a total joy
7215855 from the moment that we started in on it we all three just sort of looked at each other and went ok wait a minute this is really a special song
7215856 i still listen to johnny amp june right now after all the writing and going through it and living with it and i still get chills up my spine
7215857 powerful and big and crazy and wild everybody wants to find that kind of a big love in their life
7215858 it takes a special man to watch their spouse get on a bus and go up amp down the road
7215859 this job takes a lot out of you and it is very time consuming and even when youre home youre not sometimes my wheels are always turning and he goes off in that way too but then you have your time together we do a good job supporting one another
7215860 interesting and sad the ultimate joy and the ultimate pain and sorrow at the same time but my mom its weird because i really feel her shes with me very much shes right there with me
7215861 we didnt know what we were doing and we certainly didnt have the money to be running me all over back and forth between nashville but they did their very best to try to support me
7215862 there are parts of this record that are not just about a man and a woman for me
7215863 theyre about my experiences all the way around like leaving the group and my feelings about that the pain and the hurt or the joy of being independent and standing on my own two feet everybody who listens to this record can take these songs and place them in their lives and relate to them
7215864 i wanted to create a body of work no matter how long it took me
7215865 i had no interest in just going in and making another nashville country record that gets thrown out there
7215866 i respect the originality of an artist like dr john
7215867 he created a persona to use as an agent of fearlessness
7215868 when spurs equalised i looked at the players and thought right lads this is another test for you
7215869 you could never question the character of this side and i never have but i think we have a bit more now
7215870 some players can play when these things are going on some cant berbatov is among the latter
7215871 we wont be dancing in the streets of sunderland tonight well celebrate with a cup of tea like we always do
7215872 ein gro teil der zeitverbesserung geht auf das konto unseres neuen dfi motors mit benzindirekteinspritzung aber auch beim setup des autos haben wir uns gegen ber 2007 stark verbessert obwohl ich fast drei zehntel schneller war als der beste acura wird es im rennen sicher sehr eng werden
7215873 wir haben gegen ende des qualifyings noch einmal eine ver nderung am auto vorgenommen die sich ausgezahlt hat
7215874 ich bin zuversichtlich dass wir das auto f r das rennen noch ein wenig schneller machen k nnen
7215875 mit startplatz zwei bin ich sehr zufrieden viel mehr war heute nicht m glich
7215876 ich erwarte morgen ein sehr spannendes rennen auf dieser fahrerisch u erst anspruchsvollen strecke die qualifying runde von romain war eine grandiose leistung
7215877 auch in der gt2 klasse k nnte es enger kaum zugehen der ausgang des rennens ist komplett offen
7215878 i tried to make the songs have a simpler pop resonance than the avant garde rock of comets on fire where the music is much more complex and harder to dig through so i pared it down to basic chords but left room for a certain amount of controlled chaos
7215879 with this new album my goal was to retain that simple pleasure element while making the actual music far more complicated i wanted to make something complex sound simple where the emotional complexity the relationship between the listener and the music would still be there
7215880 is primarily architectural how high the castle got built and the intricacies of the workmanship
7215881 because there are more people in the band theres definitely a wall of sound type thing happening and part of the new textures came from having so many new players who are all great technicians but they dont let their technical skills separate them from the soul of the music
7215882 ive always believed your records should be something completely different from your live show to me it should be like a big hollywood movie experience where you dont want to see all the details all the little things that make it come together you just want the result to hit you
7215883 if i could just get back to texas if i could hold you in my arms tonight the way we used to do when we were young and restless
7215884 it started with jack ingrams first record when we were all at smu in dallas hes become quite a craftsman both in writing and producing im proud to have his name on there he does great work and no one knows the jackopierce sound better than cary plus
7215885 we really wanted to showcase that song in a way that would draw new folks to it the lyrics are amazing and timeless jack is a 3rd generation army kid i think hes read every war book ever written the lyrics every generation makes the same mistakes but still we send our sons away to do the same are universal almost everyone can relate to that in some way
7215886 i couldnt just take a break i needed it to be over i needed to find myself outside of being the guy from jackopierce
7215887 i was in the middle of a painful divorce and it seemed as though my life was falling apart brady and i started scheming on the phone about the reunion while brandt was working on jack
7215888 we both admit that we did not realize or appreciate what we had
7215889 there is a lot more gratitude for each other and for the gifts we have to write and play music
7215890 we have been blessed with the ability to strap guitars on our backs get on a plane and go play a show anywhere in the country
7215891 that is the career i always hoped we would have
7215892 i love the universal theme that is in the lyrics of
7215893 both horses were brought to a farm in benton where tiger eyed will have a chance to tend to the filly shell return to training once the foal is raised the newborn will never follow in moms footsteps regulations require a racehorses paternity to be documented and trainers have no clue who the father is
7215894 how in the world did you get on the floor
7215895 sit with him like when you guys are coming back from the camping trip
7215896 you know you love me too infinite xs and os a
7215897 jane youre only seventeen its not like you cant just go on your own in future
7215898 nonostante il terremoto che sta succedendo nelindustria musicale questa band ancora rilevante abbiamo risolto i nostri problemi e ora abbiamo colto la nostra vera essenza musicale abbiamo sfidato noi stessi siamo affamati comprendiamo limportanza di realizzare nuove canzoni comprendiamo quanto sia importante non diventare una band di nostalgici nessuno ha mai voluto questo i metallica hanno ancora qualcosa da dare non importa ci che pensa il pubblico come band faremo quello che dobbiamo fare
7215899 posso onestamente dire che questo album il miglior album che avremmo mai potutuo fare posso garantire che la gente lo apprezzer tanto quanto i nostri vecchi dischi no non posso e non possiamo offrire alcuna garanzia ma vi prometto che non potevamo realizzare un disco migliore
7215900 credo che siamo tutti consapevoli del pericolo di diventare una band che vive solo sul proprio passato credo che ogni band che stata grande nel tempo rischi di dover far fronte al futuro
7215901 i predict stocks will rocket to 30 increases settle and finally creep their way up to 52 week highs
7215902 to keep things fair for all parties were going to begin a general auction for our new products within 30 days anyone who wants in and we know that almost everyone does will have an opportunity to bid on the product first dibs go to the top 3 companies who will enjoy a 90 period free of competition from other gaming in indonesia entities once this period expires other companies can access our new technology and use it as they see fit
7215903 im pleased to report that technological advances by schemmel vitello inc have created a much higher degree of efficieny in operations this means big profits for most gaming in indonesia related companies and their subsidiaries
7215904 output of gaming in indonesia related products will nearly double overhead will decrease by 1 3 and employee salaries will increase by 15
7215905 im getting calls from gaming in indonesia industry executives investors and general employees all asking about what is going on and if they can provide information for the news agency of course they want their names mentioned so that a little publicity is given to their particular gaming in indonesia company but it does save me from hunting these people down and taking interviews
7215906 the recent news in the gaming in indonesia industry means big things for us including the need to expand our physical building and operations well be able to hire an additional and much needed 100 new employees who will help push our efforts forward this is going to be great
7215907 our fingers are crossed that corporate execs will honor all current contracts and not fire anyone
7215908 and if all contracts are solid were willing to negotiate with management at an appropriate time in the future to make sure our interests are being satisfied
7215909 for the past five years there has been a noticable trade imbalance between the usa and other nations working within the gaming in indonesia market particularly in operations and human capital the recent advances however will help mend this rift and keep more dollars on shore i expect to see demand for labor increase in the long run with additional long run profits for strong gaming in indonesia usa companies that move forward
7215910 tivemos uma pe a ou outra abaixo do n vel normal algumas car ncias t cnicas nosso saque n o entrou mas n o se pode dizer que eles s o superiores conseguimos reverter vantagens expressivas no terceiro e no quarto sets

7215912 se oito anos atr s eu virasse para esse grupo e dissesse que eles iriam conquistar dois mundiais seis ligas mundiais duas copas do mundo al m do ouro ol mpico e uma prata acho que todo mundo aceitaria n o

7215929 in den vergangenen 18 monaten habe ich gesehen wie barack die herausforderungen des pr sidentschaftswahlkampfs mit urteilsf higkeit klugheit und r ckrat gemeistert hat

7215931 last year at the all city competition he kexin moved from one team to another and during the process of registering during the move there appeared this age discrepancy
7215932 so it was the appearance of a mistake in the process of transferring teams that the misunderstanding appeared however i can right here accurately say that the ages of the members of our gymnastics delegation entirely conform to the requirements for participation in the beijing olympic games
7215933 all information is in chinese and the federation is making as thorough analysis as possible of the papers
7215934 this process may take some time but in due course the fig will make a full report of our findings to the international olympic committee
7215935 the international federation has required the delivery of birth certificates and all the documents like family books entries in schools and things like that
7215936 they have received the documents and at first sight it seems to be ok
7215937 the ages of the members of our gymnastics delegation entirely conform to the requirements for participation in the beijing olympic games
7215938 its not just me the parents of our athletes are all very indignant
7215939 they have faced groundless suspicion why arent they believed why are their children suspected their parents are very angry
7215940 with the release of hutt lants new e gaming photographic images book were going to see record traffic levels
7215941 but were doing it to make sure no unauthorized copies get resold we want to avoid plagiarism and pirating as much as possible furthermore this will be our new procedure for future releases by author dear grabau who has pledged support for this system
7215942 we stocked our shelves with double the normal number of first editions for this major e gaming photographic images biographical novel release
7215943 and we expect to sell out very fast lopiccolo mikells e gaming photographic images book brought hundreds of pre sale orders and numerous bulk order requests so the question of whether or not well sell out is moot
7215944 i think teaching this story will be highly educational for my e gaming photographic images students irregardless of what critics believe
7215945 heck if we always listened to critics nothing would be sold they serve a purpose but i leave the fact checking to qualified historians and researchers
7215946 in the literary world we seek to heighten public awareness about the e gaming photographic images industry and how it works this is absolutely essential for those in the academic literary and research fields
7215947 because the work that has been done in the e gaming photographic images literary area has been huge
7215948 it will be a top seller im sure and even though it is meant for those familiar with the e gaming photographic images literary world many others may find it of general interest as well
7215949 were releasing sephus autons work online in a weeks time
7215950 pre sale polls show this new e gaming photographic images book doubling gross sales figures of other recent releases
7215951 and i believe susana seidlings book may be a complete blockbuster if trends stick well see marked sales numbers within two weeks that will demonstrate year highs
7215952 one has to balance artistic talent with the rigors of usable multimedia
7215953 and as a result we tend to only hire those who are from accredited design universitys such as risd
7215954 we love using intense flash graphics for our weekly work

7215965 they stop between floors they skip floors sometimes you can see the shaft all the way to the bottom when the doors open
7215966 this is about peoples lives you have sick people elderly people who are at risk
7215967 sometimes you come into a building and the lobby is full of folks who cant get up because the elevators arent working
7215968 but the worst was when my son was found dead in the hudson river last year and i almost missed the funeral because the elevators were not working
7215969 sometimes the elevator will go up to my floor and then zoom it goes right back down to the bottom without the doors ever opening
7215970 there is no serious backlog in day to day repair
7215971 but in the replacement of aging elevators there is a significant and growing backlog
7215972 we have almost 6 billion in unmet capital needs which means we are replacing only about one third of the things that need replacement
7215973 i understand that the agency has budget problems but safe elevators are paramount this is about life

7215977 judging from his bones the king was generally in good health there are no signs of malnutrition or infectious disease during childhood
7215978 it has been a long journey since our decision in july 2001 to bring the olympic games to china but there can now be no doubt that we made the right choice
7215979 we are first and foremost an organization devoted to sport but it is sport with a purpose
7215980 the ioc and the olympic games cannot force changes on sovereign nations or solve all the ills of the world but we can and we do contribute to positive change through sport
7215981 the world has learned about china and china has learned about the world and i believe this is something that will have positive effects for the long term
7215982 others will become apparent with time the legacy of these games for china is ultimately up to the chinese people
7215983 it is clear that china has put the bar very high
7215984 so its going to be a challenge for london and all the subsequent games i believe and my hope will be london can even put the bar higher
7215985 we found it unusual that none of these applications have come through
7215986 we are disappointed that china has not used the occasion of the olympics to demonstrate greater tolerance and openness

7215992 i know matts down because he didnt play as well as he would have liked
7215993 this competition being pushed by kurt has made matt tougher its one of the things you have to be as a quarterback
7215994 thats way more important than the outcome of the game nobody remembers those outcomes they really dont matter we lost two significant parts of what our offense hoped to be
7215995 we didnt run the ball as well with matt as we did with kurt
7215996 it helps a quarterback to do that it wasnt all matt i was pleased with the response of our team the way we responded just based on what matts done this spring what hes done this camp tonight doesnt negate any of that
7215997 no matter what the down and distance was we were out there throwing the ball
7215998 it was pretty fun at the same time the run game will help out
7215999 unfortunately i think that i saw what i already knew
7216000 if we try to just throw the ball around you are going to get penalties you are going to get your qb hit he is going to start running around a lot he will be in trouble

7216046 what the liberals are doing is targeting a handful of specific things in our savings package in order to play politics he told network ten
7216047 they are playing with fire because if they punch holes in the budget surplus the end result is that it is harder for the rba to reduce interest rates
7216048 the key people in the frame here are the liberal party he said
7216049 dr nelson is fond of describing himself and the liberal party as the alternative government its about time they started acting like an alternative government
7216050 there are a number of small and important measures to which we are opposed and as a matter of principle we will oppose them dr nelson told the nine network

7216287 we have to create awareness that homophobia is not acceptable
7216288 its a gimmick a token effort to do with a very serious problem

7216292 gay men also wrote to me about homophobic abuse from nightclub patrons
7216293 i left the sport without any intention of returning id fallen out of love with diving
7216294 i was emotionally and physically burnt out and it did take me a long time to recover mentally and physically and start to miss it so i took the better part of a year away form the sport
7216295 i had been diving for seven years thats 10 sessions a week thats 30 hours a week for 50 weeks of the year for seven years thats a very very long time to not even reach the pinnacle of the sport so i came back with the aim of going to the olympics and ultimately to win an olympic gold medal
7216296 i wouldnt be here if i hadnt taken that time off
7216297 i know it for sure because i came back with such a drive such a burning desire and such fierce competitive spirit and i worked so hard and its a little bit emotional because i know that everything i did all the sacrifices i made how hard i had to work its all paid off its all been worth it
7216298 i often score more than 100 points on that dive its one of my most consistent dives and it is the highest degree of difficulty dive that anyone does on platform
7216299 i knew that i could score more than 100 points with it but i didnt know i had to score more than 108 to win but i went into it just wanting to enjoy it and have fun and do the best dive i could do and i knew that the points and the results would look after themselves
7216300 i was still waiting for the scores to make sure but it felt like a good dive and when i saw the results on the scoreboard because i was the second last diver and i was on top of the leaderboard i said yes i have a silver medal and i was so happy with that
7216301 i got out of the pool and i was very emotional because i didnt think i would do that well and then we watched the last dive and i ended up coming out on top so it was very emotional for me because i never thought it would happen to me not at this olympics anyway

7216397 we dont think he is going to tell the backstory so the whole thing just seems kind of icky
7216398 when someone seems like they are hiding something its a big turnoff to the public who want to share in celebrities lives
7216399 you slice up tomatoes avocados onions and sausage and saut it with scrambled eggs on a low flame and serve it with pillsbury biscuits and jelly
7216400 we have wireless on the bus so we can talk all the time
7216401 im 28 shes 29 i dont have a good answer for that my answer is well have kids like anyone else were going to let nature take its course
7216402 hey you close the store come back with us to the station
7216403 hey finish up their order then shut the store come in with us for statement
7216404 oo kay so we are waiting for our order from someone thats been waited on to be taken to the police station should we continue waiting is this right to have someone work before being put into the police car to go for question
7216405 isnt it a form of child abuse to label children as possessors of beliefs that they are too young to have thought about
7216406 horrible as sexual abuse no doubt was the damage was arguably less than the long term psychological damage inflicted by bringing up the child catholic in the first place
7216407 children ill argue have a human right not to have their minds crippled by exposure to other peoples bad ideas no matter who those other people are so we should no more allow parents to teach their children to believe for example in the literal truth of the bible or that the planets rule their lives than we should allow parents to knock their childrens teeth out or to lock them in a dungeon
7216408 70 years when we were not allowed to be taught about god we lived in an atheist state where only atheism was taught they even tried to ban god from our homes
7216409 even better we may eventually discover that there are no limits
7216410 we want to own the customer experience on the phone
7216411 you have to continue to drive value into the base product and then find those premium products that customers are willing to pay extra for
7216412 it will be interesting to see whether customers find it valuable or whether they are annoyed by a phone call interrupting their tv show
7216413 you have to innovate and offer things that you think will work
7216414 but that only means that its more important than ever that cable companies press their technology advantage over telephone companies in order to make the service more compelling to todays consumer
7216415 i think our video product is better than it was three years ago when there werent other competitors we have to make our phone product better or why would anybody switch
7216416 this is really a cool site it gives a better idea of how mechanics do their job
7216417 theyre going to give people who spend a lot of money the comped rooms we dont spend a lot of money
7216418 no longer does everybody get a comp no matter what
7216419 they casino operators have to be very discerning to give those comps to people who earn them
7216420 theyve come to realize that defending your market by giving out comps to customers that dont contribute to your bottom line is bad business
7216421 ive got a hotel room there mount airy any day of the week that i want and 40 in slots dollars
7216422 im only here to go on the beach with my daughter in the winter its mount airy
7216423 the amount of promotional allowances have increased significantly year over year
7216424 you are seeing a shift in the entire marketplace on how we market
7216425 the female slots player from 45 to 65 years of age has always been the sweet spot for atlantic city
7216426 its been our core bread and butter business and has always been vital to our revenue stream
7216427 we have to develop poker customers and not be so reliant on one source of revenue
7216428 in the summer its almost impossible you have to be a diamond card player the highest level
7216429 theyre not as free with their comps i think its because theyre not making as much money
7216430 in prior years we never had the mechanism that we now do
7216431 you can be more discerning because you have the information and are able to determine who you need to spend time and promotional dollars on
7216432 its no different from any other company that yields their product to their best customers
7216433 if youre not a high roller or a chairman card member forget about it
7216434 we need a rate that allows people to legally park at the curb when they need to drop something off see the dentist go to a meeting for an hour
7216435 we believe that this is the kind of location where you should get in and out in two hours these are short term spaces
7216436 weve been brought up from conception to think cheap parking is a good idea
7216437 its part of our primitive reptilian cortex we just arent logical about parking
7216438 is there a pricing point by which transit becomes more attractive then driving between higher meters and the price of gas youre there you now have incentivized people to get out of their cars and onto transit
7216439 i think theres going to be a lot of people initially very upset by it
7216440 it sounds good in theory but in reality i think it would deter people from visiting the city
7216441 they dont want to spend a lot of money at meters meters are supposed to be cheap
7216442 we see them coming out to feed the meter all day thats not what parking meters are for theyre for you to come and park for one hour or two hours while youre shopping
7216443 if the city can free up those meters by charging more we are very much in favor of it
7216444 up until now the balance has really been autocentric and part of what were looking at is how to better accommodate transit and walking and cycling
7216445 we dont think its reasonable to expect people to carry around a roll of quarters
7216446 that do not pose a significant risk of systemic financial crisis
7216447 the regulators realized we were going to move and that theyd get embarrassed and they decided theyd better change their positions
7216448 sometimes what we intend to be stopgap turns out permanent
7216449 were interested in stabilizing the market that means stabilizing real estate prices and going where the free flow of capital funds has failed to develop substitute methodologies then when we get the entire system working again over the next 12 months were going to go into a very thorough examination of how we got there and what has to be changed were not anywhere near that right now
7216450 they were small enough to fail but they had 12 trillion in securities bets with clients
7216451 nobody knew what would happen if that started to unravel thats a whole new concept
7216452 its important for congress to draw lines rather than dealing with this on an ad hoc basis it will be really interesting to see if the fed accepts that notion
7216453 congress has always had the authority to step in and provide guarantees or bailouts for sectors it deems crucial thats the key to what kanjorski was getting at
7216454 once the dust settles there is going to be some new understanding of the law that guides the federal reserve
7216455 candidates can exercise up to 200 options and change their options ten times the final allotment letter can be downloaded from the websites from september 6
7216456 its really not that difficult its just a matter of taking your time
7216457 its been my life dream to get my home off the road
7216458 to see something so large and heavy being moved so delicately is unbelievable these guys are like surgeons theyre amazing
7216459 ive told everyone theres one thing i want to do before i die
7216460 mergem sa castigam in giulesti este un meci important si o batalie mare
7216461 ik heb vijftig euro bij me kun je me daarvoor naar haarlem brengen
7216462 thats why the whole situation is such a shame its taking constituencies that are all important to the city and theyre all arguing
7216463 you can talk about whats good whats bad whats pretty whats not but that sign is not permissible as a matter of right
7216464 many of my buildings have signs above the second story
7216465 its important that a company is locating in center city and will have its headquarters here
7216466 is an important corporate presence as well its not uncomplicated
7216467 we knew that there would be appropriate processes to look at the signage issue that all the voices would be heard
7216468 its very unfortunate that with all good intentions on the part of so many the city the commerce department even unisys the residents of two liberty place that a dilemma of this nature arises
7216469 had the facts been known earlier i dont think we would have gotten to this point
7216470 we do want unisys to move to the city we just dont want their sign up there

7216474 taking tests buying books any preparation youre doing can make the process expensive but especially the college visits
7216475 it amazes me how many students visit schools that dont offer the major they are looking for
7216476 of course flexibility can be a curse as well as an advantage
7216477 the spirit of the lord had departed from saul and an evil spirit from the lord troubled him
7216478 faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of god
7216479 when the evil spirit from god is upon doyle he shall be well
7216480 so it was that whenever the evil spirit from god was upon saul david would take a harp and play it with his hand then saul would become fresh and well and the evil spirit would depart from him
7216481 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
7216482 we should take no option including military action off the table
7216483 since obama came to washington in january of 2005 every single senate democrat has voted for every single iraq funding bill that has come to the senate floor until president bush vetoed a timetable for withdrawal

7216491 the lasting advantage of a peaceful and democratic ally in the heart of the middle east could still be squandered by hasty withdrawals and arbitrary timelines
7216492 iraqi inaction threatens the progress weve made and creates an opening for has the dubious luxury of focusing on one kind of war at a time plus afghanistan plus too much face time in that so called
7216493 prosecute crimes committed by u s soldiers against our population
7216494 the agreement was intensely opposed by most elements in iraqi politics
7216495 to assure the iranians that the agreement with the u s would not be detrimental to iran during the visit he stated that all influential political elements in iraq supported rapprochement with iran in all areas and that iraq would not allow its territory to be used as a base for attacks against iran
7216496 shiite religious scholar grand ayatollah ali al sistani voiced opposition to the agreement arguing that any agreement that harmed iraqs sovereignty in any way was considered a violation of sharia
7216497 another three shiite scholars in najaf also condemned the agreement warning that signing would constitute a violation of islam and bring about a popular intifada abd al aziz al hakim the head of the supreme council for islamic revolution in iraq the largest shiite group in the al maliki government also criticized the agreement since it stipulated a continued presence of u s forces
7216498 see what we can do from washington to get closure
7216499 i doubt well see any flooding out here the wind is starting to sting a little but thats about it
7216500 this wont be much at all if a storm doesnt have a category in front of it it doesnt worry us much
7216501 its a great thing to honor the people on flight 93 by putting together all three attack sites the pentagon the world trade center and pennsylvania
7216502 you cannot go to a 7 eleven or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent
7216503 im sure the tragedy of this circumstance will hit all of those communities
7216504 the conventions are stultifying media spectacles where no one expects anything to happen it s devoid of public interest
7216505 a work force drawn from a diverse base of former special operations defense intelligence and law enforcement professionals ready on a moments notice for global deployment
7216506 the fact is it is not just that the economy is difficult
7216507 if we thought the economy was cyclical we wouldnt have made the change we believe we are seeing a change in consumer habits
7216508 the eight point drop represents billions of dollars in sales that are not being injected into the normal shopping sectors for consumers
7216509 this would suggest that we are starting to see signs that consumers are store shifting
7216510 what is appropriate for a 10 year old is maybe not whats appropriate for a 14 year old
7216511 they have a lot of cool clothes and all the webkinz
7216512 we end up walking out of there with a little more
7216513 expensive doesnt seem to be as relevant in this environment
7216514 the values of price and convenience are not going to change
7216515 weve had ups and downs and we wanted to end on a high moment
7216516 we never talked about what happened in the past because we cant change that it was about us going out to do our job tonight
7216517 the difference is that everybody comes here for this meet track and field is competed by everybody on this planet and they pass on the world championships to get ready for the olympic games im going to brag on my guys im proud of them they lined up and showed up
7216518 theres always room for improvement and room for tweaking in a lot of areas
7216519 i was so proud of this relay team because they wanted to uplift the usa team and show america that on the womens side were doing fine
7216520 reality programming also serves as a way for a divergent culture to stay in touch
7216521 once apon a time i could control myself once apon a time i could love you
7216522 just do it you know you want it you know you need it

7216569 vestdijk is alleen nog een duivelskunstenaar ter braak voor wie bereid is om de literatuurgeschiedenis onvermijdelijk een conservatieve aangelegenheid een moment te vergeten en zich door zijn werk van die duivelskunsten te laten overtuigen overigens doet men zichzelf daar een groot plezier mee
7216570 vestdijk als kind hoorde ik mijn vader die naam wel eens mompelen als hij zich een moment alleen waande in de keuken op het toilet of achter zijn bureau wie was dat toch hij schreef twee boeken en meer dan vijftig artikelen over hem twee keer zoveel als over lucebert de nummer twee in zijn werk

7216639 computer reduce lighting by 40 and raise temperature by four degrees
7216640 it had to be addressed right away for public safety but it took manpower
7216641 we initially didnt force entry because we were unsure whether there were any residents in the house and we didnt want to force a hostage situation
7216642 im very appreciative of the patience that the neighborhood and neighbors showed during incident
7216643 we had no incidents and no problems with people attempting to breach the perimeter we realize it disrupted their evenings but the cooperation of the crowd allowed us to do our jobs and ensure everyones safety
7216644 we are law enforcement officers protecting the community but we also have to protect ourselves we will not allow any harm to come to ourselves or our agents if it can be prevented
7216645 were part of the medway task force and wherever they need assistance we all team up together to help each other out for one common goal
7216646 during the time i was out with the arrest teams at least five people drove by or walked up to thank us for what we were doing those are the things that really make the effort worthwhile
7216647 an effective way to show the citizens of the community medway is out there it also lets the dopers know were out there fighting
7216648 we know for a fact phone calls were made to other drug dealers in the area letting them know a raid was going on said smith
7216649 we will continue looking for these individuals we have outstanding secret indictments for
7216650 they are the perfect match because of bidens expertise in foreign affairs
7216651 no question biden brings experience and depth to the ticket having served decades in congress
7216652 i think that was one of the best decisions obama ever made
7216653 biden has been in the senate a long time knows the ins and outs of washington and knows his foreign policy fairly good and will make a good vice president for obama
7216654 now we just have to buckle down and elect them
7216655 to provide for lighting in the incorporated village of wooster with gas
7216656 no matter where its at on the court allison will give it to you right in your hand
7216657 we know how each other plays and its kind of natural
7216658 we have great chemistry the whole team has real good chemistry
7216659 at the start of the game i told ellen that ive been waiting on this day since last november and she told me shed been waiting a lot longer than that
7216660 you cannot give hannah haver a single chance or shell make you pay
7216661 the thing im most proud of and its been that way since ive been here is that the girls didnt quit they were never beaten
7216662 triway had match point in game 3 but we just continued to battle frankly i had my doubts at that point but the girls didnt
7216663 they earned a lot of their points and they forced us to step up our game we did and thats really all you can ask
7216664 kearney can beat you in so many ways and shes not even at full strength
7216665 she makes every hitter better shes a great server and a smart player whos always thinking
7216666 even when you see what theyre going to do its on the floor before you can react and the thing is triway graduated a couple of outstanding middle hitters and brought some other kids in it wasnt just allison and ellen they were balanced
7216667 it wasnt perfect but im happy with the way things went today
7216668 right now our guys are thinking about the scoring problems some we played 15 to 20 games over the summer in the preseason and this week and have had trouble scoring goals we just need to have something happen to get the floodgates open
7216669 i think we just need to get our brains working a speed faster we have to anticipate things better and be able to see what is going to happen next we have a lot of experience its a bit disappointing to me that we cant see things happening sooner
7216670 i was a bit afraid they might want to defend the lead if it stayed 1 0 for too long i really think offense is the best defense if you keep attacking at some point theyll break down i told our kids at halftime that being up 1 0 we needed to apply more pressure
7216671 we play well and a mistake or two ends up costing us were just not scoring consistently right now were creating as many chances as the teams were playing were just not finishing
7216672 there are a number of players who have been very impressive in camp to date
7216673 while the numbers in our first year class 35 are not what we would like them to be the class is very talented
7216674 several of these first years have a chance to make an impact this year
7216675 b w is always one of the better teams in the ohio athletic conference which has a number of good teams year in and year out
7216676 we have scrimmaged b w for a long time its a great test every year
7216677 we hope to get both of them on the practice field in the next few days
7216678 first year mitch dawson from johnstown monroe will miss the season as will luke mccann returning starter at wr because of injuries
7216679 there have been several other key players who have missed practice time but we hope to get the majority if not all back on the field very soon
7216680 so listen here on november 2nd were going to go into that building were opening up boston right now im telling the boston fans you guys are going to lose its not going to be a victory for boston you might as well just cheer for me because boston isnt winning in boston for the season opener im sorry
7216681 you stay with it you stay aggressive we all pretty much shot the ball like garbage we had control of the game throughout except the fourth quarter and it was an uphill battle from that point
7216682 the good teams in this league never lose two in a row
7216683 when you lose a game you need to know how to respond
7216684 there are a lot of people talking about how the western conference is head over heels above the east
7216685 something i remember from my beatnik days when the lady i lived with was very into something called
7216686 lydia you have used a more pastelly palette than is your wont
7216687 the thought of the thought of the thought of his name

7216692 whoah i cant take my eyes off this picture and i dont know why
7216693 right because everything i do always reminds her of something else
7216694 helloooo everyone im back who wants to like fawn all over me like im some kind of privileged cat who can go in and out the door and stay out for as long as she pleases

7216769 luvdarts are much more than just a mobile video download to the consumer they are digital greeting cards they can send to their family friends and lovers but to a business they are valuable tools in harnessing the power of word of mouth peer2peer advertising
7216770 well its a well known fact that the most effective marketing comes from personal recommendations by family and friends and there have never been greater opportunities for a business to market directly to consumers than the mobile space presents today the problem is how to get directly to the consumer without violating their privacy and rules set forth to protect the consumer by the wireless industry luvdarts get people to spread the word family to family friend to friend lover to lover and we let the businesses subsidize the activity
7216771 its simple we let a business run a campaign whenever they want to drive more traffic to their physical location or website s they can choose the start and end dates their target market daily download budget and incentives we then stock their luvdart downloading store with co branded luvdarts they distribute a code to their customers who can visit that store and download luvdarts free under the terms of that campaign
7216772 oh i get it the business pays for the download later at a wholesale price
7216773 thats right the business only pays for whats been downloaded to be clear there is a setup charge for each campaign
7216774 hmmm very interesting concept i see where people will want to send luvdarts to their family and friends as they also carry a businesses message and promotions without violating their privacy how are you going to get this going with businesses
7216775 thats a great question first we think any business that advertises in the yellow pages will be interested in a luvdarts campaign why the average business is paying a monthly amount for an ad they cant change for 12 months in the yellow pages we give them the ability to run a campaign of different sizes and targets whenever they please for local businesses as well as national that is huge the traffic that will come from a campaign is generated mainly from their existing patrons word of mouth and the business is able to control the times when it may need more traffic driven to its location
7216776 well it seems like youve got a winner here i will be watching your progress
7216777 thanks we luv what we do and weve put a lot into it by the way we will be at the ctia entertainment conference seeking alliances as we are now set to do business with the world will you be there

7216788 what takes care of neutralizing dna to allow chromosomes to condense
7216789 did dinoflagellates once have histones and then lost them or did dinoflagellates never have histones and just figured out a different way to fold large amounts of dna into chromosomes
7216790 chromosomes would fall apart when calcium and magnesium were removed
7216791 cations play a very important role in the folding and charge neutralization of dna in all eukaryotes but more so in dinoflagellates
7216792 i find it truly amazing that in all other eukaryotes histones help in this charge neutralization and dinoflagellates constitute the only exception to this nearly universal rule it looks like this may have been the first and very efficient step toward the goal of neutralizing dna long before histones came into play

7216823 it is important to have a learner centric teaching rather than traditional teaching encourage collaborative or peer learning and encourage self directed learning

7216843 joe biden i ja prijatelji smo niz godina i vrlo se dobro poznajemo smatram dakle da je obama napravio jako dobar izbor
7216844 znam da e joe napraviti dobru kampanju te da e biti neustra iv

7216846 if recent russian actions are any indicator a technical excuse to completely block us access to the international space station for geopolitical reasons would fit nicely into the kremlin toolkit
7216847 contro la politica non si pu vincere non meritiamo di essere fuori dal podio
7216848 hanno distrutto un sogno eravamo venute qui per vincere e non siamo neanche salite sul podio
7216849 e uno scandalo la russia non meritava nemmeno di stare sul podio loro era una questione fra noi e la bielorussia russia e cina avrebbero dovuto lottare per il bronzo invece stanno l davanti a tutti
7216850 il podio era stato deciso mesi fa al presidente della federazione internazionale bruno grandi dico chiaramente che bisogna trovare una soluzione per tutto questo altrimenti sar un fallimento
7216851 last night biden wanted to leave his driveway and drive straight to the white house and tell bush paraphrasing that he knows what the world needs
7216852 it was just the dynamics in that particular campaign that they happened to face
7216853 sometimes theres just a big element of luck in life
7216854 i congratulate senator barack obama on his selection of my friend
7216855 i have enjoyed for many years the opportunity to work with joe biden to bring strong bipartisan support for united states foreign policy
7216856 will continue to have widespread support for higher office during many years ahead
7216857 he selected lieberman and the two men not selected in 2000 wound up being our national ticket in 2004
7216858 so for evan bayh getting this far in this process points to only bigger and better things to come in the future in my view
7216859 dear i finished second or third in a contest where they dont give bronze or silver medals
7216860 a hoosier was considered so seriously for such an important post
7216861 i welcomed that and i came through in fine shape
7216862 and then they showed pictures of me in the kitchen making breakfast
7216863 senator biden was kind enough to say youve got a lot of years ahead of you and this could happen next time for you
7216864 i suspect obama might well have preferred bayh as his vice president in office but opted for the person he thought most likely to help in the campaign
7216865 bayhs future continues to be bright in the senate or in an obama administration
7216866 certainly has more to do with joe biden than evan bayh
7216867 hes still young by presidential campaign standards and hes got a great record and profile
7216868 i think that this process here more than in 2000 and 2004 exposed the rest of the nation to how great a leader he is in the democratic party and all the great assets he brings
7216869 we now know that barack obama doesnt truly respect hoosiers
7216870 is that i wish a woman would have been on the ticket but alas america is not ready to embrace and support having a woman on the ticket top or otherwise
7216871 this is a guy who can out straight talk the straight talk express
7216872 you might not always like what joe says but hes going to give it to you straight
7216873 but in terms of their approach to things they are very similar i was a big supporter of chet in regard to that process we all knew it was a long shot
7216874 i still believe that hillary clinton would have been a better choice for obama
7216875 selecting senator clinton would have unified my party in ways that no other pick could reigniting the enthusiasm of 18 million hillary supporters
7216876 id be happy but the convention hasnt started yet so we need to follow procedure
7216877 i dont think barack would do it or hillary would accept
7216878 it would have been smart of him to name her as his sidekick because she got half the vote
7216879 there are going to be a significant number of people who are going to hold a grudge
7216880 im disappointed as it apparently seems that in the race for the white house its a mans world after all
7216881 im a hillary delegate even so im a democrat first
7216882 i will do exactly what my candidate tells me to do
7216883 her election was really important to me i could feel it from my toes to my head but now i am supporting obama and im going to whatever i can do
7216884 there is no way the democrats are not going to come home
7216885 if we lose this election we ought to quit just quit
7216886 im going to vote and work for him but im not drinking the kool aid
7216887 my concern is that he has a compelling message of hope and change but that hasnt converted to numbers and votes
7216888 he is struggling in national polls i dont think im the only democrat who feels this way
7216889 he is a good person a good democrat i know he has the reputation for sticking his foot in his mouth but i like the fact that he is kind of a straight shooter
7216890 they have to get out of themselves and understand that the presidential election is about the course of history
7216891 i respect hillary clintons candidacy enormously i believe strongly in her
7216892 a group or a member of such a group or class enjoying intellectual social or economic status the best or most skilled members of a group
7216893 the belief that certain persons or members of certain classes or groups deserve favored treatment by virtue of their perceived superiority the sense of entitlement enjoyed by such a group
7216894 pointy headed intellectuals who cant even ride a bike straight
7216895 im from a military family ive moved around a lot actually the place i lived longest was in hanoi
7216896 a political gaffe it is said occurs when a politician inadvertently tells the truth
7216897 why dont we pass 1 3 trillion of that back to the people who pay the bills
7216898 whether someone helps win you an election i think is kind of a side benefit you certainly want to pick someone who doesnt hurt you

7216902 senator hillary clinton will be the headline prime time speaker and former virginia governor mark warner will deliver the keynote address on tuesday night
7216903 i think people in the united states can get a little irritated by my work
7216904 frustrated even they think im a clever clever boy but ive found its okay to be in a state of conflict and opposition you dont want to be too embraced
7216905 at least as long as i can get up and down the stairs
7216906 the three set in europe were told to me by other writers and my publisher while the newark story happened to my stepfather he was actually there when the mayor broke down and cried in the middle of the riot
7216907 a coup by legal and political means the reality is that al gore was elected which means were living in an alternate universe an alternate reality like owen brick in the real world there would be no war in iraq no torture at abu ghraib and possibly just possibly no 9 11
7216908 the idea that this great man should have to suffer the loss of such a fine son is appalling
7216909 i wrote man in the dark during a very short period of time
7216910 just four months it kept writing itself it was the most intense experience ive ever had as a writer
7216911 i write everything by hand paragraph by paragraph and then at the end of the day i type up what ive written usually 1 000 words on a typewriter when the book is done ill do handwritten corrections then retype it all on the typewriter i wrote a screenplay on a computer once and hated it so much that i vowed i would never do it again i got carpal tunnel and wound up having to wear a brace
7216912 most of whats on it is false ill give readings where the person introducing me will provide information that is simply wrong ill ask them where they got it and invariably theyll say the internet
7216913 novels are about inner life about the experience of being in the world from inside
7216914 films are about life from the outside rarely do they touch the depths of novels
7216915 once we were done we had a screening for the distributor after saying how much he liked it he added almost as an afterthought that it had no commercial potential at all thats just how it is these days especially in america theres no life left for marginal films
7216916 i dont know why im gravitating toward stories about death
7216917 its probably nothing more than a function of getting older
7216918 its good to inhabit a young person again especially in that era
7216919 his mailbox read the bill smith not bill smith but the bill smith
7216920 gore took what was a likely slam dunk and helped make it into a squeaker that went the other way

7216930 with the possible exception of al gore i cant think of someone who generates as much excitement
7216931 mccain was the same for nearly seventy years then he changed
7216932 claiming that mccain suddenly transformed into a different bad man is not plausible
7216933 launching implausible negative attacks is not the new politics weve been promised
7216934 its not just something biden is making up back during the primaries i remember talking to a lot of people about how i thought the 2000 version of mccain might have made a pretty good president but the 2008 model not so much but then the 2000 version would never have won the republican nomination which is why he moved so far to the right
7216935 stole the marginal votes gore may have needed to clearly carry florida and the election
7216936 they dont want to look themselves in the mirror for betraying their finest progressive traditions and so they have to lash out at someone
7216937 theyre not going to blame themselves for selling out again and again and again
7216938 they make mistake after mistake after mistake because theyve lost their self respect they dont know who they are anymore theyve lost their identity
7216939 theyre basically appealing to the public by saying do you know how bad the republicans are people say they dont think that much of the democratic party but do you know how bad the republicans are if you define yourself by the worst instead of the best you can be theres something wrong with your psychological makeup as a party
7216940 gore is to the right of bradley on almost every important issue
7216941 he had at various times in his political career been a neoliberal tough on crime and communism a new agey environmentalist and techno futurist and an old fashioned bible thumping populist gores response to problems said a long time aide was to consult five pollsters
7216942 thats basically trying to be like the republicans but not quite like the republicans and still have a democratic image
7216943 gore advisers say naders appeal will dim as the election draws closer
7216944 theyre also counting on reform party candidate pat buchanan to nab would be bush votes
7216945 yeah what they should have said is hey the green party is for this this and this
7216946 its not my job to elect al gore or george bush
7216947 i think its an ego trip and people have lost sight of what the goals are
7216948 why didnt the democrats stop bush on iraq why did they surrender their declaration of war powers authority under the constitution and send it up pennsylvania avenue to the white house
7216949 it got so bad that everything bush did i was blamed for until i ended up saying gee i know someone who should share the blame with me barbara and george bush
7216950 they created him why dont you go back to the origins
7216951 he had called me and i think reached out to my campaign my sense is that mr nader is somebody who if you dont listen and adopt all of his policies thinks youre not substantive he seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work
7216952 ralph nader is trying to get attention he has become the perennial political candidate
7216953 i think its a shame because if you look at his legacy in terms of consumer protections its an extraordinary one but at this point hes somebody whos trying to get attention and his campaign hasnt gotten any traction
7216954 when i saw him at a book signing last year in a downtown bookstore i stood in line with 300 people
7216955 i think that wiki pages over e mail conversations is possible i can give you short examples of some conversations which will look beautiful if are processed over wiki
7216956 i thought since we were married and i had a social security card and drivers license and military id i didnt think about the paperwork i had everything a normal person has over there a car a house a family student loans a dog
7216957 they detained me at the airport and interrogated me for seven hours they were so nasty saying things like damn nazis ive never lived in germany the next day i had to fly back with lufthansa they had denied me entry to the u s
7216958 the hardest thing was i couldnt get to the fax machine we had to wait for the mail to get out the mail leaving iraq isnt exactly fast
7216959 it is a pain coming back from deployment and after 12 months in a combat zone i come back and my family is torn apart the whole situation is mind blowing
7216960 she asks when is she coming back i dont know how to answer that
7216961 the first letter my husband wrote they said wasnt emotional enough the consulate confiscated my german passport nine months ago and they only gave it back last week
7216962 i havent seen my daughter in nine months the only contact is pictures and e mails im watching her grow up on the internet

7216968 dear supporter today our campaign joins in a historic partnership with al gore together we will move america forward yes we can
7216969 there is incredible enthusiasm for senator obamas vice presidential announcement and unfortunately some people have used that enthusiasm and sent out hoaxes
7216970 we can assure supporters these texts are not coming from the campaign and their data is secure
7216971 the former u s vice president is just desperate for attention because he has no friends

7216977 the scrapbook industry has changed rapidly in the last five years
7216978 digital scrapbooking and photo books have become very popular ways to preserve your memories the majority of scrapbookers have digital cameras and for some of them it makes more sense to print a photo book rather than individual photos retailers in the traditional scrapbook industry have struggled to figure out how to capitalize on this trend the photobookbiz program is that answer to that question

7216981 obamas shortlist has narrowed to a handful of names and president clintons former no 2 isnt one of them
7216982 obama is doing very well with women voters but there is the other side
7216983 someone else more than half of clintons supporters are still not on board with obama the holdouts tend to like mccain more than obama and have more confidence in mccains ability to be commander in chief
7216984 at least i dont cake on the makeup like a trollop you c t
7216985 someone else more than half of clintons supporters are still not on board with obama the holdouts tend to like mccain more than obama and have more confidence in mccains ability to be commander in chief
7216986 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
7216987 if money is no object were very close to having no technological obstacles to providing the electricity from solar and wind sources
7216988 if money is an object the 10 year timeline is not realistic
7216989 well be much more able to make solar reasonably close in cost to current generators of electricity if you take into account the lifetime of the system and no fuel charges
7216990 the cost of not trying to reach gores goal will be even greater than seeking to accomplish it
7216991 its going to be a challenge given the limited funding and time
7216992 would deal a devastating blow to the u s renewable energy industry just as it is beginning to take off

7216996 one of the primary goals of the nyc leadership center is to train up leaders on a large scale to reach one of the most un churched cities in the world i am overwhelmed to have an opportunity to partner with them
7216997 it is an incredible privilege for us to bring one of these long lost treasures to todays church
7216998 it is so awesome to imagine singing the same song that some of the earliest christians sang in their worship services
7216999 former musical theater star goes back to new york singing new song
7217000 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
7217001 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
7217002 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
7217003 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
7217004 i cant honestly expect to collect from every little guy grandmas selling quilts online and the like but i certainly will be targeting the big guys like google microsoft and smooth operator
7217005 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
7217006 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
7217007 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
7217008 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
7217009 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
7217010 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
7217011 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
7217012 this shows that titan pokers jackpot tournaments are very popular and are continuing to grow at a fast rate
7217013 more than 7 million dollars awarded at titan pokers jackpot tournaments
7217014 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
7217015 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
7217016 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
7217017 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
7217018 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
7217019 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
7217020 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
7217021 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
7217022 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
7217023 zeb i think the main difference is gore is a politician whos learned to manipulate science while suzuki is a scientist whos learning to manipulate politics
7217024 it is no crime to be ignorant of economics which is after all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a dismal science but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance
7217025 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
7217026 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
7217027 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
7217028 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
7217029 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
7217030 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
7217031 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
7217032 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
7217033 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
7217034 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
7217035 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
7217036 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
7217037 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
7217038 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
7217039 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
7217040 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
7217041 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
7217042 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
7217043 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
7217044 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
7217045 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
7217046 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
7217047 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place

7217057 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
7217058 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
7217059 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
7217060 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
7217061 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
7217062 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
7217063 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
7217064 in the streets it is prohibited to spit and to speak breton
7217065 lyndon b johnson was initiated on october 30 1937 in johnson city lodge no 561 at johnson city texas but completed only the entered apprentice or first of the three masonic degrees for this reason he is not included in the gallery
7217066 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
7217067 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
7217068 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
7217069 madison hildebrand real estate agent reality star and now author what cant he do
7217070 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
7217071 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
7217072 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
7217073 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging

7217169 how dreadful are the curses which mohammedanism lays on its votaries besides the fanatical frenzy which is as dangerous in a man as hydrophobia in a dog there is this fearful fatalistic apathy the effects are apparent in many countries improvident habits slovenly systems of agriculture sluggish methods of commerce and insecurity of property exist wherever the followers of the prophet rule or live a degraded sensualism deprives this life of its grace and refinement the next of its dignity and sanctity the fact that in mohammedan law every woman must belong to some man as his absolute property either as a child a wife or a concubine must delay the final extinction of slavery until the faith of islam has ceased to be a great power among men individual moslems may show splendid qualities but the influence of the religion paralyses the social development of those who follow it no stronger retrograde force exists in the world far from being moribund mohammedanism is a militant and proselytizing faith it has already spread throughout central africa raising fearless warriors at every step and were it not that christianity is sheltered in the strong arms of science the science against which it had vainly struggled the civilization of modern europe might fall as fell the civilization of ancient rome

7217176 if we look at how much more water we will need for food and how much more for biomass for energy going forward it is quite worrying
7217177 almost every increase in water used in agriculture will affect water availability for other uses including that needed to keep ecosystems healthy and resilient in the face of change and perturbation
7217178 it might be environmentally reasonable to withdraw maybe 6 000 cubic kilometres but if we withdraw more water it would be at a very high environmental cost because we need water to flush the system and for different
7217179 by 2030 the same amount of energy that we produce today with fossil fuels will have to come from biomass
7217180 meet food demands by 2050 if we have a much more efficient use of water that does not include the water we need for all that biomass
7217181 we are at the end of the road when it comes to irrigation because all the water available in rivers and so on has already been now more or less used up

7217224 to be able to come here and finish ninth at the olympics is a big step for me
7217225 now im going to hopefully keep carrying that momentum and next time around keep climbing the ladder
7217226 i thought i had a good shot at a medal
7217227 i tried to put myself in it early but i looked at the clock at 5k and i think i was 14 55 actually 14 59 in 30th place seven seconds behind wanjiru i knew that if i kept up that 2 06 pace i wouldnt be finishing probably so i eased off back there and tried to keep my composure
7217228 i actually had to stop just past 30k because my left hamstring seized up
7217229 i took a couple seconds there and tried to ease back into pace for a minute or two and kind of got back onto a reasonable pace
7217230 i was just trying to hang on at that point because the cramps just kept coming i think the only thing that really saved me was i put emergency gels on my last bottle they had a lot of sodium in them if it hadnt been for that i wouldnt have made it in i dont think
7217231 its hard to feel competitive toward your teammate especially when youre running in ninth and 10th place
7217232 for me its all about just doing the best i can it doesnt matter whether dathans in front of me im always going to do the best i can
7217233 im happy for dathan we got two guys in the top 10 in the olympics thats not bad all in all its a pretty solid day for us
7217234 that was the only race i had ever dropped out of still and i carried that with me for four years that was never really an option for me i guess today if i had to sit by the side of the road and drink until i came to life i was going to have to do that i couldnt even think about that again
7217235 this whole thing is the biggest fairy tale ive ever seen
7217236 cancelled his scheduled visit to the wounded combat veterans in germany
7217237 the obama campaign originally planned a private trip no media to landstuhl regional medical center in germany to visit wounded troops but canceled it to prevent the perception of politicizing our troops
7217238 errrr uhhhhh i did not drive that car into the river
7217239 obviously finishing third in the world championship and then the last two years all of the talk has been about how the rest of the world has caught up
7217240 how this is the olympics to get the u s this is the olympics to knock them off
7217241 definitely a lot more satisfying coming out and going through the disappointment
7217242 i would have never guessed that i was ever the leading scorer in the gold medal game for the united states
7217243 but i think that shows the unselfishness of our team i think that shows the talent level we have
7217244 i pushed my rear end off to get kara lawson on this team
7217245 there were a lot of people questioning that selection she showed tonight why she belonged on this team for me personally there was big satisfaction in that
7217246 its just been awesome for me to experience this for the fourth time with such a great group
7217247 when you get superstars together the tendency is that at some point the ego has to step in thats what make these great players great
7217248 but this group had an ego only for this team that is something all coaches preach but very few times can you see 12 players act on that this group did that and thats what made them special never has a team of 12 players that i coached been so selfless
7217249 i think there is a lot of pressure i put on myself for this
7217250 and there is just a tremendous amount of satisfaction the last three years there have been a lot of challenges so this is a great way to go out

7217256 chicken is sold at between rm7 and rm7 60 per kg way above the fixed ceiling price of rm6
7217257 that means one chicken cost about rm14 or rm15 as the festive season is drawing near we fear the price of a chicken may shoot up to rm20 if left uncontrolled
7217258 basically this primary was a tie and one edged out the other but hillary cant be a divisive figure and she knows that she has to be a person who can unite all elements of the party be gracious toward the nominee and this is the best way she can meet her ends of being a prominent playmaker in the democratic party
7217259 ive probably done more for sen obama than anybody in my position has ever done by this time
7217260 i dont think they can just be dismissed as hysterical postmenopausal women given the facts that we are looking at at this moment in time
7217261 doing anything to promote that its just happening its dismaying
7217262 i think the convention is very tricky business for her clinton she clearly wants to be a team player and to be supportive of sen obamas candidacy but simultaneously she needs to do that in a way that leaves her ardent supporters not feeling let down and not feeling abandoned
7217263 she has consistently made a strong case to her own supporters to support senator obama people can come up with whatever fantasies they want but the facts are very compelling

7217268 proud to stand firm with the next president of the united states
7217269 your kitchen tables like mine you sit there at night after you put the kids to bed and you talk about what you need you talk about how much youre worried about being able to pay the bills
7217270 well thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about its a pretty hard experience hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7217271 you cant change america when you know your first four years as president will look like the last eight years of george bushs presidency
7217272 barack has the vision he also has the courage the courage to make this a better place and let me tell you something else this man is a clear eyed pragmatist who will get the job done

7217278 im sorry to say that doordarshan is not showing the tournament i tried to resolve it but apparently failed because they wanted to make money out of it
7217279 i certainly see the duty which dd should be discharging for indian sports they should not always be thinking of earning and earning there is a limit to it
7217280 i was very disappointed with what i saw last night in the major bulletins there was this hard fought match between india and pakistan which india won 3 1 but what did i find the first story was about sania mirza losing in straight sets to a junior girl in stanford in a minor tournament second story was ronaldinho leaving barcelona for ac milan for 30 million perhaps i want to ask what is the relevance of this news in a country where footballers dont get their ta da in santosh trophy
7217281 mpeg4 is better than mpeg 2 because the transponder capacity will be reduced to 50 if we use mpeg 4 since it carries double the amount of channels than mpeg 2

7217287 we had samples of tattooed human skin manufactured into lamp shades and gloves even more devastating was the collection of photographs taken by german soldiers the most haunting one showed a trench the prisoners had dug before being shot at the edge of it one of the victims looked like my mother i had trouble sleeping for nights
7217288 the humid summers were like living in hot pea soup
7217289 the market looks at this as a positive in that there have been expectations lehman would survive in some form the question was where was the money going to come from
7217290 the light volumes are really sort of the reasons behind why youve got some outsize moves

7217300 the towers are completely down now and the demolition has been carried out as planned the site is now completely safe
7217301 one tower came down completely as expected and then there was about one third of the other one left standing but angled away from the viaduct as the demolition experts designed it to
7217302 people were looking at it saying are we supposed to be able to see it but the demolition crew went to the site and manipulated what remained so that it has now completely come down
7217303 this will be a real treat for festival goers getting from the north to the south of the site used to be slow and painstaking but the bridge will make it a delight

7217318 when ukraine prioritises its national interests it goes against russias interests and of course there will be conflict
7217319 and russia has broken through a psychological barrier to start this kind of war on former soviet territory georgia had created itself in the shape of an enemy of russia and many in russia already see us in the same way we probably rank third in the list of russias leading enemies
7217320 in that situation then russia will start playing games start provoking ukraine especially with crimea
7217321 when we think about our position on georgia i have no doubts the loss of sovereignty putting into doubt the territorial integrity of georgia this means revising the sovereignty of all
7217322 there is a reason to be wary in the short term future there is a threat in that ukraine is similar to georgia in terms of what has happened in recent years
7217323 but i find it difficult to think that the threat posed is a military one russia relies on the fact that it has more of an influence over ukraine economically
7217324 if ukraine sorts out its domestic situation and consolidates its foreign policy in terms of european and atlantic integration and this goes at a good pace then we can avoid the south ossetian scenario
7217325 i mean there is no stronger enemy to ukraine than ukraine itself especially its politicians

7217332 meine frau und ich sind beide berufst tig und daher hatten wir uns eigentlich damit abgefunden dass wir uns erst im rentenalter einen hund zulegen k nnen
7217333 daf r muss ich meine arbeit nat rlich unterbrechen aber andere machen ja auch ihre zigarettenpausen
7217334 damit wollten wir arbeitgeber und berufst tige zum nachdenken anregen
7217335 ein hund sollte aber keinesfalls zum b rohund werden der acht stunden in der ecke liegt
7217336 den hund ins b ro mitzunehmen ist aber keine ideale l sung
7217337 dabei sollte man sich nach den bed rfnissen des tieres richten und nicht nach den eigenen
7217338 eine krankenschwester die in der n he ihres arbeitsplatzes wohnt wollte den hund in ihren pausen ausf hren

7217346 when they went ahead i thought it would be very difficult
7217347 our fans were thinking about last season maybe so its a very very positive message to win these kind of games will give the players confidence to believe they can win every match this season
7217348 britain and france declared war on hitler in september 1939 to honour their guarantee to poland everyone else including america fought only after he had moved against them but the guarantee did not save poland which ended the war under soviet domination
7217349 despite the difficulties we can devise a common european energy policy to reduce our dependence on russian oil and gas

7217353 hell have to figure out which of his seven kitchen tables to sit at
7217354 hes dynamic hes a great talker he goes the extra mile when he wants to jab the opponent
7217355 he brings to the ticket what obama is missing in a lot of dimensions especially foreign affairs
7217356 no choice of vice president can make barack obama more experienced
7217357 by choosing a man who has been one of his harshest critics on whether obama is ready to be president obama merely further exposes his own flaws
7217358 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7217359 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
7217360 hes an expert on foreign policy whose heart and values are firmly rooted in the middle class he has stared down dictators and spoken out for american cops and firefighters
7217361 i am absolutely right and they all are wrong about god
7217362 no formal claim of responsibility has been made and the motive for the kidnapping remains unknown as well there have been no demands
7217363 it is not clear whether they are being held for political purposes as bargaining chips or for financial purposes but journalists who spoke on condition of anonymity for their security said the abduction seemed to be a pre planned attack
7217364 maak geen fout de verenigde staten zullen de verantwoordelijken voor deze laffe handelingen vinden en straffen
7217365 ik denk niet dat wij hierover willen speculeren het zijn er meer dan wie van ons dan ook kan dragen

7217373 i was very pleased with the first 15 minutes or so we created a lot of chances and could have scored a couple
7217374 but after that we did not play well and we allowed them to control our attacks they did not create too much themselves but it was not a good performance from our team
7217375 then in the second half they scored a good goal and we had to throw people forward to get ourselves back in the game
7217376 i am sure that jamie carragher will be claiming that goal despite the deflection but afterwards he was only really concerned that we had got ourselves level
7217377 but it was gerrard who showed the winning mentality he has done that so many times from a similar position many other players would have put it high over the bar but you know gerrard will hit the target
7217378 last season we drew far too many games at anfield but this time we have sent out a message that in such situations we can win the game we have winners here
7217379 that was hard to take the players are heartbroken in the dressing room
7217380 we deserved more we certainly deserved a point we produced a disciplined performance and the two matches we have played so far have given me plenty of confidence
7217381 we beat spurs last weekend and now we have very nearly beaten a side who can win the title
7217382 their equaliser was a freak and we should have been able to see out the game even at 1 1
7217383 but i have told them that they can leave anfield with their heads high
7217384 that do not pose a significant risk of systemic financial crisis
7217385 the regulators realized we were going to move and that theyd get embarrassed and they decided theyd better change their positions
7217386 sometimes what we intend to be stopgap turns out permanent
7217387 were interested in stabilizing the market that means stabilizing real estate prices and going where the free flow of capital funds has failed to develop substitute methodologies then when we get the entire system working again over the next 12 months were going to go into a very thorough examination of how we got there and what has to be changed were not anywhere near that right now
7217388 they were small enough to fail but they had 12 trillion in securities bets with clients
7217389 nobody knew what would happen if that started to unravel thats a whole new concept
7217390 its important for congress to draw lines rather than dealing with this on an ad hoc basis it will be really interesting to see if the fed accepts that notion
7217391 congress has always had the authority to step in and provide guarantees or bailouts for sectors it deems crucial thats the key to what kanjorski was getting at
7217392 once the dust settles there is going to be some new understanding of the law that guides the federal reserve
7217393 we want to own the customer experience on the phone
7217394 you have to continue to drive value into the base product and then find those premium products that customers are willing to pay extra for
7217395 it will be interesting to see whether customers find it valuable or whether they are annoyed by a phone call interrupting their tv show
7217396 you have to innovate and offer things that you think will work
7217397 but that only means that its more important than ever that cable companies press their technology advantage over telephone companies in order to make the service more compelling to todays consumer
7217398 i think our video product is better than it was three years ago when there werent other competitors we have to make our phone product better or why would anybody switch
7217399 taking tests buying books any preparation youre doing can make the process expensive but especially the college visits
7217400 it amazes me how many students visit schools that dont offer the major they are looking for
7217401 this is really a cool site it gives a better idea of how mechanics do their job
7217402 i was writing as if another person inside me was dictating
7217403 i know it is daring for dust like me to write about god but what can be done if god has created dust capable of loving and writing
7217404 i used to think of animals that accompanied prophets or were in his service and would visit the zoo almost everyday and stand in front of cages trying to break the obstacle of silence that enwraps these creatures and realized that there is genuine honesty in these creatures that doesnt exist in human beings
7217405 i did not envy the prophet solomon for the gold with which he covered his palace walls because i know that when he died he did not take any of it with him i did not envy him either because he could master the jinn because i have no desire to enslave anybody i did not envy him either for being a muslim because i have been taught islam by the most perfect of muslims i envied solomon for one thing the ability to understand the language of birds and animals and to speak with them
7217406 the dominant weaving of this book is done in an artistic way meaning it has imagination and creativity yet there are two other main streaks with this main weave and they are the religious and scientific streaks
7217407 i felt an invisible force directing my wings towards cain i didnt like cain but a blessed angel ordered me to fly to him so i landed in front of cain and started digging i evened the wings of the dead crow to his side then i put him in his grave i screamed twice then piled dust over him then looked at the son of adam i flew towards the west and heard cain as i was flying away screaming how he failed to be like me and bury his brother i imagined his cry was full of regret
7217408 it is not my job to know maybe mankind does
7217409 all the time while writing i felt that the history page that tells the story of these animals has long been turned but i am sure that nothing gets lost not a word not a sentiment not an image or a situation its all hidden in the memory of time and becomes a secret eventually and it is known that looking for secrets is difficult but it was as if something was whispering inside me and telling me about all these secrets and where to find them
7217410 where there was a life size picture of the son of adam and under it a slogan for his fall
7217411 all we do as devils we dont actually do its all acts of circumstance
7217412 in all honesty we can not earn a living anymore in egypt mankind has beat us in doing evil there
7217413 we need a rate that allows people to legally park at the curb when they need to drop something off see the dentist go to a meeting for an hour
7217414 we believe that this is the kind of location where you should get in and out in two hours these are short term spaces
7217415 weve been brought up from conception to think cheap parking is a good idea
7217416 its part of our primitive reptilian cortex we just arent logical about parking
7217417 is there a pricing point by which transit becomes more attractive then driving between higher meters and the price of gas youre there you now have incentivized people to get out of their cars and onto transit
7217418 i think theres going to be a lot of people initially very upset by it
7217419 it sounds good in theory but in reality i think it would deter people from visiting the city
7217420 they dont want to spend a lot of money at meters meters are supposed to be cheap
7217421 we see them coming out to feed the meter all day thats not what parking meters are for theyre for you to come and park for one hour or two hours while youre shopping
7217422 if the city can free up those meters by charging more we are very much in favor of it
7217423 up until now the balance has really been autocentric and part of what were looking at is how to better accommodate transit and walking and cycling
7217424 we dont think its reasonable to expect people to carry around a roll of quarters
7217425 tenho um amigo que gosta tanto de israel que a telavive
7217426 chain mail e saiu nim jornal n o sei qual ningu m me perguntou nada n o sei se me sinta honrado ou chateado fui eu que inventei aquilo mas ningu m sabe
7217427 in being associated with steve on and off the baseball diamond i have found him to be a true professional who possesses a genuine concern and ability to motivate athletes
7217428 whenever people talk about mr jackson they talk not only about his baseball knowledge but also his integrity leadership and passion i know steve has the depth of knowledge to not only mentor young men in the game of baseball but more importantly as individuals
7217429 je gaat of op het f r veld of op het a veld
7217430 hey so and so check out the rack on the youngin on my right
7217431 what really happens behind the scenes at the falcon ric
7217432 thanks asshole it only took us two hours to deliver the water to you
7217433 its not like we risked our lives driving the water out there
7217434 theyre going to give people who spend a lot of money the comped rooms we dont spend a lot of money
7217435 no longer does everybody get a comp no matter what
7217436 they casino operators have to be very discerning to give those comps to people who earn them
7217437 theyve come to realize that defending your market by giving out comps to customers that dont contribute to your bottom line is bad business
7217438 ive got a hotel room there mount airy any day of the week that i want and 40 in slots dollars
7217439 im only here to go on the beach with my daughter in the winter its mount airy
7217440 the amount of promotional allowances have increased significantly year over year
7217441 you are seeing a shift in the entire marketplace on how we market
7217442 the female slots player from 45 to 65 years of age has always been the sweet spot for atlantic city
7217443 its been our core bread and butter business and has always been vital to our revenue stream
7217444 we have to develop poker customers and not be so reliant on one source of revenue
7217445 in the summer its almost impossible you have to be a diamond card player the highest level
7217446 theyre not as free with their comps i think its because theyre not making as much money
7217447 in prior years we never had the mechanism that we now do
7217448 you can be more discerning because you have the information and are able to determine who you need to spend time and promotional dollars on
7217449 its no different from any other company that yields their product to their best customers
7217450 if youre not a high roller or a chairman card member forget about it
7217451 of course flexibility can be a curse as well as an advantage
7217452 its really not that difficult its just a matter of taking your time
7217453 its been my life dream to get my home off the road
7217454 to see something so large and heavy being moved so delicately is unbelievable these guys are like surgeons theyre amazing
7217455 ive told everyone theres one thing i want to do before i die

7217458 non stavano uscendo da una stazione della ferroviaria n andavano sulla ciclabile come la reggiani e moriccioli se due turisti vengono a roma in bicicletta e si vanno ad accampare in un posto abbandonato da dio e dagli uomini dopo aver chiesto consiglio su dove mettere la tenda a un branco di pastori immigrati ebbene difficile garantire loro la sicurezza la loro stata una grave imprudenza
7217459 non credo proprio a parte il fatto che in italia vietato dalla legge fare campeggio libero nella periferia di una citt ma i due dovevano raggiungere un camping autorizzato a ostia e l non sarebbe successo loro nulla detto questo ci sono due cose da fare subito
7217460 mercoled ho convocato in campidoglio cia confagricoltura e coldiretti molto inquietante che quei pastori vivessero l in roulotte e che lavorassero per fattori italiani voglio sapere quali forme di controllo applicano rispetto alla pastorizia in zone limitrofe alla citt dobbiamo evitare che si creino altre sacche di degrado
7217461 proseguiremo con la massima determinazione nellapplicare le norme contenute nel patto per roma sicura dal settembre si insedier il generale mori e intensificheremo il controllo del territorio
7217462 fra comune provincia e regione abbiamo stanziato 23 milioni di euro che stiamo utilizzando rimane il fatto che siamo il comune agricolo pi grande di europa non possiamo controllare anche la campagna
7217463 ripeto oggi non stiamo parlando di luoghi di transito come pu essere una stazione ferroviaria ma se la sinistra ha proposte serie contro la violenza carnale che non sia il braccialetto proposto da rutelli siamo pronti ad ascoltarla ma la smettano di creare ostacoli alla nostra azione per garantire la sicurezza

7217480 at the end of the day we are happy for what we got
7217481 they are no longer becoming housewives and mothers they are allowed to be professional
7217482 what you are seeing is a change in how our kenyan women are being treated and there will be many more kenyan women who will perform as well as this
7217483 im delighted to welcome such a diverse group of member companies
7217484 the expansive nature of our membership continues to reflect the transformation of our industry and the broadening of abms footprint
7217485 were just starting our dynasty were going to be there in 2012 weve already improved so much in the last four years im just looking forward to what happens in the next four years
7217486 they are hand picked they dont go to school they train full time its just different its very different
7217487 weve brought back more international medals this quadrennial than ever before even during the greg louganis era
7217488 when we started this in 2005 our major goal was just to get reorganized and work for 2012 the finishes here were obviously a lot better than our last olympic games
7217489 i dont know what the international judges are looking for
7217490 obviously weve got to go back and figure that out
7217491 weve got to put a lot more emphasis on our synchronized diving
7217492 the united states has in the past not taken that very seriously the depth is very great in the united states theres no reason why in 2012 we cant win four medals in synchro
7217493 but this is different than athens where it was a collapse there at the end here our divers and our coaches really held together they didnt quit at all
7217494 presi n a adida por afrontar el us open como n mero uno del mundo

7217567 the queen has made it known that she feels kate should get involved with a charity possibly an animal charity where she can be seen to be doing something proactive and something entirely safe
7217568 it is important that kate isnt seen to be doing anything controversial and she needs to do something completely different from any of the charity work that diana did
7217569 she has quite a bad reputation for being rude when it comes to responding to letters

7217611 the rules are no longer just about how we do our jobs theyre about what our job is
7217612 we are used to saying that we are in the communication business but that business suggests a flow of information that goes two ways we have forever focused on lecturing the shift is we should be looking at what we do as a conversation we shouldnt be entranced by our own voice basic communication means you listen as much as you speak
7217613 the newsmaker now also becomes a storyteller the students in this situation became reporters by sharing their personal accounts on their blogs and capturing images that wouldnt have otherwise been possible journalists now gather this information find the best and continue the dialogue
7217614 the news doesnt start with the morning paper and end with the nightly broadcast
7217615 news organizations tend to look at the news in a linear fashion it has always been easy to have a conversation with your audience people with whom you may never speak to again but suddenly when you realize that you not only have to speak to them but hear them as well and that theyll respond to you tomorrow about a different topic that changes the way in which journalists work

7217649 it seemed somehow profane that sen jesse helms should have managed to depart this life on the 232nd anniversary of the declaration of american independence to die on the fourth of july one can perhaps be forgiven for feeling is or ought to be a privilege reserved for men of the stamp of john adams and thomas jefferson both of whom expired on that day in 1826 50 years after the promulgation of the declaration

7217659 people dont think anymore not much anyway oh sure we like to think were thinking but thats just so we can say we exist thanks rene mostly what we consider to be thought are flashes in our brain pan we may think of and we may think for and sometimes we may even think up yet seldom do we ever think out or think through
7217660 the other night i was having dinner with some friends in a fairly decent restaurant and was at the very peak of my form as a wit and raconteur but just as with infinite and exquisite tantalizations i was approaching my punch line the most incredible thing happened
7217661 in the near universal sarcastic mirth that accompanied the rolling out of sen john mccains somewhat utopian speech in columbus ohio on may 15 the quixotic nature of his foreign policy ambitions was generally stressed as a consequence one of his smaller and more realistic and achievable domestic proposals seems to have been overlooked
7217662 its somehow absurd and trivial to use the word israel and the expression 60th birthday in the same sentence or the same breath what is this some candle bedecked ceremony in miami the questions before us are somewhat more antique and also a little more pressingly and urgently modern than that
7217663 of all the slogans that hillary rodham clinton and barack hussein obama might have picked to distinguish themselves from one another
7217664 so numbed have i become by the endless replay of the fatuous clerical rantings of the rev jeremiah wright that it has taken me this long to remember the significant antecedent in 1995 there appeared a documentary titled brother minister about the assassination of malcolm x
7217665 could there be anything more delightful than carmel and the monterey peninsula at thanksgiving my cousins by marriage have a new place there within easy reach of bird sanctuaries and wildlife refuges and the light has to be experienced to be believed
7217666 so a fresh and sly political subtext in a very bizarre campaign season the two democratic nominees remain icily calm when in each others vicinity plain as it is that they cordially loathe and despise one another while huge shudders of molten rage continue to shake the ample and empurpled yet graying frame of bill clinton as he broods on the many injustices to which life has subjected him
7217667 well its fairly easy to see why barack obama made his speech in evansville indiana last night rather than pittsburgh or philadelphia or any other pennsylvanian centre of population
7217668 the stirring news that the dockworkers of durban south africa had refused to unload a shipload of chinese weapons ordered by the lawless government of zimbabwe made me remember very piercingly how good it sometimes felt to be a socialist
7217669 the visit of his holiness the pope to the united states this week will be an occasion for all kinds of manifestation of deference and servility from politicians and from the press
7217670 when martin luther king jr was murdered i was 19 years old and fancifully considered myself to be far to the left of him notwithstanding that he felt to me like one of my moral elders and tutors as he still does
7217671 as soon as mrs clintons long hidden daily records as first lady were revealed to the public my lines lit up from people who remembered how her husbands administration sold out the bosnians
7217672 its been more than a month since i began warning sen barack obama that he would become answerable for his revolting choice of a family priest but never mind that the astonishing thing is that its at least 11 months since he himself has known precisely the same thing
7217673 the extraordinary thing and also the alarming thing about the hasty withdrawal of prince harry from his front line duties in afghanistan is the way in which everybody seems to assume that it was the only right thing to do it was all very well apparently for the junior of the two royal princes to share in the risks and duties shouldered by his fellow soldiers in the household cavalry yet not for a moment longer than his valor could be kept a secret at that point he was supposed to make a rapid exit and take his valor with him

7217691 we found that there are a variety of behaviors learning disabilities and emotional problems that are unique to patients with xxyy syndrome that may be better addressed with more targeted therapies

7217694 our research is important because it provides an accurate picture of what patients are experiencing that can help physicians who treat patients with the disorder
7217695 until now physicians have had to search the medical literature to patch together a treatment plan mostly based on information on klinefelter syndrome
7217696 as a result people with xxyy werent being screened for the specific medical problems associated with their disorder they werent receiving therapies or medications for the behavioral and neurodevelopmental issues that are more profound for them and they werent receiving the types of community services that can help them live independent lives our research is an important resource for families and practitioners
7217697 life skills are more of a struggle for these males and they may need different medications a broader array of behavioral therapies and more intensive community support than those with klinefelter syndrome
7217698 we were tired of having our families running around the country looking for answers from people who didnt have them

7217725 the following 25 percent of liberal colleges after the top 50 percent
7217726 joe biden recognizes that ending our addiction to oil is vital to our national security
7217727 sen biden is a long time leader on key energy and environmental issues and the members of lcv enthusiastically support sen obamas choice
7217728 he has been outspoken about global warming for a long time we think that will make a very strong team biden has demonstrated a commitment and values that were the reason we
7217729 combining somebody who believes that global warming is a priority and is ready with the foreign policy experience you have a coherent and new direction unlike what weve seen over the last eight years
7217730 i think youre going to see a dramatic shift in u s foreign policy where we can regain some of this lost leadership
7217731 if i could wave a wand and the lord said i could solve one problem i would solve the energy crisis
7217732 i would be most capable of getting this country back into an international climate regime getting us back to the table the fastest and with the most prospect for success because of my extensive engagement in foreign policy
7217733 im also in the best position to make it clear to the united states congress that this is not merely an environmental issue it is a security issue
7217734 to deal with global warming you have to change the attitude of the world particularly china and india the two largest developing nations but in order to do that to have any credibility you have to begin here in the united states by capping emissions increasing renewable fuels establishing a national renewable portfolio standard requiring better fuel economy for automobiles
7217735 i dont think theres much of a role for clean coal in energy independence
7217736 we literally cant afford four more years of this non energy policy relying on hostile foreign countries literally putting americas security at risk
7217737 barack obama and i believe we believe with every fiber of our being that there is not a single solitary challenge that we cannot solve if we level with the american people
7217738 your kitchen table is like mine after you put the kids to bed you sit at the table and talk about what you need you worry about how to pay the bills
7217739 hell have to figure out which of his seven tables to sit at
7217740 after decades of steady work across the aisle i know hell be able to help me turn the page on the ugly partisanship in washington so we can bring democrats and republicans together to pass an agenda that works for the american people
7217741 and instead of secret energy task forces stacked with big oil and a vice president that twists the facts and shuts the american people out i know that joe biden will give us some real straight talk
7217742 of all the things ive ever lost i miss my mind the most
7217743 if its a good idea go ahead and do it its much easier to apologize than it is to get permission
7217744 our eyes can only see our beliefs our beliefs cause us to make assumptions draw conclusions and cause confusion our five senses are very limiting
7217745 whenever you are confronted with an opponent conquer him with love
7217746 as of now we have decided to go ahead with tomorrows march to lal chowk
7217747 this is uncalled for despite having a peaceful march people as well as leaders are being picked up
7217748 we have not had a violent agitation i wonder why this action has been taken
7217749 i am going to express my solidarity with the people of singur the tatas should not use their corporate power for wrong purposes
7217750 we have deployed around 3 000 policemen but they will not do anything unless the situation arises
7217751 we want our land back and we will continue to agitate till our demand is met
7217752 i am going to express my solidarity with the people of singur the tatas should not use their corporate power for wrong purposes
7217753 we have deployed around 3 000 policemen but they will not do anything unless the situation arises
7217754 we want our land back and we will continue to agitate till our demand is met
7217755 its just such an accomplishment for this team and the usa and these girls
7217756 theres no disappointment if we would have come out today and not fought id maybe have a different answer to that
7217757 i cant explain to you where our team was several months ago and where we are now from inside out how weve grown how weve played for each other
7217758 as the tournament went on the more i believed in us and where we could go and what we could do thats a tribute to all the girls
7217759 thats just typical adam timo it was great to see him have such a big game because it benefits our program
7217760 we feel bad for him because this is his senior season and hes a huge part of our team its a good thing that this isnt season ending ill take him for five games rather than for nothing at all
7217761 this program is at the level we should have that in our sights every year
7217762 its my main responsibility as a head football coach to make sure the team is ready to play each and every week
7217763 hes continually adjusting his ideas and views throughout the program and developing it
7217764 he is a smart guy kids change and times change and people who are successful adjust to that
7217765 he has become more comfortable as a head coach and more understanding of us
7217766 a three year absence it has been too long this program is at the level we should have that in our sights every year
7217767 i looked for a medal around my neck and its just such an accomplishment for this team and the usa and these girls and it just brought tears to my eyes and im more than thrilled
7217768 shes an amazing player all around and she got us here
7217769 i could have swung a little higher maybe but im not the kind of person to go down without swinging
7217770 thats how i am and i feel all right about it
7217771 one of the best volleyball players in the world period
7217772 all in all the citizens of the united states of america and indeed people around the world can be proud of our team
7217773 itd be nice to get a championship ring on top of this
7217774 weve got a great squad back in salt lake and weve got a great chance of winning that thing
7217775 its an unbelievable experience ups downs ill remember it for the rest of my life
7217776 gold silver bronze it doesnt matter the experience was well worth it and it feels good to be taking home a medal
7217777 this has been a great tournament i dont think anyone expected to have as stiff competition as it was

7217784 i kissed anna nicole she came to my rocker chick show she was wearing one of those dotted net see through things with roses on her bullet bra underneath it was when she was doing trimspa and she looked really beautiful
7217785 rose had the kind of macho rock persona that kurt detested
7217786 her defaming of our national anthem in 1990 gave us insight into who she is and what she is capable of saying and doing
7217787 its consistent with her healthy lifestyle and values she likes to invest in healthy products
7217788 i wish i had been nude from the time i was 12 until i was 28 i looked great i so wish i had listened to my mom and grandma when i was 18 and would complain about some little tiny bump or feeling bloated i used to scoff and say no i feel fat today now the jokes on me
7217789 its completely and utterly ridiculous that people at the top of our education system are being paid rewarded in fact for a degree that for all intents and purposes comes from a fake university

7217801 i felt a little stupid and embarrassed that i hadnt watched the show prior to having a meeting
7217802 im happy to say the episodes they sent to me to look at were really really engaging and really wonderful and kind of dark and moody like a lot of the work that ive actually been involved in
7217803 and i thought thats cool hmm hmm wow wow this will work ahhh so im very excited
7217804 i wouldnt say that my going into a weekly series is stepping away from anything
7217805 its another medium in which to work as an actor because i havent done series television since playhouse its a welcome change
7217806 its nothing as simple as hes got the genes of a serial killer because there is no such thing
7217807 were a show that spends a lot of time thinking we dont blow stuff up
7217808 the quality that we were looking for was deep intelligence mr fishburne you look at his work hes always brought that sensibility to the material he has done
7217809 the most important thing for me to remember is not to mistake my presence for the event
7217810 the event is csi the show everyone has a responsibility to bring their unique talents and gifts to it and thats what im going to do im going to enter into this with the most positive attitude i can im coming to work with people who are wonderful whove made great television for nine years thats a gift
7217811 taking on the system rules for radical change in a digital era
7217812 the bottom line is that technology is democratizing everything everywhere there is a gatekeeper an elite that used to make decisions on any given issue no longer has a monopoly
7217813 we were essentially held hostage i dont use that in a negative sense a really positive way
7217814 we were held hostage by their decision about who got in who got out and there was no recourse
7217815 in denver we were going to do our own party in our own space the party wasn t going to monopolize that process any more
7217816 for a week im not going to turn that down but i have a feeling that after the second day i wont touch a beer for a week
7217817 when i was in new york and boston at the 2004 conventions i realized pretty quickly that there was nothing that i was doing at a convention that i couldnt do at home there was no real advantage to being there but i was hanging out with bloggers we were having a blast it was sort of a celebration of who we were and what we were doing
7217818 being in a collective space where youre having a social gathering as opposed to being a spectator in a stadium is a big big difference so if im not getting anything inside i might as well be outside
7217819 oh thats the stuff you say when youre running against people in the primaries
7217820 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy i mean thats a storybook man
7217821 all about going out of control getting crazy and feeling really powerful
7217822 theres a lot of rust i have to shake off
7217823 im glad coach gruden gave me the opportunity to stay in there
7217824 i think i made two poor decisions which is very unlike me and i think that shows i havent practiced a lot and havent played at all
7217825 to all you curious readers out there here is something about me and mr b her partner he is skinny while im pretty chubby
7217826 he loves the game dota while i absolutely hate playing computer games we argue an awful lot but the thing that keeps us together is going to new restaurants to eat
7217827 just recently we went to ma maison which is a french restaurant located in ampang kl
7217828 it was such a surprise to find such a romantic restaurant at the hidden corner
7217829 upon entering the restaurant everything about the restaurant seemed very traditional the sweet smell the friendly staff and the cosy atmosphere
7217830 right after we took our seat we were served with a bucket of bread one half was garlic bread and the other half was just plain bread yet they tasted really good
7217831 for starters mr b ordered some oysters just to have a taste im not really a big fan because the last time i had some it tasted pretty bad
7217832 but the ones over here totally changed my mind the oysters were so fresh that we accidentally ordered another then we ordered a half dozen escargot and they were simply scrumptious they were served in a tiny cup so it was easy for us to dip the delicious butter garlic sauce with bread
7217833 for the main course i had the carre dagneau a la provencale which is simply roasted lamb rack with mustard custard it was perfectly roasted and just how ive always wanted a roast lamb to be
7217834 mr b had the filet de cabillaud au basilic citronne its really a cod fillet with basil and lemon butter and the dish was so huge the fish was fresh and creamy definitely something id recommend to anyone
7217835 for desserts we ordered gratin de fraises au grand marnier which is strawberries with ice cream
7217836 initially we were so greedy we wanted to order two different kinds but thought better of it and ordered only one the dessert was perfect to complement the romantic environment
7217837 at the end of the day it was a great eating experience great food great service with no government tax and service tax
7217838 however they do not accept credit card so make sure you bring along cash when you dine here bear in mind that they close every tuesday
7217839 e voi non lavete il problema dei medici obiettori di coscienza
7217840 parlo di quei medici che si rifiutano di fare le interruzioni di gravidanza per motivi di credo religioso in italia laborto legale ma spesso non praticato dai medici in alcuni ospedali impossibile abortire non ci sono medici disposti a farlo
7217841 io penso che se un medico la pensa cos dovrebbe cambiare mestiere
7217842 se lo agradec en pek n y tambi n en barcelona la verdad es que conmigo tuvo un gesto muy lindo pero yo sab a lo que iba a hacer porque l fue futbolista y todav a piensa como futbolista
7217843 ahora los dos tenemos la misma medalla ya que l la gan en los juegos ol mpicos de barcelona 92
7217844 vali la pena tanto sufrimiento pero sab a que de todas maneras el s lo hecho de estar con la selecci n en china iba a valer la pena independientemente del resultado final
7217845 tuve la suerte de ganar otros t tulos tambi n como el mundial sub 20 de holanda los campeonatos con el barcelona pero los juegos ol mpicos se disfrutan mucho igual todos son especiales tuve tristezas tambi n pero me quedo con las alegr as
7217846 siento algo especial al tener la medalla en el pecho por todo lo que fueron los juegos por el grupo que hab a y por todo lo que pas antes de venir a china
7217847 s que hubo mucha gente que habl y yo no me olvido no me olvido que se dijeron muchas cosas que no fueron ciertas
7217848 la convivencia con el grupo de jugadores argentinos un grupo que se hace cada vez m s fuerte
7217849 a la mayor a ya los conoc a pero la convivencia fue muy buena y adem s la experiencia de estar unos d as en la villa ol mpica y conocer otros deportistas y ver de cerca a otras estrellas que se acercaron a nosotros para charlar y compartir un buen momento sab a que esto se vive una sola vez as que no quer a desaprovechar nada
7217850 en venezuela en 2007 para m fue muy feo ver c mo le daban a brasil el premio de campe n y cuando recib la medalla dorada me acord de eso por suerte y porque hicimos m ritos nos toc a nosotros
7217851 nunca le dije que no a la selecci n argentina y nunca le voy a decir que no como se coment mal tambi n eso es una mentira muy grande siempre dije que quer a jugar todos los partidos de la selecci n sea donde sea y contra quien sea que para m es lo m s grande que hay
7217852 these are interesting times for universities we simply cannot afford to lose this time
7217853 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
7217854 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
7217855 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
7217856 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
7217857 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
7217858 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
7217859 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
7217860 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
7217861 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
7217862 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
7217863 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
7217864 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
7217865 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
7217866 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
7217867 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
7217868 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
7217869 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
7217870 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
7217871 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
7217872 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
7217873 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
7217874 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
7217875 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
7217876 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
7217877 on ne conna t pas les raisons de cet envoi donc manifestement cest pour faire plaisir george bush cest dire un alignement atlantiste

7217885 he will have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7217886 articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7217887 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
7217888 catholics who attempt to confer a sacred order on a woman and the women who attempt to receive a sacred order are by their own actions separating themselves from the church
7217889 we are roman catholics the all male hierarchy and their legal traditions came along with the spiritual package that we embrace we do not have to embrace both if they are contradictory
7217890 nothing or no one can stop the action of gods spirit moving in the church
7217891 the church has no authority whatsoever to confer priestly ordination on women
7217892 all people are created by god equal in that we each possess an immortal and individual soul but we are each unique in our talents women are called upon to be mothers spiritually and for many in marriage physically as well whereas men are called upon to be fathers spiritually and for many in marriage physically as well
7217893 as an active woman religious working in the field of retreats and catechesis in the bible belt south i have to say that i am far too busy to feel slighted by the fact that the priesthood is not open to women
7217894 theres always someone right around the corner waiting to move in
7217895 the catholic priesthood and women a guide to the teaching of the church
7217896 these women do not represent most catholic women and they do not represent most women religious
7217897 desire to live a life of faithfulness to the church and its teaching
7217898 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
7217899 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
7217900 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
7217901 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
7217902 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
7217903 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
7217904 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
7217905 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
7217906 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
7217907 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
7217908 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
7217909 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
7217910 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
7217911 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
7217912 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
7217913 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
7217914 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
7217915 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
7217916 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
7217917 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
7217918 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
7217919 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
7217920 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
7217921 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
7217922 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
7217923 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
7217924 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
7217925 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
7217926 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
7217927 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
7217928 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
7217929 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
7217930 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
7217931 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
7217932 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
7217933 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
7217934 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
7217935 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
7217936 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
7217937 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
7217938 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
7217939 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
7217940 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
7217941 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
7217942 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
7217943 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
7217944 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
7217945 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
7217946 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
7217947 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
7217948 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
7217949 who are open to doing something on the production side
7217950 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
7217951 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
7217952 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them

7217993 we will reopen the road only when we are entirely satisfied that it is safe to do so

7218027 we are deeply concerned that our son nigel brennan may have gone missing near mogadishu in somalia yesterday
7218028 he is a freelance photographer who arrived in kenya just over a week ago
7218029 we understand that the australian government is making urgent contact with relevant somalian authorities as well as the canadian french and british embassies to help locate nigel
7218030 the election results will affect his momentum whether he can move forward or not
7218031 it is pivotal he has to be in the parliament because it will change the dynamics a victory will be a step in the process
7218032 people want anwar to be in parliament and then become the prime minister

7218044 no formal claim of responsibility has been made and the motive for the kidnapping remains unknown as well there have been no demands
7218045 it is not clear whether they are being held for political purposes as bargaining chips or for financial purposes but journalists who spoke on condition of anonymity for their security said the abduction seemed to be a pre planned attack
7218046 we are appalled by this cruel abduction of journalists and call for the immediate release of our colleagues

7218050 set aside that obama said shed be on anybodys short list set aside anybodys feelings on whether she was deliberately snubbed and the pros and cons of whether it should be her
7218051 focus on the politics of it and you have about a quarter of clinton loyalists still not joining the caravan for gods sake not to even make a show of taking her seriously is flatly stupid
7218052 you cant put obama vp vetters eric holder and caroline kennedy on an hour plane ride to chappaqua just to check the box they should have done it just for the optics
7218053 barack never even said to her heres how i envision the job
7218054 they thought her supporters were mad before they are really mad now
7218055 i think there are a lot of hillary voters who are going to say hey wait a minute man you said you were going to put her on the short list
7218056 by the way he didnt seek president clintons advice either hes actually the guy who i think picked the best vice president in american history you would think maybe you would sort of check in with him
7218057 the dnc has lost its mind not only have they perpetrated fraud after fraud on the voters this year but they send me an email seeking my help in promoting this stupid meme that mccain doesn t know how many houses he has tell me they aren t really this clueless it doesn t matter how many houses mccain has it doesn t matter that he doesn t know about all of them the point is men who live in million dollar mansions that they purchased with help from a convicted felon have no right to point to the abundance of his opponent s living arrangements neither one of them knows what it s like to live in a philly row home or a trailer park or a modest three bedroom townhouse or a california ranch pursuing this line of attack is a waste of time and effort oh what do i care who is running the dnc these days they are really amatuers someone should keep them away from sharp objects they are a danger to themselves and others
7218058 the information in the film is especially jarring for those who were not in caucus states but it is information that our party must face there is a reason why half of all hillary voters are not currently willing to vote for obama and this is a big part of it as i told my friend rep lois capps whose son in law is obama s national communications director it would be unfair and unethical to delegates both pledged and super to withhold this otherwise untold story prior to their floor votes in denver this is oddly also an opportunity for unity if the obama campaign stated that they played rough in a caucus system that should be abolished it would heal a lot of wounds

7218061 foreign fighters how are they being recruited two imperfect recruitment models
7218062 foreign fighters how are they being recruited two imperfect recruitment models
7218063 their intention to smuggle the component parts of improvised explosive devices onto aircraft and assemble and detonate them on board
7218064 might be of material assistance in preventing the commission of an act of terrorism
7218065 may not have been aware of the others or the extent of their assignment
7218066 members of the outer cell purchased supplies rented apartments and transferred money needed by members of the inner cell members of the inner cell planned the attacks and at least some were preparing to participate in the missions both the inner and outer cells had been actively preparing the attack for more than six months but all the members may not have known each other
7218067 engaged in a plot to detonate liquid explosives on board multiple commercial aircraft departing from the united kingdom and bound for the united states the terrorists planned to carry the components of the bombs including liquid explosive ingredients and detonating devices disguised as beverages electronic devices or other common objects
7218068 i would say one of the concerns we had is the possibility of bringing on board a number of different components of a bomb each one of which would be benign but when mixed together would create a bomb
7218069 the terrorists planned to dye the explosive mixture red to match the sports drink sealed in the top half of the container
7218070 this was a very sophisticated plan and operation this is not a circumstance where you had a handful of people sitting around coming up with dreamy ideas about terrorist plots the conception the large number of people involved the sophisticated design of the devices that were being considered and the sophisticated nature of the plan all suggests that this group that came together to conspire was very determined and very skilled and very capable this was a plot that is certainly about as sophisticated as any weve seen in recent years
7218071 centered upon carriers that had direct non stop flights between the u k and u s
7218072 we have no evidence there was targeting of cities this was an effort to destroy multiple aircraft in flight not against any territory of the united states
7218073 i am not aware of any indication that the intent was to make the plane into a weapon
7218074 the plan was to bring them down over u s cities not over the ocean
7218075 it would make your hair stand up to be in the room to hear that presentation
7218076 i am a long standing believer that terrorist plotters or planners execute when they have all of the plot together we have no evidence this was timed to any particular holiday or special event
7218077 i can tell you our general experience certainly when you deal with al qaeda is that theyre not necessarily motivated by anniversaries the way sometimes people project
7218078 i would say that this plot was well advanced in other words they had accumulated and assembled the capabilities that they needed and they were in the final stages of planning before execution this is not a case where this was just in the initial thought stage there were very concrete steps underway to execute all elements of this plan
7218079 i got a call telling me that it looked as if the focus had turned to an attack on the united states it also became evident within 24 hours that the time frame within which the attack was going to take place would not be a matter of months but a matter of weeks or even days
7218080 a senior british official said the message from pakistan was not that explicit
7218081 this was a plan by terrorists to cause untold death and destruction and commit mass murder
7218082 had this plot been carried out the loss of life to innocent civilians would have been on an unprecedented scale
7218083 i think that the plot in terms of its intent was looking at devastation on a scale that would have rivaled 9 11 there could have been thousands of lives lost and an enormous economic impact with devastating consequences for international air travel
7218084 discovered that the inside of batteries had been scooped out and it appeared several suspects were doing chemical experiments with a sports drink named lucozade and syringes
7218085 they found a plastic bin filled with liquid batteries nearly a dozen empty drink bottles rubber gloves digital scales and a disposable camera that was leaking liquid
7218086 since 10 august we have found bomb making equipment there are chemicals including hydrogen peroxide electrical components documents and other items
7218087 we have found a number of video recordings these are sometimes referred to as martyrdom videos
7218088 there have been 69 searches these have been in houses flats and business premises vehicles and open spaces we have found more than 400 computers 200 mobile telephones and 8 000 items of removable storage media such as memory sticks cds and dvds so far from the computers alone we have removed some 6 000 gigabytes of data
7218089 diary that included a list that the police interpreted as a step by step plan for an attack the items included batteries and lucozade bottles it also included a reminder to select a date
7218090 were not convinced this particular operation is connected to the al qaeda chain of command
7218091 this operation is in some respects suggestive of an al qaeda plot we cannot yet form a definitive conclusion
7218092 certainly in terms of the complexity the sophistication the international dimension and the number of people involved this plot has the hallmarks of an al qaeda type plot
7218093 it clearly is an al qaeda type operation with links to al qaeda
7218094 clear evidence leads to an al qaeda connection in afghanistan
7218095 conduit to the british pakistani cells that carried out the 7 july 2005 public transit bombings in london as well as the failed transatlantic airliner plot in britain in 2006
7218096 we have patchy intelligence on the relationship and structure between external operations figures and al qaeda number two ayman al zawahiri and bin laden in the really big plots we think they played a role
7218097 became a regular visitor traveling to various parts of the country to meet al qaeda figures
7218098 established direct and regular contact with abu faraj al libi
7218099 was responsible for al qaeda activities and logistics throughout pakistan
7218100 drew financial and logistical support from sponsors operating in karachi and lahore
7218101 the sheer breadth of these conditions leaves ample theological justification for killing civilians in almost any imaginable situation
7218102 as if one of the foundations of our religion is how to coexist with infidels
7218103 the west avenges itself against islam for giving infidels but three options islam jizya a special tax imposed on non muslims or the sword
7218104 islam is spread with the sword alone just as the prophet muhammad was sent forth with the sword
7218105 why else did the sword come as an important pillar enslaving mankind to their master allah
7218106 muslims and especially the learned among them should spread sharia islamic law to the world that and nothing else
7218107 is our only option for glory as has been continuously demonstrated in the islamic texts
7218108 b attle animosity and hatred directed from the muslim to the infidel is the foundation of our religion
7218109 transgress the bounds of nature muslims are obligated to raid the lands of the infidels occupy them and exchange their systems of governance for an islamic system
7218110 the lord almighty has commanded us to hate the infidels and reject their love
7218111 b efriending believers i e muslims and battling infidels are critical pillars in a muslims faith
7218112 islam is so much richer than all these blasphemous principles
7218113 the call to jihad and martyrdom is for men and women
7218114 a few moments spent in jihad in the path of allah i e fighting for god is worth more than seventy years spent in praying at home
7218115 every martyrdom operation against any israeli including children women and teenagers is a legitimate act
7218116 despite the fact that bin laden murdered thousands of innocents in the name of our religion to this date not a single fatwa has been issued calling for the killing of bin laden
7218117 t hose who argue that islam has nothing to do with the attacks of 9 11 will find no comfort here the facts are plain osama bin laden ayman al zawahiri and other militants lay claim to some of the central practices and themes of islamic tradition
7218118 and replaced regimes that by reason of their religious and moral errors could be described as tyrannical islamic expansion thus involved a systematic program of regime change in which jihad became the symbol for muslim effort
7218119 a means to a political end establishing an islamic state which is itself a means to an overarching religious goal calling humanity to islam
7218120 it is not surprising then that the history of sharia reasoning is a history of conflict in which argument is often connected with violence
7218121 from an islamic vantage point all wars in islam are religious and there is no concept of secular war
7218122 why is there such a high degree of violence inside and from saudi arabia a state without a colonialist past
7218123 can select a few passages from the quran about war and peace that suits his or her preconceptions and purposes
7218124 that indicates that the quran was used extensively in the military training of thirty nine al qaeda recruits

7218131 heat related deaths and illness are preventable yet annually many people succumb to extreme heat
7218132 we have heard of exertional heat stroke deaths in individuals as young as 11

7218136 and the drive through the grand tetons on the way to the park is a great thing even if they didnt stop but just drove through it theyd see the mountains and the views its just incredibly beautiful
7218137 the driving force behind the bloody mary bar is personal taste
7218138 likes a lot of horseradish and whatnot in mine and people like to do the same thing
7218139 one time tim had a friend come in and he was like yours is very new england its very horseradish and mines very southern because its very spicy theres little comments going back and forth so its a real fun thing for everyone at the bar
7218140 i came here to learn the fine art and craft of the bloody mary and now i make the personal best bloody mary in the world
7218141 brunch has become competitive and bloody marys are a significant part of that competition whether its by glass size accouterments or price each business needs to distinguish its bloody mary since its almost synonymous with weekend brunch aka the hangover meal
7218142 throughout that process i found my way to writing music
7218143 i was part of a theater company and someone there really taught me about song structure and writing plays and performance
7218144 i was recording music and they wanted to sign me but when i wouldnt bend my style to be more superficial and glossy i lost that opportunity
7218145 a lot of prisoners would tell me you dont need to be in here
7218146 you need to focus on your music and make something of yourself
7218147 i brought in everybody from russell simmons to teach the creative and corporate sides of music and we made an album
7218148 he was so happy and following everybody around the store playing i knew we had to do something to help him
7218149 it used to be that when a dog couldnt walk it was a catastrophe often marking the end of a dogs life
7218150 especially with the euro being so strong and the u s dollar being so weak i think a lot of younger people who had initially avoided them are staying there because they are hearing so many great things about them and money is tight
7218151 its not only youth filling up the hostel anymore like in the 70s
7218152 are more expensive but also provide more privacy and luxury
7218153 they can be surprisingly expensive for the quality so i suppose the image of the cheap backpackers hostel is rapidly disappearing
7218154 they talk about the price but it doesnt prevent them from coming here and traveling
7218155 we chose hostels because i think we wanted a more authentic backpacking experience
7218156 for the time we were in italy we stayed in budget hotels and by the end of it we were excited to get back to staying in larger rooms with more people
7218157 the obvious first question is where theyre from then i ask about what they like to drink and their taste preferences
7218158 the real all star ingredient is mint because of the mojito
7218159 you put mint in something and its going to go over well
7218160 fresh fresh fresh in the drink dont allow yourself to be talked into canned fruit products
7218161 i pulled something out of a history book it was a georgia julep made with non sweet peach brandy cognac and crushed mint

7218167 in the time ive been in custody my business has been destroyed
7218168 to allow immigration agents to come into the federal and state courthouse and questioning people is really going to pose problems
7218169 im not going to say its fairly routine but its not out of the ordinary either
7218170 perhaps its trying to make them ice look more humane
7218171 we need to establish the integrity of the immigration system and this is how we can do it
7218172 i dont think most of the people will take this chance
7218173 we dont have any family in mexico if she goes where is she going to live what is she going to do
7218174 we are going to find out if people are opposed to methods of enforcement or if they are against any enforcement of the law
7218175 the administration is so desperate to force congress to act that it will try anything
7218176 i believe is the best contractor in the world for this subject matter
7218177 we need to enhance our training and get it back on track
7218178 this will give us the ability to do so and train 24 hours a day seven days a week
7218179 per our u s constitution this jurisdiction is at the federal level
7218180 i do not think we should put a band aid on a huge problem that requires major surgery
7218181 citizens are going to have to be sure when they vote and if they do want immigration reform that they vote for candidates that are not for open borders
7218182 it is a huge impact on kansas and on america and it is one of the biggest issues
7218183 states are the only ones that are going to do it because the federal government isnt going to
7218184 we need issues that are going to bring us together and bring economic prosperity to every single family in kansas
7218185 if the state did something that wasnt very intelligent on immigration it would become more of an issue
7218186 as a businessman i think it is very important to regulate the situation in the state but now i think we are more worried about the economy
7218187 this project is vast but will be very beneficial to our youth
7218188 this aspect of our curriculum will really prepare students for the real world
7218189 and we believe it will help them gain meaningful employment after graduation
7218190 this initiative will save paper save time and make use of the information super highway
7218191 and since we wont have to update texts every couple of years the information we use from the net will always be up to date and relevent to each field offered at our casino computer programmer volunteers school
7218192 im really impressed by the planning that went into this casino computer programmer volunteers project were going to be offering a wholesome curriculum that will prepare students to meet the demands of the real world while developing their appreciation for learning
7218193 were excited to announce ground breaking on our citys newest project a casino computer programmer volunteers school for talented students to foster careers and livelihoods
7218194 once construction begins we estimate a two year completion time
7218195 im thrilled that my son will have the opportunity to attend this school which really looks promising when i graduated from the nikki revelle private school i was really clueless about the real world this casino computer programmer volunteers school looks much different it is the real world and promises to teach our kids how to be productive citizens no matter what career path they may follow
7218196 it will be the best in the nation and will prepare all tessie vallas county youth for the challenges of tomorrow
7218197 were going to finance this the easy way and tax payers will barely notice any changes in their bills
7218198 we desparately needed facilities for all our programs and the high school was running out of space now with this casino computer programmer volunteers school getting built and fields set to be operational next spring we will have plenty of space for people to recreate and enjoy team sports
7218199 subven iile nu ar trebui acordate dec t pentru ceea ce are un efect pozitiv asupra naturii i climei
7218200 incepand din 26 septembrie va trebui sa aplicam aceasta directiva astfel pana la sfarsitul acestui an se stabileste cadrul functional iar in primele patru luni ale lui 2009 producatorii au termen sa se inscrie in registrul pe care il gestionam
7218201 distribuitorii trebuie sa primeasca gratuit napoi deseurile de baterii sau acumulatori portabili atunci c nd furnizeaza baterii sau acumulatori portabili noi si sa nu implice nici un cost pentru utilizatorii finali care duc deseurile si nici o obligatie de a cumpara o baterie noua sau un acumulator nou
7218202 inca nu s a discutat aceasta chestiune dar dupa cum s a intamplat in cazul deseurilor electrice si electrocasnice deee este foarte posibil sa se observe si o schimbare de pret
7218203 with three gold medals at beijing the flagbearer was a particularly tough choice
7218204 ultimately it came down to recognising caroline and georginas extraordinary performance at beijing but also taking into account their performance in athens
7218205 im good to go for new zealand for the next quadrennial no doubt about that
7218206 people have to accept a lot of whale calves will die in the wild and its not pleasant and there is nothing that can be done
7218207 this isnt a cute and cuddly world and people have to think about the reality of wild animals
7218208 i dont think we should be moving towards doing things to keep animals alive in cruel circumstances just to make us feel good
7218209 in 2007 there were 20 000 citations for charges related to driving without a license
7218210 to say there is a need for this initiative is untrue and ill conceived
7218211 unlicensed drivers who get into accidents will be uninsured and are a tremendous safety hazard to our citizens
7218212 a lot of people believe its because the enforcement of our laws is more permissive and we need to have teeth to get unlicensed drivers out of cars
7218213 we are here to announce that together we are family
7218214 people dont want to go left or right but deeper and so were here to shift the thinking and to say no to initiative 100
7218215 i think that the initiative is designed to attack undocumented immigrants
7218216 it is pretty explicit in the writing and makes the law susceptible to racial profiling
7218217 ive heard police say that insurance for illegal aliens is get out and run and thats not going to help the victims of accidents
7218218 convincing corroborating identification vehicle registration or a valid drivers license
7218219 this is an important issue for our colleges and our students and given that authority our state board needs the opportunity to review and discuss these findings with the care and thoroughness they deserve
7218220 individual states must decide for themselves whether or not to admit illegal aliens into their public post secondary institutions
7218221 other states have considered legislation to bar undocumented students from attending public institutions none of those bills have passed
7218222 we think this is an excellent fit because jim loved children
7218223 we really wanted to honor the only police officer from the city ever killed in the line of duty
7218224 we are very proud to have the ravenna police department choose the community built playground to honor one of their fallen officers
7218225 the plaque is a beautiful complement to the entrance of the playground and we are very touched to be part of the dedication to honor james wert
7218226 park itself has so much meaning and so many different tributes to a lot of community members that have passed away
7218227 weve got all these other heroes who have passed away from coaches to teachers to firemen and i think his dedication and his service to the community are a perfect fit
7218228 the park has so many different meanings from other great people whose families chose to have them memorialized there and i think this is a great way for him to oversee the playground watch it and keep it safe
7218229 we need to have agreement locally on how to handle animal calls and we need to find something that works for portage county that is viable for the future
7218230 we would have to take a serious look at discontinuing that humane officer function we are a private nonprofit organization we are not a county agency we have to look at the viability of our organization
7218231 when times were good for all the shelters this was fine it had not been an issue now with the economy tightening a shift in donor giving and the economic position of the shelter its become more difficult to provide this service
7218232 the shelter tests them treats them and houses them we pay the salaries of shelter workers for the food and water for the animals
7218233 we can no longer afford to do this for free can you help us out at least through these tough times
7218234 you have to arrest people take them home with you and house them and feed them and maybe not get reimbursed for the expense
7218235 will be left to fend for themselves because no one is going to come
7218236 the dog warden will pick up the dogs but what happens to the cats the birds and other animals
7218237 he will have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7218238 the american dream under eight years of bush and mccain that american dream is slipping away
7218239 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader a leader who can deliver
7218240 no one has supported president bush in iraq more than i have
7218241 support tax breaks for companies who ship our jobs overseas
7218242 you cant change america when you know your first four years as president will look exactly like the last eight years of george bushs presidency
7218243 ive been disappointed in my friend john mccain who gave in to the right wing of his party and yielded to the very swift boat politics that he once so deplored
7218244 folks campaigns for presidents are a test of character and leadership
7218245 thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about its a pretty hard experience he will have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7218246 of course senator biden is comfortable on the attack he spent the entire primary highlighting barack obamas inexperience and failed judgment on national security
7218247 staff is of the opinion this project does meet the code
7218248 we have not had much proposed for that particular corner over the years
7218249 its up to the planning commission to see if theyve met the requirements of the code
7218250 as with any project there are positives and negatives that need to be balanced
7218251 in meetings with sheetz officials the city asked for numerous concessions and design changes to better fit the location they have acknowledged the public input and have made a sincere effort to make the kent project fit with the scale and tone of the area
7218252 i dont think theres anything that will stop the station from going in but i feel that as a community we should see that it is made to look as nice as possible
7218253 but as ive said for a long time records are meant to be broken i certainly thought that by this time someone would have won it twice
7218254 a junior who is a threat to become the first three time winner
7218255 i thought that the way he ran a year ago was extremely impressive i thought maybe he should have gotten some consideration even last year
7218256 its an honor and a blessing to even be mentioned in the same sentence with the heisman trophy
7218257 for guys like archie to say something like that thats incredible
7218258 he piled up at least 100 yards rushing in his next four games
7218259 tim tebow is the type of guy who works hard im sure hes working his butt off to get a second one
7218260 you know what you can always say youre the first to win two
7218261 if tim tebow has the kind of season thats deserving of another heisman then let him have it hes an outstanding young man and hes done some tremendous things on the football field and in the community
7218262 but thats what it boils down to the best man wins
7218263 and now let us turn to the quiet temple deep in our hearts prepare to worship the lord from this region of inner peace may the radiance of the lord flow into your hearts and minds as our acolyte comes forward to light the candles

7218271 for the film i am recording a traditional folk kutch song i chose folk because it will stand out in the crowd i refused to take any techno music because hollywood is way ahead in it we need to have our own flavour and make our mark with what is ours
7218272 my chhaiya chhaiya number became immensely popular with hollywood filmmakers and they want to recreate the magic there will be an original composition for this film

7218285 el mundo ha conocido sobre china y china ha conocido sobre el mundo y yo creo que esto es algo que tendr efectos positivos a largo plazo
7218286 somos primordialmente y ante todo una organizaci n dedicada al deporte pero el deporte con una misi n
7218287 el coi y los juegos ol mpicos no pueden forzar cambios en naciones soberanas o resolver todos los males del mundo pero podemos y es lo que hacemos contribuir en un cambio positivo por medio del deporte

7218295 it will be a top seller im sure and even though it is meant for those familiar with the online gaming literary world many others may find it of general interest as well
7218296 i think lelia bostelmans new docu novel leads readers astray there is too much focus on making the fictional characters function whereas more attention should have been paid to the facts
7218297 i like the fact that it reaches out to those outside of the literary world this is a wise decision and proves a good way to educate others about new things
7218298 but were doing it to make sure no unauthorized copies get resold we want to avoid plagiarism and pirating as much as possible furthermore this will be our new procedure for future releases by author rosella partee who has pledged support for this system
7218299 we stocked our shelves with double the normal number of first editions for this major online gaming biographical novel release
7218300 and we expect to sell out very fast mosby seidells online gaming book brought hundreds of pre sale orders and numerous bulk order requests so the question of whether or not well sell out is moot
7218301 i fully expect a sequel to be release within six months
7218302 typically we see interest wane a year after the initial release so it is important to stay on schedule and release subsequent books at pique points of public interest
7218303 with the release of sanyaro przybylas new online gaming book were going to see record traffic levels
7218304 pre sale polls show this new online gaming book doubling gross sales figures of other recent releases
7218305 and i believe dione scholtens book may be a complete blockbuster if trends stick well see marked sales numbers within two weeks that will demonstrate year highs
7218306 were releasing ven hosss work online in a weeks time
7218307 we have spent so many resources trying to create reliable rng software using traditional algorithms and caculi theorems but have never really analyzed geometric proofs and associated logic as a means to perfect our efforts
7218308 in general spatial relationships are not trypically meant for use in random numbers
7218309 but were trying new things now that could yield very promising results

7218324 it is clear that china has put the bar very high
7218325 there are issues london will not be able to equal
7218326 it is clear that the ability to bring in hundreds of thousands of volunteers in the different sites is something that number wise is not going to be easy for london
7218327 brought in the values of fair play and other values so i think that is the identity that has to be built around london london is also a very cosmopolitan city multi ethnic multi cultural multi religious so this is something you can also use as an asset
7218328 we are going to work on generating a party atmosphere
7218329 we have always urged china to give the widest possible access to the internet
7218330 we acknowledge that the situation has not been perfect but we acknowledge at the same time that the situation was a major change compared to before the games

7218372 our staff are paid according to our funding which is provided by the ministry of health when we receive funding increases we are able to pass these increases on to our staff
7218373 we are trying to negotiate how we bridge that gap and were hoping to make some progress on that issue during tomorrows mediation
7218374 we have given the company more than two weeks notice of the action so its had plenty of time to make arrangements to cover the action

7218385 we are deeply concerned that our son nigel brennan may have gone missing near mogadishu in somalia yesterday
7218386 he is a freelance photographer who arrived in kenya just over a week ago
7218387 we understand that the australian government is making urgent contact with relevant somalian authorities as well as the canadian french and british embassies to help locate nigel
7218388 they dont really believe that the theater missile defense components in poland and in the czech republic although they are very small are in fact in the end really intended for iran
7218389 the other piece of this is that the russians have opposed the general national military defense program of the united states for a very long time
7218390 and they put the two things together they think this is the camels nose under the tent that the united states is putting in place in alaska now in central europe and who knows where next the components of an effective for a much more extensive ballistic missile defense system that would be directed against russian nuclear capabilities
7218391 the president traveled to georgia august 13 when there was a rally in tbilisi and stood beside georgian president mikhail saakashvili and said now we see the real face of russia
7218392 here is the president of poland clearly suggesting that russia is a serious military threat to all its neighbors that is obviously going to lead to the action that its has taken that is to defend itself as best it can
7218393 the russian military actions in georgia not only broke through whatever resistance the polish government had to doing the deal without getting further satisfaction on the terms of the deal but in addition pushed both sides to build in these extra defensive measures which are clearly directed against russia
7218394 no one raises any question but that the patriot missile battery or batteries that are to be put in poland plus the joint administration and patrolling of them by both u s and polish forces is designed for russia
7218395 if the russians should do anything to attack those missiles and american lives are at risk then that would mean that the debate about whether or not the united states would actually do something to protect members of nato would become academic
7218396 and indeed because american troops were there it would serve as a trigger and the united states would react
7218397 fighting intensified overnight with battles raging near the towns of datu saudi ampatuan and datu piang all in maguindanao province
7218398 we have done our best to embrace peace but the milf started the hostilities by pillaging villages and murdering innocent civilians in mindanao
7218399 now we are implementing the full force of the law and we will arrest those responsible for the traitorous attacks against civilians
7218400 this is a grim scenario and i dont even want to think about it but if the peace talks collapse then there will be war again in mindanao
7218401 the voice of reason is dwarfed by the voice of hatred and prejudice

7218405 syrias bad negotiating position is leading it to look for more weapons and to try to grow more teeth before returning to the table with israel

7218522 the second finding that may be of interest to pedagogists sic is the speed and acceleration of the slide even though the researchers found that all trombonists have great variability in this area professionals do move the slide faster so teachers should encourage younger players to move the slide faster at all tempos
7218523 the third finding made by means of the sonic ranger and verified visually is that better players hold the instrument without extra movement of the slide from side to side or up and down good players have control of the instrument in relation to the body as well as to the manipulation of the slide
7218524 how does one arrange for his breathing to be well organized it is very difficult i am generally against breathing exercises in the commonly accepted notion of breathing exercises where i would be teaching someone that they must breathe like this or like that i f you tell someone how he needs to breathe t he instructions usually destroy his breathing
7218525 to our delight inherent in the structure of the human body there is something that permits humans to learn this easily something permits humans to improve their breathing constantly without undergoing special difficulties
7218526 so often the students come to my studio and they try to push sideways
7218527 this is a valid question and one that needs much further discussion
7218528 our breathing system is complicated we breathe in different ways when we are asleep running singing or swimming the only thing all forms of breathing have in common is that when we inhale air enters the lungs and when we exhale it is expelled because the entire system is so constructed as to increase the volume of the lungs for breathing in and to reduce it for breathing out this increase in volume can be produced by a movement of the chest in front behind or at the sides or by an up and down movement of the diaphragm in general only a part of this system is used and that not to its fullest extent all the possible forms of breathing are used simultaneously when breathing must be speeded up as after rapid and prolonged running
7218529 my approach to music is expressed as song and wind this is very important to communicate a musical message to the audience this approach is one of simplicity as the structure and function of the human being is very complex but we function in a simple manner when we bring it to the art form it becomes very simple song to me involves about 85 percent of the intellectual concentration of playing and instrument based on what you want the audience to hear the lips cannot vibrate without wind when we combine song and wind the musical message song is the principal element comprising 85 percent of the consciousness the remaining 15 percent is the application of the breath wind to fuel the vibration of the lips
7218530 the human skeleton is so constructed that it is almost impossible to organize breathing properly without also satisfactorily placing the skeleton with respect to gravity the reorganization of breathing alone succeeds only to the degree that we succeed indirectly in improving the organization of the skeletal muscles for better standing and better movement
7218531 yes thats nice but what does that have to do with me im a singer or wind player and i need to keep my throat as open as possible and certainly not move my larynx around
7218532 maar dit verhaal zet je toch wel aan het denken h ik weet niet hoe ik zou reageren als mijn beste vriend zou doodgaan daar ben ik nou de hele tijd mee bezig in mijn hoofd
7218533 ive been playing with my larynx all night and started to wonder whether i could do any damage
7218534 and the first thing i run across is a feldenkrais blog discussing the larynx and didgeridoo playing which i recently became interested because there has been a study connecting it with benefits for sleep apnea sufferers of which i am one
7218535 i think it would be wonderful if you expand these ideas into an atm
7218536 it would be a lesson with applications wider than the playing of an instrument for it might connect to the heart of peoples ability to express themselves to the feeling of thought and emotion being translated into sound to being given voice

7218559 when i have shopped for situations like babies or weddings for gay friends i have good luck in quirky stores
7218560 but if you are just in a generic store the bride and groom symbol or words are in most cards
7218561 it becomes difficult to find some that are neutral but have some style
7218562 the fact that you have someone like hallmark going into that niche shows its growing and signals a trend
7218563 no he fucking wouldnt you failed coach git get down on your knees every night and thank god that malcolm blight being on a commercial network is the only thing keeping you from being the worst commentator in the game

7218565 i want to get drug tested over and over again
7218566 obviously its inconvenient but i tell you what its inconvenient if people affect you by cheating
7218567 i think about the 99 9 per cent of athletes that are clean so we have to make sure that we keep the playing field level im very happy with the many tests that were taken before and during the games
7218568 we are telling the cheats there wont be a possibility to cheat anymore
7218569 i love kayaking and i love racing but i like winning more
7218570 im proud of myself because of the stress and the pressure ive been dealing with over the past 24 hours theres been a lot of doubt in my mind and thats something ive never dealt with before so its a little victory for me
7218571 i tried to sleep a lot which i didnt i ended up tossing and turning a lot i didnt know what else to do
7218572 i turned on the computer and decided i didnt want to read emails i probably had four or five cold showers i tried to read but i wasnt interested in what kurt vonnegut had to say usually i eat it up
7218573 im used to finishing on top and im lucky to have that distinction its a bit much to ask that i do it every single time but thats what i want
7218574 the mounting pressure for the past six months knowing i was a potential double gold medallist knowing id won a lot of races until now but they dont really matter once you get here because its this one that counts that put a lot of pressure on me
7218575 i didnt have it when i needed it its just sports
7218576 i dont take anything for granted i didnt walk here thinking i had two medals in the bag no problem you cant its sports
7218577 ive been a front racer a lot of great races where i go flat out and i last to the line and everybody says man youve got a pace that none of us can hold that doesnt happen in the big races
7218578 bekele usually likes to be the hunter now hes the hunted

7218594 not in compliance with the ceasefire and that they need to come into compliance now
7218595 honestly they should make guys with three years and under show up for two or three weeks but after youre a vested guy you could show up later
7218596 i dont need to play more than two preseason games at this point in my career
7218597 that would make everybody happy and we wouldnt have to play four games
7218598 i wouldnt want to take too much time away from the rookies and young guys who need a chance to show what theyve got
7218599 but youve got to balance that with a 20 game season before you get to the playoffs and thats a lot to ask of the big fellas in the line and even the receivers thats a lot on their legs
7218600 honestly i think we push it as far as we can already
7218601 theres a point of diminishing returns physically sixteen games is already a really long season
7218602 theres nothing much we can do about it it can be a pain for the veterans but its something we have to do to get focused and prepared and its something that lets the young guys show what they can do
7218603 i do think its important for coaches to protect the guys they know are going to be in there in the regular season and at the same time get a look at the young guys when youre trying to find that diamond in the rough
7218604 that sounds really good to me im behind that all the way
7218605 all the ills of the world or hasten political change
7218606 it has been a long journey since our decision in july 2001 to bring the olympic games to china but there can now be no doubt that we made the right choice ioc president jacques rogge said on the final day of the olympics
7218607 we are first and foremost an organization devoted to sport but it is sport with a purpose rogge said
7218608 the ioc and the olympic games cannot force changes on sovereign nations or solve all the ills of the world but we can and we do contribute to positive change through sport
7218609 the world has learned about china and china has learned about the world and i believe this is something that will have positive effects for the long term rogge said
7218610 some of the changes in china are obvious today he said
7218611 others will become apparent with time the legacy of these games for china is ultimately up to the chinese people
7218612 it is clear that china has put the bar very high he said at a news conference
7218613 so its going to be a challenge for london and all the subsequent games i believe and my hope will be london can even put the bar higher
7218614 perfect for media access to the internet during the games and expressed surprise that no citizen protest permits had been granted
7218615 we found it unusual that none of these applications have come through rogge said adding the ioc was told the cases had been resolved through
7218616 we heard about these cases and we discussed them with bocog rogge said referring to the local olympic organizing committee
7218617 the reply we received from the chinese authorities this was an application of chinese law the international olympic committee is not a sovereign organization we have to respect chinese law
7218618 yes of course i have been criticized for various issues said rogge who has been accused of being out of touch
7218619 the bolt issue i mean i take it with a big smile
7218620 i said that he was the icon of the games together with michael phelps i have great respect for his abilities i thought that and i repeat what i said he should show more respect for his opponents but ive also said in the same way he was a young man of 22 and that he has time to mature
7218621 what moved me most is the attitude of this man rogge said
7218622 the positive attitude to say this is a big failure i take responsibility but ill come back and i will win gold i think this is the true spirit of the olympic games
7218623 there are issues london will not be able to equal rogge said
7218624 it is clear that the ability to bring in hundreds of thousands of volunteers in the different sites is something that number wise is not going to be easy for london
7218625 brought in the values of fair play and other values so i think that is the identity that has to be built around london london is also a very cosmopolitan city multiethnic multicultural multi religious so this is something you can also use as an asset
7218626 im not the guy no one believed him just as no one believed him when he said of the vice presidential slot last year
7218627 in the aftermath i had to remake my health my reputation and my career in the senate
7218628 hed already had a lot of bad things in life happen to him
7218629 china drew 2 2 with australia last night and pipped their opponents to qualify for the womens field hockey semifinals
7218630 its a classic strategy of balancing the ticket picking a running mate who is strong where youre not strong
7218631 people who were probably leaning toward obama but were a little nervous this makes them more comfortable
7218632 but the people who were skeptical about obama or uncertain i dont think thats enough to budge them off where they are
7218633 theres only three things he mentions in a sentence a noun and a verb and 9 11
7218634 the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7218635 out of all of the offers i had i chose these three schools
7218636 id say these schools recruited me the hardest they all had great facilities and great coaches any place i would have picked would have been a great fit for me
7218637 but the school i chose probably recruited me the hardest and wanted me the most and i think its the best fit for me im going to be a hawkeye
7218638 ive questioned his sanity wisdom intelligence but i understand totally too
7218639 he wants to coach its a sickness thats hard to cure
7218640 the guy who loves this story the most is rick neuheisel
7218641 there shouldve been no complaints i had a great job and i was making good money
7218642 i spent plenty of nights kicking myself wondering why i left coach ferentz why i left the university of iowa
7218643 here i am im supposed to be coaching football and everybody would think i was crazy if i tried to move back there already within a year i didnt know what to do and you can get pretty hard on yourself to the point of walking into a guys press conference
7218644 i drag my buddy around this campus for two and a half hours
7218645 its ridiculous he thinks im nuts i dont know where the football office is were walking all over the medical plaza the liberal arts area up and down bruin walk finally i see some reporters walk out of the hall of fame building and i stop them
7218646 he just kind of hung around and hung around and hung around and there were a lot of ucla folks there who were well wishers
7218647 i said hello to him like i was saying hello to everybody he said coach do you have a minute i said sure what do you need i thought he wanted an autograph
7218648 i ended up waiting for four hours on his couch
7218649 i thought that would be the end of it and that way im not telling him no and he goes away seeing if he wants to do it
7218650 he became a jack of all trades and became extremely valuable to us ive got a lot of good young people but theres not anybody whos more reliable
7218651 hell make a great coach theres no question in my mind

7218665 substantial gains could be realized from consolidating the many ftas into a single region wide one
7218666 governments need to connect the poor to the thriving regional economy by eliminating labor market barriers investing in workers capabilities and building infrastructure to connect disadvantaged regions with economic centers

7218679 de overheid schroomt niet om het leven van zogenoemde klokkenluiders die misstanden aan de kaak stellen te verwoesten en stelselmatig hun rechten te schenden de kwestie spijkers staat niet op zich
7218680 we kennen vele andere zaken waar min of meer hetzelfde is gebeurd de huidige wetten en procedures vormen kennelijk onvoldoende waarborg tegen dit verwerpelijke gedrag
7218681 ministers staatssecretarissen hoge ambtenaren rechters en zelfs de nationale ombudsman negeren rechtsstatelijke beginselen en procedures als hun dat uitkomt ze doen dat om hun eigen hachje te redden of de vermeende belangen van hun ministerie of van hun politieke partij te beschermen
7218682 dat burgers door hun eigen overheid op een dergelijke wijze worden bedreigd is buitengewoon ernstig
7218683 zeker als dat juist die burgers overkomt die met ongewone burgermoed de rechtsstaat proberen te beschermen tegen een overheid die onrecht begaat
7218684 uitzonderlijk maar we herinneren ons ook de zaak timmerman en deze dagen de kwestie van de ambtenaar van het ministerie van justitie die misstanden op zijn departement aan het licht bracht justitie stelde hem op non actief en maakt hem inmiddels vijf jaar lang het leven en de uitoefening van zijn rechten onmogelijk en in het laatste geval negeert justitie daarbij zelfs een uitspraak van de rechter

7218688 theres nothing like being able to cast that vote as a delegate on the floor and be a part of history
7218689 i was born with this right but until 1965 the right was not there
7218690 its history to me just to be involved in the process but major history to be a woman and black and be a part of this process
7218691 it sort of tells me youve worked hard and now you can see that the country is changing because millions and millions of people are working hard or have worked hard to see something happen in these united states
7218692 i like to see the involvement of the 18 to 30 year olds in the democratic process
7218693 i love it this is a revolution this is a revolution and i think a lot of it i think people snicker but its divine intervention god is putting us together to help each other
7218694 im supposed to vote however hillary clinton wants me to vote right now i have in my mind no other alternative unless she releases us to vote for someone else
7218695 i fully expect her to give us guidance at that point
7218696 we have to get everyone behind the same candidate and the same causes that hillary and obama have shared through this process
7218697 they have so much more in common than differences weve had so much apathy across the country because people have lost hope in politicians theyve been let down by their so called leaders and i think barack obama has so much support because people are hoping again
7218698 its about having a voice in what you believe in
7218699 and give them a sense of security that he can solve the problem while also allowing people to feel secure about their jobs
7218700 the two main issues for me are healthcare and education
7218701 i can only speak from what happens in the 7th congressional district i just see so many people in desperate need right now with the rising costs of health care i know what its like for a family of four just to pay health care
7218702 it starts at 7 30 a m in the morning and i was told be prepared to stay up past 11
7218703 i get to meet maybe the first black president of the united states i get to hear dynamic speakers im a social scientist ive always been fascinated by history and the political process and to get to be a part of that its a dream come true
7218704 this choice of biden is disappointing because he is the creator of the idea of dividing iraq
7218705 we rejected his proposal when he announced it and we still reject it
7218706 i want this to be the norm so everyone knows what we can do
7218707 the tax payers have a right to know whos trying to influence their legislators

7218709 the only thing missing was a skilled family physician to conduct the detailed physical
7218710 in some cases we have the same technology and in many cases we ended up having a little better technology
7218711 so we decided to put that to good use and try to set up our own program
7218712 ill tell you that comparing this program ill never go back to dallas
7218713 im not worried about being inconvenienced im worried about my childrens safety
7218714 how long have they been having bus routes fifty or 60 years i dont understand why every year you have to reinvent the wheel
7218715 im the first one to say that i made a mistake and im responsible for this fiasco because i voted for it
7218716 ive heard complaints from a handful of constituents but ive also had calls from people in the health care profession complaining
7218717 the medical professionals who have come to me are accusing the university of dumping patients on its neighboring institutions whether its being implemented in the way thats in the best interest of the patient i cant tell you
7218718 the services we provide except wellness will be housed in this unit
7218719 we can do things like provide wigs and scarves prostheses and nutritional supplements weve also set it up with a laptop and printer so that if someone has a particular type of cancer the personnel in the unit can look up information and print it out for them right there
7218720 we have negotiated with hospitals and doctors offices in those areas for parking space
7218721 we wanted to put it where it would be easily accessible for patients
7218722 during the day i used to go and visit the classrooms and i would get them to like me by singing a funny song and after that i would teach them a prayer
7218723 one of the things theyve given the little ones had no idea what a sister was what a nun was
7218724 this gave the teachers an opportunity to teach them about the work the sisters do
7218725 everything was in such an uproar and to come into a place that looked so beautiful and so full of peace was a wonderful gift to them
7218726 i told them theres good news and theres bad news
7218727 the good news is youre in a beautiful home and the bad news is we have to go to lacombe today because hurricane rita is coming
7218728 we ate lunch and i had a connection with the state police and he said if you can keep going to lacombe bring them there
7218729 we had lost one sister before the storm and 11 others after the storm
7218730 i think it was all that movement i dont think its good for us in our older ages
7218731 don and i have served together in congress for many years and i consider him a friend
7218732 don has been an outspoken voice against environmental extremists over the years and has strongly opposed the types of federal regulatory overreach advocated in the name of environmentalism

7218767 no you are not toast pick up that stone in front of you and bash the head of the chief
7218768 there is a big difference between being anti american and being critical of the united states
7218769 the fundamental role of anti americanism in europe in general and particularly among those on the left is to absolve themselves of their own moral failings and intellectual errors by heaping them onto the monster scapegoat the united states of america the u s is charged with all the evils real or imagined that afflict humanity from the falling price of beef in france to aids in africa and global warming everywhere the result is a widespread refusal to accept responsibility for ones own actions
7218770 anti americanism is hypocrisy at its finest you can spend your evening catching the latest episode of
7218771 it all boils down to the fact that knowledge and intelligence are two different issues rote memorization of world capitals does not equate intelligence
7218772 as an american please allow me to begin by asserting that our nation has had its strengths and its weaknesses its successes and its failures and its justices and injustices throughout history and continuing into the present although i sense much patriotism for my homeland i recognize our need for humility to understand that our country is not above questioning or reproach but is rather under the same standards as all other nations of the world i would simply like to ask those who view our country from afar to maintain a balanced perspective and realize too that there exists good and bad in america both in terms of its domestic society and politics as well as in its relations with other nations whilst there may be growing anti americanism in the united kingdom i do not believe such sentiment to be reciprocated on our side of the atlantic i viewed a recent survey that indicated most americans view england positively and never have i seen the flag of your country or any other foreign land for that matter burned in the streets of our cities clearly we as american citizens have not meant to be your enemies
7218773 as someone who takes human rights seriously im appalled by the lack of sympathy the left feels toward the victims of any regime other than the bush administration lets shout it to prisoners everywhere if youre not harmed by an american your suffering doesnt count
7218774 ambivalence antipathy and resentment toward and about the united states have comprised an important component of european culture since the american revolution at the latest thus way before america became the worlds mr big the proverbial eight hundred pound gorilla and a credible rival to europes main powers particularly britain and france while the politics style and discourse of the bush administration and of george w bush as a person have undoubtedly exacerbated anti american sentiment among europeans and fostered a heretofore unmatched degree of unity between elite and mass opinion in europe they are not cause indeed a change to a center left administration in washington led by a democratic president would not bring about its abatement let alone disappearance
7218775 is euro disney land a threat to the french culture if french culture can be squashed by mickey mouse or more exactly by simply moving mickey geographically it would have to be disturbingly fragile
7218776 anti americanism is the only face of xenophobia still broadly accepted in europe
7218777 americans find themselves damned either way if they remain within their own borders they are isolationist hicks who are shirking their responsibilities if they intervene they are rapacious imperialists
7218778 the british find it very difficult to come to terms with the loss of their global dominance we felt a deep sense of hurt and loss we used to run the world and we dont anymore so in order to palliate that insecurity we tend to run ourselves down too much and were also snooty about the people who do run the world
7218779 it is tragic that anti american ideas are so easily passed through rumour while reconciliatory ideas and notions must be backed up with catalogues of evidence before they are even considered purely because of the fact that it is so much easier to hate than to keep an objective open mind
7218780 other common anti american objections are ignorance and stupidity in dealing with these two i have no reason to suspect that the average american is any less intelligent than the average person from anywhere else one trait i have noticed is that other cultures are generally much more ashamed of any deficit in the intellect of the individual especially ours the british and as such will make a much greater attempt to hide it if all cultures bar one are scared of looking stupid and take action to prevent that happening then that one remaining culture is inevitably going to be lumbered with that image
7218781 we became not a melting pot but a beautiful mosaic different people different beliefs different yearnings different hopes different dreams
7218782 most of the anti americanism these days stems from plain old nationalistic jealousy by a lot of countries that are born of insecurity about their own place in the world and their painful self awareness of their own failings and shortcomings like the kids in the next block who are jealous of the boy who has a better bicycle or a newer fancier skateboard phuque em all
7218783 europeans like the rest of the world hate america and americans but love our aid when in distress and our soldiers to die for their countries you need to work live and pay taxes from this side of the atlantic to understand our vision of europe and the rest of the world
7218784 unjustified hatred of americans there is much unjustified hatred in the world there is unjustified hatred of the usa much of this arises from the victimisation complex that sweeps much of mankind whoever is in charge whoever is powerful or successful will also be hated this immature hatred often evaporates quickly with a little reason or thought there are some some invalid unjustified criticisms the most widespread hate is the hate by people the world over who fall victim to their own shortcomings and want a scapegoat
7218785 usa citizens are not given world news in the same way as most the other developed nations
7218786 despite the usas dominance of mass media it is frequently only the pro usa self congratulatory messages that seem to arrive in europe the usa citizens criticism and disbelief of their own government is not apparent which gives the overall impression that americans are either gullible ignorant or honestly uncaring
7218787 if a person outside of american culture is a hateful person they may actively hate and verbally attack america
7218788 i think it is best when faced with people from other nations to treat them as individuals
7218789 sometimes the caliber of a nation is found not in why it is liked but rather in why it is not
7218790 everyone is in favor of free speech hardly a day passes without its being extolled but some peoples idea of it is that they are free to say what they like but if anyone says anything back that is an outrage
7218791 with a military that has become a laughing stock and her increasing irrelevance in the world around her i believe that the canada i know and loved is gone
7218792 i think i probably have a much higher iq than you do

7218801 its not something we are proud of that happened but its a fact
7218802 it has become a mystery that enthralls people and to that extent id love to see businesses here take advantage of that
7218803 about 600 000 tourists come to salem looking for the dark side of history
7218804 the majority of the people that are walking past our door have no idea even what state the borden murders took place much less what city
7218805 by us explaining to them the place that the murders happened is only 80 miles south of here its going to drive traffic to fall river
7218806 uniquely suited to be my partner as we work to put our country back on track
7218807 joe biden is what so many others pretend to be a statesman with sound judgment who doesnt have to hide behind bluster to keep america strong
7218808 joe wont just make a good vice president he will make a great one
7218809 i say with every fiber in my being we cannot stand four more years of this
7218810 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
7218811 i think he can be ready but right now i dont believe he is the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7218812 if it were a race between sen mccain and sen biden it would be a very different race
7218813 for obama supporters this is like finding out from your neighbor instead of your sister that shes engaged not how you want or expect the news to be delivered
7218814 we have seen some text campaigns in the many hundreds of thousands of opt in mobile users over the past couple years all in the consumer products services realm
7218815 this is the first massive effort in the political world
7218816 i doubt well see any flooding out here the wind is starting to sting a little but thats about it
7218817 this wont be much at all if a storm doesnt have a category in front of it it doesnt worry us much
7218818 he makes you feel like he knows you and remembers you
7218819 our position should be seriously improved in terms of benefits for the state especially for the city
7218820 hes a very nice guy and talks to everybody its a privilege for us in delaware to have joe biden for vice president
7218821 congrats sen biden thanks for putting de on the map
7218822 hes just so down to earth and im really glad he got a chance to be somebody
7218823 i think we vote our three electoral votes with pride but i dont think it decides any elections
7218824 joe is extremely effective on issues like the economy children and families and crime
7218825 his selection will prove to be a wise choice for the world our country and our wonderful state of delaware
7218826 medicine is scarce and there is only one doctor and a few nurses that shows how we are unable to cope
7218827 the principal goal of the legislation which we are totally supportive of is transparency
7218828 but then it made a turn as if the wing dropped abruptly
7218829 we were still very low very close to the ground
7218830 im here for the cops and the firefighters the teachers and the line workers folks whose lives are the measure of whether the american dream endures
7218831 telling the truth is more important than making you feel good
7218832 hes so qualified so impressive too bad he cant win maybe he should be secretary of state
7218833 joes out there hugging and kissing people he just keeps going
7218834 you know the american people could care less about whats going on up here
7218835 the first mainstream african american presidential candidate who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7218836 you cannot go to a 7 eleven or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent
7218837 im a seasoned guy and i really feel completely at ease
7218838 so where can i really see xahs writings that demonstrate its quality with respect to conventional english standard
7218839 the discontinuous groups of rotation and translation in the plane
7218840 so where can i really see xahs writings that demonstrate its quality with respect to conventional english standard
7218841 the discontinuous groups of rotation and translation in the plane
7218842 i didnt have time to react i wasnt even able to hit my brakes or anything what stopped the forward motion of the car is that i ran into a big bear
7218843 we are trying to get individuals to become more aware of their health
7218844 im big and beautiful and doing my best to keep my stress levels down so i can stay healthy
7218845 thats big not lazy not a glutton and certainly not deserving of the pompous poisonous disrespect served up daily to those of us with more bounce to the ounce
7218846 biden owes his selection to russian prime minister vladimir putin
7218847 russias invasion of georgia reinforced the american worry about international tensions
7218848 vladimir putins contribution to american politics he is a necessary antidote to the obama lack of worldly wisdom which before georgia was a bit academic to most americans
7218849 took the 3 a m call obama needs a pal who can do the same
7218850 basically this is an internal american affair but it is giving us cause for concern because biden was clear in his calls to divide iraq according to sectarian and ethnic lines
7218851 an exceptionally good decision which shows how obama is trying to organize all elements of the democratic party behind him
7218852 lets just say that my previous employment didnt require it o
7218853 so they the sunni fighters deserve our gratitude and the inclusion into the security forces because we adhere to a policy that there are no arms but the arms of the government
7218854 for me this conference is about trying to find out what it means to be an american muslim in terms of political and civic engagement
7218855 im trying to find out what it means to be a political muslim but not the one on the cover of a magazine with a gun
7218856 im trying constantly to figure out how can i be a civically involved muslim interact with other muslims as well as the government while not seeming like a sellout like my allegiance is in one camp or another
7218857 when we go to the pentagon the community goes nuts people are like are you guys becoming the muslim mouthpiece for these agencies
7218858 we are trying to be very transparent but it is important for us to be here there are always people who dont feel like engaging with the government but we feel that is our strategy
7218859 but muslim americans need to continue to advance to learn the importance of civic engagement
7218860 china has opened for the world to learn all about china and china all about the world
7218861 the ioc is extremely pleased with the organisation of the games the athletes were at the centre

7218866 you know this opposing viewpoints guy could have chosen a better way to say these things but if you think about what he is trying to say it actually makes a lot of sense there is actually a small amount of very intelligent logic hiding behind his unpolished presentation
7218867 with the company being external debt free and our ownership clearly demonstrating continuing commitment to the long term

7218872 fiecare restaurant care serveste peste are la parter sau la subsol un spatiu amenajat plin cu acvarii tu te duci si ti alegi ce vrei sa incerci iar apoi trebuie sa i spui unul angajat cum vrei sa maninci ceea ce ai ales fiert la gratar sau la aburi deobicei noi am cerut la gratar dar am incercat si varianta la abur oricum intotdeauna am primit si sos de soia si alte verdeturi linga peste
7218873 din pacate ceea ce nu mi a placut a fost imposibilitatea lor de a intelege ca nu dorim chiar mereu sa mincam iute oricit le ai spune ei tot presara citeva seminte de chili sau alte mirodenii extrem de iuti in special la peste si la fructele de mare
7218874 puiul sau vita condimentate insotite mereu de boluri cu sos de soia si servite alaturi de ciuperci sau legume sotate sau facute la gratar au fost omniprezente pe mesele noastre
7218875 ne a placut foarte mult si modul in care a fost pregatit antricotul de vita pe care l am cerut a venit un chelner la masa a instalat un mic gratar pe baza de carbune incins si a pregatit in fata noastra zecile de feliute taiate
7218876 intr adevar in vreo 3 4 localuri in care am intrat am vazut in meniu supa de ciine la 2 8 euro dar nimeni dintre noi n a vrut sa incerce asa ceva

7218884 why do i smell good stuff when its not even breakfast
7218885 to be able to come here and finish ninth at the olympics is a big step for me
7218886 now im going to hopefully keep carrying that momentum and next time around keep climbing the ladder
7218887 i thought i had a good shot at a medal
7218888 i tried to put myself in it early but i looked at the clock at 5k and i think i was 14 55 actually 14 59 in 30th place seven seconds behind wanjiru i knew that if i kept up that 2 06 pace i wouldnt be finishing probably so i eased off back there and tried to keep my composure
7218889 i actually had to stop just past 30k because my left hamstring seized up
7218890 i took a couple seconds there and tried to ease back into pace for a minute or two and kind of got back onto a reasonable pace
7218891 i was just trying to hang on at that point because the cramps just kept coming i think the only thing that really saved me was i put emergency gels on my last bottle they had a lot of sodium in them if it hadnt been for that i wouldnt have made it in i dont think
7218892 its hard to feel competitive toward your teammate especially when youre running in ninth and 10th place
7218893 for me its all about just doing the best i can it doesnt matter whether dathans in front of me im always going to do the best i can
7218894 im happy for dathan we got two guys in the top 10 in the olympics thats not bad all in all its a pretty solid day for us
7218895 that was the only race i had ever dropped out of still and i carried that with me for four years that was never really an option for me i guess today if i had to sit by the side of the road and drink until i came to life i was going to have to do that i couldnt even think about that again
7218896 obviously finishing third in the world championship and then the last two years all of the talk has been about how the rest of the world has caught up
7218897 how this is the olympics to get the u s this is the olympics to knock them off
7218898 definitely a lot more satisfying coming out and going through the disappointment
7218899 i would have never guessed that i was ever the leading scorer in the gold medal game for the united states
7218900 but i think that shows the unselfishness of our team i think that shows the talent level we have
7218901 i pushed my rear end off to get kara lawson on this team
7218902 there were a lot of people questioning that selection she showed tonight why she belonged on this team for me personally there was big satisfaction in that
7218903 its just been awesome for me to experience this for the fourth time with such a great group
7218904 when you get superstars together the tendency is that at some point the ego has to step in thats what make these great players great
7218905 but this group had an ego only for this team that is something all coaches preach but very few times can you see 12 players act on that this group did that and thats what made them special never has a team of 12 players that i coached been so selfless
7218906 i think there is a lot of pressure i put on myself for this
7218907 and there is just a tremendous amount of satisfaction the last three years there have been a lot of challenges so this is a great way to go out
7218908 my husband and i are not planning on getting a divorce

7218911 im in love its a defenseless love like when i was a primary schooler
7218912 i visited her room to inquire about her injured back
7218913 i didnt wreck anybodys home it was already wrecked when i started going with him
7218914 with three gold medals at beijing the flagbearer was a particularly tough choice
7218915 ultimately it came down to recognising caroline and georginas extraordinary performance at beijing but also taking into account their performance in athens
7218916 jee die jongens kunnen echt niet in de pot richten he het stink echt extreem
7218917 oh nee die geur is kots anoniem 1 heeft erin gekotst
7218918 we nearly took out a pedestrian but apart from that i think unofficially timing confirms that we set a new beijing 100m record

7218921 our study found that the fires in wtc 7 which were uncontrolled but otherwise similar to fires experienced in other tall buildings caused an extraordinary event
7218922 heating of floor beams and girders caused a critical support column to fail initiating a fire induced progressive collapse that brought the building down
7218923 video and photographic evidence combined with detailed show that neither explosives nor fuel oil fires played a role in the collapse of wtc 7
7218924 we did not find any evidence that explosives were used to bring the building down
7218925 this size blast would have produced an incredibly loud sound that was not recorded on videos of the collapse nor reported by witnesses
7218926 collapse was also not due to fires from the substantial amount of diesel fuel stored in the building
7218927 but the crust i dont like so much so i eat the cheese and ham and seafood on top and throw the rest away
7218928 once i let my child eat some pudding that had passed its eat by date

7218946 government believes this country cannot become a middle income country without adequate supply of energy at affordable prices adequate supply of energy could lead to the drastic reduction in the payment for cost of power generated
7218947 it was the hope of government that in the next 4 to 5 years consumers would be able to pay affordable prices for the generation of electricity
7218948 the first power megawatt of energy would have been supplied by the december deadline if gas was supplied for the project the lack of air conditioners and a charge of 0 4 percent for gcnet rates were the other challenges facing the completion of the project way beyond schedule
7218949 200 megawatts of energy would be generated by december this year whiles an additional 360 megawatts was expected to be generated before the end of 2009
7218950 despite the arsenal of international instruments created to combat the exploitation of human beings as well as the growing awareness of forced labour and prostitution of children the disturbing truth is that such fragrant violations continue
7218951 it is up to us now to break those chains and move into the freedom of true and real emancipation
7218952 ghana is collaborating with other agencies to curb all forms of modern slavery like human trafficking forced labour child prostitution and the various conflicts that are emerging within society
7218953 stupid jokes and songs played on a keyboard i got for my 11th birthday
7218954 the questions that you ask when you split up with somebody
7218955 if i can pay it off i can get a newer car a bit sooner its really boring but its normal
7218956 but really its all about rainy nights in november when youre trying to think of new jokes
7218957 i dont know if its going to make that any easier but it might make more people come to see the shows and thats good
7218958 in a really scary pub in newcastle where they were all sat with their arms folded saying come on then woman
7218959 the first half was hard and the second half went really well
7218960 it was things like what if i want kids what if nobody fancies me any more and all these things that most people have probably thought
7218961 even if they werent in a marriage everybodys split up with somebody and had all of these horrible thoughts i answered mine throughout the course of the show
7218962 its about entertaining the audience theyre the people whove paid their money
7218963 if you entertain them youve done your job the fact that i sold out a lot and got good reviews was amazing in itself

7218998 i proved to myself this summer that i can play in the nba and have the skill suited for the nba i think they just want me to develop one more year get more experience and hopefully come back next year
7218999 my agent let me know a couple picks before that houston was going to take me
7219000 that is something i totally agree with and i look to do things like hit open shots make hustle plays and get rebounds
7219001 he is still living the dream even though he didnt have as many opportunities as a first rounder
7219002 thats very common especially when you consider that weve had 700 some people out there
7219003 to end it with an olympic record after everything those guys have been through that shows you they care about representing america
7219004 they wanted to end it with a good dose of good ol american apple pie
7219005 so we used that as motivation we kept our heads high and we ran great
7219006 its a blessing for me to be out on this floor now participating in my fourth olympics and walking away with a fourth gold medal
7219007 weve said from day one that top to bottom we are a deep team
7219008 we just send wave after wave of players at you
7219009 we werent going to be the team to let lisa lose
7219010 you cant shoot less than 40 percent and expect to win gold medals
7219011 the national park service could move ahead with a multistate approach
7219012 cahokia mounds is among the jewels in the states crown of historic sites and we have no intentions of giving it up we feel weve done a tremendous job of monitoring and enhancing the site enhancing the interpretive center and securing additional property to be preserved we have fewer staff than we did 20 years ago but the staff is very dedicated and they do a good job
7219013 i certainly think cahokia mounds is deserving of national and international attention
7219014 i think it should get more attention locally but i dont know if a switch to the federal park system would necessarily solve the problems
7219015 they have a new master management plan theyre looking at ways to bring more people to the park
7219016 the state would need to make such a request and he hasnt heard from anyone
7219017 scrappy kid from scranton turned world class statesman and immediately set him loose on john mccain
7219018 thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about the six term delaware senator told thousands of frenzied supporters referring to the arizona republican senators recently quoted uncertainty about how many houses he owns
7219019 hell have to worry about which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7219020 one of the finest public servants of our time he then went through a biographically detailed outline of bidens life painting him as a man with a humble hard knocks background and sterling foreign policy bona fides
7219021 he has always been a friend to the underdog said obama
7219022 he looked former serbian leader slobodan milosevic in the eye and called him a war criminal joe biden is what so many others pretend to be a statesman video obama biden at old state capitol courtesy lee news service photos sen joe biden
7219023 we cannot as a nation stand four more years of this biden said to enthusiastic cheers from rallygoers who stood for hours in 90 degree heat to witness the unveiling of the ticket
7219024 barack and i come from very different places but we share a common story said biden recounting how obama was raised by a single mother and how both men were poor at times in their childhoods
7219025 the next president before quickly demoting him back to running mate status
7219026 house divided speech obama supporters who first learned of the choice of biden hours earlier through news reports or text messages from the campaign appeared to generally supportive
7219027 biden is the bulldog we need said sharon hoffmann of st louis who traveled to springfield for the event
7219028 biden had a lot of criticism of obama in the primary race noted rallygoer shane mills also of st
7219029 i think thats going to be an easy target for mccain i think obamas got a lot of work to do
7219030 the pension and unused leave are any employees as a matter of right
7219031 i would like to take credit for turning the policies on their head for the benefit of my client but that simply isnt true
7219032 the boards decision regarding severance for former chief mokwa was based solely on the need to bring about a quick resolution that moved the department forward under new leadership
7219033 i dont think any amount of retirement benefits under the law can make up for the sacrifices a member and a members family makes over a 37 and a half year career
7219034 the job especially the job of a chief is not a 40 hour a week job
7219035 they want to go and they cant go without me
7219036 if i learned anything by watching dick gephardt you try to be ever mindful of where you came from and who got you there
7219037 singing from the same sheet of music as opposed to going off in different directions it needs to be glued together with one common cause
7219038 are second or third generation from the old machine pols which is an aspect of illinois politics that obama wants to play down in the national campaign
7219039 theyre attractive theyre hardworking theyre the new face of the democratic party in illinois said mooney
7219040 its a way of highlighting the up and comers they want to get them out there
7219041 blagojevich reminds people of rezko and rezko is somebody the republicans want to connect to obama
7219042 its a single message of support for sen obama and spreading illinois enthusiasm everywhere thats what the whole week is about
7219043 in the past we focused on vaccinating high risk persons at risk of getting pneumonia or dying when they got flu and that wasnt very effective
7219044 were adding to that the recommendation to vaccinate people who transmit flu and thats primarily school age children
7219045 i think its going to be a few years until pediatricians and public health authorities and possibly school districts figure out how to do this
7219046 last season was an unusual fluke and more often than not the flu vaccine is very effective
7219047 every physician is going to encourage people to get the flu vaccine
7219048 we didnt have computers and video games when i was growing up
7219049 so ive been in that creek catching crawdads and fish just about all my life
7219050 we have paid for our land and the right to live here
7219051 we dont want to pay for the brunt of pollution in cities and towns they should pay to manage their own waste not us
7219052 we are a resource management agency and we have to protect the public
7219053 but we also have to ensure that the requirements and standards that we set are necessary we should not be forcing ratepayers to protect uses that dont exist
7219054 for some reason the department seems to have a greater distrust of the public than they do the dischargers
7219055 a lot of people just dont want to talk to the state about their secret swimming holes and we have to respect their private property rights
7219056 but its not and i dont understand why the state never asked the people who live here about that before
7219057 if anything i think students are more concerned if their roommate doesnt have a facebook page
7219058 then its like oh my gosh whats wrong with them
7219059 so if anyone has a reputation from facebook its me
7219060 the person who was on facebook way too much yeah that was me
7219061 i put myself a bit more on reserve because i didnt want to be the loser from facebook
7219062 its kind of weird because people were already starting to get reputations before they even set foot on campus which i just dont think is healthy
7219063 facebook is dangerous because people only see what you want them to see they have their best pictures up you judge them based on their favorite tv shows and movies but thats not who the person is
7219064 we are going to have all of the time in the world to get to know each other
7219065 canadians are also much better at paying off their balances than those in the u k 56 per cent australia 47 per cent or the u s 44 per cent
7219066 its important to note that the major banks are very rigid with their interest rates
7219067 as long as p e private equity is out of the game and strategics cant get their stocks to stay steady long enough to value deals and as long as the financial institutions are having difficulties of their own its hard to get money to get deals done
7219068 there are a lot of talks going on but nothing is really getting done
7219069 everyone wants to talk right now but you wont see anyone doing anything for a while
7219070 last year we were just hitting the edge of the credit crunch and we were still doing a lot of m amp a deals and we were doing capital raising deals
7219071 this year its almost all capital raising deals and looking at failed banks and failed bank assets
7219072 there is not much m amp a i have been very busy this year generally capital raising and fire fighting
7219073 that are less directly affected by credit conditions businesses that are more service oriented and less balance sheet oriented

7219239 im truly and deeply saddened it had to go this way
7219240 the really sad piece of this is whats important in life is friends and family
7219241 the only comment i can make is its a family matter its a tragic family matter
7219242 i think i understand accounting im on five public audit committee boards im the chairman of two ive been the chairman of the audit committee of probably the second largest financial institution in the country
7219243 he and a set of his colleagues were going to leave fairchild and start another company and wanted me to participate in this activity if id invest and come on the board and be a colleague of his
7219244 after a conference that the government ordered or orchestrated national security agency on how to build a very fast machine
7219245 as long as ive got the capacity to do it
7219246 shock i had no idea he had that much money
7219247 the evidence indicates both guzy parents ignored the existence of the childrens trusts and the terms of the 1977 agreement
7219248 almost without exception i find these defendants to be honestly amazed at the seriousness of their conduct as far as the system is concerned
7219249 many of the defendants have no previous criminal history and have been productive members of the community and often there are complex psychological reasons why they are interested in child pornography
7219250 the images themselves are truly horrible even passive viewers of such material help to make its production profitable
7219251 the practical effect of possessing child pornography is to stimulate the market in child pornography which encourages things such as child torture and rape
7219252 and i didnt look at them or dwell on them very much
7219253 what we know is very limited to a very skewed sample because these are just the guys who get caught
7219254 as a prosecutor i dont really need to know why
7219255 for every one of these people we take down were intervening in preventing child abuse
7219256 the elements are very easy for the government to prove
7219257 there is nothing about prosecuting the bernie wards of the world that is going to stop the east european exploiters from marketing this stuff
7219258 kuba or hunchback a lot of times by playmates when i was young and by somebody who truly hates me before they bruised my ego big time
7219259 its important to establish a need for middle eastern gaming policy product improvement for consumers
7219260 we hedged our bets on lowd antenor incs release today and all indications point to big profits for our share holders
7219261 i also think expanded european operations will help share holders pocket books as well there is less competition in europe among the various middle eastern gaming policy companies so higher prices can be charged team this with the strong euro and youve got instant profits
7219262 with the pomp and circumstance of palasik scrudato inc touting its new brand
7219263 it only means good things for the middle eastern gaming policy market
7219264 we made a big mistake five years ago when we allowed an important researcher at our firm to moonlight at delisa hyder corporation
7219265 the result was a catatrophe for our middle eastern gaming policy marketing efforts and ruined our numbers for the year
7219266 but also want to assure the general public that the government will be looking out for their well being with consistent and independent middle eastern gaming policy product reviews and panels
7219267 look everyone knows that eboni ibarra inc contributed to our partys campaigns last year this is not news remember however that we have a duty to our constituents our voters to protect them from corporate malpractice and shoddy workmanship
7219268 wildeman lovorn our vp of international marketing will be kubic purtle incs choice to run the campaign in europe
7219269 and were certainly going to see some great things past campaigns have been a bit laksydaisical but now with new demographic research and data were ready to move forward with giant steps
7219270 weve still got a few tricks up our sleaves that will stun the industry so be on the look out for big things from finau hodgman inc within the next few months
7219271 this new middle eastern gaming policy product will revolutionize the way consumers live at home
7219272 and furthermore with parcel glatz incs golden guarantee warranty youre assured top quality reliable performance and help with any repairs

7219297 people want anwar to be in parliament and then become the prime minister
7219298 it does not matter to me whether he wins or loses as far as i am concerned i have my government to look after whatever the opposition members want to do that is up to them

7219302 but with the london games in 2012 it would be crazy to go this is the greatest job in the world
7219303 theyd say you cant do anything more with the british team why dont you come and do something else itll be exciting weve got a big budget we are a big country
7219304 but the worst job would be to lead a foreign team in that olympics i dont think i could stomach that really national pride would not allow me to do it no matter what somebody paid me
7219305 we have to look at whats happening in the rest of the world a number of national organising committees including the usa and australia do reward their medallists with cash bonuses
7219306 british cycling have to get the full financial package necessary to continue top deliver medals and keep people of brailsfords quality otherwise we will lose him and we will lose other top coaches

7219316 it was gerrard who showed the winning mentality he has done that so many times from a similar position
7219317 many other players would have put it high over the bar but you know gerrard will hit the target
7219318 i was very pleased with the first 15 minutes or so we created a lot of chances and could have scored a couple
7219319 but after that we did not play well and we allowed them to control our attacks they did not create too much themselves but it was not a good performance from our team
7219320 last season we drew far too many games at anfield but this time we have sent out a message that in such situations we can win the game we have winners here
7219321 that was hard to take the players are heartbroken in the dressing room we deserved more we certainly deserved a point we produced a disciplined performance and the two matches we have played so far have given me plenty of confidence
7219322 we beat spurs last weekend and now we have very nearly beaten a side who can win the title
7219323 their equaliser was a freak and we should have been able to see out the game even at 1 1 but i have told them that they can leave anfield with their heads high
7219324 no not at all players have been away on international duty and the performance wasnt the best
7219325 ive been a player and ive been away with england many times and it is hard to get going again
7219326 i had about an hour with my players on friday and i think it showed in the second half we played into hulls hands
7219327 well not get carried away because its only two games
7219328 but it was one of those games where paul ince was on a high after the result last weekend it was his first home game hes just signed santa cruz on a new contract so there was a little bit of momentum with blackburn and it was important we got something
7219329 we could have gone on to win the game and whether that would have been fair or unfair doesnt matter we could have won it
7219330 im ecstatic with a point to tell you the truth its a great point on our travels and if we continue with that kind of passion drive commitment togetherness well be okay this year
7219331 stupid jokes and songs played on a keyboard i got for my 11th birthday
7219332 the questions that you ask when you split up with somebody
7219333 if i can pay it off i can get a newer car a bit sooner its really boring but its normal
7219334 but really its all about rainy nights in november when youre trying to think of new jokes
7219335 i dont know if its going to make that any easier but it might make more people come to see the shows and thats good
7219336 in a really scary pub in newcastle where they were all sat with their arms folded saying come on then woman
7219337 the first half was hard and the second half went really well
7219338 it was things like what if i want kids what if nobody fancies me any more and all these things that most people have probably thought
7219339 even if they werent in a marriage everybodys split up with somebody and had all of these horrible thoughts i answered mine throughout the course of the show
7219340 its about entertaining the audience theyre the people whove paid their money
7219341 if you entertain them youve done your job the fact that i sold out a lot and got good reviews was amazing in itself

7219387 die olympischen spiele in peking waren f r adidas ein riesiger erfolg sowohl in china als auch weltweit
7219388 was markenpr senz w hrend der olympischen spiele angeht so waren wir in allen sportarten eindeutig die f hrende marke wir haben erstklassigen service und attraktive produkte geboten die speziell f r peking entwickelt wurden auch in der kommunikation haben wir durch unsere kampagne together in 2008 impossible is nothing akzente gesetzt sie hat beim cannes festival den ersten goldenen l wen f r china gewonnen somit haben uns die olympischen spiele in peking einen gro en schritt voran gebracht in unserer mission die f hrende sportmarke der welt zu werden
7219389 wir haben bereits die uefa euro 2008tm in sterreich und der schweiz genutzt um unsere f hrende position im fu ball weiter auszubauen und jetzt haben wir bei den olympischen spielen erneut gezeigt dass die marke adidas das herzst ck des sports ist durch die plattform der olympischen spiele 2008 in peking hat adidas hinsichtlich umsatz marktanteil und wahrnehmung der marke in china die marktf hrerschaft bernommen
7219390 unsere olympische reise geht weiter wir haben bereits mit den vorbereitungen f r die olympischen spiele 2012 in london begonnen wo adidas erneut official sportswear partner sein wird
7219391 wir sind auf dem besten weg unser ziel f r den konzernumsatz in china von mehr als 1 milliarde eur bis 2010 zu erreichen
7219392 die erfolgreichen olympischen spiele in peking hinterlassen ein verm chtnis f r den sport in china und f r alle marken unseres konzerns daher bin ich berzeugt dass wir in den kommenden jahren weiterhin dynamisches wachstum in diesem markt verzeichnen werden

7219419 we expect american online gaming economy survey results to be slightly different than those of europe
7219420 but in general there should be some important commonalities between both groups
7219421 weve seen some very interesting commonalities across cultures ethnicities and various different societies online gaming economy survey takers were very considerate in their answers and this helped us greatly to further tune our hypotheses in the end well have a great set of data to analyze and study for the future as we continue to review how online gaming economy factors work in society
7219422 i was impressed with the publics awareness of online gaming economy trends in their daily lives ive been studying them for months now and some surveyees raised questions that i couldnt readily answer in those cases i referred them to write their comments down and submit them to our directors for further review
7219423 i chose not to answer that question because it had nothing to do with the study of online gaming economy and everything to do with my personal finances as a result i did not qualify for a compensatory gift but that is fine privacy is important even if were collecting data for academic purposes
7219424 and 50 cash is a nice gift i also added my name to the online gaming economy studys contact list for future surveys interviews and any public discussions its a very interesting and important topic
7219425 im very excited about tallying the data from this important online gaming economy survey
7219426 this is the first time weve asked for public participation in our scientific research and were absolutely flattered and grateful by the turn out i expect preliminary results will be tabulated by next month at which point well release general findings about important online gaming economy trends in this society to the local media
7219427 for those surveyees that took part in all three of the online gaming economy survey sections we offered three different forms of compensation a cash gift of 50 gift certificate to a local restaurant or a gift card for the upcoming holiday season at the local mall
7219428 i loved the opportunity to meet and greet the online gaming economy survey takers and speak to them one on one i want to get the most accurate and colorful data possible for my work also i want to get personal ideas and view points that will offer some important perspective about the level of online gaming economy integration in our society
7219429 the little school that could that was the last team standing as athens defeated harper creek in the finals to win the gold division
7219430 we knew if we were going to be successful we were going to have to get by st philip
7219431 both teams played good and it took a lot out of us so against harper creek it was who could survive the most and this is the little team that could and they played awfully good volleyball today
7219432 we have a team thats composed mainly of seniors that have been playing varsity for three years and this is the year where were looking for everything to come together
7219433 it was the first tournament of the year so there was a lot of learning growing and learning how to work together and working out some kinks but at the end of the day we just ran out of gas
7219434 as the season progresses and we get ourselves conditioned and ready to go i think well be able to finish the day the way we want to
7219435 it is so hot but ive got my fan going and have been drinking lots of water
7219436 it makes them think a little bit they know they have to work harder
7219437 we were up 22 18 and we let them come back and win and you cant do that against good teams but thats going to come with maturity and as the new kids get more involved
7219438 i think it was lesson learned today and well see how we move on from this
7219439 a lot of girls got some playing time which is nice with 14 girls and we knocked off coldwater which we havent done at pennfield in a long time
7219440 the third year in a row and this is the first year we didnt give it away
7219441 we finally started getting it together a little bit we still have some things we need to work on but we started to move our feet and work together as a team
7219442 it would have been a lot better to be in the silver tournament but winning the bronze is a good thing because we didnt get down even though we lost in pool play we kept our heads together and were able to come out on top
7219443 the winner of the presidential election be forced to choose his opponent as vice president maybe then the republicans and democrats would get along and get something done
7219444 just trying to figure out how to use the prop is a big part of it
7219445 it sounds kind of ridiculous now but the way we planned it out its supposed to be really funny and silly
7219446 our main purpose is to get battle creek out and making films
7219447 we have a lot of talent in this town and we want to highlight that
7219448 we talked about starting a production company and trying to enter different festivals like sundance
7219449 so this competition could be a big boost for morale if we win it
7219450 we entered a film in the very first battle creek film festival it wasnt very good
7219451 it was more like a trial run but it was a good experience
7219452 the economy is the main issue thats what theyre talking about in the neighborhoods
7219453 the rest of the nation is hurting now were in somewhat of a recession but its more than that in michigan its exacerbated here
7219454 if you like what jennifer granholm has done for michigan youre going to love what barack obama is going to do to america
7219455 i think we can explain that to people and theyll understand what we mean
7219456 republicans can try to shift the blame but michigan voters understand that the bush economic policies that john mccain embraces have cost michigan jobs and put our country on the wrong track
7219457 i thought we did pretty well throughout most of the day
7219458 about four of our best players were out from injuries in the offseason
7219459 jen drouin had a good day and mackenzie coldstadt really stepped up for us
7219460 you try to find reasons when sometimes there are no defensible reasons for the awful things that happen or that people do to one another sometimes you just need to let yourself feel not think
7219461 you can say it was a short week you can say what you want but im not that type of guy
7219462 i completely take the burden for his loss i didnt execute and i didnt get in a rhythm to let the team drive down the field
7219463 when i got to daylight i saw receivers blocking and dan was out there
7219464 dan really took two and then i kind of weaved and dove over the top
7219465 thats how the running game is its 2 3 negative 2 nothing then all the sudden the big one hits
7219466 the running game is like that boxing match where a guy keeps hitting a guy in the body and it doesnt look like much early but later on they get tired of getting hit in the body and they let their guard down
7219467 i want to take the legs out of them so they cant rush
7219468 then theyll defend it then we have a chance to use the big guys outside
7219469 if theyre not rooting for the home team what are they doing here
7219470 its expected maybe if i was a lion id be a little disappointed
7219471 some guys will talk about the guys who didnt make the trip and did not play
7219472 but they had guys who did not play as well so you cant use that as an excuse
7219473 i must admit for as tired beaten up and strung out as you look you must be a work horse and dont get me wrong i dont think all of this stuff youve written is good in fact in saying that even 20 percent is good id be giving unwarranted praise but there is a lot of material
7219474 yeah well i just try to shit out as much as i can you know when a champion race horse fucks only one out of a hundred of his or her children become champions
7219475 uh huh so is that why im supposed to support this novel because you are just like a champion race horse did you know my father owned horses and some of them had brilliant careers
7219476 i didnt know that and i was just making an analogy
7219477 yeah i got it but making an analogy between writing and horse racing seems a bit far fetched if you dont mind me saying
7219478 i dont usually make analogies but i have to disagree with you especially when it comes to the novel the router on the track is very equivalent to a novelist both have to save ground and have a closing punch i think
7219479 well we can agree to disagree because i think the book has to be strong at the beginning in order to catch the reader but you do that when you write in the opening chapter her cock was bigger than mine and while i was taken back by a woman with 8 flaccid inches i guessed my liver problems caused me to itch too much to fight and immediately tell her to leave i told her well it to put her clothes back on and to finish the drink as i poured myself a double shot thats good honest writing tricked by a transexual funny shit and a good beginning
7219480 yeah i try to be honest it really did look like a woman
7219481 im sure it did but if your stories are honest it seems you have a habit of getting drunk and making bad decisions frankly it seems you are either a liar with a good sense of how to use dialogue or a drunk who will inevitably get yourself into situations that will make you unreliable
7219482 well then if were going to continue im going to drink and we can converse with myself being in my normal state yes i am a drunk and a liar and while you might not be a drunk im sure you lie as well but its fucking fiction man fiction means you imagine shit and make it seem plausible id bet all i have that you probably are a coke head because thats the drug of choice for you rich boys shit im out after i finish this beer
7219483 thanks for the lesson and i have to admit i do sometimes do cocaine i imagine you should know i know its not a lie that you do your share of drugs and despite what you just said to me alex your writing at times is entertaining and the reason i invited you to come here is that i was hoping to give you a contract but you have to
7219484 no fucker i dont have to do anything when i breath it just happens when i write it just happens if i were to sign with you it becomes a physical process which knowing about people like you means ill have to be involved in lawsuits eventually
7219485 dont let the door hit you on the way out
7219486 athletes heart is a well known consequence of sport practice and has been considered as a kind of physiological adaptation to extreme training
7219487 in het uiterste geval een toeslag van 15 procent maar hoger zeker niet
7219488 you traded the bluesmobile for a microphone okay i can see that
7219489 no look at the truck its half full hes been here for awhile
7219490 she looks like shes out for a run in the park and for her she is
7219491 lanima come un occhio quando si posa su ci cui la verit e lessere risplendono lanima afferra e capisce ed raggiante di intelligenza ma quando si volge verso la penombra di ci che diviene e perisce allora ha solo unopinione poi dunaltra e sembra non aver pi intelligenza ora ci che impartisce verit al fatto conosciuto e il potere di conoscere a chi lo apprende ci che vorrei che vio designaste con lidea del bene e questo giudichereste essere la causa della scienza
7219492 people are born so that they can learn how to live a good life like loving everybody all the time and being nice right
7219493 well dogs already know how to do that so they dont have to stay as long
7219494 an obama biden ticket is a very impressive and strong team
7219495 what is this guy doing with us why is he here
7219496 when the boat sails along the steam you see peach trees on both banks with green grass where hills and the stream seem to end you suddenly find a secret passage which leads to charming pools and paddy fields it is like a dreamland with fairy music drifting in the air from magnificent towers
7219497 passing your embroidery ball to the beloved one may the fragrance of wine intoxicate those who smell it the tender feelings seem to be water poem and song this is the fairyland in the dream this is just the land of peach blossoms which you have expected for a long time
7219498 it sure hasnt sunk in yet this was such a hard fought battle
7219499 i think when that kind of thing happens the guys got a good taste of whats important in life we were crushed by that
7219500 theyre always good theyre fast and theyre tough to beat
7219501 but the character of this group is so persevering they never looked out of the match theyre just grinding and grinding and grinding
7219502 ce correspondant a appeler 4 fois sans laisser de message
7219503 you happy bastards are making me sick please go away
7219504 youre sick you dont want us to sing for you
7219505 you dont seem sick no no no youre not getting out of it that easy youre getting a song whether you want one or not what song do you want us to sing
7219506 if youre really interested in making your relationship work little rituals are a great way to do it
7219507 every marriage has what i call a relationship reservoir or the stored up emotional energy of the relationship
7219508 honey what do you think is the one thing most important to a successful marriage
7219509 it all started one winter night years ago when julie had had a really bad day
7219510 we were huddled under the covers of our bed and julie was describing how all the people who made her day miserable were bad polar bears and how she didnt want any of the bad polar bears coming into the bedroom and how the bed was our refuge from them you realize how embarrassing it is to admit this right anyway thats when we started calling the bed the igloo
7219511 its our little sanctuary only nice things happen in the igloo
7219512 its funny because i always thought that when you lived with somebody youd automatically know everything that was going on
7219513 but we find that if we dont take that time to connect with each other its really easy for life to get in the way the igloo offers one of the few times in the day where theres not a whole heck of a lot else going on so youre able to focus on each other in a deeper way
7219514 but its always a nice way for us to catch up
7219515 hes just my best friend and our marriage is a great partnership and theres no one id rather talk to
7219516 because we know plenty of married couples who fight a lot about how often they have sex the wifes upset because all he ever wants to do is have sex the husbands upset because he doesnt think they have sex enough but this has never really been a problem with us and i think it has a lot do with the fact that were always talking sexy to each other
7219517 were always complimenting each other tossing out fantasies telling each other were hot he gets to feel like he can have sexual feelings and i feel like i dont have to have sex all the time to appear attractive
7219518 lets put it this way the way i see it sex is like chocolate cake after five days of eating chocolate cake even chocolate cake doesnt taste that great
7219519 we are so disgusting this is so pathetic its like a sickness
7219520 look we get a kick out of it because its so ridiculous its our guilty pleasure
7219521 honestly i think we just need to be dumb for a while
7219522 were both very into our careers and when youre at work with any job theres going to be a certain amount of professional stress you like to come home sometimes and for that lousy hour or whatever kick back and relax
7219523 life is serious enough isnt it sometimes you need to do something stupid and if you cant be stupid with your husband who can you be stupid with
7219524 honey dont forget at 7 15 we have our nightly cuddle followed by the affirmation of our vows our 7 35 spontaneous flirtation and then of course a new episode of
7219525 you know that old saying how can i miss you if you dont go away
7219526 doing things separately gives you a chance to fill in the blanks that your partner cant fill in for you for example one of you likes classical music the other one likes sports plus taking a break from each other gives you more things to talk about because when youre joined at the hip whats to talk about youve already seen it all
7219527 as a woman you get this message that when you get married you spend every single waking second with your husband and youre so unbelievably happy
7219528 and my parents actually do spend every single waking second together and oddly enough they are happy
7219529 and yeah they spent every moment together but they spent every moment together at each others throats
7219530 so joe had to convince me that having our own lives was a good idea
7219531 it all brings a freshness to our marriage because we both continue to grow as people
7219532 getting out of the house and out of each others hair keeps us from going crazy
7219533 we have been married for seven years but praying together is something we didnt start doing until about a year ago
7219534 in the past whenever we faced big decisions wed have discussion after discussion about them but wed never really come to a resolution
7219535 i soon found that praying together brings out a real sense of selflessness and humility
7219536 when youre praying for each other not yourself youre focused together and speaking from the heart on a whole different level i would never have predicted this for us but it really works
7219537 as bad as any problem may seem at that moment
7219538 prayer always helps us see beyond it it doesnt have to be a long drawn out scripture reading just a few minutes a day when we pray it brings another level of honesty to our conversations i think its the most intimate thing you can do with another person
7219539 we just join hands and let it rip whether were asking for forgiveness or giving thanks saying it out loud holds a lot of power
7219540 we have considered all possibilities and exhausted all possible rescue scenarios and along with other experts in the field we agree the animals suffering should not be prolonged and advocate for a humane outcome
7219541 it is a good thing that people care about animals but in this case we are asking the community to consider the animals welfare first over their own emotional empathy
7219542 the chances of survival for the calf even with human intervention are extremely low
7219543 this animal is approx 4 5 metres long and will weigh around four tonnes so logistically it will be extremely difficult to transport house feed and rehabilitate
7219544 even if the whale were successfully nursed it will have no life skills it wont know how to communicate or socialise with other whales and it wont know how to migrate to antarctica
7219545 its a tragic end to a programme that dozens of people have put their hearts and souls into
7219546 he heard me singing and came over i looked at him and he was full of life all he needed is a mothers milk
7219547 then they dragged it to a closed tent and all the while they dragged it it was flapping its tail blowing out of its head and moving and trying to get away
7219548 it was so upsetting because euthanasia is meant to be an easy death and that whale did not have an easy death at all
7219549 that was the best way it could have been done
7219550 that was a scene that we witnessed it looked like a scene out of the antarctic with a japanese fishing boat
7219551 we had five minutes and during that time they euthanased poor colin
7219552 the last thing we want is that the whale should suffer
7219553 the vets are saying he hasnt got long to go you should take action
7219554 the animal is suffering shark inflicted injuries is experiencing breathing difficulties and its flukes are hanging down
7219555 some people are very upset and some were very aggressive its a bit harrowing personally
7219556 theyve been calling me the worst names you can imagine including effing murderer which is a bit hard to take ive spent my life working with animals
7219557 but its understandable because theres a lot of community concern it says something about our attitude to the environment
7219558 while its got life its got hope he heard me singing and came over i looked at him and he was full of life he had a few scratches and cuts on him and i was a bit worried about his eyes
7219559 all he needed is a mothers milk there was hope another whale could pick him up and adopt him he could have at least learnt to swim with them and eat krill and plankton
7219560 well do an autposy on the whale to work out what was wrong with it that may have led to its mother abandoning it
7219561 the body will be buried in a known location so it can be accessed if scientists want to analyse the bones for future research
7219562 people have to accept a lot of whale calves will die in the wild and its not pleasant and there is nothing that can be done
7219563 this isnt a cute and cuddly world and people have to think about the reality of wild animals
7219564 i believe the national parks and wildlife service behaved impeccably
7219565 i dont think we should be moving towards doing things to keep animals alive in cruel circumstances just to make us feel good
7219566 hes that unique public servant who is at home in a bar in cedar rapids and the corridors of the capitol in the vfw hall in concord and at the center of an international crisis
7219567 thats because he is still that scrappy kid from scranton who beat the odds the dedicated family man and committed catholic who knows every conductor on that amtrak train to wilmington
7219568 is genuinely a friend of mine ive known john for 35 years
7219569 and during those 18 months i must tell you frankly
7219570 i have been disappointed in my friend john mccain who gave in to the right wing of his party and gave in to the swift boat politics he once so deplored
7219571 thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about
7219572 its a pretty hard experience hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at

7219580 i dont know why i wrote this post it is bad or may be not i am not sure
7219581 well when i came back home another shitty thing happened power went off
7219582 and it is the engineers duty to do everything at the last moment so thinking i had all the time in the world i disregarded the increasingly heavy rain and started to play candle lit carrom with kela
7219583 i went and saw to my horror that there were only girlie umbrellas available but when i searched properly i did find some black umbrellas so i decided to buy it but wait i saw the label and here it was for 667 rupees only well with no time and having more than a goats brain i decided to adjust with a girlie umbrella for a day which was available for 220 rupees i got the umbrella
7219584 thus it should be clear that a torturer is a torturer whatever language he speaks and whatever country he belongs to the driver was talking to people in singular whatever i dont remember the word it was as if he thought he was the lord it was as if he was enjoying the overcrowding of the bus i realized what sadists felt like he was feeling comfortable in his chair looking at the crowded bus i felt what a concentration camp felt like and i for the first time sympathized with the jews borat notwithstanding
7219585 this is the 98956th indian origin author that i have been asked to review please give me a break god damn it
7219586 to reduce such a richly diverse book to a couple of main themes is a disservice for there is much here to reward the careful reader notably two startlingly educative essays on the ancient roots of relations between india and china particularly pleasurable is sir takals masterly reclaiming of rabindranath tagores reputation from the unjust misjudgment of him in the west as a mediocre mystic poet rather than the rationalist and humanist genius and polymath takal convincingly depicts but disservice aside two principal arguments emerge from this collection an affirmation of indias political and cultural heterogeneity and of the reach of reason in indias intellectual traditions
7219587 i think of the glorious tiananmen square days when i read sir takals works
7219588 i so adore takal because he posts his articles mostly at the break of dawn
7219589 pardon me for this infantile indulgence but pray allow me to savour the poetic mastery of sir takal i fear that if i dont quantify it into my already vast intellectual cache i shall miss out on something very special the stuff that mortals are faintly aware of

7219597 what i suspect elicited the tirades by motley rice in the providence journal ap and law com is that they are ripped about not getting all the money they assumed they would nine years ago and now being faced with the prospect of being on the hook for expenses
7219598 i have to think that jack mcconnell fidelma fitzpatrick and the leadership at motley rice didnt have any inkling when they started this litigation that they would have to pay the tab for many of the administrative costs if they lost
7219599 in its brief and in its argument on august 15th in superior court the state argued that it is not liable for the administrative costs because of sovereign immunity well motley rice isnt the state that leaves them wide open to liability for those costs

7219634 if we consider mankind as a whole and substitute it for a single individual we discover that it too has developed delusions which are inaccessible to logical criticism and which contradict reality if in spite of this they the delusions are able to exert an extraordinary power over men investigation leads us to the same explanation as in the case of the single individual they owe their power to the element of historical truth which they have brought up from the repression of the forgotten and primeval past

7219665 its either going to be some regulation restricting your behavior or some huge tax and neither of those is politically popular

7219667 ive spent most of my 30 year career fighting regional planning and regional government
7219668 but what you are seeing here is a pretty thoughtful approach there are incentives for in fill development and building along transportation corridors and in the end it doesnt prevent development in suburban areas it just says there are standards and it has to be done well

7219672 the blogosphere has so far been a haven of good intentions and relatively honest dealing however with blogs becoming commonplace less principled people will want to use them
7219673 i think the public is still very trusting towards blogs it is still seen as sincere and it should remain sincere for that we need a quality mark a disclosure of who is really writing and why

7219680 there is concern at the very highest level that kate middleton still does not have a job one royal source told the newspaper
7219681 the queen is keen that the monarchy should lead by example and that the princes and their girlfriends should all be seen to be hard workers
7219682 the queen has made it known that she feels kate should get involved with a charity possibly an animal charity where she can be seen to be doing something proactive and something entirely safe
7219683 it is important that kate isnt seen to be doing anything controversial and she needs to do something completely different from any of the charity work that diana did
7219684 she has quite a bad reputation for being rude when it comes to responding to letters one friend told the newspaper
7219685 she often fails to rsvp when she is asked to attend events she once failed to reply to a wedding invitation from one of williams friends and it didnt go down very well

7219745 fischer does suggest n d note 19 that we should recognize different families of direct argument only some of which rely on a modal transfer principle
7219746 perebooms 2001 110 17 four case argument and meles 2006 188 94 zygote argument are examples of this sort that dont employ a transfer principle
7219747 direct arguments do not employ modal transfer principles rather they invoke notions such as sourcehood origination and so forth
7219748 p and no one is or ever has been the ultimate source of its being the case that p
7219749 if ones action results from a deterministic causal process that traces back to factors beyond ones control to factors that one could not have produced altered or prevented then one is not free in the sense required for moral responsibility
7219750 if ones action results from a deterministic causal process that traces back to factors beyond ones control to factors that one could not have produced altered or prevented then one is not free in the sense required for moral responsibility
7219751 ernie is not a free agent and is not morally responsible for anything
7219752 it is drawn from the argument as a general conclusion
7219753 thus it seems that all arguments for the incompatibility of determinism and moral responsibility or determinism and free will presuppose a transfer principle of some kind
7219754 fischer does suggest n d note 19 that we should recognize different families of direct argument only some of which rely on a modal transfer principle
7219755 what would make premise 1 of the zygote argument true is that ernie isnt responsible for what he does because of the way his zygote was produced the preplanning of his life by diana is supposed to get us to see this
7219756 one can describe either of those lines of reasoning in a way that makes an explicit reference to a transfer principle of some sort this still seems to conflict with statements made by john and randy
7219757 different families of direct argument only some of which rely on a modal transfer principle
7219758 also just as i dont think direct argument needs tnr i dont think the consequence argument needs the transfer of powerlessness i do not deny tp i just dont think it is necessary for the argument here again fritz and i have a disagreement and i admit that i havent managed to adduce a knockdown argument
7219759 in fact i would say that one doesnt need to wield the concept of a reason or that of the thing to do or of the thing to believe in order to reason effectively it is enough if one is dealing with reasons and treating them as reasons
7219760 warranted belief that there is nothing which negates the reasonableness of treating p as vindicating f ing
7219761 the real question is whether we can find a relation on the practical side that plays the explanatory role played by the two truth relations entailment and probability related on the theoretical side there is unfortunately only one candidate for this explanatory role on the practical side as far as i can see this is some appropriate configuration of the notion of value
7219762 then under normal conditions she would also on the basis of this deliberation decide to do a1 and do a1
7219763 then under normal conditions on the basis of this deliberation she would decide to do a1 and she might do a1
7219764 if the agent reflected on it she would believe that her alternatives are open and her deliberation efficacious
7219765 is in a room with two doors and that he believes one of the doors to be unlocked and the other to be locked and impassable though he has no idea which is which
7219766 according to vipd no one can deliberate unless she thinks that she has the power to perform certain actions that is unless she thinks that she has free will in a sense that is amenable to one who endorses the source view
7219767 i do not believe that i can in a metaphysical sense of can do a and refrain from doing a i dont believe that i have the power to do a and refrain from doing a but still i believe that i can in an epistemic sense of can do a and refrain from doing a that its epistemically possible that i do a and refrain from doing a
7219768 dana correctly points out that my characterization of deliberation is in certain respects quite broad an active mental process whose aim is to choose what to do from among a number of mutually incompatible alternatives in particular it does not mention the evaluation of reasons or the aim of finding the best thing to do or even a good thing to do its unlikely that there is a canonical characterization of what it is to deliberate but one worry is that the broadness of the characterization could result in my not talking about the same thing as some other participants in this discussion im open to narrowing the definition and its important for me to watch out for places where i might not be talking about the same thing as some of the other discussants
7219769 i think that van inwagens original argument was intended to be neutral with regard to any particular analysis of free will or can
7219770 my thought is that setting aside my definition nothing that we ordinarily think of as deliberation would have the role of producing an intention to do a in a case in which the agent is already certain that she will do a for example it doesnt seem to me that consideration of reasons for and against in this situation would have the role of producing an intention in such a case rather at least typically the agent would simply just form the intention independently of further deliberation
7219771 suppose i believe i will a tomorrow im sure of it no doubts still my belief isnt an intention suppose i dont yet have an intention to a tomorrow and i think i wont a unless i come to intend to a i prefer to form intentions only on the basis of an at least cursory appraisal of my reasons why cant i deliberate about whether to a tomorrow
7219772 im certain that i want to marry you ben but recently ive been dating allen id like to take the time to deliberate about with whom id like to spend the rest of my life but i am really certain that i want to spend the rest of my life with you
7219773 after reasons for various actions have been weighed and evaluated
7219774 serious deliberation occurs when one is choosing between alternatives and it does not seem to one once all the purely factual questions have been settled that the reasons that favor either alternative are clearly the stronger
7219775 there is the gap of rational decision making where you try to make up your mind what you are going to do here the gap is between the reasons for making up your mind and the actual decision that you make
7219776 i think that deliberation about two or more options requires a belief that those options are equally possible
7219777 after reasons for various actions have been weighed and evaluated
7219778 im certain that i want to have a committed relationship with you ben but i havent even tried to decide to have that comment yet furthermore there is this other man allen who has recently asked me to go steady i dont know allen at all and he seems rather dull and unattractive so there is no reason to be worried nonetheless id like to take the time to deliberate about whether to make a commitment to you or about whether to make a commitment to allen dont worry though for i am really certain that i will decide to make a commitment to you
7219779 in real life our certainty if we ever have it tends to derive from our having already deliberated
7219780 be certain of things that at least in some senses are not necessary
7219781 to deliberate is to try to decide between or among various incompatible courses of action

7219786 the tools needed to compromise an accurate vote could be as simple as tampering with the paper audit trail connector or using a magnet with a digital assistant
7219787 the quality of the voting machines provided by these vendors is so poor far below what wed even expect in consumer electronics
7219788 if this kind of failure rate happened to our toaster ovens we would be outraged
7219789 lobbying is a big part of the problem not only here in new york state but all around the country
7219790 the voting machine vendors saw a big big pile of cash from the hava and moved in on all the states
7219791 year in and year out we see the same mistakes in ballot design with the same results
7219792 raising serious questions about whether the intended choice of the voters was certified as the winner
7219793 we are in constant communication with them and with god asking for his guidance
7219794 players have been away on international duty and the performance wasnt the best
7219795 ive been a player and ive been away with england many times and it is hard to get going again
7219796 i had about an hour with my players yesterday and i think it showed in the second half we played into hulls hands
7219797 but we did it to everton last week so it evens itself out in the end
7219798 to be fair when you go ahead theyve got to start coming out and playing and that probably opens things out for us to go further ahead
7219799 but to concede straight after our goal was really really disappointing defensively we werent at the races
7219800 paul robinson could do nothing about it the header could have gone anywhere but it goes in off the post
7219801 but overall they deserved their point and could even have won it at the end
7219802 it was an exciting game to be fair and were always trying to win it and make it exciting for people
7219803 but sometimes and ive said this to the lads when youre tired and you know youre tired its important you have a bank of four and another bank of four and be hard to beat
7219804 but the positive thing is that although the lads are disappointed if someone had said to me from everton away and hull at home wed take four points we would have we just got it the wrong way around
7219805 well not get carried away because its only two games
7219806 but it was one of those games where paul ince was on a high after the result last weekend it was his first home game hes just signed santa cruz on a new contract so there was a little bit of momentum with blackburn and it was important we got something
7219807 we could have gone on to win the game and whether that would have been fair or unfair doesnt matter we could have won it
7219808 im ecstatic with a point to tell you the truth its a great point on our travels and if we continue with that kind of passion drive commitment togetherness well be okay this year
7219809 but it does come down to that little bit of quality in the final third which you pay a lot of money for
7219810 we had opportunities one or two half chances to turn into good chances which they do at the top clubs but we wasted those opportunities to a certain extent in the second half
7219811 im absolutely flattered that my name is being mentioned about managing the great britain team
7219812 would i take it if they offered it to me absolutely i would be a fool not to
7219813 ive had some great managerial jobs during my career but there is no doubt this would be the icing on the cake
7219814 the fact it is being held on my old stamping ground in east london makes it even more appealing
7219815 ive never had a more frustrating summer we came fifth and a lot of clubs look at everton as the right way to do things
7219816 weve not spent massively to finish fifth we have progressed every year
7219817 this is the first summer where i feel i have not made any progression i dont need to buy mid premier league players i need to buy top players to challenge the top teams and that costs big money
7219818 why is there a problem getting people in it is a bit of everything weve got all these injuries and i want to sign six or seven players before next week
7219819 im going to try to do something but i cant say for sure that it is going to happen all you can see is that it is not helping things through not having brought in new blood
7219820 west brom will feel they could have got something from the game but the premier league is a cruel league
7219821 you have got to score when you get opportunities but we hung in there and took the couple we had
7219822 for this team of ours to win any premier league game at the moment is a credit to them
7219823 there was plenty of good play from us we controlled things for the vast amount of time
7219824 the team looked as if it could go on and win but in a five minute spell we conceded two goals maybe that is the difference at this level
7219825 we have got to learn very quickly but we showed we can compete in this league we showed we should have no fears of the premier league because we will be a decent side
7219826 i was very pleased with the first 15 minutes or so we created a lot of chances and could have scored a couple
7219827 but after that we did not play well and we allowed them to control our attacks they did not create too much themselves but it was not a good performance from our team
7219828 then in the second half they scored a good goal and we had to throw people forward to get ourselves back in the game
7219829 i am sure that jamie carragher will be claiming that goal despite the deflection but afterwards he was only really concerned that we had got ourselves level
7219830 but it was gerrard who showed the winning mentality he has done that so many times from a similar position many other players would have put it high over the bar but you know gerrard will hit the target
7219831 last season we drew far too many games at anfield but this time we have sent out a message that in such situations we can win the game we have winners here
7219832 that was hard to take the players are heartbroken in the dressing room
7219833 we deserved more we certainly deserved a point we produced a disciplined performance and the two matches we have played so far have given me plenty of confidence
7219834 we beat spurs last weekend and now we have very nearly beaten a side who can win the title
7219835 their equaliser was a freak and we should have been able to see out the game even at 1 1
7219836 but i have told them that they can leave anfield with their heads high
7219837 it was just one of those things but ross turnbull came in and did very well he can be pleased with his performance
7219838 i hope there will be a team by 2012 it will be team uk i hope we can get an agreement on that
7219839 i think when people are looking at the olympics in 2012 britain home of football where football was invented which we gave to the world i think people would be very surprised if there is an olympic tournament in football and we are not part of it
7219840 i am determined to work with the football associations and the international olympic committee to ensure that when we come to 2012 we have a mens football team and we have a womens football team playing
7219841 he is out of touch with the overwhelming views of football supporters throughout the uk
7219842 all the national supporters groups oppose this move and see it as a threat to the status of their nations to field independent football squads
7219843 not only do all the national supporters associations oppose such a move but the majority of football associations in the uk have said they do not want to take part in a single uk team as it could threaten their existence within fifa
7219844 i will be 37 so im not sure i will still be playing but you never know at the end of day im just going to be happy to be involved
7219845 i will definitely be there but whether its playing or not im not so sure about that one
7219846 for me football is the best sport in the world so for me it should be top of the list
7219847 there are so many other great sports and so many other athletes who have worked so hard to get here but its still important
7219848 there are great players and great teams over here so its still my number one sport whether or not it is looked at as different
7219849 if you look at jamaica a small island nation they won gold silver and bronze in the womens sprint theyve got world records theyve won the mens the womens 100 and 200 metres and the relay
7219850 this is an exceptionally brilliant nation at the same time a small nation scotland can compete on the world stage we proved that in the olympics and a scottish team at the olympics is the future
7219851 im absolutely passionate about scotland and i want scotland to do well but im also exceptionally proud of team gbs performance in the olympics i dont see why i should be asked to make a choice between those two
7219852 we were not sharp enough in the first half and our passing was certainly not as good as we expect it to be i dont know why
7219853 you have to give credit to fulham they played very well and they started sharper than us
7219854 we dominated the second half but i felt in the last 25 minutes we were too nervous and wanted to just hit the ball up there rather than create a chance
7219855 of course it is a setback but the result is there and we have to make up for it by winning the next match we have a big game on wednesday in the champions league and need to improve
7219856 we paid a big price for the mistake on their goal we should be able to cope with a corner when it comes in at low level like that
7219857 you are right that is a fact but we have to face it because from all our possession we could not produce many chances frankly the performance was just not good enough
7219858 i thought we played well for 70 minutes but perhaps in the last 15 or 20 we were guilty of trying too hard to just cling on to the lead and moved away from the style
7219859 i can understand that perhaps we got tired because there was a lot of pressure but we have to be realistic and say it is the consistency to play well for 90 minutes that we need
7219860 it is dangerous to invite teams especially teams of this quality on to you but thats what we did in the end the ball was in and around our penalty area far too much
7219861 i dont want this to sound too critical though ive seen the best defensive performance by us since ive been here but i like best the fulham that can compose itself quite well and pass the ball well
7219862 to be fair its heartening that when our backs are against the wall we can produce the necessary fighting spirit
7219863 i had him for a year and a half at viking stavanger in norway and hes still a good player both defensively and at set pieces

7219879 if the markets stabilise in a month and a half two months we will pick up the project for an initial public offer of ansaldo energia again
7219880 to reach the point of listing you need five to six months
7219881 if the jca is delayed or is not fielded as planned that would be a loss of capability for our nation
7219882 that to me would be probably harshly judged in the future if we were to lose that capability people will be wondering what we were thinking when we lost that capability why we allowed that to occur
7219883 would have to look across all the services and find out why the marine corps needs fixed wing aircraft another land component and why the navy needs fixed wing aircraft a surface maritime component
7219884 the company has not formally submitted any restructured aircraft pricing on the c 130j to the air force but looks forward to any opportunity to do so

7219891 hey we can read our books while were in line
7219892 we know people are going to drive we want them in their cars for less time
7219893 i believe in local control i come from a city council
7219894 but traffic congestion doesnt all of a sudden go from bad to good when you cross any particular city or county border and air quality and climate challenges dont respect artificial boundaries
7219895 most people dont want to live in dense urban cores most people want a little elbow room they want a yard for their children to play in
7219896 they want a little grass a little garden a little breathing room they can call their own and who the hell are you to tell people they cant
7219897 its either going to be some regulation restricting your behavior or some huge tax and neither of those is politically popular
7219898 so theres been a big debate about whether we can do this all with carrots
7219899 ive spent most of my 30 year career fighting regional planning and regional government
7219900 but what you are seeing here is a pretty thoughtful approach there are incentives for in fill development and building along transportation corridors and in the end it doesnt prevent development in suburban areas it just says there are standards and it has to be done well
7219901 is now the seat of individuals who were appointed illegally and that means that in the minds of many people the court symbolizes illegality

7219918 andriy has returned home and i am happy about it i am a milan fan and i am very happy
7219919 ive spoken to andriy 48 times in the past three hours the terms of the agreement are very private
7219920 between today and tomorrow andriy will be in milan and he will start again his life as a milan player
7219921 andriy made a mistake in leaving and i believe that in the past two years he has realised that this is his home
7219922 now he has made his financial sacrifices but at this point the only thing that matters is that he returns to us

7219937 i dont think that we were just going through the motions before

7219939 tonight we got up early and got the focus back were not going to be too hard on ourselves if we lose a few tough games but theres nobody in here whos going out there not caring if we win or lose

7219941 thats an out in any mans game most guys catch that ball
7219942 teixeiras just absolutely killing everything we throw and hes on every pitch

7219944 in the past id gotten a couple of hits off his offspeed pitches but tonight i noticed that his fastball was working really well so i was just looking for something hard the entire at bat

7219953 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
7219954 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
7219955 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
7219956 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
7219957 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
7219958 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
7219959 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
7219960 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
7219961 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
7219962 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
7219963 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
7219964 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
7219965 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
7219966 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
7219967 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
7219968 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen

7219972 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
7219973 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
7219974 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
7219975 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos
7219976 aspectos jur dico pol ticos de la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural
7219977 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
7219978 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
7219979 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
7219980 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre
7219981 we were not allowed to take all because there was an agreement among the people to defend this space
7219982 the joint ministerial decree has been issued and now they demand a presidential decree to ban ahmadiyah
7219983 we are studying a number of options and are open to all possibilities which could include buying lehman
7219984 kdb had said it would consider buying a stake in lehman
7219985 it seems like kdb internally decided to stop the talks given that it had not kept the government posted further
