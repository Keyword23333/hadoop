7810007 russia should have recognized the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia long ago and should have followed it up with defense cooperation and assistance treaties long ago too
7810008 currently it is important for us that south ossetia should gain independence legally from the point of view of the world community
7810009 after this we shall be able to seek accession into the russian federation but this issue will be postponed for the future
7810010 only the international recognition of independence and sovereignty will give reliable international guarantees of security and free development rights improve the situation and ensure stability in the caucasian region
7810011 it is nato not russia that is primarily interested in nato russian cooperation
7810012 if they choose to break off this relationship even the whole of it nothing terrible will happen
7810013 this strategy has been key to protecting the group against the current market volatility and leaves us well placed to take advantage of opportunities arising from an upturn
7810014 while advertising remains a difficult environment we expect to markedly outperform our peer group over the next quarter with a strong management structure and a clear strategic vision we are confident in the groups ability to deliver robust revenue and profit figures in the face of uncertain macro economic conditions
7810015 we also put greater emphasis on achieving higher margins in broadband and telephony services and exited some lower yielding contracts
7810016 revenue was up by 15pc from 5m sterling to 5 8m sterling and operating profits were up by 51pc to 0 9m 2008 0 6m sterling in the first six months
7810017 with such considerable uncertainty about global and national economies it is difficult to predict the rest of the year with any degree of confidence
7810018 the technology available today is light years ahead of what was generally available just five years ago
7810019 add those advancements to increasing technical expertise as we learn more about graphically creating immersive worlds and the conditions are right to have graphics play a major role in telling the story of a game

7810021 with the economic situation worsening and the property market still suffering we are calling on the government to take urgent action on hips

7810044 that omission sends a message that verges on the sinister not that ministers have abandoned their commitment to decency and fairness but that when it comes to devising strategies for dealing with the numbers crisis and the other challenges facing the prison estate the monitoring task has simply disappeared off the agenda
7810045 we are concerned that the government seems to be going back on jack straws own statement that we cannot build ourselves out of the prison numbers crisis
7810046 we are not just dealing with overcrowding though overcrowding is a serious problem in some prisons we are also dealing with a system that is overwhelmed by numbers
7810047 the proposal to add 7 500 in these three massive prisons is going simply to add another set of places where regimes will suffer because they will have to accommodate the needs of several different kinds of prisoners who at the moment we expect to keep separate from one another
7810048 for over a decade this government has failed to provide adequate jail places but huge prisoner warehouses the largest in europe are not the right answer
7810049 whats needed is a network of smaller local prisons with better integration with local communities and a new focus on reducing re offending so that we can arrest the growth in the prison population in the right way

7810132 my mother shes 85 years old im sorry to say but she will not vote for him
7810133 weve been talking with staff in different parts of the midwest
7810134 and were all struggling to some extent with the problem of white workers who will not vote for obama because of his color there is no question about it its a very powerful thing to get over for some folks
7810135 but i tell people are we supposed to be afraid of that and not go ahead and try to do something different
7810136 there are people who want to hurt barack obama because of his race and sometimes i fear for his safety
7810137 its relatively simple get your electricity bills for the past 12 months add up the units used and divide by the number of cows in the herd
7810138 thats a wide band but dont forget theres a huge diversity in parlours being operated and equipment used
7810139 farm businesses can get a nasty shock when the contract runs out and the energy supplier puts the business on to a standard tariff
7810140 costs can soon mount and you could be accumulating considerable costs unknowingly
7810141 also most contracts will have a white meter or period within any day when the user pays a lower rate for energy just like the old economy 7 tariff for domestic properties
7810142 check if you have it and when the time is set aim to get much of the high energy use such as heating hot water for parlour washing done in this time you can save hundreds a year
7810143 thats 7665 units a year and at 8p unit some producers may be paying as much as 11 12p unit it costs 613 that rises to 958 a year when you heat a tank twice daily one on low tariff and one tank full at standard day rate
7810144 but you can cut that to 710 by having two 50gal tanks heated in the low tariff period and reheating the second tank before use later in the day it costs less to reheat warm water
7810145 for example running borehole water through the plate cooler before entering the hot water tank will remove and make use of some residual heat taken from the milk itself
7810146 it is important to check what savings may be achieved before investing capital producers can download an energy efficiency guide from our website www dairyco org uk for free we will also talk producers through possible changes to cut energy use
7810147 also check fans have good airflow if youve altered building layout since they were installed can they still get adequate airflow
7810148 lighting is a key area it costs 65 a year to run a 500w halogen type lamp for eight hours daily multiply that by the number of lamps and it can be costly

7810155 an atmospheric pressure drop at wind turbine blades is an undetectable and potentially unforeseeable hazard for bats thus partially explaining the large number of bat fatalities at these specific structures
7810156 people love to sit in their backyards and watch birds its much harder to watch bats because they are nocturnal
7810157 it was important for us to determine as much as we could about this issue
7810158 we had to be quite patient mainly because we were started from a knowledge base that wasnt quite zero but very very low
7810159 well on kirstys performance what else can i say which has not been said by both the officials and the international media here about her phenomenal achievement
7810160 there is no doubt that kirsty is obviously the greatest athlete of our time
7810161 getting an olympic gold medal and breaking a world record in the process is just out of this world
7810162 she is also a very lovely person to work with and i really enjoyed being in her company during these games
7810163 the results of brian dzingai and ngoni makusha were also very impressive in the case of dzingai no one took notice of him until he reached the final of the mens 200m event
7810164 he was africas sole representative in the mens 200m event from the second round to the semi finals and then the final
7810165 and when he qualified for the final everyone here was just asking who is this good athlete from africa
7810166 this definitely speaks volumes of his talent and we in team zimbabwe 2008 should also feel proud about his achievement he really did us proud here
7810167 for making it past the opening rounds of the mens long jump and the womens single sculls event speaks of their bright future as we prepare for the next olympic games in london in 2012

7810222 the main purpose of these exercises is to increase the cooperation and partnership between u s and georgian forces
7810223 the georgian move against south ossetia was motivated by political considerations having to do with israel and iran according to nfc georgian president mikheil saakashvili decided to assert control over the breakaway region in order to force israel to reconsider its decision to cut back its support for georgias military
7810224 russian and georgian media reported several days ago that israel decided to stop its support for georgia after moscow made it clear to jerusalem and washington that russia would respond to continued aid for georgia by selling advanced anti aircraft systems to syria and iran

7810227 with donnie getting hurt and keenan having some tendinitis and some camp leg issues we really never got to have them out there at the same time
7810228 i was very pleased with their approach and their effort
7810229 it wasnt perfect they had their share of mistakes but they also had their share of plays and i think they showed that they have that short memory and the ability to come out and step up and make plays it was fun to watch them
7810230 he looked kind of nervous on a couple of plays
7810231 the bright spot was he just kept playing he got better as he continued to play in the game and didnt let himself get down hes very very hard on himself which is a great trait of his
7810232 the young man had spent about five weeks in hastings and was due to return home next weekend his death is incredibly sad
7810233 enormous numbers of foreign students come to hastings and rother each summer in the region of 30 000 to 50 000
7810234 the problems and issues they are involved in are very few in comparison to these large numbers
7810235 notwithstanding this no matter how rare an incident like this is the effect on the young mans family can only be imagined
7810236 i saw the english boys attack the arab boys in the street
7810237 i have been told that they punched him he fell down then they kicked him in the head
7810238 its a big tragedy for hastings well see how this affects the language schools and host families
7810239 those boys are very cruel i knew something would happen because theres always problems here
7810240 but the market is reacting to it and edging up some
7810241 lately there has been a very strong correlation between oil futures and the us dollar
7810242 just because any exporter hasnt got accreditation yet doesnt mean they wont get it
7810243 it all depends on if theyve applied and when they applied whether the application was filled out correctly to start with
7810244 i am pleased that wea has made this first announcement well ahead of the harvest
7810245 the goal of this major economic reform was always to provide more choice for growers
7810246 augusts fall in the german ifo business confidence index clearly adds to the recent run of bad news on the eurozones largest economy
7810247 the fall from 97 5 to a three year low of 94 8 was sharper than the consensus forecast but broadly in line with our own expectations
7810248 the decline was due to falls in both business expectations and perceptions of current conditions
7810249 if it was to happen i think youd just have to take it in your stride
7810250 i think ive taken a lot of confidence out of saturday and not knowing i was going to be there because of mcmenimans illness and yet the team had such a good result
7810251 im not surprised by anything really in the game these days
7810252 you enter you do your best and you hope for the best and you have to live i guess with what youre delivered
7810253 ill read the release and then well go from there
7810254 every week theres players who are injured and unavailable to us luke burgess it one example but theres a queue of blokes who are waiting for their opportunity as well so it will be what it is
7810255 nathan sharpe has flown over as a contingency we have all the other blokes who are on tour and hugh mcmenimans back on his feet after his illness so the whole group will be considered
7810256 i guess a suspension it not typical but its a typical week in terms of managing your mix
7810257 police have launched a major investigation with charges expected to be laid soon

7810269 sie wissen ganz genau das die wahren verantwortlichen von abu ghureib sprich die vorgesetzten die die folterungen und dem tigungen offiziell befohlen haben nie belangt wurden

7810278 even moslems from puerto princesa have also taken the streets to show their refusal to be under the moro islamic liberation front
7810279 they have good relationships and interact well with each other among muslims priests government officials very harmonious and peaceful there is collaboration among the moslems and christians here in puerto princesa

7810283 it becomes impossible for hollywood types who adopt these different lifestyles to support a political party that is so openly and prominently critical of important aspects of their way of living
7810284 so while many of the more creative filmmakers consider themselves to be socialists filmmakers writers and other creative types in communist countries were typically very strongly opposed to their governments

7810295 wir haben in deutschland viel zu lange auf pump gelebt
7810296 den menschen gegeben oder aber in infrastruktur wie zum beispiel stra enprojekte oder in forschung gesteckt
7810297 wir haben miteinander eine koalitionsvereinbarung und auf dieser basis arbeiten wir
7810298 this is going to be catastrophic for millions of people
7810299 maybe we should have had a discussion before policy is put out there publicly
7810300 the basis is right its how you get there and there are some people who have great difficulty in organising a 12 year old to get to school when they dont want to go to school
7810301 a lot of us are uncomfortable about this policy but it was a rudd labor commitment and kevin rudd confirmed that yesterday that its a promise he will be keeping
7810302 i think its fair to say there is a great deal of concern within the caucus
7810303 its a pretty extreme organisation thats got extreme powers that doesnt confront anybody else in australian society
7810304 i dont think we need to keep this at the extreme end of where it is at the moment i think we should be able to wind that back somewhat before 2010
7810305 a federal government committed to workplace rights has no justification for keeping the abcc until 2010
7810306 the greens will not shrink from defending the basic human rights of workers including those in the building and construction industry
7810307 i stand here today at the cross currents of that history knowing that my piece of the american dream is a blessing hard won by those who came before me
7810308 people like hillary clinton who put those 18 million cracks in the glass ceiling so that our daughters and sons can dream a little bigger and aim a little higher
7810309 that is the thread that runs through my journey and baracks journey and so many other improbable journeys that have brought us here tonight where the current of history meets this new tide of hope
7810310 this november the torch will be passed again to a new generation of americans so with barack obama and for you and me our country will be committed to his cause
7810311 the work will begin anew the hope will rise again and the dream lives on
7810312 let there be no mistake about it we are united
7810313 hillary wants us to support obama the same we supported her and thats what we are going to do
7810314 i feel pretty good about my chances especially now that ive got one of the finest statesmen in this country on my ticket joe biden as vice president
7810315 there was no warning we werent coming at them they were coming at us
7810316 we must remain non violent we must have the high moral ground
7810317 theres a powerful police presence here the chill of 1968 is in the air of denver
7810318 police will use all means to restore normalcy as soon as possible
7810319 police will take decisive action against the protesters government restraint is almost over
7810320 i ask all the protesters who have been blockading or occupying government offices that you still have a chance to withdraw and go back to your homes
7810321 i will not resign i will stay to protect this country
7810322 the military will not allow the protesters to take control of the country however it is not the time yet for military force
7810323 today is judgement day i am ready if they want to arrest me
7810324 the easiest way to restore normalcy is for prime minister samak to quit
7810325 if we do not receive a clear and positive response we will prolong the rally to the next day and mobilise more protesters
7810326 the military will not stage a coup detat the public must not panic and must carry on their daily lives the army will not get involved in politics
7810327 its one of the most significant job losses in australia this year and its obviously going to have a serious impact on the ongoing quality of the companys papers magazines and websites in australia and new zealand
7810328 the important question here is the sort of damage this is going to do to the company for a bit of short term benefit a bit of short term cost savings
7810329 a far reaching program designed to comprehensively restructure and reposition the business for years to come
7810330 they choose to stand up for particular oil companies instead of standing up for australian families who need lower interest rates
7810331 its going to be very interesting indeed where the credibility stakes now hang in this place in terms of those opposite and their behaviour in the senate as they begin to launch their assault on this nations best fiscal preparedness for what will be uncertain global economic times ahead
7810332 they certainly dont have a mandate for these completely unjustifiable tax increases
7810333 what the government is actually doing is taxing australians now in an unjustifiable way in order to spend it later in order to buy their way back into office in 2010
7810334 the incoming government was given an economy that was described as the envy of the world
7810335 consumer confidence is the lowest it has been since 1991
7810336 if they the opposition decide to be spoilers then we will seek to negotiate with the minor parties to make sure these essential budget bills are carried
7810337 we will not attend the clear message is that the dialogue is still underway and we dont expect any member of the executive to address us until that dialogue has been concluded
7810338 brooke informed me two days ago that very soon wed be producing our own version of
7810339 that would imply its a boy so until we know well refer to it as two and a half people were beyond happy to be new parents together
7810340 we couldnt be more excited to add to our already big and happy family

7810356 carbon taxes are part of the programme for government the sooner we grasp the nettle and comply the better
7810357 clean water will become a dwindling resource with more demand in that situation it will have a pricing component similar to that of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere
7810358 accordingly i am unable to say at this stage when proposals will be available

7810367 it may be possible to slow the rise of xdr tb deaths
7810368 by ensuring that patients are correctly diagnosed as early as possible and put on appropriate treatment for the correct length of time
7810369 extremely labor and resource intensive and has to be done within extremely well structured tb programs
7810370 the reason we have the problem is inadequate control of tb
7810371 aggressive treatment of xdr tb is the logical strategy to provide the best chance of treatment success while avoiding the creation of additional drug resistance
7810372 should be cautious in their hope to attain such success rates in settings with a high prevalence of hiv

7810386 the musicians i knew had gone through that transition im listening to bob dylan and i realize these artists are using their talent to project their feelings and ideas not just please people i was in the wrong place in 1967 i was thirty i was entertaining people in nightclubs who were forty they were at war with their kids who were twenty there was a generation war i was in the middle of it i said what the fuck am i doing over here the twenty year olds are the people who will understand me and give me a chance i took two years to change and it happened on television happened on shows like della reese virgina graham and steve allen
7810387 virginia graham was a real shit stirrer she just loved to get me to talk about smoking pot and henry mancini she got henry mancini to cop out to being a pot smoker on tv i went on there my beard was growing my attitudes were changing and i talked about my changes on the panel a lot
7810388 really the choice of joe biden in my opinion is tantamount to an admission barack obama himself lacks the necessary experience to be president

7810406 job seekers in some fields are competing aggressively for open positions giving employers the edge in those segments of the hiring market at the same time however companies continue to face a shortage of highly skilled professionals in fields such as technology and accounting these in demand workers may not be willing to leave secure positions unless firms extend very attractive job offers
7810407 businesses are operating on leaner resources and are competing to secure the intellectual capital that will drive productivity and new revenue streams companies are also replacing lower performing employees to strengthen their talent bench to prepare for a time when the economy shifts into higher gear
7810408 recruiting highly skilled professionals may require a greater financial commitment or special perks that provide a more attractive work environment however nearly three quarters of employees surveyed said the availability of flexible schedules may cause them to choose one job over another

7810442 it is a long term call on the common stock

7810444 its just another spin on the same old thing again
7810445 mutate to become resistant to combination treatments so evolving newer combinations increases the life of the drug used
7810446 situation is changing fast with doctors having to frequently change the combination of drugs
7810447 still makes chloroquine the medicine of choice to treat malaria patients
7810448 problem of morbidity with relapses in p vivax malaria is of great concern
7810449 stigma associated with hiv aids is very very strong here
7810450 remains idle because the local community believe they cannot contract the disease
7810451 we need an aggressive awareness campaign in these remote areas
7810452 we have no picture or poster of a condom here we cannot take the risk
7810453 culture does not allow me to advise or discuss any sexual matter with a woman who is older than me
7810454 it appears that significant comprehensive reform would not begin until september 2010
7810455 judging by the level of enquiries we have received from businesses wanting to recycle their waste pvc we expect recycling rates to break new records again by the end of the year
7810456 ive had a great last year and i really mean this
7810457 i was not a part of that presidential search i sat through it all but i dont want anyone to think i had a bad year i had a great year and it was one of the best years the college has had
7810458 its like a new change in my life of course for 45 years in a row ive been on college campus welcoming students teaching students or doing something as a faculty member or administrator this will be the first time in 45 years that i wont be doing that so thats a change
7810459 weve tried to expand the reaches of monroe community college throughout our community everyone should have the opportunity to go to college if they want to and i think weve made that possible
7810460 ive known the way hes impacted students in their growth choices in careers and personal choices
7810461 its remarkable when he works with students its so clear how much he cares about them and their success
7810462 his leadership has helped to elevate mccs stature as a premier institution and a national model emulated by schools throughout the country
7810463 toms dedication and perseverance made him an invaluable asset to the college his outstanding character and professionalism have made him a pleasure to work with over the years he will be missed
7810464 hes one of the very accomplished community college administrators in the country and were in great hands
7810465 he said to me as you look back can you say what dad said
7810466 and thats do the best you can i believe i can say that
7810467 tak e aim at rival hiv drugs hinting at side effects and other drawbacks
7810468 with images of hope and by explaining the benefits of their treatments
7810469 tough new tack has some patient groups unsettled saying it could scare off patients
7810470 dont take a chance stick with the hiv medicine thats working for you
7810471 will the hiv medicine make my skin or eyes turn yellow
7810472 while we acknowledge that some people may find the headline and imagery of the materials to be provocative gsk stands firmly behind the ads and their underlying message patients considering changing hiv therapy ought to consult closely with their physician to fully understand the near and potential long term health implications of such changes
7810473 just as likely to encourage a patient to stay with another medicine as it is one of our own assuming that the medicine is working for a patient and is well tolerated
7810474 ends this september and as always we will take all the community feedback we have received into consideration for future campaigns
7810475 ask your doctor if there are hiv medications with a low risk of diarrhea
7810476 kaletra has a well established side effect profile and profound and sustained effectiveness in combating hiv
7810477 market for hiv medicines has grown crowded and companies want to protect their market share
7810478 treatments have become so comparable so companies are really trying to split hairs to have a marketing advantage
7810479 numbers have been creeping up for several years especially among young children
7810480 the bottom line is that we dont have enough information
7810481 we know that more children are diagnosed today than in the past
7810482 a lot of it is the change in what we call autism but we cant say that explains all of it
7810483 we certainly get indications that autism exists in other communities of the world but whether it exists to the same degree as common its not quite as clear

7810487 some perspective on the policy arguments between the mccain and obama camps
7810488 want the federal government making decisions for consumers or for providers
7810489 like other democrats he was pushing for a big government program to deal with what he saw as market failures in health care and to bring down the price of insurance
7810490 program was in place though he trusted a market of individuals to make its own decisions once the government had subsidized health insurance he thought the vast majority of the uninsured would sign up
7810491 find traction in the presidential race where health care remains a large issue
7810492 give both candidates a spring board to tout their very different health care plans
7810493 move some money from here to there cut some government waste no one apparently ever noticed and then fund an unattainable promise with an outlandish price tag
7810494 totes up dubious savings to fund his ultimate goal of making health insurance affordable to everyone
7810495 obamas own web site points out that health insurance premiums have risen six times faster than wages in the last four years
7810496 to be sure there are many laudable goals in obamas plan
7810497 improve the nations health and may moderate if not lower long term health care costs
7810498 near term price tag is clearly being underestimated to make the medicine go down a little easier
7810499 promises to provide every american access to affordable comprehensive health care and to achieve long overdue mental health and addiction treatment parity
7810500 thats right the dems will expand the number of people who receive subsidized health care provide better benefits and you apparently dont have to worry about costs going up
7810501 dems are going to eliminate waste in the medical system they will save the typical family up to 2 500 per year
7810502 how to pay for all these bright packages chances are that you wont have to give but only will get get get
7810503 then the platform promises a return to fiscal responsibility really
7810504 suggestion that mr obama is all rhetorical fluff is mistaken
7810505 place him at almost any point on the democratic political spectrum
7810506 era of big government would not be over in an obama administration
7810507 the resulting dead end on prosperousness is daily and hourly a stronghold called jews

7810545 the work begins anew the hope rises again and the dream lives on
7810546 i think about how one day theyll have families of their own and one day they and your sons and daughters will tell their own children about what we did together in this election theyll tell them how this time we listened to our hopes instead of our fears how this time we decided to stop doubting and to start dreaming

7810572 in a partnership with war child thats now been running for four years the frere maino centre in kinshasa houses around 40 boys ranging from 8 15 years of age with war childs help the centre has recently been refurbished with new beds furniture electrics shower and toilet facilities as well as a new roof and septic tank the children are also enjoying a wide varietyof entertainment facilities such as a games room including table football and a tv
7810573 aside from our help in the refurbishment of the centre war child has also invested heavily in the training of the centres staff in areas such as child care basic hygiene and safety and also reintegration techniques through this partnership the social educational and behavioural issues that many of kinshasas children are burdnened with are now being addressed a process that has seen all of frere mainos boys enter mainstream education
7810574 were also heavily involved in local advocacy promoting an understanding of the problems these kids face in the wider community this is all part of the war child philosphy to encourage the community to work with the children and develop a more positive attitude towards them
7810575 weve also involved some of the centres staff and children in a broader committee across the city making for a stronger voice and allowing them to pass on their knowledge and ideas investing in the local community in this way means that the community comes together as a more unified unit
7810576 one of the offshoots of this improved structure within the community is the listening posts an initiative run by the centres staff where they work directly with some of kinshasas 20 000 street children the staff give advice to these children on issues such as health and safety and encourage them to pass on their knowledge to other children its a peer to peer referral programme whereby the children tell us if there is anyone in particular danger or at particular risk we can then immediately intervene and help the child whose suffering would otherwise have gone unnoticed

7810606 eating of rats will serve twin purposes it will save grains from being eaten away by rats and will simultaneously increase our grain stock
7810607 we are very serious to implement this project since the food crisis is turning serious day by day
7810608 this would be a big step up for nice but people ive spoken to have heard rawlins making these kind of comments in private before
7810609 nice was not created to set medicine prices nor indeed to drive them down as nices chairman now seems to see as his mission
7810610 forecast sales and the effect on the nhs drugs bill and
7810611 nice is beginning to flex its muscles there will be regulation on prices nice will be involved in it and prices will go down
7810612 theyre the people who are probably best placed to say how much the drugs should cost
7810613 if nice gets involved in pricing as soon a drug is launched then at least the company will be able to start selling the product straight away if a price is agreed
7810614 nices role critical for the nhs is to value medicines but the recent decisions on kidney cancer confirm that we need to re examine how they define value we need less soulless arithmetic and more clinical judgment
7810615 lives are being put at risk a programme needs to be put into place to ensure that all british children are inoculated against hepatitis b
7810616 much of the rest of europe operates mass childhood vaccination programmes it is time that the uk followed suit
7810617 only vaccinates those deemed to be at high risk but evidence shows that this policy is failing
7810618 only half of gp practices are following clinical guidelines on protecting patients this is leaving millions of patients at risk of a preventable disease
7810619 wants to engage with the department of health to find a solution to this growing issue
7810620 once again nice has shown how poorly it assesses new cancer treatments its economic formulae are simply not suitable for addressing cost effectiveness in this area of medicine
7810621 we have already seen distraught patients remortgaging their houses giving up pensions and selling cars simply to buy drugs that are freely available to those using health services in countries of comparable wealth
7810622 it just cant be that everybody else around the world is wrong about access to innovative cancer care and the nhs right in rationing it so severely
7810623 we have made it possible for thousands of cancer patients to receive treatment when without our guidance they would almost certainly have not it therefore cannot be the case as professor sikora and his colleagues suggest that our methods for valuing new treatments are unsuitable for cancer drugs
7810624 if one group of patients is provided with cost ineffective care other groups lacking powerful lobbyists will be denied cost effective care for miserable conditions like schizophrenia crohns disease or cystic fibrosis
7810625 high price seems to have been imposed mostly because the companies figured the market would bear it
7810626 could usefully be spent on providing drugs for cancer patients in a country where we spend less on cancer treatments than on drugs for constipation in a country where as a result of nices appalling and uneducated interventions we spend less than two thirds of the european average on drug treatments for our cancer patients

7810630 rightly worried at this onslaught if local gp surgeries lose up to a quarter of their patients in many cases they will no longer be financially viable that means patients will have to travel further and will lose the relationship they have with the family doctors they know and trust
7810631 it appears that pcts have been forced to site new surgeries where they have available buildings rather than where they are needed it would be much better value for money to invest in the existing practices so that they can further improve the quality and range of services they offer
7810632 the governments approach has the potential to undermine many practices leaving them little option but to reduce their staff or services which will not be in the interests of patients

7810652 this year theyre out there a bit more than they were last year
7810653 right now weve inspected 1 731 entries and out of that number theres about a 96 2 percent compliance rate
7810654 we want as good of a compliance rate as we can get
7810655 and for the number of horses weve had so far thats a good percentage the trainers are making a strong effort to bring their horses to inspection in good shape and make sure theyre in compliance with the horse protection act
7810656 this is not totally all new but this year they did walk the barns again and the trailers where they unload the horses and they inspected some horses that they saw that they had some questions about
7810657 they brought some of the horses back up to where they do the inspections at calsonic arena some violations were written on some of those horses
7810658 this deliberate infliction of pain upon these noble stoic horses is animal cruelty no less so than dogfighting or cockfighting soring must be brought to an end
7810659 this alliance will inform the public the media and members of congress of this inhumane practice and put violators on notice that the american people will no longer tolerate this criminal abuse of horses
7810660 this is not actually the first time weve had individuals monitoring those areas
7810661 weve done this the past few years this is a joint effort between the dqps and the usda to enforce the horse protection act
7810662 a great deal of work went into this plan a year ago and we saw the fruits of that labor with the type of horse we saw in the ring
7810663 during this year there has been improvement over last year and i think the compliance rate shows that and indicates that
7810664 anytime a horse gets excused from a class some of those people feel like theres nothing wrong with that horse but our inspections have improved theyre more consistent and at the celebration we have usda vmos present and theyre overseeing the inspection of the dqps and theres a good team effort between those groups to make sure these horses are compliant
7810665 using a drug screening program to detect the use of prohibited substances placing emphasis on improper shoeing conducting random inspections of the barn area and ensuring enforcement of the tennessee anti soring ordinance are all measures that will protect the horses as well as the integrity of the show
7810666 we commend the celebrations show management for their consultative and collaborative approach and commitment to having sound clean horses in the show ring we hope that the standard set by the celebration will be adopted by other show managers
7810667 establishment of a single industry organization that has governance responsibilities and sets and enforces uniform standards and regulations
7810668 the goal is to eliminate soring and we are making every effort that we can to see that every horse is in compliance with the horse protection act that enters the show ring
7810669 those people who continue the illegal practice of soring will eventually be weeded out of the system theyre going to have to bring their horses into compliance
7810670 well we have this wonderful relationship together we have this incredible connection so why are you not doing this or that which would reflect that incredible bond

7810686 the crisis that im talking about is the one of living every day food supplies are lower than theyve ever been one morning this week in my home town four of the five main supermarkets were simply shut doors closed bars up gates padlocked no notice no apology nothing the one supermarket which has a south african franchise was open but the prices were completely out of reach a 250 gram bag of salt cost 150 dollars a small tin of jam was priced at 250 dollars these amounts are the figures after ten zeroes were removed a fortnight ago in real terms the salt was 1 and half trillion dollars and the small tin of jam 2 and a half trillion dollars to put this in perspective you need to know that a junior school teacher i met this week told me she currently earns 2 trillion dollars a month 200 dollars without the zeroes a month in the classroom for less than one small tin of jam

7810722 president clinton understands this is sen obamas convention and he is here to do all he can to make sen obama our next president
7810723 were talking about the nominee for the president of the united states
7810724 there are people who are not going to vote for him because hes black

7810737 augusts fall in the german ifo business confidence index clearly adds to the recent run of bad news on the eurozones largest economy
7810738 the fall from 97 5 to a three year low of 94 8 was sharper than the consensus forecast but broadly in line with our own expectations
7810739 the decline was due to falls in both business expectations and perceptions of current conditions
7810740 the young man had spent about five weeks in hastings and was due to return home next weekend his death is incredibly sad
7810741 enormous numbers of foreign students come to hastings and rother each summer in the region of 30 000 to 50 000
7810742 the problems and issues they are involved in are very few in comparison to these large numbers
7810743 notwithstanding this no matter how rare an incident like this is the effect on the young mans family can only be imagined
7810744 i saw the english boys attack the arab boys in the street
7810745 i have been told that they punched him he fell down then they kicked him in the head
7810746 its a big tragedy for hastings well see how this affects the language schools and host families
7810747 those boys are very cruel i knew something would happen because theres always problems here
7810748 you cant stop the due process of law in this country people are doing their jobs the police and aca are investigating cases and the media is reporting on the process of investigation

7810767 if it was to happen i think youd just have to take it in your stride
7810768 i think ive taken a lot of confidence out of saturday and not knowing i was going to be there because of mcmenimans illness and yet the team had such a good result
7810769 im not surprised by anything really in the game these days
7810770 you enter you do your best and you hope for the best and you have to live i guess with what youre delivered
7810771 ill read the release and then well go from there
7810772 every week theres players who are injured and unavailable to us luke burgess it one example but theres a queue of blokes who are waiting for their opportunity as well so it will be what it is
7810773 nathan sharpe has flown over as a contingency we have all the other blokes who are on tour and hugh mcmenimans back on his feet after his illness so the whole group will be considered
7810774 maybe we should have had a discussion before policy is put out there publicly
7810775 the basis is right its how you get there and there are some people who have great difficulty in organising a 12 year old to get to school when they dont want to go to school
7810776 a lot of us are uncomfortable about this policy but it was a rudd labor commitment and kevin rudd confirmed that yesterday that its a promise he will be keeping
7810777 i think its fair to say there is a great deal of concern within the caucus
7810778 its a pretty extreme organisation thats got extreme powers that doesnt confront anybody else in australian society
7810779 i dont think we need to keep this at the extreme end of where it is at the moment i think we should be able to wind that back somewhat before 2010
7810780 a federal government committed to workplace rights has no justification for keeping the abcc until 2010
7810781 beyond the credit crisis the impact and lessons learnt for investment managers
7810782 police will use all means to restore normalcy as soon as possible
7810783 police will take decisive action against the protesters government restraint is almost over
7810784 i ask all the protesters who have been blockading or occupying government offices that you still have a chance to withdraw and go back to your homes
7810785 i will not resign i will stay to protect this country
7810786 the military will not allow the protesters to take control of the country however it is not the time yet for military force
7810787 today is judgement day i am ready if they want to arrest me
7810788 the easiest way to restore normalcy is for prime minister samak to quit
7810789 if we do not receive a clear and positive response we will prolong the rally to the next day and mobilise more protesters
7810790 the military will not stage a coup detat the public must not panic and must carry on their daily lives the army will not get involved in politics
7810791 i stand here today at the cross currents of that history knowing that my piece of the american dream is a blessing hard won by those who came before me
7810792 people like hillary clinton who put those 18 million cracks in the glass ceiling so that our daughters and sons can dream a little bigger and aim a little higher
7810793 that is the thread that runs through my journey and baracks journey and so many other improbable journeys that have brought us here tonight where the current of history meets this new tide of hope
7810794 this november the torch will be passed again to a new generation of americans so with barack obama and for you and me our country will be committed to his cause
7810795 the work will begin anew the hope will rise again and the dream lives on
7810796 let there be no mistake about it we are united
7810797 hillary wants us to support obama the same we supported her and thats what we are going to do
7810798 i feel pretty good about my chances especially now that ive got one of the finest statesmen in this country on my ticket joe biden as vice president
7810799 there was no warning we werent coming at them they were coming at us
7810800 we must remain non violent we must have the high moral ground

7810803 bars can be a good occasional source of nutrients such as protein for people on the go but they vary dramatically in their content before eating a bar a consumer should be sure it has what he or she needs without unwanted ingredients
7810804 hong kongs nutrition labeling regulation is unique meaning all imported foods making nutritional claims from all sources will have to be re labeled for the hong kong market
7810805 while the us requires the labeling of 15 nutrients plus energy products manufactured for the us do not meet with the hong kong nutrition labeling requirements due to different nutrient definitions rounding practices and recommendations for daily consumption

7810831 i had it happen when i was 32 in the ahl he was a young player when he was injured and very determined to get back
7810832 has hindered him a little hes lost some of the sight in the eye but the fact hes playing tells you something about the character of the individual
7810833 he got some fastballs he had short quick swings and stayed on the ball good he went the other way good rollins is going to hit hes got a good swing hes got a very good approach at the plate
7810834 hes a good dude hes very honest with how he feels about certain pitchers and stuff like that its a good compliment from him that im tough to get a hit off of i guess

7810856 guarantee appropriate sex and relationship education in every primary and secondary school by putting personal social and health education on a statutory basis as part of the national curriculum
7810857 international evidence suggests that high quality sex and relationship education that puts sex in its proper context that starts early enough to make a difference and that gives youngsters the confidence and ability to make well informed decisions helps young people delay their first sexual experience and leads to lower teenage pregnancy levels
7810858 that omission sends a message that verges on the sinister not that ministers have abandoned their commitment to decency and fairness but that when it comes to devising strategies for dealing with the numbers crisis and the other challenges facing the prison estate the monitoring task has simply disappeared off the agenda
7810859 we are concerned that the government seems to be going back on jack straws own statement that we cannot build ourselves out of the prison numbers crisis
7810860 we are not just dealing with overcrowding though overcrowding is a serious problem in some prisons
7810861 the new survey clearly shows that town halls hugely resent having to pass the electoral roll to direct marketing companies
7810862 most people hate junk mail and cold calling and councils dont want to be part of the process that generates money for junk mail companies in this way
7810863 selling the electoral roll undermines democracy dissuades people from voting and gives people the impression that the council is profiteering from selling their personal information

7810868 i really was just getting back into feeling 100 percent
7810869 i had a great week of practice that week and i was feeling really good then to get hurt really just kind of crushed my attitude
7810870 i took all those months off and started rehabbing it and taking it real slow and i think that really helped
7810871 he didnt do anything in the spring because we wanted to be 100 percent certain that his arm was going to be healed
7810872 hes had no restrictions in august most of our kids came back the first monday of august so he hit the ground running
7810873 hes still a little rusty because he hasnt done anything with 11 people but his arm strength is just about back to normal and his accuracy is still there

7811089 the picture is becoming clear not only are vaccines causing an epidemic of autoimmunity including type 1 diabetes but they are causing an epidemic of metabolic syndrome as the immune system acts to suppress the inflammation and autoimmunity caused by the vaccines current data shows that vaccines are much more dangerous than the public is lead to believe and adequate testing has never been performed even in healthy subjects the current practice of vaccinating diabetics as well as their close family members is a very risky practice

7811105 you all are not just renewing people youre already beginning to renew the physical building
7811106 is the gospel powerful enough to transform the lives of even these people
7811107 youre a church and you want to meet in a bar what kind of church is that thats fascinating
7811108 wow this is a kind of church i have never seen before and this is a facet of christianity i did not know existed
7811109 if church is what happens when people encounter the risen jesus and commit themselves to sustaining and deepening that encounter in their encounter with each other there is plenty of theological room for diversity of rhythm and style so long as we have ways of identifying the same living christ at the heart of every expression of christian life in common
7811110 oh they are just selling out to the culture so they can fit in and look like they are doing something radical

7811140 the boy just wants to play football he doesnt mind where it is
7811141 he has come to a team that has got plenty of midfield players and hopefully he will add to the competition in that area of the pitch
7811142 he is here because he knows what we can do he has seen us enough
7811143 he knows how our teams play and the attraction for him was to come and play in a team that gets the ball down and plays and passes he wants to get started
7811144 its always welcome when the club brings players in because you need a big squad
7811145 its always good when the club bring good players in and it will create good competition and force everybody to work harder
7811146 but we still need to do more because those who did not make it may have died because they started the treatment late or did not have access to proper nutrition
7811147 i think we are contenders i think we would be that but we wouldnt have any guarantees
7811148 look at tottenham they won the league cup last season but their league form suffered they finished 11th through it and you would have never imagined it with the team they had
7811149 newcastle had a really decent run in the uefa cup two years ago they were unlucky to lose to alkmaar in the quarter finals but the run took a lot out of them and they werent able to sustain their league form so we are capable of contending but whether we are good enough is another issue
7811150 i want us to be involved and it will be a big disappointment if we go out of it
7811151 the maps will show what happened last month and what the police have done about it
7811152 there will be many high crime areas where people dont report to the police because they dont trust the police and they just sort it out between themselves
7811153 if an offender is brought in and asked to empty their pockets
7811154 and drug paraphernalia is found then thats the location of the crime
7811155 i dont think this is going to tackle crime at all
7811156 criminals will gain access to an encyclopaedia of where to go out and commit crime because they know that the police are vulnerable because they dont have the cover in some areas that they like to
7811157 we will seek to reach an agreement on this with grave resolution
7811158 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
7811159 feel an obligation to the people who sent them here
7811160 we were not all on the same side as democrats but we are now
7811161 to discuss ways in which his foundation is addressing some of the worlds most pressing problems
7811162 president clinton understands this is sen obamas convention and he is here to do all he can to make sen obama our next president
7811163 were talking about the nominee for the president of the united states
7811164 there are people who are not going to vote for him because hes black
7811165 and weve got to hope that we can educate people to put aside their racism and to put their own interests no 1
7811166 n o nenhum segredo que comuniquei a minha colega israelense que n o acho que a atividade de assentamentos ajude o processo
7811167 as fronteiras do estado palestino e de israel ser o determinadas por um acordo
7811168 o processo de paz n o ser afetado pela atividade nos assentamentos
7811169 no final das contas a pol tica do governo de israel n o expandir os assentamentos nem construir novos assentamentos nem confiscar terras palestinas
7811170 o papel dos l deres encontrar um modo de viver em paz no futuro e n o deixar que os ru dos relacionados com a situa o no terreno estes dias se introduzam no quarto de negocia o
7811171 pelo que eu sei a atividade nos assentamentos se reduziu da forma mais dram tica sobretudo do outro lado da cerca
7811172 and if i dont play ill be ready for kansas city
7811173 yeah i sure do ive been playing a lot of football so whether you play or dont play in the preseason id be ready no matter what its up to coach i was hoping i could play last week
7811174 because of the media and the fans theres more energy or electricity in the ballpark but you cant bring in a pitcher an inning earlier they dont give you two wins when you beat the yankees so you cant do it differently
7811175 if we put on a run here theres no question we can make it
7811176 theres no question with the number of games we have left its possible
7811177 im just glad at this juncture its at yankee stadium
7811178 im looking forward to it thats what you play baseball for is that type of atmosphere those type of games
7811179 its impossible to do you cant budget for price increases like that
7811180 we had our budgets in back in december well before gas prices really started going up
7811181 for instance if we have volleyball and field hockey going to the same place well try to get them to go together
7811182 just because of the way they are so spread out its the schools in classes i m and s that are really going to feel this
7811183 in class l we have concord to the north and thats about 60 miles then theres keene to the west and the way the schedules alternate in each of the sports we actually only end up making that trip maybe three times a year
7811184 theres been talk of reinstituting the connecticut valley league now one thing was that teams were playing more vermont games than they were new hampshire games
7811185 i wouldnt be surprised if you saw it in a sport like hockey where ice rentals and things like that are involved
7811186 this mandala is being dedicated to the deity of compassion chenrezig in tibetan avalokiteshva in sanskrit
7811187 it shows his celestial mansion and it will take all week to finish
7811188 we have been criss crossing the country for the past nine months to show our culture and at the same time raise money for our monastery in india
7811189 tibetans in india right now are free to practice their culture and religion
7811190 while the chinese have allowed the communities to rebuild the thousands of temples destroyed when the chinese invaded tibetan practices are limited by the government
7811191 why would someone walk into a house if a dog was lost
7811192 i think this right here will be contagious and it will rub off on a lot of people
7811193 i think guys will see how much fun we had and be like man i want to be a part of that
7811194 but the good news is this unsolicited five or six of these guys have already said they want to be part of what we do going forward but we have plenty of time to sort through it they need some time off they really do
7811195 the thing i remember most about kirk was he was a great teacher especially in the offensive line
7811196 he was a real inspiration to a lot of people around him five kids great husband and father and a great coach and one of the finest people ive ever been around as far as how he treated people fairly
7811197 we believe our offense can move the ball on a consistent basis this year
7811198 going against our defense will help them get to that level
7811199 the last three or four days hes been making great decisions
7811200 if he doesnt have his initial reads hes a tremendous athlete and takes care of that himself
7811201 you can see him putting the ball on the money
7811202 its been a good three or four days for him im encouraged like i was in the spring now a little bit more towards the end of fall camp
7811203 overall i would say were much improved especially compared to the past two years ive been here
7811204 there are still a lot of families that have experienced a lot of damage some of which is not covered by insurance we have a state disaster relief fund that is in desperate need of donations from folks that are willing to give
7811205 we want to do everything we can to help the families and individuals who suffered as a result of the tornado
7811206 were very aware that communities have spent considerable dollars in the recovery phase after the tornado and the floods and were very aware that many of them have budgets that are strained which is why were going to expedite the reimbursement process
7811207 its not against the law for people to take photos
7811208 weve had our eye on it for a while and we think its a great thing to be taking place here in our area
7811209 anything that goes on anywhere around us is to our benefit it really is and we encourage that
7811210 its very hard not to think about the olympic games
7811211 very difficult to refocus i mean all my thinking is there in beijing
7811212 in russia if you stop anyone in the street and ask what is a grand slam i dont think many people can tell you but everyone knows the olympic games there is nothing bigger
7811213 people just come to me and say oh im happy for you
7811214 i dont know what is best to be a little bit tired but very comfortable and very positive or to be fresh and not play in the olympic games
7811215 you can have a perfectly nice time once the hangover wears off acknowledge just how bad it is
7811216 its a magical movie you dont have to be a die hard abba fan to love this film but it certainly helps take a chance on loving it
7811217 here is what the catechism of the catholic church says human life must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception
7811218 whether joe biden is as ignorant of what his religion teaches remains to be seen
7811219 so there we have it the man running for president on the democratic ticket supports selective infanticide his running mate is a pro abortion catholic the delegates are wildly out of step with americans on abortion and the speaker of the house hasnt a clue what her religion teaches on the subject
7811220 the monthly numbers of approvals for house purchase which have fallen by some two thirds over the last year levelled off in july it would however be premature to think that the housing market will now start to recover because overall approval activity continues to be very low
7811221 with no sign of credit conditions easing and house prices continuing to fall we expect delinquencies to continue rising and losses to increase over the coming quarters

7811297 the path to get to the point im at now was a really interesting one
7811298 everything i did was leading up to it whether i realized it or not and mostly not it was going towards where im at now
7811299 i did commercial art for some time but i always needed to pretty much make ends meet with other stuff thats when i got into landscaping
7811300 by the time i had finished that wall there was a realization theres something going on here the touch the feel whatever a real connection so i took that and ran with it
7811301 i knew stone was where i wanted to go i got serious about it
7811302 when i do the stone work its as much art as anything i do the way i approach stonework is how shapes fit together and how light affects textures and how sunlight will take a different course during the day and highlight stones or a stone wall
7811303 working in all that 3 d a little light bulb went on id been interested in sculpture but id never done it

7811320 weve seen lots of change technology being the obvious one but the world is more fast paced now than ever and its easy to lose our understanding that all children can learn they learn in different ways and we need to have an understanding of how each one learns the end game for all students is that they go on to be lifelong learners you must be the motivators coaches and cheerleaders for each child

7811338 you have to wonder at the artistry the exceptional skill with which the flint tools have been shaped the neanderthals may have had thicker fingers than us but they were certainly not clumsy
7811339 what is it with the australian media why are they focused on slandering second life as a failure i have recently discussed my research findings of commercial activity within second life with several journalists where only minimal quotes have been used out of their original context in order it seems to support an obvious negative bias
7811340 guys this stuff happens economies just cant grow all the time its not the end of the world and its probably not the end of facebook either
7811341 in terms of customers and perhaps your everyday people there was no evidence of anybody in there i was often the only one wandering around these very impressive sites on my own

7811348 we also have a building sandbox where visitors can hone their virtual creative skills in a safe environment
7811349 i think second life has been a fantastic first setting for all sorts of organisations to learn those fundamental virtual world tools and building skills

7811360 i try to be a handyman but usually ill make things worse then ill call the plumber something like that but for the most part im just watching sports on television
7811361 i look for what they like to do on first second and third down ill just put the tape in and look at all first down passes first and second down runs third down nickel stuff
7811362 everything has to be done for the players by tuesday night
7811363 they all get a book of the game plan it shows the opponents pass plays and runs its a pretty good sized book and it takes a little time to put that together meantime the offensive coaches are off doing their own thing
7811364 we could go until about 11 oclock its like getting ready for a final exam every week you want to have as much knowledge as you can so we try to get everything fed to the players on wednesday
7811365 it all depends what works for you like just talking on the phone with your loved ones or like just paying bills thatll get your mind off it
7811366 i dont have a lot of physical demands in this game but the mental part wears on you
7811367 my wife says im like a woman with pms the last two months of the season it kind of builds up as the year goes on so i need those stress release days to not think about stuff it kind of builds back up wednesday thursday friday and saturday then im pretty revved up on sunday so on tuesday i try not to come in at all if possible i dont have to watch film

7811369 my son races quarter midgets miniature racing cars and i do racing on the computer i do friday nights at atco raceway my daughters getting in the band its just a lot of fun seeing them do things and it makes you realize honestly that football is a job but its not your life
7811370 i think its easier said than done especially if youve had a bad game or you lost
7811371 when that happens you find yourself sitting around thinking about the plays you could have made thats why its important that by this point youve learned to have a short memory
7811372 its a chance to get your heart and your head at 100 percent
7811373 you know its going to be a physical contest so i know im going to be getting off the floor a lot slower playing with the kids
7811374 theres not going to be too much physical conduct in the household as far as playing with the kids or roughhousing because i know im going to be beat up after those games i know
7811375 hell have a chance to review it because a lot of it is on his shoulders wednesday as to how the offense goes
7811376 back in the day nobody knew him but villanova said we want to follow you
7811377 they offered him before anybody else got involved he took an unofficial visit up there its a small school with great academics and he felt comfortable with the whole situation
7811378 last year the mets had a big lead and i think they kind of thought they were a much better team than us
7811379 this year all the games have been close even though theyre 9 4 against us its been close we know were definitely capable of beating them
7811380 we only got to enjoy being in first place for one day
7811381 then it was three and out that kind of sticks with you
7811382 even if we feel we can beat them weve got to play them good weve got to play them better than they do these are big games for us big opportunities
7811383 donovan and l j s were both more extensive and a lot more damage was going on down there so i wouldnt expect to take as long to get back as they took
7811384 definitely said it was smart that we went in there and did it
7811385 he was able to fix what was going on down there and hes pretty optimistic i should have a speedy recovery
7811386 i dont think theres too much of a timetable right now
7811387 right now im just walking im increasing it about a quarter mile each day from what i understand thats all ill be doing for the next week or so down the road ill start jogging and stretching
7811388 i definitely dont want to come back too early and put myself out for more of the season
7811389 i dont have a game in sight but i want to get back out as soon as possible
7811390 you have to be in tune with your body i guess ive never had this injury ill work with the trainers but ultimately its my body and when im ready hopefully ill feel good out there
7811391 i know i started feeling it about three or four days into training camp this year it started giving me problems and it gradually became harder and harder to get through practice i definitely continued to aggravate it and tweak it more
7811392 then there was more than a couple where he splattered just a little bit so the fundamental and technique work there will come into play
7811393 theres a battle there now jason davis is a pretty good fullback there i think he has some skill and ability
7811394 its hard not to look feminine am i right or am i wrong
7811395 but would i do it yeah id do it i dont know how far id get i might look like jerry springer did when he was on
7811396 i think a lot of the guys would do it but probably none of us would be good
7811397 i think maybe donovan mcnabb and omar gaither might do it i think outgoing guys like them might do it but me no no way first of all i cant dance like that maybe i could learn but i just have better things to do with my time than play around with ballroom dancing
7811398 i mean its something thatll bring you a lot of publicity but i dont want that im just a low key type guy who does what i do and moves along
7811399 but you dont hear them saying theyd like to be on the show
7811400 mainly because there are usually professional athletes who are part of the show jerry rice emmitt smith people like that
7811401 but no way i would do it its just not something id want to learn i mean after being on that show where would i go to dance like that even if i learned
7811402 and i dont think id want to spend my off season learning how to ballroom dance when i could be doing something i really enjoy like being on the lake with my boat
7811403 maybe the ballroom dancing i could do but the other stuff sometimes looks too feminine to me
7811404 youve got to do that to pull it off you know what i mean
7811405 even smith rice and taylor had to do things that looked a little bit feminine to pull it off and thats just not for me there are probably a handful of dudes on the eagles who would go on the show but not this cat here

7811431 the tokyo stock exchange is not available for a money game
7811432 the question of why it was ever privatised could be put to more than half the constituents of the tokyo stock exchange the answer is that the presidents of tse listed companies get escorted to their aeroplane seats by a japan airlines stewardess

7811441 its very hard not to think about the olympic games very difficult to refocus
7811442 in russia if you stop anyone in the street and ask what is a grand slam i dont think many people can tell you but everyone knows the olympic games there is nothing bigger
7811443 i think we have an ethical responsibility to protect our police officers as well as residents
7811444 as a mother i see the officers out there especially when the kids are coming home from school
7811445 were being faced with big salary increases and other budgetary requirements as well
7811446 its not that we were not going to fill the position we were just looking at the overall picture so we didnt have to raise taxes
7811447 this wasnt an exercise in trying to get rid of shannons position
7811448 i think its our job to ask questions all the time
7811449 the townspeople over the past two years have been very satisfied with the service they get
7811450 the voters approved the budget with 10 officers in it last year going backwards isnt a good idea
7811451 we have to work through the process again because everything was on hold
7811452 the fourth defensive tackle is a guy by the name of klecko
7811453 he looks good to me right now he had a good game the other night and hes had a great camp
7811454 ive been hearing that hes a long shot since ive been in the nfl
7811455 they said i was too small to be a nose tackle up in new england
7811456 i just put it out of my mind and go play
7811457 he has good football sense and he loves to play hes a high motor guy im not going to say he hasnt surprised me some im not quite as surprised after being around him a bit
7811458 honestly if you guys had not just told me id have no idea what was said
7811459 ive got to get through this week and then hopefully when the roster for st louis the season opener comes youre name is still there im just going to keep doing what i did to get here keep pushing
7811460 to tell truth id only lost about 10 pounds to go down to fullback
7811461 putting the weight back on wasnt the problem it was eating all that chicken and salad to get it off in the first place
7811462 switching back to tackle was easy you just go back to what you know the only thing was you had to get back in that pass rushing and run stuffing mind set it wasnt a big deal
7811463 i had to learn the whole front seven in new england
7811464 it was just as complicated up there dont get me wrong because im still learning but i think its going ok
7811465 fortunately i dont think im going to miss too much of the season
7811466 i dont know what exactly the procedure was but they had to go in both sides and fix them
7811467 he told me not to compare this to other injuries because theyre completely different
7811468 both donovan and l j s were a lot more extensive and had a lot more damage i wouldnt expect it to take as long as they took to get back
7811469 but i figured id have the surgery now and get back as soon as possible they havent given me a timetable its kind of see how it feels as you go as time passes well have a better idea when ill be back out there
7811470 i know ive had issues down there since my days in st louis
7811471 its gotten worse over the years i know i started feeling it in training camp about 3 or 4 days into it it started giving me problems and it gradually became harder and harder to get through practice with it after the carolina game it got to a point where it was hard to deal with
7811472 football players youre going to have to play through some pain sometimes
7811473 i underestimated it a little bit i just figured it was one of those things you played through and eventually it got better but it didnt
7811474 i definitely dont want to come back too early and put myself out for more of the season
7811475 im going to be back out there when i know i cant do more damage to it you dont want to lose more time you want to make sure its right i dont know what the magic formula is but ill know when im ready
7811476 when somebody gets hurt we go with the next guy who steps up and plays
7811477 thats just our mentality wed like to have kevin back as quick as possible hes a really good player i think hes a little underrated and hes a good player wed like him back as quick as we can in the meantime we have some pretty good players that will be able to step up and play at a high level
7811478 this is a free country this is england i can walk where the fucking hell i like you ugly bitch
7811479 i dont know whats going to happen i would assume that hell probably say no and if thats the case so be it ill get some practice today and tomorrow well be ok

7811511 the issues of uncoordinated house searches and harassing civilians have also been of concern to the government of afghanistan which has been shared with the commanders of international forces in afghanistan unfortunately to date our demands have not been addressed rather more civilians including women and children are losing their lives as a result of air raids

7811528 the rigorous trial design and the fact that all three primary endpoints were met with statistical significance reinforce the quality of the data supporting the potential for azilect to have an effect on disease progression
7811529 the successful outcome of the study provides further rationale for the early use of azilect among parkinsons disease patients
7811530 delaying disease progression is the most important unmet need in the management of parkinsons disease
7811531 the adagio study the first of its kind was prospectively designed to demonstrate if azilect can slow down the progression of parkinsons disease results of the study show that early treatment with once daily rasagiline 1mg tablets provided significant clinical benefits that were not obtained by those patients where initiation of azilect therapy was delayed by nine months

7811541 its not 100 per cent but were certainly moving in the right direction

7811547 was jetzt noch nicht zu tage tritt ist dass damit auch die rentenerwartung f r zuk nftige rentnerjahrg nge sinkt w hrend im oecd durchschnitt ein arbeitnehmer der heute 1000 euro verdient eine rente von 730 euro zu erwarten hat sind f r ihn in deutschland ganze 400 euro rente vorgesehen damit ist millionenfache altersarmut gesetzlich programmiert das ist ein skandal dass unter diesen voraussetzungen der private konsum das deutsche wirtschaftswachstum nach unten zieht wie vom statistischen bundesamt heute bekanntgegeben ist nicht berraschend in einer solchen situation muss die regierung handeln sie muss die infrastruktur ausbauen die lohnpolitik muss wieder darauf ausgerichtet werden dass sich die einkommen entsprechend der produktivit t und der preissteigerungen entwickeln die gesetze die wie hartz iv zum lohndumping einladen m ssen ge ndert und der allgemeine gesetzliche mindestlohn endlich eingef hrt werden

7811552 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
7811553 feel an obligation to the people who sent them here
7811554 we were not all on the same side as democrats but we are now
7811555 to discuss ways in which his foundation is addressing some of the worlds most pressing problems
7811556 president clinton understands this is sen obamas convention and he is here to do all he can to make sen obama our next president
7811557 were talking about the nominee for the president of the united states
7811558 there are people who are not going to vote for him because hes black
7811559 and weve got to hope that we can educate people to put aside their racism and to put their own interests no 1
7811560 we are now controlling most of the key government offices to prevent them from coming to work

7811570 we looked at the blueprint at what weve been doing and made some intelligent decisions without really panicking everybody
7811571 people are expecting penn to be old news and washed up we want them to think that
7811572 to get the swagger back we need to start winning games if you keep losing nobodys going to respect you we came in here expecting to win championships if not the first year the second year if not the second year at some point now our times kind of running out were getting a little antsy you can sense it especially with the older guys
7811573 you just keep plugging away each year everybody comes in with a clean slate i like being the underdog really it just makes us hungrier we want to show people what we can do
7811574 before we spent an awful lot of time making sure they didnt get too confident
7811575 now you have to be really concerned that you build enough confidence its a fragile program from that sense
7811576 we have to get some of the kids buying back into everything believing they can win the tight games thats one reason we went with a whole new approach
7811577 where do avatars go when their owners die of old age

7811579 conversar sin interesarse por el resultado de la verdad es entonces quien miente con m s habilidad en las opiniones sobre temas pol ticos econ micos y culturales lo primero de todo es que la verdad tiene que estar encima de la mesa no la ideolog a
7811580 es necesario ese di logo en que la verdad y el bien com n sean el tema de conversaci n y que los t cnicos den los elementos para conversar
7811581 hoy se habla mucho de democracia inclusi n y de di logo pero hay que quitarse las caretas y que cada uno realmente sostenga si cree en el di logo que lo ejerza si cree en la democracia que la viva si cree en la libre discusi n de las ideas que respete y tambi n exponga las suyas y as seremos el pa s que queremos ser
7811582 es una pena contemplar de pronto c mo el pa s se encrespa y empieza a haber una situaci n un poco sorprendente
7811583 son nuestras familias nuestros amigos nuestra realidad y territorio es la estima por este pa s y el deseo de superaci n
7811584 es perfectamente compatible un buen nivel econ mico una buena situaci n social y al mismo tiempo un cuidado de una calidad de vida
7811585 el rol de la iglesia debe quedarse en iluminar a trav s de los principios que ayuden a los que sienten que tienen la fe cat lica que la experiencia de dos mil a os lleva a la iglesia a conformar la doctrina social que procura el bien com n en una sociedad

7811589 derzeit wird mit 3d internet noch viel experimentiert fast t glich kommen neue angebote auf den markt
7811590 fest steht dass die vielen kinder und jugendlichen die sich bereits heute in virtuellen welten aufhalten das auch in zukunft tun werden dadurch wird das marktpotenzial f r 3d internetwelten in den kommenden jahren enorm ansteigen
7811591 welche dieser plattformen berleben werden l sst sich zum heutigen zeitpunkt noch nicht absch tzen
7811592 ob die user jedoch langfristig diesem 3d chat treu bleiben oder eine neue virtuelle heimat suchen ist so kurz nach dem start schwer zu sagen
7811593 tatsache ist dass all diese launches und ank ndigungen zeigen dass die zeit des web 3d gekommen ist
7811594 bei hard drive partys geht es um pizza bier und den austausch von inhalten von 500 gigabyte festplatten die mit tausenden von musikst cken bef llt sind
7811595 derartige filesharer partys sind f r uns schon seit geraumer zeit keine neuheit mehr sondern ein bekanntes problem
7811596 das kind hat jetzt nur einen neuen namen bekommen das problem bleibt aber dasselbe
7811597 nat rlich ist diese entwicklung ein riesenproblem f r die musikindustrie im grunde genommen geht es dabei aber nicht um das problem der raubkopien sondern um das der speichermedien
7811598 diejenigen die meinen dass ihnen diese musik zusteht werden zudem wohl immer einen weg finden sich diese auf illegalem wege anzueignen
7811599 f r uns ist die gegenw rtige entwicklung ein deutliches indiz daf r dass unsere bisherige strategie im kampf gegen online piraterie juristisch h rter durchzugreifen richtig war
7811600 youtube arbeitet nicht erst seit gestern mit einer ganzen reihe von partnern aus dem medienbereich zusammen mit konzernen wie verlagen oder tv sendern haben wir bereits seit einiger zeit sehr gute erfahrungen gemacht

7811610 ob arbeiter oder selbstst ndige ost oder westdeutsch barack obama erzielt werte unter den deutschen w hlern von denen deutsche politiker nur tr umen k nnen
7811611 es ist die sehnsucht der deutschen nach einem politiker mit charisma die diese werte erkl rt
7811612 200 000 berliner sind nicht zur siegess ule gepilgert um zu h ren was obama da eigentlich sagt es ging darum wie er es sagt dass er einfach da ist und diese ausstrahlung hat dieses charisma was wir hier so vermissen
7811613 the essence of the workshop is to ensure a smooth 2008 hajj operation
7811614 the workshop should inject new ideas that would improve on how to perform a successful hajj hajjul mabrur and welfare services of the fct contingent to the holy land
7811615 fct pilgrims affairs has put everything in place towards a successful 2008 hajj operation
7811616 any payments after the deadline shall not be entertained as a federal government policy of non sponsorship of pilgrims the directorate would like to make the public note that the fct administration still up holds this policy
7811617 i would also like to use this medium to inform the public that the secretariat of the directorate has been relocated from gwagwalada to the central business district cbd abuja

7811623 basically its a headband with a hairstyle attached to it
7811624 i wanted to make something that was a little bit more accessible for anyone for any age i have a cousin thats 6 years old and she loves it
7811625 so its basically having a hair do where you dont have to go to the salon you just put it on right away and you have great hair
7811626 my mom has them my sister some of my girlfriends its just been really easy for the summer especially with the weather my hair gets really frizzy in this weather so its been great having the bandit
7811627 and when they have tidily given them a good scraping and a final polish do you think then that there will be any room for awe on easter island
7811628 where were sitting and everything we can split with the mets and still win our division
7811629 i look at our schedule and everything and id say getting to sept 15 and being close to where we are at gives us a chance
7811630 if we can stay with them we can beat other people too
7811631 but if they dominate us they are going to put some distance between us
7811632 its not acceptable that a major wall street firm isnt participating
7811633 we believe that post games and for a long period of time these venues will be used pretty well
7811634 the management companies will immediately open them up for public use
7811635 do you agree mr saito with mr kitabata that shareholders are corrupt and greedy
7811636 if i can only take one of them on my bicycle
7811637 that the system breaks down when the last person who knew about the previous crisis retires
7811638 i tamb ho farem servir com a exemple de com pujar un v deo al youtube
7811639 ive been on the ballot a few times but i hope something happens i would just be so honored and happy if it happened i dont know what i would do id be so thrilled

7811642 heres a baseball bat were going up the road for a smoke
7811643 that big on our back sounds good to me and were ready to get after it
7811644 i think if we dont make it to the acc championship we let some people down
7811645 theres an entire generation of kids who have no idea smu used to be a good football program
7811646 if we recruited a kid to hawaii who was being recruited by a pac 10 school we were probably 1 for 150 on those kids
7811647 here before i even played a football game i had 14 commitments of top high school kids for the 09 season thats the biggest difference
7811648 we want to be no 1 and were going to have to fight for it
7811649 its like going to a mercedes benz dealer and deciding which color you want they all run the same
7811650 shane on first 10 foot lead posada knows shane hook slides so hes gonna throw to the inside part of the base
7811651 shane goes posada throws umpire calls him out bang here come 12 different replays and they all show shanes hook slide avoided the tag they dont reverse the call yankees win the game
7811652 they say it will slow down the games it takes 2 seconds to re rack the tape you know what slows down games lou piniella going out there to argue for 4 minutes kicking dirt
7811653 and van brocklin would throw it and mcdonald wasnt there and van brocklin would get really hissed
7811654 mcdonald had tripped i could see that on my monitors in the truck but the fan watching at home didnt know that i wanted the fan to see what i saw
7811655 took it back to new york somebody erased it or taped over it which is what happened to the first super bowl which i directed
7811656 no royalties because i was an employee at cbs and no emmy i dont know why maybe it was an anti italian backlash
7811657 called the truck and said my boy what you have done here will have such far reaching implications we cant begin to imagine them today
7811658 he had to do everything had to shoot the biggest water buffalo but he couldnt have invented instant replay because he was never in the truck he never directed he never punched the buttons
7811659 tony verna son of italian immigrants invented the instant replay
7811660 because it changed something that had never been done before
7811661 just let the kids play how to stop other adults from ruining your childs fun and success in youth sports
7811662 its very hard not to think about the olympic games
7811663 very difficult to refocus i mean all my thinking is there in beijing
7811664 we have been developing partnership relations with nato for quite a while but we do not need the illusion of partnership
7811665 we are ready for any decision even halting relations as a whole
7811666 when we are surrounded by a huge number of military bases and they say everything is in order we dont like it
7811667 we believe that cooperation between nato and russia has always been and remains mutually beneficial
7811668 as was decided at the last nato meeting we cannot continue cooperating with russia s usual since it is not observing the six point peace plan nonetheless we will of course follow the development of events closely and regularly reassess our attitude toward the events but we want to keep all channels of communication with russia we do not intend to break off any contacts
7811669 in connection with the halt of the functioning of the russia nato council we have taken a timeout on the military line with the alliance it is hard to say today the time when gen maslov will go to brussels
7811670 our economy its individual sectors and most of all agriculture are bearing a high enough load we do not see or feel hardly any pluses that does not mean that we should refuse strategic movement in the wto but it is necessary to clarify relations with our partners
7811671 inform a number of our partners in the wto of the renunciation of agreements that contradict its interests
7811672 beginning with trade in meat elements of aviation technology and ending with questions of intellectual property
7811673 they were all concluded with the understanding that our partners would help us complete the wto accession process quickly our partners told us that and those agreements are in the balance
7811674 those obligations that we consider restrictive for our economy were suspended until such time as russia is a full member of the wto
7811675 russia is one of the candidate countries that as a gesture of goodwill are taking on obligations before its accession
7811676 it has the right to renounce them however the process of accession to the wto assumes the easy course of negotiations in search of mutually acceptable agreement of course russia is in a unique situation but russias decision can hardly be considered a normal thing
7811677 now is the time when there are chances and very good possibilities for the solution of the transdniestria problem
7811678 russia is ready to make every effort for the final settlement of the transdniestrian crisis
7811679 we dont know right now because thats what goldman is doing
7811680 capital access is more restricted now in the film business than its been in a decade
7811681 because the film business is hit driven there is enormous risk when financing films and the current credit squeeze has lessened investors appetite for risk
7811682 we feel that we closed the merrill lynch deal for ua when the market was a very tough market and we continue to have consultations with financial alternatives in the marketplace for financing an mgm slate

7811684 the arrest is part of an ongoing investigation by lancashire constabulary and greater manchester counter terrorism unit
7811685 for some people having a fry up with bacon and sausages might seem like a good way to start the day
7811686 but if you are doing this regularly then you are significantly increasing your risk of bowel cancer which is one of the most common cancers in the uk
7811687 this is important because there is convincing evidence excess body fat increases risk of six different types of cancer
7811688 over 50 per cent of cancer patients in nigeria are women
7811689 government is doing its best now but it is left for people to know what is happening particularly the women in rural areas
7811690 over 50 per cent of cancer that you see in the country happens to women if it is not cervix it is womb or breast and this cancer is preventable
7811691 it is advisable for any woman to check or palpitate her breast regularly soon after her monthly menstruation
7811692 a woman who has passed menopause should not think she is becoming young again when she suddenly starts bleeding
7811693 anyone who continues to experience nagging cough sudden voice crack hoarse voice mole or dark mark on the skin and itching should see a doctor
7811694 you should worry about these signs because some of them may turn out to be skin cancer and you cannot afford to play with such things
7811695 in other words about one machine is serving 20 million people in nigeria which is a terrible situation for the country but i am glad that government has identified the solution
7811696 i think the government should declare the niger delta an emergency area with a 12 months development plan as plan a and another 15 years programme as plan b
7811697 my salary every month is a huge joke and i just wonder how i survive with my family
7811698 i live in one room on theoutskirts of the city gwagwa and my family is in enugu
7811699 we bought a kilo of meat for n400 in 2006 but today it is n800 and still threatening to rise while vegetable cost four times more
7811700 but it is worse because of the higher cost of rent transport and feeding some
7811701 my house rent will be due by the end of this month and i dont have any hope of renewing it because i have collected a loan from the co operative to meet some other needs in the family
7811702 it is not easy i have to sell some of my wrappers to pay my childs ssce registration fee
7811703 such promises most times do not materialise as i have to make do with the little they give me before leaving home
7811704 i really do not have a choice because i know that if they have they would give me
7811705 a civilian commercial transport boat which plies the yenagoa fropa southern ijaw route of bayelsa state was attacked by the men of the military joint task force jtf on sunday august 24 2008 by about 16 30 hours
7811706 the jtfs explanation of the attack which led to the death of 12 passengers and one critically injured survivor made up of students women and children was that they heard the sound of gunfire minutes before the emergence of the passenger boat
7811707 this unfortunate killing of innocent civilians again calls for the replacement of the military task force with the police in civilian areas
7811708 we have received a report about the hijacking of this vessel
7811709 i have never seen a society where in the course of demanding for more development destroys the only thing it has
7811710 we mothers in sabon lugbe community on airport road abuja wish to bring to your notice plans by the federal capital territory administration through its development control department to demolish our houses without any relocation plans for us
7811711 you are aware that late last week there were changes in the command structure of some of the service organisations
7811712 the chief of army staff is new the chief of defence staff is new and all others that we invited they are yet to formally take over from their predecessors and they have requested the speaker to please give them time to formally take over and assume duties
7811713 the task of youth development has become so onerous that my administration is working on a blueprint of a public private partnership ppp on youth empowerment whereby the private sector will take very active interest and role alongside the public sector
7811714 the event of today which seeks to institutionalise the principle and practice of youth participation in governance and public administration is a great accomplishment when placed against the background of international best practices thereby ensuring participation of our young people in the process of policy formulation and implementation especially on issues that affect them
7811715 this institution of a youth parliament therefore is one of the numerous youth oriented programmes of this administration
7811716 nigerian politics needs new blood and this parliament will provide it i urge all of you here to take this occasion seriously because you are future parliamentarians and the tasks ahead of you are myriad
7811717 representatives of their various constituencies whose views and aspirations they are here to articulate and propagate

7811953 people who drink alcohol need to be fully aware of the damage that can be done to their health by excess on this our two organisations agree
7811954 in our view the british medical association is wrong to press the government to deter the minority by punishing the majority with higher taxes that is also the view of the large majority of the public which overwhelmingly rejects your case for higher taxation

7811959 clearly the inner tissues of plants are a biological niche for microbial life that warrants further exploration
7811960 it is a niche that can be readily explored by undergraduate students the potential to explore something so completely unknown gets the students very excited about science
7811961 the chronic features of tuberculosis in these patients suggest that extensively drug resistant tuberculosis may be acquired through previous treatments that include second line drugs aggressive management of this infectious disease is feasible and can prevent high mortality rates and further transmission of drug resistant strains
7811962 48 per cent of patients with xdr tuberculosis often termed untreatable in press reports responded favourably to treatment
7811963 keshavjee and colleagues have shown that both mdr and xdr tuberculosis can be cured with aggressive treatment with use of the most effective antituberculosis drugs available

7812036 i think you can see from this cynical blog entry that microsoft is behind the push to make sure gnu linux is contaminated by proprietary blobs why and what the plan is i dont know but if microsofts john carroll really believed that refusing proprietary modules was going to be bad for linux would he stay silent and let it happen or would he write about how foolish it is you decide i know i have and the novell deal helps me to think it through as to what microsofts motive might be by the way note the lwn news picks that shows the end of the conversation with the decision that there would be no such deadline to ban non gpl linked modules in spite of what carroll inaccurately reported sheesh

7812070 medina explained that it was the decision of the city secretary city attorney and commissioners to place the item on the agenda so to provide our committee with
7812071 according to jim goza at tuesday meeting the request came from the committee members who is lying medina or goza according to all of the commissioners who spoke on the issue they were surprised to see the item on the agenda and felt like things should be left to the committee again who is lying goza or medina or the city commissioners either goza or medina is lying the liar should step forward and resign from city government yea i am on the floor laughing too if we know one of the two is lying how can we trust them to be an advisor on the charter review committee we cannot mz is 100 correct in seeking a chair goza and medina cannot be trusted to lead this effort we saw the proof at tuesdays meeting it is clear to me that the city commission coward in front of mz tuesday night because they had no choice they got caught trying to make the charter review committee a rubber stamp of their wishes garza was the most pathetic member of the commission for going after mz personally this is how tyrants work before mz spoke ss officer lawyer goza reminder mz no personal statements or direct comments to the commissioners allowed you would think we were in gozas nazi germany did you see goza stand up and challenge garza when he went after mz personally you see in gozas little world of no free speech we the people cannot directly address the commission as it relates to their failures but commissioner garza can attack any citizen he wants ss officer lawyer goza is truly an embarrassment to the legal profession i guess goza and guerra can get away with silencing all dissenting speech when you have the financial backing and political support of ss officer lawyer gamez in my view the charter review committee needs to learn the lesson from last time around too many changes can result in a complete failure we clearly need a change as to recall the way it is currently written recall is not an option for the citizens of brownsville the compadre system in regards to employment is costing this city a fortune in incompetent leadership the charter review committee should recommend that the city manager have a masters in public administration such as in every major city in texas they should recommend that the head of personnel have a masters in personnel management or administration they should mandate that all directors have either a masters in their field or a professional license in the alternative these simple changes will bring about significant improvement to the city of brownsville empowering the people to remove incompetent commissioners or an incompetent mayor would bring about meaningful change to brownsville city government mandating minimum educational levels for key positions within the city of brownsville would end the compadre system in hiring and make competence the first rule of thumb when directors are hired if this city commission expects the people to give them anything in this process they better accept that they are going to have to give the people something if the commissioners are willing to support these basic changes which are non political as to any one person on the commission i would support health insurance benefits for the commissioners as a compromise it is 8 000 square miles nearly the size of new jersey according to the marine consortiums annual measurement completed in july

7812118 ibn hajar al asqalani said the book of malik is sound by all the criteria that are demanded as proofs in the mursal munqati two types of hadith which have a missing link and other types of transmission then as suyuti followed what ibn hajar said here and said the mursal hadith in it are a proof with him i e as well because the mursal is a proof with us when it is properly supported every mursal in the muwatta has one or more supports as will be made clear in this commentary i e suyutis commentary on al muwatta called tanwir al hawalik it is absolutely correct to say that the muwatta is sound without exception ibn abdal barr collected together all the mursal munqati and muaddil hadiths in the muwatta and said that the total number of hadiths in the muwatta which do not have an isnad are sixty one he stated that he found the isnads of all of them in other sources with the exception of four hadiths the erudite scholar of hadith shaykh muhammad habibullah ibn mayabi ash shanqiti says in idaa al halik that he had found witnesses for these four hadith and he then mentioned these witnesses he said some of the people of knowledge made these isnads complete he mentioned from ibn abdal barr that there was no munkar rejected hadith in the muwatta nor anything fundamentally refuted
7812119 no munkar hadith in the muwatta nor anything fundamentally rejected
7812120 rather he umar ordered ubayy ibn kab to lead the people with 11 rakats
7812121 verily the holy prophet peace be upon him in the month of ramadan used to perform 20 rakats and the witr prayer afterwards without congregation
7812122 criticism of hadith among muslims with reference to sunan ibn maja
7812123 shafii also recognises a weak hadith as authentic sahih if it is found to be accepted by the whole ummah see al sakhawi fath al mugith but he does not accept maliks view of restricting the practise to the people of madinah according to the later scholars of the hanafi school like ibn al humam a hadith will be declared sahih if it is supported by the practise of the ummah see abdal rashid numani ma tamusu ilaihe al haja pg 18 among traditionalists tirmidhi often remarks after quoting a less authentic hadith it is being practised by the people of learning ahl al ilm suyuti deduces it indicates that the hadith is supported by the sayings of the people of learning more than one scholar has said that a hadith is declared sahih if supported by the sayings of the people of learning even if it lacks a proper isnad see suyuti a folio 20
7812124 one of the factors from which the authenticity of a hadith is known is that the learned ulama may conform to it which is a proof of its being sound vide
7812125 it has been proven without doubt that ubayy ibn kab allah be pleased with him used to lead the companions during ramadan for 20 rakats and 3 rakats of witr hence it is the principle maslak of most of the ulama that this is the sunnah because ubayy ibn kab led 20 rakats of prayer in the presence of the muhajirin the emigrants and the ansars the helpers and not a single companion repudiated it
7812126 for two nights the holy prophet peace be upon him led twenty
7812127 all the traditionalists muhaddithin are unanimous about the soundness of this report
7812128 imam abu yusuf rahimahullah asked imam abu hanifah rahimahullah did hadrat umar allah be pleased with him have any compact from the holy prophet peace be upon him for 20
7812129 umar ali as well as other companions allah be pleased with them all and sufyan al thauri ibn al mubarak and imam allahs mercy be upon them all believed in 20
7812130 at last unanimity was formed on 20 rakats of prayer and this alone is in succession
7812131 i have seen the companions and other people in makkah saying 23 rakats including the witr
7812132 there has been the companions consensus ijma as sahaba on 20 rakats of taraweeh
7812133 not even one of the the four imams believes in less than 20 rakats of taraweeh the practise and belief of the majority of the companions was also this imam malik allahs mercy be upon him believes in more than 20 rakats he is positive that they are 36 according to imam maliks practise only 20 rakats of taraweeh will be said in congregation but the general practise and method of the citizens of madinah was that during the brief rest interval after every 4 rakats when the imam sat down after 4 rakats they used to perform 4 more rakats the men who said the taraweeh in the sacred mosque at makkah used to circumambulate tawaf the kaba during this brief recess the people of madinah naturally could not circumambulate the kaba and hence instead they used to perform 16 rakats more in total during these brief recesses
7812134 the number of rakats in the taraweeh is twenty imam shafii and imam ahmed allahs mercy be upon them assert the same thing their proof is the report which bayhaqi has with genuine authority narrated from saib ibn yazid the great companions including umar uthman and ali may allah be pleased with them as also the revered successors tabiin used to perform twenty rakats
7812135 the most excellent and the most advisable course to conform to is that of the holy prophets and his peace and blessings be upon him companions practise
7812136 who are the salafiyya are they the people who conform to the way of the holy prophet peace be upon him his companions may allah be pleased with them all and their successors this includes the four mujtahid imams allahs mercy be upon them consensus on 20 rakats or is it the likes of al albani and his followers
7812137 in our time ibn abdal wahhab najdi appeared and attacked the two noble sanctuaries makkah and madinah he claimed to be a hanbali but his thinking was such that only he alone was a muslim and everyone else was a polytheist under this guise he said that killing the ahl as sunnah was permissible until allah destroyed them wahhabis in the year 1233 ah by way of the muslim army
7812138 the sign of the khawarij the first deviant sect that appeared in the time of the companions concerning the shaving of the head was not found in the khawarij of the past but only in the najdis of our time
7812139 ibn abdal wahhab arose in the beginning of the thirteenth islamic century in the najd his thinking was false and his beliefs were corruptional on these grounds he opened the way for killing the ahl as sunnah
7812140 ibn abdal wahhab however went far beyond this i e of ibn taymiyya raised in the wastelands of najd in central arabia he had little access to mainstream muslim scholarship i say this may be disputed by his supporters in fact when his

7812144 maybe we should have had a discussion before policy is sic put out there publicly mr adams said
7812145 a lot of points and concern about the policy during the meeting
7812146 the basis is right its how you get there and there are some people who have great difficultly in organising a 12 year old to get to school when they dont want to go to school he said
7812147 a lot of us are uncomfortable about this policy but it was a rudd labor commitment and kevin rudd confirmed that yesterday that its a promise he will be keeping she told abc radio today
7812148 i think its fair to say there is a great deal of concern within the caucus
7812149 its a pretty extreme organisation thats got extreme powers that doesnt confront anybody else in australian society he said
7812150 i dont think we need to keep this at the extreme end of where it is at the moment i think we should be able to wind that back somewhat before 2010

7812188 congratulations to michael phelps for winning eight olympic gold medals i applaud him and his mother for speaking about ad hd mr phelps shows that its possible to go beyond coping with ad hd and truly achieve his candor addresses stigma and hopefully will inspire others to seek help
7812189 its important for people living with ad hd to pursue interests they enjoy and at which they excel
7812190 phelpss success demonstrates that being a part of a supportive family setting goals engaging in enjoyable activities and receiving positive feedback are all important in building self esteem phelps is clearly an exceptionally talented athlete and a source of pride for the millions of people affected by ad hd
7812191 among men there is a deep stigma associated with seeking treatment for ad hd i hope that michael phelpss openness conveys to young men that its okay to seek treatment that it is part of a wise game plan
7812192 its obvious to everyone who watched the olympic games that mr phelps has an engaged supportive and enthusiastic family who helped him find his right fit with swimming
7812193 the new figures on junior doctor working hours are worrying
7812194 there is plenty of time for hospitals to address the challenges of junior doctors moving to a 48 hour week but it is important that the change is carefully managed so that the reduction in working hours does not negatively impact on the quality of junior doctor training or patient care we need to ensure that junior doctors can acquire the skills and experience required to practise safely within the new limit on working hours it may also be necessary for the length of time it takes to qualify as a consultant in some specialties to be increased particularly in surgical specialties

7812201 the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
7812202 mr president former secretary of state colin powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
7812203 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
7812204 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
7812205 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective
7812206 governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government

7812212 the tools of conquest do not necessarily come with bombs and explosions and fallout there are weapons that are simply thoughts attitudes prejudices to be found only in the minds of men
7812213 for the record prejudices can kill and suspicion can destroy and a thoughtless frightened search for a scapegoat has a fallout all its own for the children and the children yet unborn
7812214 a media campaign to create a wedge between the american people and their government
7812215 in the 1920s a failed austrian painter published a book in which he explained his intention to build an aryan super state in germany and take revenge on europe and eradicate the jews
7812216 the world ignored hitlers words and paid a terrible price
7812217 we must remember always that accusation is not proof and that conviction depends upon evidence and due process of law
7812218 it demands the deep analysis and the sober contemplation of every american
7812219 i would say some people thought we were going to die
7812220 it was obvious to me that there was depressurisation in the cabin but there was no announcement and no evidence of the cabin crew for most of this experience why on earth didnt they give a few more calming words to the passengers
7812221 mine wasnt filling up with oxygen and neither was my sons he was hyperventilating i looked at the lady on my left and hers hadnt filled up either
7812222 the oxygen masks were working the correct safety procedures were followed
7812223 they cant be making passenger announcements when they have their oxygen masks on
7812224 as the passengers confirmed the pilot did make an announcement once he got down to 8 000 feet where it is safe to take the oxygen masks off that they were diverting to limoges

7812233 lord jesus im tired of chasing minnows im tired of living for lesser things im through wasting the precious gift of life today to the best of my ability and by the best of my knowledge i turn my life over to you i ask you to forgive me for the sin of neglect the sin of rebellion and the sin of ignorance my sins are too many to count the bible says you died to pay for my sins i dont understand how this could be but i want to get in on it please forgive me thank you

7812236 post code prescribing is rife in the uk with some patients getting access to life extending treatments ahead of a nice decision whilst others are left to die myeloma uk wants to engage with the department of health to find a solution to this growing issue
7812237 these survey findings reveal the dismal state of uk cancer management
7812238 despite significant advances in the treatment of myeloma such as revlimid the majority of patients cannot get access to new life extending drugs until they have been appraised and approved by nice a process that can take up to three years from when the drug is first licensed in the uk
7812239 patients with active myeloma require effective treatment to improve their chances of survival the impact of waiting even a month for treatment can result in a life or death situation
7812240 the provision of funding for treatments currently undergoing nice appraisal is a matter for local pcts and nice has no role in those local decisions
7812241 the department of health has issued guidance to the nhs that makes it clear that funding for a treatment should not be withheld simply because nice guidance does not exist

7812280 everybody knows that sleep is important yet the function of sleep seems like the mythological phoenix
7812281 we dont understand the purpose of sleep but it must be important because all animals do it
7812282 the very fact that dolphins have developed the remarkable specialization rather than merely getting rid of sleep altogether should count as evidence that sleep must serve some essential function and cannot be eliminated
7812283 sleep may be the price you pay so your brain can be plastic the next day
7812284 while there may still be no consensus on why animals need to sleep it would seem that searching for a core function of sleep particularly at the cellular level is still a worthwhile exercise

7812300 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
7812301 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic

7812369 emmett rise e si chin sul tavolo allungando un pugno verso il fratello
7812370 cosa devo fare per convincerti non stai dormendo e non sei nemmeno morta sono qui e ti amo ti ho amata sempre e sempre ti amer ho pensato a te visto il tuo volto nei ricordi durante ogni minuto di lontananza dirti che non ti volevo pi stata una terribile bestemmia
7812371 di tre cose ero del tutto certa primo edward era un vampiro secondo una parte di lui chiss quale e quanto importante aveva sete del mio sangue terzo ero totalmente incondizionatamente innamorata di lui
7812372 quando la carta mi tagli il dito lo alzai per esaminare il danno dalla ferita invisibile colava una minuscola goccia di sangue poi accadde tutto molto velocemente edward si lanci verso di me scagliandomi dallaltra parte del tavolo ero caduta vicino al pianoforte gettando le braccia in avanti per proteggermi in mezzo alle schegge di vetro affilate dal polso al gomito ormai il dolore minvadeva acuto e bruciante confusa e disorientata cercai di non badare al rosso vivo del sangue che mi colava dal braccio e incrociai gli sguardi eccitati di sei vampiri improvvisamente famelici
7812373 nel silenzio assoluto unintuizione improvvisa rimise ogni dettaglio al suo posto cera qualcosa di cui edward non aveva voluto parlarmi qualcosa che jacob non mi avrebbe tenuta nascosta qualcosa che aveva attirato i cullen e i lupi nella foresta e li aveva fatti avvicinare pericolosamente tuttavia stavo aspettando proprio quel momento lo temevo ed ero pronta ad affrontarlo malgrado desiderassi con tutta me stessa che non arrivasse mai ma i miei guai non potevano aver fine vero
7812374 prima di te bella la mia vita era una notte senza luna molto buia ma con qualche stella punti di luce e razionalit poi hai attraversato il cielo come una meteora allimprovviso tutto ha preso fuoco cera luce cera bellezza quando sei sparita la meteora scomparsa dietro lorizzonte e il buio tornato non era cambiato nulla ma i miei occhi erano rimasti accecati non vedevo pi le stelle niente aveva pi senso
7812375 se vuoi che sia io a compiere il gesto lo far ma a una condizione
7812376 il tempo passa anche quando sembra impossibile anche quando il rintocco di ogni secondo fa male come il sangue che pulsa nelle ferite passa in maniera disuguale tra strani scarti e bonacceprolungate ma passa persino per me
7812377 prometto di amarti per sempre ogni singolo giorno per leternit mi vuoi sposare

7812391 it only toughens our resolve to do an operation like this
7812392 the result of this operation thus far has been a huge blow to the enemys ability to plant major ieds and more to plant them along highway 1 in southern kandahar
7812393 its thrown them off balance and well continue to maintain the momentum to keep them off balance in that specific area
7812394 this is our last hurrah this is the battlegroups last push to clear pashmul
7812395 it is literally a massive reflection of how far the canadian army has come over the last few years
7812396 all these individuals have said they wont even attempt to make a claim for compensation because they will be found out by the taliban and they will be killed
7812397 this is a historically significant operation for this rotation and its effects are very important in the context of the campaign at this time
7812398 this discovery enables us to offer the first genetic tests to families affected by the inherited form of this disease
7812399 furthermore because there already are drugs in development that target the same gene in adult cancers we can soon begin testing those drugs in children with neuroblastoma
7812400 this is a very important discovery as it not only helps us understand the genetic roots of this terrible disease but also has led to dramatically new ideas for curative therapy
7812401 this finding means that it is possible to offer simple non invasive screening for patients with a family history of neuroblastoma
7812402 as we increase our knowledge of alk mutations we will also offer specialized diagnostic testing for all newly diagnosed patients with neuroblastoma to eventually allow oncologists to better customize treatment to a childs genetic profile
7812403 its an advantage to be able to start with agents that have already been shown to be safe in adults
7812404 together with this current study we are defining the genetic events that underlie this childhood cancer
7812405 better understanding of these biological pathways will guide our efforts to develop more effective treatments
7812406 our study indicated that the highest risk of data leakage is related to the endpoints or to the behavior of the end users at the endpoints
7812407 among organizations with top performance the most effective strategies for preventing data loss include a combination of enabling technologies including data discovery and classification data monitoring and filtering and encryption of data in use at the endpoints
7812408 the aberdeen study points out that while the top performing companies have achieved significantly better performance at protecting against malicious data loss incidents their greatest challenge remains in preventing data loss caused by simple human error and by well meaning employees trying to carry out their jobs
7812409 policy based data centric encryption protects against both types of threats in a single solution and is the leading approach taken for encryption as validated by this independent study we continue to experience strong demand for our intelligent centrally managed file based encryption approach to endpoint data protection as organizations race to prevent reputation damaging data breaches
7812410 the level of football is very different when you want to compare the champions league and local matches and naturally the team is responding according to the level of the opposition
7812411 we are not being disrespectful at all to the local competition and fans will see a committed dynamos when we face caps united on sunday
7812412 we have to win because we have unfinished business with al ahly so the players need that morale booster
7812413 and we also have to think of the fans who have been so supportive its been incredible
7812414 washington marvel and nyasha are definitely out of tomorrows tie but i have to believe we have enough players who want to give their best for caps united so we should have enough cover in that regard
7812415 its a derby that is true but still it is a game like any other we will try to give our fans something to cheer about tomorrow
7812416 it has been quite hectic in the past couple of months but i can say the boys have been responding well and the fans have been equally supportive but the battle is far from over and fans should come in their numbers to support the team on sunday as well as next weekend when we face al ahly in the must win match on saturday
7812417 we have to remember that dynamos have to beat ahly at any cost to stay in the hunt for a place in the champions league semis because any other result means qualification would no longer be in our hands but would depend on the outcome of the other clash between asec and zamalek we have to avoid this at any cost by beating al ahly
7812418 com a resultat daix les dades relacionades amb sol licituds de targetes de cr dit dalguns dels nostres clients i dades daltres bancs no van ser retirades
7812419 we have got a good result against villa you could tell the fans enjoyed themselves but now we must look forward to the next game
7812420 obviously when you get result in the premier league it gees everyone up
7812421 i thought he played pretty well for about a set and a half it was a decent test and i came through it pretty well
7812422 im feeling really confident just now regardless of what happened in beijing
7812423 george mccartney may feature but other than that were a bit light on the ground with regard to one or two of the others coming back
7812424 they havent gone away yet so weve got to work as hard as we possibly can to get these players back
7812425 any player would want to play for arsenal of course but for inler this may be perhaps a little early maybe a season too early
7812426 scotts injury came as a surprise to us because he trained on friday morning
7812427 its an abductor muscle and so he is going to have a look at that but he might be fit for next week
7812428 fear before him all the earth the world also shall be stable that it be not moved
7812429 we have received two interesting offers both of which are from english clubs what we always do is defend our interests we wont sell any player if the bid is not the amount we have asked for
7812430 if they want albert riera theyll have to pay what espanyol is asking
7812431 we want camp to begin on monday 1 september before lunch and the players should report to the zifa office or contact me to find out further details pertaining to the camp
7812432 the coach has looked at players like vusa harry shereni and cephas and feels that now he wants to look at other options
7812433 cephas had also earlier indicated to me that he has retired from international football
7812434 as for honour the coach feels he should be allowed more time to fully recover from the injuries that have been troubling him by playing more club football
7812435 the coach has also looked at takesure and nkatha and feels that they did not satisfy him as well as he would have wanted so he will consider them in future assignments but certainly not for this game
7812436 my teammates gave me the confidence to face sadomba they told me that i was going to make a save and i did that i also think that i am good at saving penalties
7812437 i am not a prophet but we hope the win sets the tone for the next games in the league we would really like to continue winning and pray for good results
7812438 for now we are happy to beat dynamos and this builds up our confidence but still we have to work hard
7812439 oscar used to play as a right back but we have been playing him in midfield
7812440 he has the pace but i am working on perfecting his final delivery
7812441 once he improves on that i believe he will almost be a compete player
7812442 i am happy that i have reached my first cup final as coach of a club more so i am also happy that lengthens have reached their first cup final
7812443 just being in the final for us is a good achievement and anything that comes after is a bonus for us
7812444 the game against highlanders was the turning point for us
7812445 we are currently working with september 27 as the date with the venue being rufaro
7812446 malaika had done well so far and he should continue working hard to be sharper we try to play as a team and thats why richard mteki combines well with tendai
7812447 in fact all the players contribute well but as a coach one is never satisfied and i want more good results
7812448 i just want to know what others think warrants use of the ignore feature
7812449 the nano is a really terrific cpu and you put nano with geforce together and everything works blu ray dx 10 games its low cost it consumes very little power its unbelievable
7812450 that were going to optimise all our software for nano and carry out compatibility testing for all nano platforms so any time you have a nano platform you can put a geforce in it and itll just work
7812451 these counterfeit sites now use all the same marketing best practices youd see on a legitimate site
7812452 we are expecting heavy resistance from this area these so called strongholds of commander bravo
7812453 right now as we speak there is heavy fighting in lanao del norte in piagapo
7812454 they are running low on resources they have also been beaten up by the offensives
7812455 police have launched a major investigation with charges expected to be laid soon seven said
7812456 around 40 children amp squo amp squo alleging they were
7812457 police have launched a major investigation with charges expected to be laid soon amp squo amp squo seven said
7812458 maybe we should have had a discussion before policy is sic put out there publicly mr adams said
7812459 a lot of points and concern about the policy during the meeting
7812460 the basis is right its how you get there and there are some people who have great difficultly in organising a 12 year old to get to school when they dont want to go to school he said
7812461 a lot of us are uncomfortable about this policy but it was a rudd labor commitment and kevin rudd confirmed that yesterday that its a promise he will be keeping she told abc radio today
7812462 i think its fair to say there is a great deal of concern within the caucus
7812463 its a pretty extreme organisation thats got extreme powers that doesnt confront anybody else in australian society he said
7812464 i dont think we need to keep this at the extreme end of where it is at the moment i think we should be able to wind that back somewhat before 2010
7812465 a federal government committed to workplace rights has no justification for keeping the abcc until 2010 greens senator rachel siewert said
7812466 the greens will not shrink from defending the basic human rights of workers including those in the building and construction industry
7812467 why should i make online advertising my business focuses only to my community and my market is intended for local consumers only
7812468 they can do things i cant do crop photos make the sky bluer if they want to i like to show the image as i saw it people ask me if i do digital photography and when i say no they say good for you they give me encouragement
7812469 im not really a student im a hands on person
7812470 i hike and canoe while i am riding along in the car i am always looking around much to my wifes chagrin she wants my eyes on the road i am always looking for images i see a snapshot in my mind and then i decide to go back maybe early in the morning or at a different time i photograph outside landscapes streams and ponds i like the intimacy of streams and the surrounding woods
7812471 i take the rest of the year off to be retired
7812472 i had about 100 images on magnets i sold thousands of them
7812473 i do things i enjoy i hike with good friends and have melded photography with hiking i take pictures of things i like and i hope others will too
7812474 gli siamo piaciuti cos tanto che hanno deciso di farci recitare ancora
7812475 pochi giorni fa siamo stati a casa di catherine hardwicke la regista per provare le nuove scene stato molto divertente
7812476 e gli spettatori hanno detto che volevano scoprire un po di pi su un certo personaggio oppure che non avevano capito molto bene un certo punto della trama eccetera
7812477 flashback sulla storia della famiglia cullen sono un paio di scene ci siamo io e robert pattinson edward e poi rosalie ed emmett
7812478 gli spettatori volevano vedere pi scene con jacob quindi mi hanno ritagliato un posticino nella scena del ballo alla fine del film
7812479 twilight come titanic come romeo e giulietta due persone follemente innamorate ma il cui amore pericoloso
7812480 dobbiamo ancora girare qualche scena e poi dobbiamo occuparci delle musiche e degli effetti sonori e ovviamente gli effetti visivi

7812484 you dont get in the music business just for the music its music girls and maybe a bit of drinking i was doing a lot of drugs when i was with bros plates of cocaine would go round at parties
7812485 i was growing up and made a lot of mistakes but the drug thing wasnt for me in the end when i left the band i was smoking a lot of weed but that didnt last long i lost about six months of my life from being in a haze
7812486 pertemuan masyarakat sipil dan pemerintah dki jakarta tentang hak atas perumahan dan masalah penggusuran di jakarta
7812487 i was immensely relieved when the doctors and nurses explained to me and my wife that rapidarc treatments focus just on the tumor
7812488 earlier technology for radiotherapy limited the number of angles we could use for striking at a tumor
7812489 with rapidarc technology we are seeing excellent treatment plans that permit us to target the tumor from nearly every angle in a 360 degree circle around the patient the impressive thing is that when we use rapidarc to target the tumor from more angles we can deliver a treatment using less radiation and it only takes two minutes
7812490 the vast majority of our patients since then have had no complications following treatment
7812491 i couldnt imagine how we would improve on that but with rapidarc we have we can get the same results two to eight times faster than was possible with our earlier technology
7812492 whereas we generally treated four patients each hour rapidarc is making it possible for us to treat up to five patients an hour with plenty of time in between appointments having extra time for administrative tasks will help us ensure that charges are captured correctly and cut back on time consuming billing errors
7812493 ive been pleased with the thoughtful and efficient care ive been getting at image guided radiation therapy
7812494 im in the treatment room for only about five minutes per session because i live so close to the care center im only away from home about an hour each day the doctors told me that i was one of the very first patients in the northeast to receive treatments using this technology i think its wonderful that people are inventing these devices its a miracle as far as im concerned
7812495 luke loves the farm he loves tractors and he loves feeding baby calves
7812496 evidently he got curious and thought im gonna go see
7812497 yeah but he doesnt wear it anymore have you noticed
7812498 this tour is more about the internal mechanisms of the liberal party
7812499 my view is that this needs to be federally driven and thats the unanimous view of the state council today
7812500 the average queenslander wants their national and liberal party leaders focussed on the concerns of everyday queenslanders and less focussed on our own issues
7812501 were aware of the matter discussed tonight by the aurora police department

7812503 clearly the original claim was an attempted fraud and appropriately rejected
7812504 those who submitted and certified it should be ashamed of themselves

7812530 the maps will show what happened last month and what the police have done about it
7812531 there will be many high crime areas where people dont report to the police because they dont trust the police and they just sort it out between themselves
7812532 if an offender is brought in and asked to empty their pockets
7812533 and drug paraphernalia is found then thats the location of the crime
7812534 i dont think this is going to tackle crime at all

7812583 oftentimes it just comes down to luck so far green bay is rolling snake eyes
7812584 those are all key players but to me wells and pickett are the only two that absolutely have to play against minnesota you dont want to face that team with obvious weaknesses on both lines
7812585 with aaron rodgers at quarterback the interior linemen will have to play even better than they did a year ago
7812586 tony moll will get run over at right guard hes no match for either of the williams boys sittons size and strength would give him fighting chance but id be shocked if hes ready
7812587 without pickett i could see peterson gaining 100 yards by the middle of the second quarter
7812588 colin cole is a solid backup but you dont stop a guy like peterson with backups they need pickett to be healthy and productive to even stand a chance of being able to slow down the running game enough to force quarterback tarvaris jackson to have to make plays
7812589 its one thing fo play but its another thing to play well you dont want to face the williams boys and guard steve hutchinson at less than full strength heck usually being at full strength isnt enough

7812619 ive been a part of this church for seven years now and its been fascinating to see god build it we can be sure its been god building it because i think some of the routes that hes taken us down at first didnt make much sense but now when you take a step back
7812620 everywhere we have met has exposed us to another part of the city from day one when this church was first planted the vision has always been that gateway would be a church that affects every area of the city that were not to remain hidden from some parts of leeds but rather were to be on display to the whole lot and im convinced that what were doing here at abbey grange is the next step in fulfilling this vision

7812628 nato russian relations will need to take fully into account the implications of russian military actions in georgia

7812633 the army will not launch a coup the people can be assured
7812634 we need to have greater clarity that this government is going to be around next year
7812635 as long as the government is restrained in its response sticking to the law not overreacting and shying away from physical violent enforcement of the law it has the upper hand
7812636 they shouted get out get out at us repeatedly all 150 of us were rounded up for a short while before police arrived and talked them down to the ground floor

7812650 its impossible to do you cant budget for price increases like that
7812651 we had our budgets in back in december well before gas prices really started going up
7812652 for instance if we have volleyball and field hockey going to the same place well try to get them to go together
7812653 just because of the way they are so spread out its the schools in classes i m and s that are really going to feel this
7812654 in class l we have concord to the north and thats about 60 miles then theres keene to the west and the way the schedules alternate in each of the sports we actually only end up making that trip maybe three times a year
7812655 theres been talk of reinstituting the connecticut valley league now one thing was that teams were playing more vermont games than they were new hampshire games
7812656 i wouldnt be surprised if you saw it in a sport like hockey where ice rentals and things like that are involved
7812657 i wanted to break 32 minutes but it was tough i was alone the whole race
7812658 i went out a little hard i didnt know what to expect because i didnt really remember the course
7812659 i just kept a good rhythm and i felt really good
7812660 you never know when you get to the starting line because everyone seems like theyre a good runner
7812661 i looked back a few times but there wasnt anybody close
7812662 i felt good today it was a personal record for me by about 50 seconds
7812663 so i felt really good there were a lot of good runners out there
7812664 the closest i ever got to alliette was probably about 100 yards
7812665 he took the lead from the get go and that was it he pretty much maintained
7812666 i wanted to get out as hard as i could i wanted to get out of the first mile at 5 50 and i think i got below that
7812667 and if i dont play ill be ready for kansas city
7812668 yeah i sure do ive been playing a lot of football so whether you play or dont play in the preseason id be ready no matter what its up to coach i was hoping i could play last week
7812669 its very hard not to think about the olympic games
7812670 very difficult to refocus i mean all my thinking is there in beijing
7812671 in russia if you stop anyone in the street and ask what is a grand slam i dont think many people can tell you but everyone knows the olympic games there is nothing bigger
7812672 people just come to me and say oh im happy for you
7812673 i dont know what is best to be a little bit tired but very comfortable and very positive or to be fresh and not play in the olympic games
7812674 you know i have an action against tvnz and rnz and others
7812675 i look at a lot of joe and jane consumers on main street anywhere and a lot of them are pretty content with just a regular cellphone
7812676 it does what they need it to do and basically that is just to make a phone call
7812677 this just does not sound like someone taking responsibility for the major part he played in killing these young women
7812678 i dont think there is anything in the world more difficult than losing a loved one but that phone call came in as a close second at 17 years old telling your mother that her only daughter has been raped and murdered is in itself a life altering event for 20 minutes after hanging up with her i was nonfunctional i basically curled up on the floor and wept

7812738 we believe our offense can move the ball on a consistent basis this year
7812739 going against our defense will help them get to that level
7812740 the last three or four days hes been making great decisions
7812741 if he doesnt have his initial reads hes a tremendous athlete and takes care of that himself
7812742 you can see him putting the ball on the money

7812751 the past two years we scored more goals than we have in a very long time and thats our goal again this year
7812752 because of the media and the fans theres more energy or electricity in the ballpark but you cant bring in a pitcher an inning earlier they dont give you two wins when you beat the yankees so you cant do it differently

7812754 theres no question with the number of games we have left its possible
7812755 im just glad at this juncture its at yankee stadium

7812759 shell be my floor captain because she knows the game the best of everyone on the team
7812760 we have a good coach we feel were prepared when we go into a match
7812761 i can teach them how to play smart and i have a smart bunch of players
7812762 a finisher would be nice but by the end of the year ill have a couple who can finish and set the ball down
7812763 they all bring a lot of the same things to the table but its that little extra
7812764 shown me theyre ready to be captains theyve taken the leadership role theyve taken ownership of this team

7812813 the koran and its place in muslim life and society
7812814 islam wishes to destroy all states and governments anywhere on the face of the earth which are opposed to the ideology and program of islam regardless of the country or the nation which rules it the purpose of islam is to set up a state on the basis of its own ideology and program regardless of which nation assumes the role of the standard bearer of islam or the rule of which nation is undermined in the process of the establishment of an ideological islamic state islam does not intend to confine this revolution to a single state or a few countries the aim of islam is to bring about a universal revolution

7812819 whose malicious bias against muslim americans and their organizations is well known
7812820 the last hour would not come unless the muslims will fight against the jews and the muslims would kill them

7812822 our goal is to ensure freedom eradicate prejudice and create a society in which muslims live peacefully and prosper alongside other americans
7812823 the players have got to be better than that to claim a cheltenham shirt and what sticks in my throat is the manner of the defeat
7812824 as manager i take the responsibility and i will look at myself but we were poor on the ball and we didnt have the solidity either its the first time i have suffered a result like that as a manager and thats very disappointing
7812825 what i said to the players after the game is indescribable i want them to fight for their shirts and be part of it but they have to contribute more than that we were disappointing in every department and i am looking for a big reaction from the players against stoke city
7812826 im aware stoke city and me as a manager have poor records in this competition over recent years its time we did something about it and we will put out a decent team at cheltenham
7812827 it wont be easy i watched cheltenham at their place twice last season and its a tight ground and a good atmosphere they will be out to claim our scalp and whoever we put out will have to be up for it
7812828 we have got absolutely nothing to lose and it can give us a big boost in confidence should we get something out of the game
7812829 i wouldnt be disrespectful to hartlepool and say we are going to go there and score lots of goals they are a decent team who work extremely hard and have got some good individuals
7812830 it is a tough game for us it is not easy to go to hartlepool and get a win we are anticipating a tough game i think the confidence is high from the way the team played against everton there is no problem with confidence i know football is results driven but ive got to be happy with my team i think we can control games i think we can give the opposition problems
7812831 maybe we cannot win the premier league but we can win the carling cup
7812832 we have done it before and we will be looking for a decent run in the competition it is a competition that we can genuinely win we have to believe that
7812833 en vez de tirar balones hacia fuera haga los deberes que le corresponden y que
7812834 es intolerable que mientras la regi n de murcia sufre la crisis m s intensamente que el resto de espa a el gobierno de valc rcel act e de forma irresponsable al no ejecutar el presupuesto en materia de empleo como deber a en los ltimos datos del mes de junio tan s lo se hab a ejecutado un 12 78 del sef mientras las partidas publicitarias y para tele valc rcel ya est ejecutada al 100 si es importante la ejecuci n del presupuesto en condiciones normales en momentos dif ciles como este es imprescindible
7812835 con estos pobres resultados el gobierno regional carga sobre los bolsillos de los murcianos los efectos de la crisis y demuestra su incapacidad y cinismo simplificando esta crisis en culpar al gobierno de zapatero que es quien pone las medidas que ellos no aprovechan en vez de hacer autocr tica y buscar soluciones los murcianos no nos merecemos ser la comunidad que m s est sufriendo la crisis
7812836 nefastas las pol ticas de empleo juvenil del gobierno regional ya que en el mes de julio de los m s de 68 000 parados de la regi n de murcia casi 31 000 fueron menores de 35 a os el 45 11000 j venes m s parados que en julio de 2007 seg n datos del propio observatorio del sef pero es que adem s el desempleo de j venes menores de 25 a os en espa a se redujo en julio en 2 601 personas 0 9 respecto al mes anterior mientras en nuestra regi n aument en 428 personas 4 97 respecto al mismo mes seg n datos del inem y analizando estos datos es a n m s grave si comparamos la variaci n interanual del n mero de parados j venes menores de 25 a os que en espa a es del 26 05 mientras en la regi n de murcia es del 70 02 con esta diferencia pedir soluciones al gobierno central es de absoluta ignorancia desconocimiento y desprecio a los 3721 parados j venes m s que hay en murcia ahora con respecto al a o anterior si en distintas zonas de espa a los datos son distintos est claro cu l es el elemento diferenciador
7812837 insuficientes los 500 cheques empleos y una verg enza la escasa ejecuci n del presupuesto del servicio de empleo y formaci n cuando m s falta hace la formaci n y es fundamental la recolocaci n de trabajadores hoy exigimos que valc rcel nos d explicaciones a los murcianos porque no vale que cuando las cosas van bien el gobierno regional se atribuya todos los xitos y cuando las cosas van mal la culpa la tienen otros son min sculas las medidas del gobierno regional y una vez m s el equipo de valc rcel se gasta m s en publicidad que en medidas concretas para sacar a la regi n de murcia de esta ca da en picado
7812838 por qu la regi n de murcia encabeza las cifras de paro del pa s por qu en el mes de julio el 45 de los parados fueron j venes menores de 35 a os y por qu el aumento del paro juvenil en la regi n es tan exagerado con respecto al resto de espa a es el gobierno regional el que tiene las competencias en las pol ticas activas de empleo y los murcianos esperamos soluciones para que la regi n de murcia deje de encabezar la crisis con m s dificultades que el resto de espa oles por culpa del modelo de desarrollo del gobierno del valc rcel

7812847 when the physical issue of the home became an issue we knew we had to do something but we dont want to do anything in haste then this building became available this gives us time to weigh our options and see what we need to do for the future its like fate
7812848 its a good short term solution im happy with the move and the chance to move forward
7812849 i voted for the move yes because ive been told the building is unsafe
7812850 but i also believe the people of the county have a say in whether we build a new home or not
7812851 with the condition of the current county home this will be good
7812852 but ill miss the grand ole lady as i call her you know that building has roots in this community and it will be sad to leave her

7812884 wij onderzoeken dit jaar inderdaad of de veiligheid van deze meisjes in india wel gewaarborgd is
7812885 ik zie niet onmiddellijk een verband tussen het weerbaar maken van deze meisjes en het verblijf in india
7812886 is het beschikbaar gestelde budget wel in verhouding tot het resultaat dat met deze meisjes behaald wordt
7812887 wij zien hier hele jonge cli nten die met bedreigingen en geweld te maken hebben zij hebben zwaar trauma te verwerken maar is een cultuurschok in india dan de oplossing misschien maar het is nog niet bewezen
7812888 de hulpverlening moet hen daartegen wapenen maar gebeurt dit ver weg in india het zou toch logischer zijn om de meisjes gewoon in nederland op te vangen
7812889 ik kan mij tegelijk wel voorstellen dat meisjes india een leuk alternatief vinden voor een justiti le jeugdinrichting in nederland ik ben zeer benieuwd naar de resultaten
7812890 er is wel eens een terugval geweest maar geen van de acht meisjes die inmiddels weer terug zijn zit nu weer in de prostitutie dus dat is in elk geval positief

7812896 we know that family is going through a most difficult time
7812897 we want them to know how deeply we feel for them and support them
7812898 we are still hopeful that additional information will eventually surface that will lead us to yi jien
7812899 but we know that the odds for that outcome are reduced with each day that goes by in the absence of a promising development we will be scaling back the operation
7812900 we have pursued every lead committed necessary resources and enlisted the help of agencies and groups that we felt could help us to resolve this puzzling case
7812901 i think this right here will be contagious and it will rub off on a lot of people
7812902 i think guys will see how much fun we had and be like man i want to be a part of that
7812903 but the good news is this unsolicited five or six of these guys have already said they want to be part of what we do going forward but we have plenty of time to sort through it they need some time off they really do
7812904 james was too nice of a guy for this to have happened
7812905 the number of security bugs reported in solaris environments are much higher than the same reported in linux
7812906 linux is far mor secure reliable than windows since you dont get this bothering blue screens
7812907 open source is much more secure than propietary beacuse everyone can improve the code and there are thousands of millions developers lovingly looking after code integrity

7812909 i wanted to break 32 minutes but it was tough i was alone the whole race
7812910 i went out a little hard i didnt know what to expect because i didnt really remember the course
7812911 i just kept a good rhythm and i felt really good
7812912 you never know when you get to the starting line because everyone seems like theyre a good runner
7812913 i looked back a few times but there wasnt anybody close
7812914 i felt good today it was a personal record for me by about 50 seconds
7812915 so i felt really good there were a lot of good runners out there
7812916 the closest i ever got to alliette was probably about 100 yards
7812917 he took the lead from the get go and that was it he pretty much maintained
7812918 i wanted to get out as hard as i could i wanted to get out of the first mile at 5 50 and i think i got below that
7812919 we have decided to immediately suspend disabling our nuclear facilities
7812920 this measure has been effective on aug 14 and related parties have been notified of it
7812921 north korea is trying to muddle through and delay as much as possible
7812922 at the same time this is a last ditch effort trying to somehow influence u s presidential politics
7812923 i think the timing of the hu jintao visit to south korea was very depressing to the north koreans
7812924 i see it as another card at the negotiation table to urge the u s to remove it from the terrorism blacklist as soon as possible
7812925 the united states and china can think that they are drawing north korea into true nuclear disarmament but north korea has continued to nuclearize throughout the six party process
7812926 we know it wont always be smooth sailing the more difficult the circumstances the more we must remember the important commitments made by each party and abide by a spirit of mutual respect in encouraging mutual confidence

7812944 mate no one in world rugby is playing the way their coach is talking about not successfully anyway everyone has discipline policies and a procedure in their game the way he is talking is nonsense you cant just play an expansive wide game
7812945 if de villiers keeps on going down this track he will be unsuccessful he has got to learn if he wants to coach at international level you have to have some sort of discipline involved then get the players to play for that the hard thing for peter is that he has never coached professionally and this is one of the most difficult teams to coach
7812946 what they do demand is that you must be fitter and play better from un structured ball
7812947 but you dont need to go to a harum scarum type of game
7812948 but south africa have gone to the other extreme theyre attacking off everything and theyre going lateral not through defences you have to go through sides like australia and new zealand first south africas problem is if you have played one game then try to go to the other extreme thats a danger knowing the south african players i would say they would prefer much more discipline theres no structure in their game at present and they have lost all their discipline
7812949 they could turn it around even in 7 days 20it will be tough but they are a resilient bunch of players some of the toughest footballers i have ever been involved with
7812950 but he has to change his philosophy because it doesn t fit these players its not credible you have got to give players a framework to work under peters big test now is to learn if he learns he can turn it around but if he continues to be stubborn he wont last long because his tactics wont work

7812957 although the 2007 port of tauranga ports of auckland merger proposal was not successful the rationale for changes in the industry in the upper north island is still strong
7812958 the sustainability of new zealands existing ports sector investments the industrys ability to invest in the future and the global competitiveness of the countrys supply chain might be assisted by the purchase of port of taurangas container business by ports of auckland
7812959 a single integrated container business at the upper north island would also facilitate a more sensible and coherent approach to investment in supporting infrastructure in road rail and coastal shipping
7812960 a rough and ready calculation would suggest that taurangas container business would be worth substantially more than ports of aucklands container business
7812961 going to shoot obama from a high vantage point using a rifle sighted at 750 yards
7812962 was directly asked if they had come to denver to kill obama he responded in the affirmative
7812963 clearly we found there are federal implications otherwise we would not have notified them
7812964 its premature to say that it was a valid threat or that these folks have the ability to carry it out

7812969 brian brohm looks lost out there hes playing with zero confidence matt flynn seems more sure of himself but he refuses to look down the field it would take him about 20 completions to move the offense 80 yards the packers might not score a single point with either rookie under center in the regular season
7812970 it was nice to see tory humphrey finally make a few plays you can make an argument that joey haynos has been the second best tight end during the summer but he seems destined for the practice squad unless the packers keep four at this position that seems unlikely
7812971 greg jennings is the best receiver on the team hes becoming virtually impossible to cover jordy nelson is going to be a solid player but hes not ready just yet he struggles to get off the line and he needs to do a better job of selling his routes i dont see a sixth receiver on the roster brett swain was invisible against denver after enjoying a solid week of practice
7812972 the group played much better than a week ago but then again denver is mediocre up front and coordinator bob slowik kept things vanilla jason spitz performed very well at center after getting knocked around at left guard in san francisco tony moll didnt embarrass himself in an extended stint at right guard but he plays too high to be consistently effective on the inside allen barbre can be a dominant run blocker at times but he needs to do a better job of handling stunts
7812973 this group wasnt effective against the run or the pass something is wrong with johnny jolly he looked like an emerging star last season but hes been just another guy all summer maybe his surgically repaired right shoulder isnt 100 percent jason hunter dominated against denvers backup offensive linemen but he was far less effective against the starters thats been his mo for the past three years only his draft status and perceived potential is keeping jeremy thompson around hes done next to nothing in training camp
7812974 jon ryan had an outstanding night his punts were booming and he scooped up at least two low snaps as the holder speaking of which j j jansen needs to be better if he can finally stay healthy returner in the battle for field position hes blessed with a rare mix of size speed and vision

7812986 database archiving often fails to get the attention it needs compared to other critical activities related to production databases and data warehouses
7812987 an archival system becomes critical when you need to access archived information in response to a legal summons customer service issue security investigation or technical issue the value of archiving grows considerably as it becomes easier to access the archived data
7812988 with legal demands for access growing conventional approaches to database archiving are increasingly being found lacking
7812989 while i hate galaxy girl was originally kat cahills runner up for our who wants to create a super heroine contest shadowline editor kris simon and i loved the concept so much we had to put it on the fast track to becoming its own series
7812990 when kat saw seths upcoming work on brat halla she knew he was the perfect artist to capture the mood she was going for we really cant help but agree
7812991 the core of i hate galaxy girl is renee finding the self confidence to achieve her dreams despite constantly being told to give up the experience is something i think just about anybody can relate to while the overall story is still a heck of a lot of fun
7812992 its impossible to do you cant budget for price increases like that
7812993 we had our budgets in back in december well before gas prices really started going up
7812994 for instance if we have volleyball and field hockey going to the same place well try to get them to go together
7812995 just because of the way they are so spread out its the schools in classes i m and s that are really going to feel this
7812996 in class l we have concord to the north and thats about 60 miles then theres keene to the west and the way the schedules alternate in each of the sports we actually only end up making that trip maybe three times a year
7812997 theres been talk of reinstituting the connecticut valley league now one thing was that teams were playing more vermont games than they were new hampshire games
7812998 i wouldnt be surprised if you saw it in a sport like hockey where ice rentals and things like that are involved
7812999 it is us stepping up and acknowledging the grief and the loss its kids killing kids its a loss of life
7813000 there are years that ask questions and years that answer
7813001 ive had a great last year and i really mean this
7813002 i was not a part of that presidential search i sat through it all but i dont want anyone to think i had a bad year i had a great year and it was one of the best years the college has had
7813003 its like a new change in my life of course for 45 years in a row ive been on college campus welcoming students teaching students or doing something as a faculty member or administrator this will be the first time in 45 years that i wont be doing that so thats a change
7813004 weve tried to expand the reaches of monroe community college throughout our community everyone should have the opportunity to go to college if they want to and i think weve made that possible
7813005 ive known the way hes impacted students in their growth choices in careers and personal choices
7813006 its remarkable when he works with students its so clear how much he cares about them and their success
7813007 his leadership has helped to elevate mccs stature as a premier institution and a national model emulated by schools throughout the country
7813008 toms dedication and perseverance made him an invaluable asset to the college his outstanding character and professionalism have made him a pleasure to work with over the years he will be missed
7813009 hes one of the very accomplished community college administrators in the country and were in great hands
7813010 he said to me as you look back can you say what dad said
7813011 and thats do the best you can i believe i can say that
7813012 but not really inexperienced we have several who play club volleyball
7813013 i love that they truly love the game they love learning it and they have a lot of fun with it
7813014 shell be my floor captain because she knows the game the best of everyone on the team
7813015 we have a good coach we feel were prepared when we go into a match
7813016 i can teach them how to play smart and i have a smart bunch of players
7813017 a finisher would be nice but by the end of the year ill have a couple who can finish and set the ball down
7813018 they all bring a lot of the same things to the table but its that little extra
7813019 shown me theyre ready to be captains theyve taken the leadership role theyve taken ownership of this team
7813020 i dont think ive had a team thats bonded this well in my five years here
7813021 hes old school he doesnt believe that any one player except for perhaps a franchise quarterback is worth the kind of money that is regularly being tossed around by other gms the fact that he played the game for a decade makes me think hes probably right he knows what it takes to succeed and unlike a lot of his brethren he doesnt equate spending big money on big names with winning
7813022 hed rather have 53 good players than 10 superstars and 43 journeymen the fact that head coach mike mccarthy agrees with this philosophy makes their relationship a strong one and thats why the two were able to get things turned around so quickly
7813023 he missed a golden opportunity to improve during the spring and now the summer has turned into just as big of a waste of time this isnt a recipe for success especially against defenses that will be less concerned about green bays passing game and more focused on stopping the run in 2008
7813024 the tackles are solid but the interior has been a huge problem all summer i dont understand why coach mike mccarthy insists on moving those guys around is it really necessary to slide jason spitz over to center when scott wells gets dinged why not just let junius coston fill in during practice and the exhibition games its awfully easy to criticize spitz and daryn colledge but ive never seen young offensive linemen jerked around in such a way this looks like a weakness heading into the season and thats a shame because i honestly believe that the talent level is more than adequate
7813025 this was the deepest position on the team a year ago and now the packers have to rely heavily on a journeyman like colin cole even worse the coaches are desperate enough to give mediocre ends michael montgomery and jason hunter snaps at tackle in the nickel package thats because justin harrell cant stay healthy and cullen jenkins and johnny jolly are having disappointing summers even with ryan pickett and kabeer gbaja biamila back in the lineup this position wont be a strength in 08 unless jenkins and jolly step it up
7813026 i dont have a problem with the starter aaron rodgers will be fine as long as his teammates start blocking and catching for him he certainly wasnt great against san francisco but im not sure johnny unitas wouldve stood much of a chance on that night the problem is with the two rookie backups neither brian brohm nor matt flynn is anywhere close to being ready to play at this level it didnt really matter who the no 2 quarterback was when brett favre was around but the odds are that it will matter now especially if rodgers keeps getting knocked on his ass this football team is too talented not to have a veteran ready to step in if need be
7813027 a j hawk nick barnett brady poppinga charles woodson nick collins atari bigby and aaron rouse are almost the prototype of what youre looking for in a blitzer all of those guys are big fast and extremely aggressive
7813028 coordinator bob sanders has coached in one system for the better part of two decades
7813029 and no matter where hes been bringing extra rushers has never been a big part of the scheme it takes years to become good at knowing how to design an effective blitz and it takes even longer to know exactly when to use it blitzing is an art form and lets put it this way sanders is no picasso
7813030 its time to share the secret of the worlds best strawberries with business and food connoisseurs who will appreciate our vision of quality and responsible growing methods
7813031 so much is mass produced and manufactured these days that flavor and quality have almost disappeared we have dedicated ourselves to growing strawberries the way nature intended without compromising quality
7813032 were often asked what is the secret that makes daddyberrys taste so good it might be because we feed them purified rain water or perhaps all the attention they get at the nursery but were quite certain that eliminating harmful chemicals and pesticides is what really lets the true flavor of our strawberries stand out
7813033 we may be approaching an inflection point where the rate of technological advancements is accelerating at an exponential rate
7813034 we must buy disk space and everyone else is buying san widgets why shouldnt we

7813065 it was encouraging to speak to young students as a gay man in a safe environment
7813066 sharing my experience as a young gay man in a very different era at the college gave me an insight into the important role of mentoring that gay and lesbian catholics can provide in our church community
7813067 my experience as a participant in online discussion forums about faith and sexuality has raised my concerns about a culture of homophobia which is evident among some of the contributors to such forums
7813068 the inclusion of the international day against homophobia in church calendars will send a clear message to those in the church who fail to understand that the dignity of the human person is a core catholic teaching which challenges homophobia in our community

7813072 at the time late 1990s there were parish priests openly discriminating against family members as well as gay people themselves
7813073 there were hundreds of parents or siblings or even partners whose relationships ended because of sexuality issues and i think a lot of people were able to come to closure when they had someone saying the churchs teachings were not necessarily the truth
7813074 without fail she turned up to every volunteer induction at quac and talked on behalf of parents with gay children
7813075 i think she changed a lot of peoples attitudes even the attitudes of lgbts towards their parents she gave a new perspective on what its like to be gay in a straight family
7813076 our friendship was slow to develop but once it did it blossomed and she became more of a mother figure to me than a work colleague
7813077 once she got involved in something she just went for it
7813078 she had scrupulous ethics and was very good at what she did at both the policy level and personal level amongst other things she met with government ministers and got the catholic church to donate money for anti homophobia workshops in the outback
7813079 she was so effective in doing what she did she saved countless lives put families back together and prevented suicides
7813080 she was unbelievably intuitive and extremely supportive i dont think ive seen anybody give more to a cause and she and her husband were involved in several organizations and causes
7813081 shes left a huge imprint and legacy weve got no doubt thats shes up there kicking butt and probably working on the popes right now
7813082 one of the last things she said before she died was that shed see what she can do shes got plans

7813124 we are both journalists and we both know that you always have to get both sides of a story how can reporters without borders publish such comments without contacting us to hear our version of the story
7813125 let me at least tell you what happened with the french reporter david hury he never came to us and we never saw him i was out of the country and i got a call that a journalist was in a very sensitive area with the daily israeli threats what was i to do we stopped him and we spoke to him to know his identity at least and why was he there taking pictures we definitely didnt arrest him we just drank coffee with him and tried to know him better
7813126 if they want to work with the ministrys accreditation then let them work in other territories not in the ones threatened with israeli bombings
7813127 for example i got a visit recently from a french journalist asking to conduct an investigative report
7813128 we are really living a difficult period we can find israeli agents everyday how should we act in these situations we let everyone come and go just because we believe in democracy we believe in democracy but we also believe in the dangers around us we only ask to investigate the identity of the journalist before he roams in our region is it too much to ask
7813129 usually we need 48 hours to investigate the origins of the journalists
7813130 in addition to that dozens of foreigners come and take pictures of dahiyeh everyday why didnt we have problems with them if we are supposed to be harassing arresting and confiscating we are going through a rough period with the threat of an open war with the enemy we have the right to be careful we never stood in the way of journalists for we want to show what we have but for the time being we have to be careful
7813131 they exaggerated when they used words like kidnapping and terrorists
7813132 i told them so but apparently it was the editor back in brazil who decided that from now on hezbollah would be considered a terrorist group
7813133 i dont blame them but it is the way it was done that was unfair this is not how hezbollah should be dealing with the press
7813134 it is becoming such a hassle to get the point of view of the people in those areas that often you just dont bother anymore

7813173 being a conservative republican maybe thats hard to say but i dont know any other way we can do it we need to educate our children and it does take money
7813174 its been common practice to have supervision before and after school
7813175 some say thats a moral obligation thats true but having a moral obligation is one thing being able to pay for it is another
7813176 when an economy is good and there is money the enrollment doesnt go up and the legislature says why do you need money when the economy is bad our enrollment shoots up and theres no money
7813177 going forward we will continue to meet the states essential needs and we will stand by the same principles that guided this years budget no increased property taxes no additional borrowing and no expanded gambling
7813178 it seems that such towers like prisons are just not welcome additions to the landscape and those who hold those sincere opinions are entitled to some sympathy

7813184 the water got into the garage but stayed out of the house but were talking about millions of gallons it will take a long time for the water to recede
7813185 i ran outside as the house shook then i looked up and noticed there was a lot more light than there should be
7813186 we had some trees down and a couple of floods

7813196 power has been restored to everyone capable of receiving service
7813197 our biggest challenge as other companies faced were high winds flooding and trees on lines
7813198 if a transmission line is down that serves hundreds or thousands of people our priority is to restore that first then the other more challenging areas
7813199 its a complicated system and i know it can be frustrating at times power restoration is not done based by who calls in first
7813200 we had guys in some areas of our network wading through waist deep water others faced poisonous snakes trying to restore power in flood areas they faced some pretty hazardous conditions
7813201 most of the outages were the result of a progress energy transmission line that went down that served our rainbow lakes sub station

7813224 if i had been able to turn on the television and see a documentary or any kind of program about kids with other gay and lesbian parents
7813225 i use that term purposely i think children of queer parents have their own coming out process and i was terrified to come out i cant even imagine what it would have been like to go through my childhood without feeling that kind of fear of exposure and that confusion and isolation
7813226 i really wanted it to be from the kids point of view i felt a lot of the media i had been seeing was from the parents point of view which is certainly worthy and important and has its place but i felt that as a kid of a gay parent i had this role to play i could help bring our voices to a wider audience

7813233 but ive always said fighting with your brother at thanksgiving makes a family or talking back to your mom makes a family or all of the things that are normal make a family i dont want us to have to be happy and rainbow all the time i just want us to be able to exist
7813234 i am profoundly grateful for the family i grew up in both for my lesbian mother and my straight dad what i went through wasnt easy i wish that i hadnt grown up in a homophobic society i think it has made me stronger in so many ways and im happy i feel like ive been queered a little bit im not a completely straight person because of that experience and i love that thats part of my life

7813248 i am delighted to be continuing our program of growth as we roll out even more low fares across australia with the addition of another weekly flight between alice springs and melbourne we have experienced a fantastic response to our consistently low fares from tourists and the people of central australia alike and i am delighted that these additional low priced seats will be available in time for the christmas peak season
7813249 i know that there are a lot of people in alice springs who have supported tiger airways in our efforts to break the qantas monopoly and finally bring affordable fares to the people of central australia this additional weekly service is a vote of confidence by us in the community of central australia and we look forward to a strong response in bookings as customers snap up our low low fares we are committed to continuing to grow our presence in alice springs based on consumer demand and hope that these additional services will also encourage a reduction in airport charges and fees at alice springs airport
7813250 the passion that the people of the sunshine coast have displayed in embracing australias true low fare airline has resulted in tiger airways expanding its operation to a daily service between melbourne and the sunshine coast now you can get low low fares every day of the week with tiger airways providing over 130 000 seats per year between melbourne and the sunshine coast
7813251 if you want to travel between perth and melbourne the choice is simple tiger airways not only has the lowest fares but also more flights than any other low fare airline from melbourne tullamarine

7813259 over the last four years ian has done an outstanding job of changing a culture bringing together a number of provinces together under one banner in difficult circumstances so there are clear parallels between his experience at the chiefs and where we are at the ospreys

7813271 an author has a right to use what he himself has experienced is that he is never able to utter verity but is to keep verity for himself and only let it be refracted in various ways
7813272 the first is a failure to provide a safe system of work for the movement of vehicles and plant at the site
7813273 relatively small vehicles such as the land rover in which the two deceased were travelling were not prevented from being operated in close proximity to large vehicles including dump trucks while they were being operated with reduced visual fields thereby creating a risk of collision
7813274 the second is a failure to provide the operators of all mobile plant with suitable means of communication or other equipment to reduce the risk of collision and injury
7813275 these two deaths were entirely preventable and arose from the clear failure of scottish coal to provide suitable means of communication between different vehicles on site in order to reduce the risk of collisions as well as a failure to manage vehicles on their site
7813276 earth moving vehicles such as dump trucks or bulldozers have poor visual fields due to their large size
7813277 it is crucial that additional steps are taken to ensure that the drivers of these dump trucks are aware of other smaller vehicles around them
7813278 control measures to reduce the risk are easily available at a minimal cost installing an additional camera on the side of the dump truck fitting a raised roof beacon or other means of improving visibility on the land rover could prevent similar incidents in the future

7813314 we ask mr wickremesinghe whether that challenge still holds good he must declare it in public or at a media briefing the government is ready for a general election at any time
7813315 we feel sorry for him he will stand no chance this time as the pressure against him will mount steadily

7813362 a n o ser que ela nos libere e pe a que votemos em obama temos que votar nela mesmo que j se saiba quem o candidato
7813363 nossa preocupa o neste momento manter o partido unido para eleger um presidente democrata certamente vou fazer campanha para obama assim que ele for declarado oficialmente o candidato
7813364 vamos fazer tudo baseado na uni o do partido unidos venceremos n o adianta tentarem alimentar a disc rdia o partido n o est dividido estamos debatendo e conversando sobre como vamos vencer esta elei o em novembro mas estaremos unidos

7813380 bagaimana kami mau melaksanakan program kerja calon bupati dan wakil bupati jika tidak ada dana seharusnya para calon itu mengeluarkan dana untuk biaya operasional partai bukan sebaliknya
7813381 masa pihak tuan rumah yang menyediakan dengan biaya sendiri itu kan nggak lucu disebut biaya operasional itu bukan money politik dengan membagikan uang bukan itu maksudnya
7813382 dana operasional itu untuk keperluan seperti yang saya ungkapkan katakanlah kopi rokok atau ya pisang goreng dalam suatu riungan itu saja jangan dulu berpikir uang bensin atau pengganti ongkos mereka dari rumah ke tempat riungan
7813383 siapa yang akan mengganti uang saya saya juga masih harus membiayai keluarga saya akui tugas anggota partai adalah untuk menyukseskan calon yang diusungnya tapi saya bukan anggota dprd dan bukan pengusaha hanya seorang supir angkot
7813384 saya setiap hari mengeluarkan dana untuk ini itu tidak kurang dari dua juta rupiah mungkin jumlah itu lebih jika saja saya punya tabungan seratus juta maka akan habis dalam waktu satu bulan atau lebih sedikit
7813385 penghasilan saya hanya berasal dari gaji wakil ketua dprd di luar itu tidak berapa sih gaji anggota dprd untuk membiayai pencalonan diri sendiri masih jauh jauh hari saya sudah menolak untuk dicalonkan karena memang tidak punya uang namun karena situasi memaksa akhirnya saya terima namun setelah maju begini saya dihadapkan pada situasi rumit karena ketiadaan dana

7813436 one of the purposes of our research is to develop better designs for precast concrete buildings
7813437 this is really important to our industry because well be able to develop structures that can resist natures most difficult loads including earthquakes
7813438 we conducted tests from lower seismicity all the way to higher seismicity and shook the building stronger and stronger each time with a higher intensity
7813439 since that time we have been working to come up with designs that will make these structures survive a northridge earthquake or stronger
7813440 we are only able to perform physical experiments on that one structure but if we can show that our models capture important response properly we can run hundreds of earthquake simulations a year for the cost of a graduate student a fast computer and a software license which at around 50 000 is substantially less than the costs of these kinds of tests
7813441 the englekirk center is very important to the research community and to the industry because it has an outdoor environment where we can perform large scale tests that cant be done anywhere else in the world
7813442 if we treat all of the lettuce and spinach then theres going to be a very rare instance of exposure to illness causing microorganisms
7813443 whats sad is that the fda after a nearly nine year review selected only two products involved with the massive illnesses in 2006
7813444 i suspect it will take awhile for the supply chain to get into place because of the limited number of irradiation facilities in place in the u s
7813445 these facilities are relatively expensive to build so you have to make sure you have adequate product flow and a market for that product
7813446 it would have to be new construction thats for sure
7813447 we wouldnt expect any immediate adoption and in fact industry wont move forward unless they are sure there wont be a backlash from consumer activists the other issue is that there is a lot more product now being labeled organic and you cannot irradiate products labeled organic
7813448 theres been a lot of research done on that and basically products that have treated with irradiation are as good or better after 14 days typical travel time than those that havent
7813449 we now know that in order to kill e coli on this type of product we can turn down the dosage level the power of the beam effectively and lettuce and spinach remain just as crisp and wholesome as if you grew it yourself
7813450 the american consumer has shown willingness to purchase irradiated products such as strawberries and meats once consumers understand the food safety implications their unfounded worries about the safety of the cold pasteurization process are eliminated even though there are a lot of naysayers and anti irradiation people giving inaccurate information
7813451 the experience with ground beef is that consumers have not reacted negatively to the label
7813452 the only negative reaction is to price it costs more
7813453 in 2006 there were an estimated 50 billion servings of green leafy salads served in this country and there were approximately 1 200 people made ill
7813454 the odds of getting a food borne illness from produce are already extremely low based upon the number of servings that we see but what we have to recognize is that irradiation is one more tool we can use to ensure the safety of our products this is especially important for at risk populations immune compromised folks pregnant women children under the age of eight and elderly these people are at high risk for food borne illness and it may be useful to feed them greens that have been irradiated for that last margin of safety
7813455 the real importance of this rule is that produce companies wouldnt even look at the technology unless the government approved it the new fda rule makes them more inclined to take a fresh look at it

7813484 he has done very well for us in pre season has looked good in training in the first few weeks of this season and hes a good squad player
7813485 if the window comes and goes without a move for them then they will be involved in the squad

7813536 i had an interesting talk with your mom this weekend
7813537 she remarked how lucky i am to be able to stay home with the munchkin and not have to teach again she said that she would have loved to be able to do that but there were layoffs at your dads plant so she had to go back to teaching she said she wanted to be a better mom to you guys than that
7813538 my mom did go back to work when money was tight because of the situation at my dads plant but things turned around at the plant and mom continued to work for another ten years after that
7813539 because she liked the money she stayed at work so she could buy things for herself that my dad wouldnt
7813540 but all she did was sleep when she got home
7813541 pretty much bottom line mom didnt work because we needed the money mom worked because she wanted to spend money on useless stuff

7813595 that omission sends a message that verges on the sinister not that ministers have abandoned their commitment to decency and fairness but that when it comes to devising strategies for dealing with the numbers crisis and the other challenges facing the prison estate the monitoring task has simply disappeared off the agenda
7813596 we are concerned that the government seems to be going back on jack straws own statement that we cannot build ourselves out of the prison numbers crisis
7813597 we are not just dealing with overcrowding though overcrowding is a serious problem in some prisons
7813598 the computer was removed from our secure storage facility in essex and sold on ebay
7813599 we know which employee took the server and sold it but we believe it was an honest mistake and it was not intentional to sell it without the server being cleared
7813600 we want to stress that this is an isolated incident and we are investigating how the server was removed and sold the security we have in place is what we are known for this is a very unfortunate incident and we are taking measures to ensure it will never happen again

7813604 wed had our car damaged five times in the last six months i got really upset about it
7813605 my wing mirror had been left hanging on with tape because i couldnt afford to keep getting it repaired at 250 a time
7813606 i ran up to them asked them what they were doing and said i think youd better come with me
7813607 they seem ed surprised so i grabbed them by the collar and took them back to my house one of them kept tugging and trying to pull forward but i had a firm grip and i wasnt letting go im a parent and i acted like a parent

7813618 it is as a result of prudent decision making that the kenyan government opened up the country to the far east including asian countries as a result kenya has been able to access countries that provide better deals
7813619 in the past procurement of government goods was shrouded in mystery then political considerations mattered more than economic sense
7813620 right now most of kenyas roads are either being refurbished or built anew by chinese firms and all our international airports are also being upgraded by chinese owned firms this is after going through the process of open tendering
7813621 if a kenyan for example wants to visit the uk they face a lot of stringent requirements that act as a hindrance but if they wish to travel to the far east china or india the process is enabling and travel friendly thats one reason that has led a lot of local business people to shy away from travelling to the uk let alone seeking business there
7813622 the change in the bilateral trade relations between the uk and kenya has political overtones written all over it
7813623 the cabal that took power in 2003 had always accused the british government of aiding and abetting the misrule associated with the reign of daniel arap moi the british government was a bugbear for the group because its quiet diplomacy emboldened moi to rule autocratically

7813684 sommige critici van isra l beseffen het kennelijk nog niet maar ze hebben al lang de overhand
7813685 na dit lange inleidende deel volgen hoofdstukken over de misstappen van amerikaanse inlichtingendiensten over de amerikaanse bemoeienis met pakistan saudi arabi iran isra l en turkije ook hier werpt hersh soms een verhelderend licht op de achterkant van de amerikaanse beleidsvoering maar juist in dit deel worden te vaak anonieme bronnen opgevoerd voor tamelijk obligate observaties en waar de inhoud verschraalt begint extra op te vallen dat het allemaal is opgeschreven in zon dorre stijl

7813687 als je wilt weten hoe ik denk over buitenlandse politiek lees sharansky
7813688 terug naar de literatuurlijst van de president daarop staat ook met stip the case for democracy the power of freedom to overcome tyranny and terror van nathan sharansky de auteur is de vroegere anatoli sjtsjaranski vermaard wiskundige en hero sch sovjet dissident die in de jaren zeventig aan de zijde van andrei sacharov streed voor de mensenrechten na een celstraf wegens spionage mocht hij in 1986 de sovjet unie verlaten en vestigde zich in isra l waar hij met andere russische immigranten een eigen partij vestigde die een sterk nationalistische koers volgde de partij is opgegaan in het likud blok sharansky staat in hoog aanzien van amerikaanse neo conservatieven en bush was zo onder de indruk van zijn laatste boek dat hij hem onlangs uitnodigde voor een priv bezoek aan het witte huis en tegen de hoofdredacteur van de washington times zei hij als je een indruk wilt krijgen van hoe ik denk over de buitenlandse politiek lees dan het boek van sharansky diens invloed kan inderdaad worden ontwaard in bush recente inauguratierede en dan vooral de opvatting dat vrijheid en democratie de sleutel vormen tot vrede en voorspoed dit in tegenstelling tot de realistische school die zich bovenal bekommert om de internationale stabiliteit ook als onvrijheid en onderdrukking daardoor worden bestendigd
7813689 in 1992 kreeg rafik hariri de leiding in het moegestreden libanon
7813690 hoe kan een vlucht naar voren het beste worden afgestopt tot nu toe hebben duitsland frankrijk en groot brittanni die met amerikaanse instemming onderhandelen over irans nucleaire programma hun heil vooral gezocht in minzame diplomatie maar het wordt onmiskenbaar tijd voor een krachtiger boodschap en niet alleen vanwege het rumoer van de honden en varkens zoals in 1979 de amerikaanse gijzelaars in teheran door een bepaald persoon werden betiteld
7813691 wiesenthal vond bepaald niet dat alles was welgedaan wat isra l deed maar meer nog ergerde hij zich aan de golven van kritiek op de joodse staat waarin hij een forse antisemitische onderstroom ontwaarde toen de volkskrant hem kort na de libanees falangistische slachting in de palestijnse kampen sabra en chatila 1982 interviewde zei hij bitter ik moet vaststellen dat links een collectieve verantwoordelijkheid voor de gebeurtenissen in libanon legt bij de joden in de wereld nur tote juden haben eine gute presse zo onderwees hij destijds de twee volkskrant verslaggevers van wie ik er een was
7813692 isra l en iran hebben altijd een curieuze relatie gehad jeruzalem steunde teheran stilletjes in de oorlog tegen irak maar nu zijn de verhoudingen weer op een dieptepunt beland
7813693 maar dit is duidelijk niet het devies van mahmoud ahmadinejad sinds vier maanden president van iran enkele weken geleden wekte hij grote beroering toen hij in een toespraak op een anti zionistische manifestatie
7813694 iran zal zich steeds meer opwerpen als aanvoerder van het anti isra lische blok en zal daarbij de eigenschappen vertonen van een klassieke imperiale mogendheid met de ambitie om de regio naar haar evenbeeld om te vormen de nieuwe confrontatie wijkt af van de arabisch isra lische oorlogen doordat iran niet alleen wordt gedreven door islamistisch vuur maar ook streeft naar een nucleair potentieel
7813695 iran toont zich ongevoelig voor westerse druk en geeft zijn nucleaire ambities extra reli f door de anti isra lische
7813696 libanon en internationaal tamelijk ge soleerd is geraakt en het geldt in nog sterkere mate voor iran dat vorig weekeinde bij het internationaal agentschap voor atoomenergie iaea een saillante diplomatieke
7813697 nu is daar niets op tegen laten we luid en vaak eer betonen aan de religie van mohammed vrede zij met hem als maar niet de illusie wordt gekoesterd dat de fundamentalisten in saudi arabi en pakistan en de radicalinskis in teheran en damascus daarmee kunnen worden geapaiseerd
7813698 hoe groot acht u de kans dat iran zich actief in de palestijnse zaak zal mengen die kans is altijd aanwezig maar eerlijk gezegd denk ik dat iran andere dingen aan zijn hoofd heeft
7813699 maar als het om iran gaat zet herzog zich schrap
7813700 jawel iran wordt streng toegesproken het land moet binnen dertig dagen te kennen geven dat de verrijking van uranium wordt gestaakt en het moet weer volop meewerken met de inspecteurs van het internationaal agentschap voor atoomenergie iaea maar rusland en china de zinsnede geschrapt dat de iraanse nucleaire activiteiten een bedreiging vormen voor de internationale vrede en veiligheid want in dat geval zijn op grond van het vn handvest nadere strafmaatregelen vrijwel onvermijdelijk iran staat meer ge soleerd dan ooit sprak condoleezza rice het westerse kamp moed in na de uitspraak van de veiligheidsraad maar dat isolement is nog verre van benauwend
7813701 hij schreef dinsdag een brief aan vn baas annan waarin hij zich erover beklaagde dat isra ls illegale kolonisatiepolitiek de kans op het bereiken van een vredesregeling op basis van een twee statenoplossing om zeep helpt de brief veroorzaakte onder westerse diplomaten enige opschudding want hoewel negatief ingebed suggereerde de term twee statenoplossing toch een kleine verschuiving in het hamas standpunt de dingen hebben nooit een rechte lijn in het midden oosten dus wat gebeurde zahar haastte zich toe te lichten dat zijn brief geen spoor van een erkenning van isra l bevatte niettemin bleef de indruk bestaan dat de realiteitszin zich even had doen gelden bij een regering die allicht begint te beseffen dat de iraanse lofzang te weinig soelaas biedt een aansporing voor washington en brussel om zowel wortel als stok paraat te houden
7813702 en over iran zei hij laat het duidelijk zijn dat wij niet nog een kernmacht in de regio wensen
7813703 aanbevolen lectuur voor iedereen die meent dat de neoconservatieven een stelletje machtswellustelingen zijn of nog erger joodse complotteurs die de amerikaanse buitenlandse politiek tot een instrument van de staat isra l hebben willen maken zoals op allerhande weblogs maar al te vaak valt te lezen het neoconservatisme waarvan de grondleggers merendeels afkomstig zijn uit de linkse hoek is uitgegroeid tot een eigenstandige denkrichting in het debat over de amerikaanse buitenlandse politiek het neoconservatisme onderscheidt zich vooral door de opvatting dat het karakter van een regime van grote betekenis is voor vrede en veiligheid en dat de buitenlandse politiek de grondwaarden van de liberaal democratische samenleving dient uit te dragen
7813704 de internationale gemeenschap inclusief isra l gunt de hamas regering enig respijt maar zal deze adempauze voldoende zijn om over enkele maanden meer beweging aan het palestijnse front te mogen verwachten iran is een continuing story waarbij substanti le beslissingen telkens weer vooruit worden geschoven
7813705 in het geval van de vs ligt de zaak duidelijk bijna vijf jaar nadat president bush irak iran en noord korea uitriep tot de as van het kwaad dreigt ieder lid van dit boosaardige trio te ontglippen aan de amerikaanse controle irak staat drie nhalf jaar na de invasie aan de rand van een burgeroorlog iran blijft weigeren de verrijking van uranium te staken
7813706 de britse krant meldde dat iran hard bezig is om zijn invloed te versterken in het al qaida netwerk wat inlichtingendiensten vooral verontrust is de kans dat de iraanse connectie al qaida op termijn aan een vuile bom helpt
7813707 een van de neteligste problemen voor de amerikanen in irak zei fischer is dat buurland iran waarmee washington zo snel mogelijk in gesprek moet raken volgens baker c
7813708 kopstukken in het complexe politieke bestel van iran niet van harte wordt gesteund maar hooguit wordt gedoogd of als bad cop ingezet
7813709 allereerst is er de beteugeling van de nucleaire aspiraties van iran
7813710 nog zouden wagen aan een militair avontuur tegen iran maar ik zou er niet meer een groot geldbedrag op durven inzetten washington is duidelijk bezig de druk op iran op te voeren
7813711 reden voor grote bezorgdheid over een nucleair bewapend iran aldus drefner maar isra lische politici moeten zich niet wijs maken dat we terug zijn in 1938 en dat iran het nieuwe nazi duitsland is
7813712 de nucleaire ambities van noord korea en iran veroorzaken grote spanningen in oost azi en het midden oosten
7813713 foreign policy progressieve amerikaanse denktank de selectie van de winnaars ligt voor een deel voor de hand iran staat uiteraard op de eerste plaats
7813714 vijftien britse marinemensen in de iraanse territoriale wateren was de aanhouding een kwestie van toeval of was er sprake van een welbewuste iraanse actie naarmate de affaire langer duurde leek het er steeds meer op dat de aanhouding een welbewuste daad was een daad die veel weg heeft van een rare sprong door een kat in het nauw alle snoeverij van geestelijk leider ali khamenei en president mahmoud ahmadinejad kan niet verbloemen dat iran de laatste tijd behoorlijk ge soleerd is geraakt en te laten zien dat er met de islamitische republiek niet valt te spotten
7813715 aan beide kanten luidt het oordeel iran heeft dik gewonnen uiteraard is er een verschil in toonsoort
7813716 maar er valt ook iets te zeggen voor de stelling dat de gewijzigde krachtsverhoudingen in de palestijnse gebieden een nieuwe kans opleveren
7813717 mearsheimer en walt lijken te miskennen dat lobbyen een wezenskenmerk is van het amerikaanse politieke bestel even selectief gaan mearsheimer en walt te werk bij de onderbouwing van de centrale stelling van hun boek
7813718 de transatlantic trends laten namelijk ook zien dat de amerikaanse en europese opvattingen over de ernst van enkele wereldproblemen klimaatverandering terrorisme een nucleair iran de russische aspiraties elkaar weinig ontlopen
7813719 syrische woestijn maar is de kennelijk goed uitgevoerde aanval vooral een waarschuwingsboodschap aan iran dat als nucleaire mogendheid in wording en als ideologisch bevlogen stokebrand het werkelijke

7813721 frans amerikaanse vriendschap en verzekerde dat parijs net als washington vastbesloten is te voorkomen dat iran een kernwapenmacht wordt de amerikanen just loved it
7813722 verrassing twee het iran rapport van de gezamenlijke amerikaanse inlichtingendiensten waarin staat dat teheran naar alle waarschijnlijkheid
7813723 die dag wordt dan automatisch bestempeld als de day after het vorige week gepubliceerde iran rapport van de gezamenlijke amerikaanse inlichtingendiensten was dermate opzienbarend dat politici en commentatoren
7813724 dreigingen waaraan isra l blootstaat dreigingen die een nieuwe dimensie hebben gekregen door de nucleaire ambities van iran ik heb in de loop der tijd heel wat discussies met isra lis meegemaakt
7813725 daarmee ondermijnen de vs hun eigen pogingen om iran te weerhouden van de ontwikkeling van een kernwapen de regering bush stelt daar tegenover dat india anders dan iran al een halve eeuw een stabiele democratie

7813729 is your mom here i need to talk to her
7813730 i thought it would be a relief to us in business only to find out that air ugandas timings were not convenient
7813731 if i can be in nairobi by 6 00am hold two meetings one at 8 00am and another one at 2 00pm and be back in uganda at 6 00pm or 11 00pm on the same day it is only kenya airways offering that i am left with no choice but to bite the bullet
7813732 operators willing to ply a route should have an understanding between the two countries normally they should not have limitations but the route seems to have issues from the kenyan side

7813736 though the fig tree does not bud and there are no grapes on the vines though the olive crop fails and the fields produce no food though there are no sheep in the pen and no cattle in the stalls yet i will rejoice in the lord i will be joyful in god my savior
7813737 are you willing to regularly financially sow into the webchurch
7813738 note some webchurch members already donate as partners of extreme prophetic we suggest an additional monthly offering will be donated towards the ministry of the webchurch into your life in order for us to meet our webchurch expenses a minimum offering of 50 per month per family is necessary we are committed to serving our congregation with our whole hearts and will believe by faith for all our needs to be met we do however have confidence that our church members will desire to take financial responsibility for the care we are giving
7813739 extreme prophetic and xpwebchurch are committed to this principle that is why our people are so blessed we are trusting that everyone who comes under our covering will abide in the blessing of the lord and that there will be none poor or sick among us lets put our faith out together for that
7813740 second we repudiate the two extremes that define the present culture wars in the united states on one side we repudiate the partisans of a sacred public square those who would continue to give one religion a preferred place in public life in a diverse society it will always be unjust and unworkable to privilege one religion we are committed to religious liberty for people of all faiths we are firmly opposed to theocracy and we have no desire to coerce anyone or to impose beliefs and behavior on anyone we believe in persuasion on the other side we repudiate the partisans of a naked public square those who would make all religious expression inviolably private and keep the public square inviolably secular this position is even less just and workable because it excludes the overwhelming majority of citizens who are still profoundly religious nothing is more illiberal than to invite people into the public square but insist that they be stripped of the faith that makes them who they are we are committed to a civil public square a vision of public life in which citizens of all faiths are free to enter and engage the public square on the basis of their faith but within a framework of what is agreed to be just and free for other faiths as well every right we assert for ourselves as christians is a right we defend for all others
7813741 i am doing well here and very busy i am in meetings of one kind or another almost every day in order to get things going at tracys heart and other projects we met on saturday morning with the coordinator of a program similar to tracys heart we are starting it was a wonderful meeting the lady who runs it is very sharp and knows what is happening and what is needed they have a training program available which we will send our people to as well it is for people who will be counseling or dealing with the women and their families in any way the task is huge but lord willing we will help make a dent in it as well that group helped 448 women last year but i think all on an out patient basis anyway i am glad to have their assistance and hope we can work together in the future though it is our plan to open the center before i go we will probably not bring in any women until we have a chance to train some workers first if we do any helping it will be completely on an out patient basis as we have already been doing with 4 women and then we will see about actually brining some into the home after that we do though say a big thanks to international disaster and emergency services for sending us over 5000 to help with rebuilding the wall at tracys heart they also sent 10 000 to help some refugees in north kivu who have been forced out of their homes due to continued rebel activity in their area i hope to go there early next week to see that project get underway i will take just a couple of days myself but may leave someone there to continue seeing it through sopo is making good headway on his house he had the doors and windows installed yesterday so it now secure he will have a crew of friends there tomorrow morning at 6 am to tear the old house down from inside the new one the new one was built around and over the old one they will then dig holes for the poles which will be used to separate the various rooms nail pieces of split open bamboo across these so they can then fill in between with rocks and mud to make walls and to provide insulation from the cold i am not sue what the next step is after that but we are taking it one phase at a time i hope to get with the other pastor who lost his house to the earthquake to get him started on his building project as well i want to get at least a few pictures to send to you before i leave we have had a couple of pretty hard shakes the last two nights friday night about 2 am and sunday about 3 15 am i sure wish they would stop i feel light ones quite often but the hard ones keep us all on edge and a little shaky god bless thanks for the prayers and love which i constantly feel

7813754 the 17 point lead never existed everybody gets a bounce out of the convention
7813755 you know that youre going to be watched by more people than have seen you before that time

7813759 when ted kennedy comes here to ask us all to pull together as a party not many people in this hall are not going to take that next step
7813760 it never stopped him he didnt go in a corner and weep he just started something else and now here he is tonight so tenacious
7813761 anyone whos advanced for him knows he likes a stool
7813762 nothing nothing is going to keep me away from this special gathering
7813763 i have a headache from the altitude today i cant imagine what its like for someone whos got radiation chemotherapy and has to take a battery of drugs
7813764 their stories are very different but they share a commitment to the timeless american ideals of justice and fairness service and sacrifice faith and family
7813765 leaders like them come along rarely but once or twice in a lifetime they come along just when we need them the most
7813766 id heard it from a pretty good source last night but everyone was thrilled to hear about it at our breakfast this is the kind of moment that sen kennedy lives for
7813767 id heard something over the weekend but his health is such an issue it wasnt clear if hed be able to come
7813768 im a cancer survivor and i know how draining this kind of thing can be
7813769 it pushes the focus back on the challenge ahead and on obama and the race it gives people something positive to talk about
7813770 this may be ted kennedys final gift to the party
7813771 this says that he feels this is the democrats year and the party is not as unified as hed like it to be his appearance takes the headlines away from the clinton faction
7813772 happens to be somebody who i love to death hes just a good man and obviously hes going through a difficult time but im glad that we can use this convention to remind people of the contributions hes made to this country
7813773 just charges the atmosphere here the emotion is enormous its just what you want to start off the convention
7813774 many people who have known joe for many years and have considered him a friend are disappointed
7813775 many others are actually angry he has basically turned his back on the democratic party
7813776 a vote for lamont would jeopardize our chances for getting a democrat in the white house in 2008
7813777 are a bad reflection on him as a human being
7813778 it is all too easy to find the 100 women who will protest at the convention and they become the story
7813779 rather than to talk about the underlying numbers of women voters who in droves will vote for obama
7813780 people dont know yet that john mccain is just bad for women
7813781 talking about these differences is clearly a pathway to generating intensity among women voters
7813782 these swing women voters have tremendous economic anxiety right now
7813783 women are going to the watercooler and talking about what just happened in georgia
7813784 they are not unmindful of the way the world impacts on them
7813785 the adoption of appropriate information behaviour to identify through whatever channel or medium information well fitted to information needs leading to wise and ethical use of information in society
7813786 this report is a devastating critique of the problems the new system of funding is having
7813787 in 1984 i was very unpopular with the democratic party
7813788 i had committed the unforgivable sin of losing in 1988 there was a little more warmth and this year ive been more or less reconstituted as a positive figure
7813789 i have participated in the last three conventions when we did not have an incumbent president to re elect
7813790 but will now follow the custom established during the past 40 years by other democratic presidents including harry truman who only attended the first convention after he left office
7813791 anyone who believes he is responsible for what bill clinton did in secret at night with a young intern is absolutely stupid and ridiculous carter told georgias delegates
7813792 he cant stand up as frankly as i did and explain it to you but somehow in the american peoples minds he has to convince them of that absolute truth
7813793 malthus was right in predicting that the population would grow geometrically but he didnt foresee our ability to make geometric improvements in agricultural technology even today with several countries in the world suffering massive famines there is little doubt that a commitment to use more land and newer agricultural methods could vastly increase the amount of food produced on earth the problem we now face is therefore more complicated than the one malthus identified in theory the food supply can keep up with the population for a long while yet but in practice we have chosen to escape the malthusian dilemma by making a set of dangerous bargains with the future worthy of the theatrical legend that haunted the birth of the scientific revolution doctor faustus
7813794 observations concerning the increase of mankind peopling of countries etc
7813795 the great increase of offspring in particular families is not always owing to greater fecundity of nature but sometimes to examples of industry in the heads and industrious education by which the children are enabled to provide better for themselves
7813796 we are the finest race in the world and that the more of the world we inhabit the better it is for the human race just fancy those parts that are at present inhabited by the most despicable specimens of human beings what an alteration there would be if they were brought under anglo saxon influence i contend that every acre added to our territory means in the future birth to some more of the english race who otherwise would not be brought into existence
7813797 are reproducing relatively too fast therefore birth control methods must be taught them they must not have too easy access to relief or hospital treatment lest the removal of the last check on natural selection should make it too easy for children to be produced or to survive lengthy unemployment should be grounds for sterilization or at least relief should be contingent upon no further children being brought into the world and so on since a high degree of intellect and imagination of scientific and artistic ability and other qualities cannot be adequately expressed or utilized in the great majority of the lower strata it is useless to plan for their genetic increase in these strata indeed it is more than useless it is dangerous for the frustration of inherent capacity leads to discontent and revolution in some men to neurosis and inefficiency in others the case is strictly analogous to that of cattle in africa in an unfavorable environment too drastic genetic improvement is worse than none
7813798 it will be necessary quite soon to face the fact that only a certain fraction of any human population is equipped by heredity to be able to take full or even reasonable advantage of a full higher or professional education
7813799 thus even though it is quite true that any radical eugenic policy will be for many years politically and psychologically impossible it will be important for unesco to see that the eugenic problem is examined with the greatest care and that the public mind is informed of the issues at stake so that much that now is unthinkable may at least become thinkable
7813800 the same speech hes been giving for months why didnt he give the germans something more
7813801 it was a tent in the desert 100 degree heat off and on for what seemed like forever
7813802 why was i held by the united states like that when i was their ally
7813803 if theyre exaggerating and distorting this much in august what will october be like
7813804 oftentimes one brings in celebrity for a sense of making a campaign look like its young and vibrant and visionary and all the rest of it you give it a bit of that showbiz juice the problem is that the last thing that barack obama needs is showbiz juice
7813805 hes got all the charisma hes got the speaking the whole idea of this rock star candidate is now to some extent being reframed to become a liability the democratic party has to be really careful that they dont paint themselves as a hollywood presidency kind of thing
7813806 a lot of people are beginning to realize that celebrity endorsements are doing a lot more to get you to change your mind about the celebrity than they do to get you to change your mind about a candidate
7813807 most people come to candidates with pretty set ideas of what their party is and who they like and who they dont
7813808 just because one of their favourite actors endorses someone or speaks for one of them i think its more likely that the average voter is going to say oh i used to like that celebrity but they like candidate x so i dont like that celebrity anymore
7813809 if the youth vote turns out as it did with the primaries for obama i think youre going to see a president obama
7813810 if the youth vote does as it has done in the past and that is that it always promises and looks like its going to be behind john kerry or al gore then what youre going to see is president mccain
7813811 i think it cuts both ways the candidates want celebrities there because it brings media attention but they dont want them around too much because they dont want to bring negative attention as though it is just a celebrity kind of endorsement
7813812 depending on the celebrity you might be able to register three votes but you might lose three votes there are people in hollywood who are very divisive in terms of their politics
7813813 the celebrities use it as a means of getting themselves back into the limelight
7813814 its what i would call a synergistic relationship where both sides probably benefit in a celebrity spectacle culture
7813815 cos come a noi la giustizia non piace la vogliamo cambiare e lo faremo dialogando

7813852 30 years of feminism have emancipated women but emasculated men while girls gained their freedom to sleep with whom they wanted and to succeed in any career they chose to pursue boys were gradually formed by social pressure into what women confused and giddy with their new found freedom thought they wanted their men to be
7813853 the family unit will become happier and stronger as we play our natural roles

7813857 our robust 2008 interim results were mainly driven by our premium
7813858 subsequent to the announcement of the remarkable interim results the group successfully entered into a loan agreement with a syndicate of banks for up to hk 450 million at an interest rate of approximately 4 the loan will be used to support the groups future development by providing capital to further expand its production capacity and marketing and sales efforts our ability to obtain financing in todays tight credit environment is a testament to the strength of our operations and our future prospects
7813859 he does not feel that obama has given him the respect due to him as a former president

7813861 in the process of expanding in europe germany is one of several possible future markets

7813863 according to our observations germany is a market that could soon be ripe for current
7813864 tv and the web amount to the same thing to us
7813865 unlike most broadcasters we do not only use television to attract people to the internet on the contrary people go to current com swap thoughts concerns and videos and then we bring the best of it to the tv screen
7813866 the first is a failure to provide a safe system of work for the movement of vehicles and plant at the site
7813867 relatively small vehicles such as the land rover in which the two deceased were travelling were not prevented from being operated in close proximity to large vehicles including dump trucks while they were being operated with reduced visual fields thereby creating a risk of collision
7813868 the second is a failure to provide the operators of all mobile plant with suitable means of communication or other equipment to reduce the risk of collision and injury
7813869 these two deaths were entirely preventable and arose from the clear failure of scottish coal to provide suitable means of communication between different vehicles on site in order to reduce the risk of collisions as well as a failure to manage vehicles on their site
7813870 earth moving vehicles such as dump trucks or bulldozers have poor visual fields due to their large size
7813871 it is crucial that additional steps are taken to ensure that the drivers of these dump trucks are aware of other smaller vehicles around them
7813872 control measures to reduce the risk are easily available at a minimal cost installing an additional camera on the side of the dump truck fitting a raised roof beacon or other means of improving visibility on the land rover could prevent similar incidents in the future
7813873 hey kids looking for a good church choir to sing in this fall
7813874 the churches desperate hunger to mean more in politics and economics had the perverse effect of making them less effective opponents of the political and economic pressures on the nation they mattered more when they wanted to matter less

7813921 we have brought in world renown poker managers dealers and players in the industry including houston waldie steve cyr jimmy miller steven braverman and blaine goodwin to kick off the only poker lounge in the city
7813922 hard rock likes to push the envelope when it comes to entertainment so the lounge will be no different
7813923 job seekers in some fields are competing aggressively for open positions giving employers the edge in those segments of the hiring market at the same time however companies continue to face a shortage of highly skilled professionals in fields such as technology and accounting these in demand workers may not be willing to leave secure positions unless firms extend very attractive job offers
7813924 businesses are operating on leaner resources and are competing to secure the intellectual capital that will drive productivity and new revenue streams companies are also replacing lower performing employees to strengthen their talent bench to prepare for a time when the economy shifts into higher gear
7813925 recruiting highly skilled professionals may require a greater financial commitment or special perks that provide a more attractive work environment however nearly three quarters of employees surveyed said the availability of flexible schedules may cause them to choose one job over another

7813932 go back and support those pro gay state legislators and eliminate the anti gay state legislators
7813933 just a little bit of money goes a long way
7813934 the only way bigots are going to learn is if we take their power away from them
7813935 number one they need to import a large amount of wheat
7813936 if they need wheat right now the us is the place to go
7813937 the idea of that in 2000 was to promote certain types of exports to sanctioned countries so there would be food medicine agricultural products medical products
7813938 it is still surprising that they are buying wheat from the us instead of waiting to buy wheat from someone else
7813939 maybe the relationship between iran and the us is not as terrible as it has been
7813940 iran is more interested in showing to its people that it is not restrained by sanctions
7813941 the real signal is look were doing fine we can buy wheat from the us

7813958 america should be a place where you can make it if you try and barack stood up that day and spoke words that have stayed with me ever since he talked about and he said that all too often we accept the distance between the two and we settle for the world as it is even when it doesnt reflect our values and aspirations but he reminded us that we also know what our world should look like he said we know what fairness and justice and opportunity look like and he urged us to believe in ourselves to find the strength within ourselves to strive for the world as it should be its the story of men and women gathered in churches and union halls and high school gyms people who stood up and marched and risked everything they had refusing to settle determined to mold our future into the shape of our ideals
7813959 generations of the american people have surged through the preambles portal and widened its gate like constitutions amendments are not just words but deeds flesh and blood struggles to redeem americas promise while making amends for some of the sins of our fathers
7813960 choices can also be confusing stressful and in the end you can always make the wrong one when it comes to medicine my knowledge is possibly not as comprehensive as that of a qualified and experienced practitioner i would therefore rather know that all hospitals and surgeries are clean and friendly and then allow my gp to refer me to the nearest one where i could receive the required treatment
7813961 when ministers speak of choice what they really mean is installing the practice of privatised competition in the public sector
7813962 its just not in the supply budget to have the school district buy a packet of markers for each student
7813963 we want them to communicate their needs we can usually help them out
7813964 buy items in the middle of the school year and youll pay a lot more
7813965 we have children put a post it near parts of a story that they didnt understand or want to come back to
7813966 whether our contrition is genuine or not is a question which cannot be left to our own discretion but must be left to the judgment of god therefore no one can say without presumption that he is truly contrite
7813967 if a man were required to say that he was truly contrite he would be driven to presumption and to the impossible task of knowing all sin and evil in his heart
7813968 gods promise in the sacrament is sure our contrition is never sure for this reason god would have us build not on our uncertain contrition but on his certain promise so that we may be able to persevere in every time of trouble
7813969 are secluded like dreary sepulchres from the light of day
7813970 it will be hard to say no to 1m but its not just about money its a feeling too its going to be a difficult decision

7813974 any player would want to play for arsenal of course but for inler this may be perhaps a little early maybe a season too early
7813975 we have received two interesting offers both of which are from english clubs what we always do is defend our interests we wont sell any player if the bid is not the amount we have asked for
7813976 if they want albert riera theyll have to pay what espanyol is asking
7813977 scotts injury came as a surprise to us because he trained on friday morning
7813978 its an abductor muscle and so he is going to have a look at that but he might be fit for next week hes a strong lad so we will see how he is
7813979 americans who believe in the second amendment believe its a constitutional right americans who believe in god believe its a matter of personal faith americans who believe in protecting good american jobs believe its a matter of the american dream
7813980 people embrace faith not because they are materially poor but because they are spiritually rich
7813981 ask not what your country can do for you but ask what you can do for your country
7813982 all the chinese know is humping communism and dog eating leave the nfl alone
7813983 could it be a msm ploy to divide the emerging blogosphere
7813984 they definitely want this some of them i think someone wrote about this
7813985 if sports journalists at major newspapers and magazines feel compelled to change their standards because of the proliferation of gossip and pressure from superiors and start reporting more off the field gossip
7813986 if something were to happen and id have the opportunity to go to a place where baseball is breakfast lunch and dinner that would be awesome

7813993 kita lihat dari kps produksi yang produksi lebih dari 10 000 bph treatmentnya seperti apa kemudian 5 000 10 000 bph treatment nya juga dibedakan
7813994 kalau yang di bawah 5 000 bph juga kita cap bagaimana dia mau meningkatkan produksi
7813995 itu kan di carry forward bukan dihilangkan kita tidak mau ngemplang cost recovey
7813996 kalau cuma di cap di satu tahun lalu di carry over di tahun berikutnya itu sih sama saja dengan tidak ada pembatasan
7813997 yang dimaksud pembatasan itu semestinya ya misalnya diganti hanya 80 atau 60 saja dari keseluruhan biaya operasi yang dikeluarkan dan tidak lalu dicarry over ke tahun berikutnya

7814012 when you represent the country performance has to be there and i wish he performs on the cricket field
7814013 this is certainly good for the game in india but the proposed suggestion of the candidate retiring at least ten years ago to be a selector is debatable
7814014 its been absolutely fantastic with great weather to go with it
7814015 the people of colne are very proud to have this festival here as it is regarded as the number one blues festival in the country
7814016 economically it is a massive boom because 35 000 people need to eat drink and sleep and it has all been very good natured

7814020 hok will play an important role in helping us to create a building that will attract the worlds best scientists to the uk this country is already a leader in medical research this project plays a fundamental role in our ambition to consolidate and build on that position
7814021 we want a building that will help our scientists work with experts from different disciplines from centres of excellence across the country and the world to make a tremendous difference to our understanding of human disease
7814022 our goal is to create an intelligent and memorable building one which works and delivers the benefits of research and innovation to the patient
7814023 are secluded like dreary sepulchres from the light of day
7814024 the groups performance in the first half together with our growth potential supports the boards view that rio tinto presents a very strong stand alone
7814025 the driver of demand for our products is urbanisation and industrialisation in heavily populated countries like china and india and these economies continue to grow strongly
7814026 no really thats my address i can show you my drivers license if you want
7814027 my wastewater treatment system is smarter than your honor student

7814029 people forget we had 99 points and were in first place 60 70 percent of the year weve added two players in bobby holik and brian rolston and certainly were looking for a defenseman or two to come in and play or push somebody and well see what happens from there
7814030 as you might imagine for barack running for president is nothing compared to that first game of basketball with my brother craig

7814038 weve looked at several ways to play anticipated growth in wind energy weve also considered titanium makers for that industrys ties to the production of lightweight modern aircraft
7814039 while the two trends might not appear to have much in common at first glance hxl offers a way to play both the aircraft and wind markets
7814040 the connection is the lightweight composite materials hexcel makes that are used by producers in both sectors hexcel develops and manufactures advanced structural materials
7814041 it is the largest u s producer of carbon fiber the worlds largest weaver of reinforcement fabrics and the number one producer of composite materials
7814042 its product was initially developed for the aerospace industry but is now used in a wide range of applications from golf clubs to satellite arrays and from the rotor blades of wind turbines to life saving monocoques for formula 1 race cars
7814043 its been a rollercoaster ride for hexcels stock in the past 12 months the shares hit their one year peak of 27 19 in december 2007 by january 22nd they had plummeted to 17 the shares rebounded through may only to fade again year to date hxl is off about 15
7814044 second quarter profits came in shy of wall streets expectations as a result of costs associated with the start up of four overseas manufacturing plants and a weak u s dollar the reason hexcel has been investing in plants in europe is to be closer to customers such as airbus
7814045 hexcel just won a big order from airbus that was the biggest in the companys history
7814046 hexcel is in a great position to profit from the growing investment in wind energy platforms and the demand for lighter weight more fuel efficient airplanes the skyrocketing price of crude during q2 did much to disrupt the plans of cash strapped airlines to acquire the new planes
7814047 boeings delays getting the dreamliner in the air have also been well documented those are short term problems however long term it is inevitable that air carriers will want these newer planes in their fleets
7814048 wind energy is obviously a hot topic too oilman boone pickens is pushing wind farms as an alternative to oil fired power plants al gores alliance for climate protection meanwhile has promoted them as an anecdote to greenhouse gas emissions
7814049 when two guys like gore and pickens coming from opposite ends of the political spectrum can come to the same view theres some karma happening
7814050 a strong dollar should help hexcels cost structure in its overseas plants and could well lead to an earnings surprise in the second half of the year if the trend continues this is a stock to keep on our radar
7814051 why does it always snow when im going to talk about global warming
7814052 sydneys largest dam warragamba has received 43mm of rain since thursday while the regions smaller dams got a better soaking including the upper nepean which got 108mm
7814053 the water problem is so severe for adelaide that it may run out of water by early 2009
7814054 environmentalists can have a sense of humour too environmentalists can have a sense of humour too
7814055 were not a public utility were a newspaper and we cover things based on what is newsworthy people who have half a percent or less following among the public are much less newsworthy than people with 40 and 50 percent
7814056 the nader campaign is based on a simple premise there is no difference between the two major parties
7814057 this is true if you stand far enough away from the two parties in the same way new york and tokyo would look similar if you were standing on the moon
7814058 a self indulgent exercise that that will distract voters from the clear cut choice represented by the major party candidates
7814059 the public deserves to see the major party candidates compete on an uncluttered playing field
7814060 protectionism would destroy our prosperity and make the worlds poor even more miserable it is a strange platform for the ralph nader who says he speaks for the weak and the neglected
7814061 many of those who are thinking about voting for mr nader probably imagine that he is still the moderate humane activist of the 1960s
7814062 any presidential candidate whose running mate is winona laduke an ojibway indian activist from a minnesota reservation must be considered both marginal and self indulgent
7814063 like an enormous zit on prom night when least expected or desired nader and his green party followers have reappeared on the political scene
7814064 one of the saddest sights in politics is a fading public figure who refuses to concede that his or her time has passed
7814065 the latest egotist to ignore reality is ralph nader the aging consumer advocate whose crusades stalled and popularity sagged long ago nader is in the great tradition of political diehards who stubbornly hope against hope that they can keep the reporters and speaking fees coming despite all the derisive laughter
7814066 the two party system works fine if not perfectly why cant we leave it at that
7814067 im going to hang around and walk through the convention hall and shake as many hands as seem to be friendly
7814068 they say i got them into politics not the young ones of course
7814069 they invite us we wave everybody cheers we sit down
7814070 i think hes more ready for it clearly by far than i was

7814075 i still believe its an advantage if you know how to win a us open
7814076 its a tough tournament to win rafa has never been beyond the quarters so thats definitely the advantage i carry to the other players
7814077 i want my baby back baby back baby back ribs
7814078 we will not attend the clear message is that the dialogue is still under way and we dont expect any member of the executive to address us until that dialogue has been concluded
7814079 when you and daddy drink orange juice and then you will start on fire
7814080 let me get this straight daddy and i drink orange juice and then start on fire
7814081 uh huh i have a machine in my bum that makes fire and orange juice
7814082 i see that the billing department worked on that august 6th but i dont know why they didnt fix it
7814083 it looks like our billing department was looking into that let me contact them to find out the status and i will give you a call back to follow up
7814084 to all the candidates tell me your position on gun control as myself and other americans really want to know if our babies are safe
7814085 this is my baby purchased under the 1994 gun ban
7814086 i believe we ought to move it out let the individual communities decide their gun laws and how guns ought to be treated
7814087 it has had a devastating impact on elections because the nra has targeted and spent millions of dollars distorting individual members views and al gores views
7814088 the key is going to be also attacking poverty bringing people together dealing with those kids in the ghettos that are heavy users of gun violence and they are victims of gun violence to make sure that this country attacks the core problems of poverty having child care bringing parents together
7814089 are you going to be able to keep his baby safe
7814090 ill tell you what if that is his baby he needs help
7814091 i dont know that he is mentally qualified to own that gun
7814092 get bitter they cling to guns or religion as a way to explain their frustrations
7814093 ill tell you what if that is his baby he needs help
7814094 i dont know that he is mentally qualified to own that gun
7814095 there used to be an organization for people who believed in a truly limited government limited taxes limited spending limited interference in individual lives and limited intervention in foreign affairs that organization was known as the republican party but the only one of those beliefs that still motivates the g o p establishment is limited taxes
7814096 the ipcc is a scientific intergovernmental body set up by the world meteorological organization and by the united nations environment programme
7814097 the governments the ipcc is open to all member countries of wmo and unep governments of participate in plenary sessions of the ipcc where main decisions about the ipcc workprogramme are taken and reports are accepted adopted and approved they also participate the review of ipcc reports
7814098 leaving my television on all day and night so i can increase my global footprint
7814099 it could be good for the nation if other corporate companies could emulate what standard bank has done to work with undp on an issue that is of national and global concern
7814100 we believe that coal use will increase under any foreseeable scenario because it is cheap and abundant
7814101 should and will take actions to reduce the emissions of co2 and other greenhouse gas emissions
7814102 coal will continue to play a large and indispensable role in a greenhouse gas constrained world
7814103 shook his fist in wrath as he walked the platform a white foam gathered upon his lips giving him a look of ferocity
7814104 does mr lincoln wish to push these things to the point of personal difficulties here douglas demanded backing around and shaking his clenched fist within a few inches of lincolns face
7814105 made him look like humpty dumpty in a toupee while lincolns height was largely in his legs and gave audiences the impression of a scarecrow come to life
7814106 this government was made by our fathers on the white basis
7814107 by white men for the benefit of white men and their posterity forever
7814108 when lincoln rose to take the oath and discovered that he had no place to rest his top hat douglas obligingly stepped forward and held it for him
7814109 a sad heart with a grief that i have never before experienced
7814110 my best moment i have a lot of good moments but the one i prefer is when i kicked the hooligan
7814111 i didnt study i live you cant study these things life teaches them to you you dont find them in a book ive read a lot of socrates on page 3 of the sun
7814112 football is like making love if you cant last 90 minutes like me you wont win
7814113 an issue that deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts always loved that adjective noun pairing what is an untrue fact from all sides and not just propaganda from one
7814114 deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts from all sides and not just the propaganda from one
7814115 capitalism is the greatest system ever created for alleviating general human misery and yet it breeds ingratitude because we constantly hear how cruel capitalism is while this collectivism or that is more loving because unlike capitalism collectivism is about the group not the individual
7814116 i learned this shes stronger and tougher that he bill clinton is when she takes a point youre gonna have to be sure youre well informed because she will not compromise shes very bright shes strong and when she gets her dander up she aint going to roll over
7814117 im convinced he has a sexual addiction he needs to get help for his sake he has already damaged his presidency beyond repair
7814118 when truman boarded a train january 1953 at union station without a penny in federal largesse except a microscopic army pension the president knew he would have to sell some property and would even have to dip into his own pocket to buy stamps to answer the 72 000 pieces of mail he received in just the first two weeks after he left the white house
7814119 he assured me the press stories concerning the kickbacks he got in exchange for state contracts were not true he lied to me
7814120 boy is she bitter about the press if george w loses shes gonna pop off the bush press bashing didnt abate even after their boy became president
7814121 i dont know what powell is going to do but if he were to jump into the political arena as a republican he could get the nomination as vice president if not the presidential nomination and he could beat clinton easily
7814122 john mccain would be stronger against gore gore will be a dull unspiring loser candidate for the democrats mccain looks stronger he is stronger mccain because of his military service and vietnam prisoner of war hero status you know he had a hehluva military record
7814123 bush has that air reserve texas national guard record of course gores war record in vietnam aint much either
7814124 it was just the dynamics in that particular campaign that they happened to face
7814125 sometimes theres just a big element of luck in life
7814126 i congratulate senator barack obama on his selection of my friend
7814127 i have enjoyed for many years the opportunity to work with joe biden to bring strong bipartisan support for united states foreign policy
7814128 will continue to have widespread support for higher office during many years ahead
7814129 he selected lieberman and the two men not selected in 2000 wound up being our national ticket in 2004
7814130 so for evan bayh getting this far in this process points to only bigger and better things to come in the future in my view
7814131 dear i finished second or third in a contest where they dont give bronze or silver medals
7814132 a hoosier was considered so seriously for such an important post
7814133 i welcomed that and i came through in fine shape
7814134 and then they showed pictures of me in the kitchen making breakfast
7814135 senator biden was kind enough to say youve got a lot of years ahead of you and this could happen next time for you
7814136 i suspect obama might well have preferred bayh as his vice president in office but opted for the person he thought most likely to help in the campaign
7814137 bayhs future continues to be bright in the senate or in an obama administration
7814138 certainly has more to do with joe biden than evan bayh
7814139 hes still young by presidential campaign standards and hes got a great record and profile
7814140 i think that this process here more than in 2000 and 2004 exposed the rest of the nation to how great a leader he is in the democratic party and all the great assets he brings
7814141 we now know that barack obama doesnt truly respect hoosiers
7814142 a group or a member of such a group or class enjoying intellectual social or economic status the best or most skilled members of a group
7814143 the belief that certain persons or members of certain classes or groups deserve favored treatment by virtue of their perceived superiority the sense of entitlement enjoyed by such a group

7814145 im from a military family ive moved around a lot actually the place i lived longest was in hanoi
7814146 a political gaffe it is said occurs when a politician inadvertently tells the truth
7814147 weve seen an increase in fuel and water rate debts linked to the increases in the cost of living people on income support are finding it harder and harder to make their benefit stretch
7814148 fuel debts used to be rare but its now a regular occurrence and its not just people who are on benefits its also people who are working
7814149 some people are missing meals to save money especially pensioners
7814150 they regard it as important to pay their bills and to make sure theyve got the money some are only having one meal a day theyre literally going hungry
7814151 i recently referred one man to age concern because i was so concerned about the lack of food he was eating
7814152 i though it was leaving him not able to manage we estimate we see only a fraction of the people who are struggling because pensioners tend not to ask for help
7814153 housekeeping food and clothing is the one bit of your budget you can control so if youre on a low income thats what gets hammered
7814154 people are obviously thinking that winters coming and we had a bad winter last year theres concern about whats coming
7814155 the government must seize control of this escalating crisis and take immediate action to ease the pressure on millions of households
7814156 as an emergency measure to help alleviate the problem this winter the government and energy companies should be working together to offer fuel vouchers to the poorest pensioners
7814157 in order to stand a real chance of helping the poorest pensioners the government must make it mandatory for energy companies to offer social tariffs at the cheapest rates
7814158 as patron of produced in kent and trustee of canterbury cathedral i feel both these issues have enormous national importance
7814159 this is a unique and i hope effective way to raise the profile of both these issues

7814183 dear supporter today our campaign joins in a historic partnership with al gore together we will move america forward yes we can
7814184 there is incredible enthusiasm for senator obamas vice presidential announcement and unfortunately some people have used that enthusiasm and sent out hoaxes
7814185 we can assure supporters these texts are not coming from the campaign and their data is secure
7814186 whether or not our next president and congress dismantle empire usa plus turning things around here at home
7814187 obama had a fork in the road go for experience or change
7814188 why dont we pass 1 3 trillion of that back to the people who pay the bills
7814189 i have to put everything on the table i dont think its a good alternative but if they can prove that it is and they want to pay royalties to the taxpayer let us use those royalties to invest in renewable energy resources then we have something to talk about
7814190 oh were going to have elections were going to have them by october theyre going to be inclusive theyre going to be transparent theyre going to be fair and this or that
7814191 were not staying around for ever for you to get around to this you have to do it now overdue

7814193 the point is is that it shouldnt have an impact on the womans right to choose roe v wade talks about very clear definitions of when the child first trimester certain considerations second trimester not so third trimester theres very clear distinctions
7814194 and if that in fact is a a a a good alternative then that is something that we should do

7814199 i know that joe will campaign well for senator obama and so i think hes going to be very formidable
7814200 ive always respected joe biden but i disagreed with him from the time he voted against the first gulf war to his position where he said you had to break iraq up into three different countries we really have different approaches to many national security issues

7814242 a strong russia scares the americans and their clients a weak russia scares them as well
7814243 a legitimate conclusion to this is that it would be better if there were no russia at all
7814244 we used to cut down a lot of trees to plant cocoa cutting down trees used to be normal
7814245 there seemed to be a lot of will and support for the idea that the communities should be receiving benefits
7814246 there is an overall understanding that aiding local people is an important part of what we should do
7814247 there are georgian forces on one side ossetians on the other
7814248 is this a normal life we are afraid our children will be killed
7814249 the only thing we want is peace i dont care who we are with russia or georgia people are dying
7814250 they are trying to force out the ossetian population it is our territory
7814251 we hope the agreement will end the differences between the somali leaders

7814253 our purpose is not to create a trade bloc we are committed to open regionalism and adopt an inclusive approach

7814266 the fall from 97 5 to a three year low of 94 8 was sharper than the consensus forecast but broadly in line with our own expectations
7814267 the decline was due to falls in both business expectations and perceptions of current conditions
7814268 i am 65 so therefore i am considered an elderly person the sign doesnt represent older people as they are today there should be a generic sign that is representative of all vulnerable pedestrians regardless of age
7814269 the sign portrays a small proportion of the older generation they are assuming everyone who is old looks like that and they dont
7814270 to change every sign in the country would cost taxpayers hundreds of thousands of pounds and a change in the law

7814299 thats shocking the academic debate is between some who say that junior enlisted ranks lean slightly republican and some who say its about equal but no one would point to six to one
7814300 that represents a tremendous shift from 2000 when the military vote almost certainly was decisive in florida and elsewhere and leaned heavily towards the republicans
7814301 if on a bad day a guy gets that letter that says his tour has been extended from 12 to 15 months that could spur a quick donation and expression of anger
7814302 donating helps members of the military express their political views privately
7814303 its hard to describe how apolitical a lot of the enlisted ranks are hes worried about other things than following the news
7814304 it took some effort to get that check i had my mom send me my checkbook and i walked to the post office in camp liberty in baghdad with an envelope addressed to barack obama in chicago illinois
7814305 he was right on iraq long when others were jumping into the sea like lemmings and thats hard to do were soldiers and we respect courage
7814306 most of my friends are conservative republicans and they say im voting for barack mccain does not have a lock on the military vote thats for sure
7814307 well complete our duty im deploying next year because its a commitment i made to the nation not to a president but we all know that iraq was a big mistake
7814308 as soon as the surge was ordered my tour was extended just by a pronouncement from the president for very few americans can the president say something and your lives are changed
7814309 thank you for contacting me about karl roves failure to appear before the judiciary committee i appreciate that you took the time to share your thoughts with me the judiciary committee is taking karl roves failure to testify very seriously and we are currently considering all options including contempt proceedings to compel him to answer important questions regarding the firing of several u s attorneys some have suggested that congress implement inherent contempt as if that is a viable option the jail cell in the basement of the capitol doesnt exist and the sergeant at arms is an over 60 year old executive congress is not a police force and we will likely need to continue to utilize the courts and system of justice to pursue these matters again thanks for being in touch please do not hesitate to let me know if i may ever be of assistance to you or your family
7814310 resolved that rooms a and b opposite the room of the solicitor of the court of claims in the capitol be and are hereby assigned as guardroom and office of the capitol police and are for that purpose placed under charge of the sergeant at arms of the house with power to fit the same up for purpose specified resolved that said wooley for his repeated contempt of the authority of the house be kept until otherwise ordered by the house in close confinement in the guardroom of the capitol police by the sergeant at arms until said wooley shall fully answer the questions above recited and all questions put to him by said committee in relation to the subject of the investigations with which the committee is charged and that meanwhile no person shall communicate with said wooley in writing or verbally except upon the order of the speaker
7814311 under the inherent contempt power the house sergeant at arms has the authority to take karl rove into custody and bring him to the house where his contempt case can be tried presumably by a standing or select committee if he is found by the house to be in contempt of congress he can be imprisoned for an amount of time determined by the house not to exceed the term of the 110th congress which ends the beginning of january 2009 or until he agrees to testify the supreme court has recognized the power of the house to enforce its own subpoenas through the inherent contempt provision stating that without it congress would be exposed to every indignity and interruption that rudeness caprice or even conspiracy may mediate against it before congress asked the justice department to try contempt cases on its behalf the inherent contempt power was used more than 85 times between 1795 and 1934 mostly to compel testimony and documents
7814312 both chambers also have an inherent contempt power allowing either body to hold its own trials and even jail those found in defiance of congress although widely used during the 19th century the power has not been invoked since 1934 and democratic lawmakers have not displayed an appetite for reviving the practice
7814313 u s code title 2 the congress chapter 6 congressional and committee procedure investigations sec 193 privilege of witnesses no witness is privileged to refuse to testify to any fact or to produce any paper respecting which he shall be examined by either house of congress or by any joint committee established by a joint or concurrent resolution of the two houses of congress or by any committee of either house upon the ground that his testimony to such fact or his production of such paper may tend to disgrace him or otherwise render him infamous

7814316 wow the blogs have gone crazy about the story i did
7814317 nothing more than an in print character assassination of rush limbaugh sean hannity and bill oreilly a foray into absurd leftist delusions of links between them and the vile murderer in a tennessee church this past july 27
7814318 this is newsday giving this woman a license to assault these fine men in print accusing them of complicity in murder newsday should immediately publish a full retraction and an abject and absolute apology to those defamed by this womans wretched words
7814319 bill oreillys people ambushed me in my driveway today with camera and microphone i guess ill be on the show tonight or tomorrow this is not what i had wanted yikes wish me luck i dont feel bad about anything i said but hell probably edit it to make me look like an idiot
7814320 because of its liberal teachings and his belief that all liberals should be killed because they were ruining the country and that the democrats had tied his countrys hands in the war on terror and had ruined every institution in america with the aid of media outlets
7814321 the islamofascists are actually campaigning for the election of democrats
7814322 the best damn thing that can happen to this country
7814323 there are things in life worth fighting and dying for and one of them is making sure nancy pelosi doesnt become the speaker
7814324 tak ing our side should there be some kind of catastrophic attack
7814325 march thousands of us into the hands of the enemy they would gladly take the guns of the american military and turn them first on the american patriot rather than turning the guns of the american patriot on the enemy within
7814326 the far left in america is dominated by haters people who despise their own country
7814327 i am very proud of everything i wrote in let freedom ring
7814328 sure these guys hold some responsibility for what happened but we all hold responsibility particularly anyone who hasnt stood up and spoken out against hate speech were all contributing to the climate where people are being dehumanized because of their beliefs
7814329 the inherent worth and dignity of all people this has been part of our mission since abolitionism continuing through womens suffrage the civil rights movement and our current advocacy on behalf of gay lesbian bisexual and transgender persons
7814330 continue to stand on the side of love even and especially during these complicated times
7814331 do you have a mac no then never mind whats up with this 916 399 7992 number claiming to be apple
7814332 i am supremely confident of that statement sony would not let me say that if they hadnt seen all the numbers they would not let us say that and we are absolutely 100 percent confident of it
7814333 will consider soon a step to restore the nuclear facilities in yongbyon to their original state
7814334 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
7814335 feel an obligation to the people who sent them here
7814336 we were not all on the same side as democrats but we are now
7814337 to discuss ways in which his foundation is addressing some of the worlds most pressing problems
7814338 president clinton understands this is sen obamas convention and he is here to do all he can to make sen obama our next president
7814339 were talking about the nominee for the president of the united states
7814340 there are people who are not going to vote for him because hes black
7814341 and weve got to hope that we can educate people to put aside their racism and to put their own interests no 1
7814342 everything you say is looked at and in many cases misconstrued
7814343 theres a reason why people like her its because she doesnt sort of you know fuel the fire
7814344 i wake up every morning wondering how on the earth im going to pull off that next minor miracle to get through the day
7814345 with the exception of the campaign trail and life in the public eye i have to say that my life now is really not that much different from many of yours
7814346 it is so wonderful to be here and nothing was going to keep me away from this special gathering tonight
7814347 i pledge to you that i will be there next january on the floor of the united states senate
7814348 we are told that barack obama believes too much in an america of high principle and high endeavor
7814349 but when john kennedy thought of going to the moon he didnt say its too far to get there we shouldnt even try
7814350 today an american flag still marks the surface of the moon
7814351 what struck me when i first met barack was that even though he had this funny name and even though he had grown up all the way across the continent in hawaii his family was so much like mine
7814352 he was raised by grandparents who were working class folks just like my parents and by a single mother who struggled to pay the bills just like mine did and like my family they scrimped and saved so that he could have opportunities that they never had themselves
7814353 and barack and i were raised with so many of the same values like you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do and that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
7814354 i am here because of the opportunities that my father had that my mother had you know we are who americans were supposed to be
7814355 i know that while america may not be perfect our union can be always be perfected i know what we can achieve when good people with strong conviction come together around a common purpose and i know what a great leader can go to help us build common ground
7814356 america we need such a leader a leader who can heal the wounds of the last eight years a leader who knows that unites us is greater than what divides us america we need barack obama
7814357 america realizes we cant four more years of the same ineffective governing
7814358 when you look at those polls that say 30 per cent of clinton supporters are now going to vote for john mccain he desperately needs to keep them on his side of the ledger
7814359 im hillary clinton and i do not approve that message
7814360 we were not all on the same side as democrats but we are now
7814361 we are united and we are together and we are determined
7814362 obama mccain is the devil in disguise and will ruin canada

7814365 die leute vertrauen mir zu einhundert prozent ich bekomme alles was ich brauche und was ich will das ist der richtige weg wenn man weiterkommen will
7814366 ich werde jahr f r jahr erfahrener bin also n tzlicher nicht nur was das fahren des autos betrifft
7814367 auch bei der entwicklung des autos bei der frage welche richtungen man bei der abstimmung einschl gt bin ich besser geworden

7814370 im vergangenen jahr haben wir den sieg knapp verpasst es waren nach einem der spannendsten duelle die die wrc je gesehen hat nur 0 3 sekunden
7814371 revanche kann ich in diesem jahr nicht nehmen weil marcus gr nholm nicht mehr dabei ist
7814372 es verspricht aber auch so ein enger fight zu werden
7814373 das ppige gr n neben den pisten ist wundersch n die pr fungen sind schnell und technisch anspruchsvoll aber die autos werden nicht allzu sehr beansprucht vom fahrerischen her ist es sicher einer meiner lieblingsl ufe
7814374 wie gro der nachteil sein wird h ngt davon ab wie feucht die bedingungen sind es gibt viele pr fungen die wir nur einmal durchfahren das k nnte m glicherweise viel zeit kosten aber die tatsache dass wir als erste raus m ssen bedeutet auch dass wir in der meisterschaft vorn liegen und wir werden alles tun um diese f hrung zu verteidigen
7814375 der schl ssel zum erfolg wird sein f r unseren c4 wrc ein set up zu finden das mit dem harten reifen von pirelli funktioniert das set up das wir in finnland hatten war sehr gut und ich h tte im auto ein hervorragendes gef hl es liegt an uns das in neuseeland zu wiederholen
7814376 es ist zwar sehr weit weg aber ich liebe die pr fungen in neuseeland und auch das land als solches
7814377 man kann sich ganz aufs fahren konzentrieren ohne angst zu haben das auto zu besch digen das ist toll die pace ist sehr schnell deshalb ist es entscheidend ein gutes gef hl f r das terrain zu haben und da fehlt es mir vielleicht noch an erfahrung ich denke dass es wieder sehr eng wird und ich werde die drei tage mit gro er umsicht angehen auch wenn ich wieder aufs podium fahren m chte
7814378 die pisten sind weder rau noch wellig die schwierigkeiten liegen woanders
7814379 bei der suche nach der richtigen abstimmung haben wir drei schl sselfaktoren mit einbezogen die tatsache dass wir bei wahrscheinlich k hlen und vielleicht auch feuchten bedingungen den harten reifen nehmen m ssen die tatsache dass man die lauffl chen bei losem schotter nicht mehr nachschneiden darf und nat rlich das spezielle profil der pr fungen

7814384 pollack seems oddly unaware of historys motivating forces to assert that what triggers revolutions civil wars and other internal unrest is psychological factors particularly feelings of extreme despair is plain silly the boston tea party could not have been prevented by prozac what is troubling about pollacks view which is fairly representative of his fellow liberal interventionists who are likely to be in power soon is its lack of clarity no matter what good will americas policy community proclaims toward the middle east this mix of blinkered indulgence of israel and disdain for the rest of the region as well as a predilection for wilsonian dreams over achievable goals suggests we will remain in the wilderness for some time to come
7814385 by restoring the colonel to what now seems his rightful position as a courageous principled radical who was dickinsons chosen reader admirer and advocate wineapple throws what she describes as a small considered beam upon the work and life of these two seemingly incompatible friends the recluse and the activist that beam when directed by a writer as thorough and intuitive as wineapple brightens not only the pale figures of the poet and the hitherto elusive colonel but the poems for which upon occasion dickinson drew inspiration from higginsons more active life
7814386 certain writers have a style that can be best likened to body odor irresistible to some obnoxious to many and apparently imperceptible to the writer himself therouxs lack of self awareness his failure to observe the basic hygiene of modesty is compelling in its way after reading the auto hagiography of the turkmen leader niyazov theroux summarizes it as pages and pages most of it self reverential he could be writing a press release for his own book

7814389 all fears to the contrary however american wife is no hatchet job no gossipy kitty kelley bio in disguise nor is it hagiography or the sort of seamy political pulp fiction in which denizens of the capitol have been known to dabble rather it is an intelligent well crafted psychologically astute novel that granted will anger the overly literal and the easily outraged but such people are unlikely to be eager readers of contemporary fiction this book is for those of us who are
7814390 murray bail plays a laconic self concealing game cunningly luring the reader in to his interlinked stories the pages is not an easy or open book but it is an oddly compelling one the spell is most powerfully cast in which can make the world come alive on the page after all perhaps it is fiction that does best what this philosopher is trying for to grasp what he saw before him ordinary objects to fit words only to what can be seen

7814403 the city evicted a blind guy he must have deserved it
7814404 everyone has the right to freedom of speech but these actions are not acceptable for someone who is representing our university
7814405 professor shanahans conduct falls below the standard established to protect our university its faculty students and alumni as a representative of fhsu he had a duty of care that was seriously breached by his behavior if the coach of one of our athletic teams became angry and mooned officials student athletes and fans during a sports event he or she would no longer be a coach at fort hays state university standards for our debate program are certainly just as high
7814406 i greatly appreciate the strong support i have received from fhsu over the last 10 years in the fullest tradition of academic freedom and the outpouring of support and concern expressed by countless colleagues students and former students i am terribly sorry that my actions reflected poorly on the university however they must be judged in the unique context of college debate marked by its passion and rigorous intellectual engagement i hope this incident does not detract from the incredible work done by fort hays state debate over the last decade or my other contributions to fhsu which are far greater than a 9 minute youtube clip
7814407 it should be clear that a faculty member can be dismissed for unprofessional behavior
7814408 pretty obvious that dr shanahan did not exercise appropriate restraint nor did he show respect for the opinions of others in this incident
7814409 dr shanahan had a right to have a hearing by his peers to see if his colleagues agree that his behavior perhaps accumulative behaviors justified his dismissal
7814410 exercised its prerogative under the debate rules to dismiss reid brinkley as a judge
7814411 said the decision to remove a black female judge was an act of white hegemony which is to say an exercise of the power whites enjoy over people of color
7814412 i understand why mr shanahan was outraged by the not so veiled accusations of racism during his 10 years at fhsu i have known bill to be a fervent champion of the underdog and racial equality
7814413 our investigation revealed that those ills have also infected college debate we have a responsibility not only to deal with the specific incident but to stand up against this decline in the standards of college debate
7814414 i had no idea that college debate had degenerated into the kind of displays that we witnessed if anyone doubts my conclusion that person should view the entire debate which was laced with four letter words a lack of personal respect and a lack of civil discourse
7814415 in the course of thousands of debates that can take place in a single tournament and you multiply that by all of the events and its so rare that it takes 30 years for something like this to happen

7814427 tijdens de wedstrijd deden ze er alles aan om me uit de wedstrijd te halen toen ik na een lange rush even stond uit te puffen voor de dug out van juventus boden ze me een bidon aan toen ik een slok had genomen proefde ik dat het geen water was maar de door god verboden peroni substantie meteen ben ik naar de scheidsrechter gestapt met het verzoek de wedstrijd per direct te be indigen de grote brutus z elberto laat zich potverdorie oooooooh sorry toch niet vergiftigen gelukkig gaf de scheidsrechter gehoor aan mijn wens daarna ben ik direct naar de toernooileiding gestapt en heb toen het hele voorval uitgelegd eerst van de poging tot omkoping vervolgens over de vergiftiging

7814432 i didnt know about it because i obviously dont ring my own phone it was john mallinson who said to me a few weeks ago do you know whats on your phone
7814433 i said i never ring myself thats why i didnt know theyve been trying for a couple of weeks to correct it
7814434 they thought they had done it at one point but then i was called and told it was back at one point people like mike mitchelson were ringing me up just to hear the message
7814435 i played it to my wife and she thought it was hilarious
7814436 id not like to blame anybody in the end a technician from orange talked our technicians through it and told them what to do
7814437 we were all bemused by this we dont know how it happened nobody has been able to give us an answer
7814438 met brutus z elberto hebben we al een fr le linkspoot in ons midden die in zijn eentje een wedstrijd kan beslissen met z roberto erbij hebben we twee van dat soort spelers en dat zou geweldig zijn
7814439 z roberto is altijd mijn grote voorbeeld geweest of eigenlijk moet ik zeggen dat k zijn grote voorbeeld ben ik kan dan mooi op 10 blijven spelen en hij kan perfect de linksbuitenpositie bekleden zodat ik dat nooit meer hoef te doen en bedenk nou het duo der tovenaars z en z dat is toch geweldig

7814450 this is the latest step by the sri lankan government to intimidate journalists who write about security issues
7814451 the fact that baracks people have not helped when he has this money machine behind him suggests that he hasnt pushed his people hard enough or his people havent pushed their donors or others hard enough and i think thats something that really grates on some of the clinton supporters

7814456 with the threat of legislation looming bmw has shown that even premium carmakers can seriously reduce co2 but the slow response of most carmakers shows that the eu needs to keep up the pressure with challenging long term co2 targets

7814510 brutus heeft een hele belangrijke stem in dat proces in het team moet immers alles om hem draaien dus een goede wisselwerking is noodzakelijk

7814529 sen hillary clinton was our first choice and that of 18 million primary voters but presumptive democratic nominee sen barack obamas pick joe biden is a friend of women and a strong selection for vice president

7814788 there are so many kind and decent people who are not believers in jesus christ who are identified by the bible as doomed to eternal separation from god in hell while at the same time there are so many people who are negative stubborn unpleasant and morally weak who are identified by the bible as beliervers destined to enter into eternal fellowship with god in heaven
7814789 for god so loved the world that he gave his one and only son that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life for god did not send his son into the world to condemn the world but to save the world through him whoever believes in him is not condemned but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because he has not believed in the name of gods one and only son
7814790 in fact were looking at being on course for a record season the bad weather has definitely played a part in this
7814791 to be honest for some tourists rain even seems to be a bit of a novelty

7814845 to encourage the medical device industry to think more carefully
7814846 fortunately there are some safeguards already in place but device manufacturers can do better
7814847 in the 1970s the bionic woman was a dream but modern technology is making it a reality people will have sophisticated computers with wireless capabilities in their bodies our goal is to make sure those devices are secure private safe and effective
7814848 but i dont think the findings have any great clinical significance
7814849 to hack the system you have to get the programmer right up against the patients chest its not as if somebody could do this from down the street
7814850 deliberate malicious or unauthorised manipulation of a device is extremely low
7814851 incorporate encryption and security technologies designed to mitigate these risks
7814852 as the study points out the likelihood of unauthorised or illegal manipulation of an implantable device is extremely remote and st jude medical is not aware of such an event with our devices
7814853 the chance of an icd being reprogrammed by a computer hacker is extremely remote
7814854 it is unlikely at present that this will be a risk to my patients it is also even more unlikely to be of interest to hackers in general and very few terrorists
7814855 there has not been a single reported incident of such an event in more than 30 years of device telemetry use which includes millions of implanted patients worldwide
7814856 despite an extensive database of adverse incidents the agency has never received any reports of hacking associated with implantable medical devices such as pacemakers or icds implantable cardioverter defibrillators
7814857 nevertheless as part of our adverse incident investigation process this we will look into this further in consultation with the relevant device manufacturers

7814874 because bats can detect objects with echolocation they seldom collide with man made structures
7814875 an atmospheric pressure drop at wind turbine blades is an undetectable and potentially unforeseeable hazard for bats thus partially explaining the large number of bat fatalities at these specific structures
7814876 given that bats are more susceptible to barotrauma than birds and that bat fatalities at wind turbines far outnumber bird fatalities at most sites wildlife fatalities at wind turbines are now a bat issue not a bird issue

7814886 i talked with kiwanuka yesterday and he was more than ready to do whatever we wanted him to do that was in the best interest of the team
7814887 i am confident that i can get the job done and this is something i have been preparing for my entire life basically
7814888 it is just that is what i have been doing for ten years so take that and add two years playing linebacker it is a big difference but i am ready for it
7814889 it is something that he all of us really wanted but obviously we didnt want these circumstances for kiwanuka to get back in the defensive lineman room
7814890 it is a good thing for him it is a good thing for this team he is definitely a d lineman at heart and hopefully he can just come back in and not miss a beat
7814891 clark and wilkinson have always flipped and played on both sides
7814892 clark will have opportunities to play at sam as will wilkinson bryan kehl has flipped around as well but today clark will work more at the sam
7814893 i did understand the complex deal with kiwi and when stray didnt come back and that he may move out to end
7814894 so i did understand that sam may be an option but i focused on the wil linebacker but i understand this is a business and im going to embrace it with open arms i just go out there and bang with tight ends im on the line more often and its less productive than weak side linebacker because you have to fly around making plays on the ball and youre more a d lineman at sam linebacker but we have an opportunity to get off the ball and make some plays as well
7814895 they reached out and they talked to us about the possibility of strahan returning
7814896 feels the ship isnt even out of the harbor and theyre already taking on the cannons he feels like maybe he should jump back in there
7814897 have i talked to the giants yes are we negotiating no are they interested yes
7814898 if it wasnt for the fans and giants organization he wouldnt even think about coming back because after going out on top winning the super bowl and all that its hard to think about doing that again
7814899 jerry reese said hey you think michael would have some interest obviously theres not any pro bowl defensive ends out there except him im sure theres a part of him that wants to play do i think its a big part no
7814900 does he have a number in his head i doubt it
7814901 i doubt football is the first thing on his mind today
7814902 there hasnt been any discussion that i have been involved in there
7814903 we are going to explore every option that is available and the last time that i talked with michael he had accepted his new challenge and was very happy about that and i have not spoken with him at all since the browns preseason game
7814904 i decided to pull the old car out of the garage and see how i felt today get some of the dust off of it
7814905 i felt pretty good im feeling a lot better a hundred percent i didnt have any limitations going either way right or left i jumped up and made a few catches im just trying to get back to my old self getting off the line full speed and being able to accelerate when the ball is in the air im trying to get all the kinks out of the armor
7814906 i forgot how tough it is to run routes when youre a little bit winded in the two minute drill even though i didnt go but a few plays
7814907 its just good to get out there and run around again im happy i can go out there and run without any pain im basically trying to get into the best playing shape that i can and get my cardio up i hope i feel pretty good tomorrow
7814908 ill be out there every snap this season fighting along the way were just being very cautious and i understand being in year nine but the most important thing is to be ready september 4th

7814911 i thought we were excellent we really should have won
7814912 we dominated the game for about 80 minutes and we created a lot of chances
7814913 i think we had that spark that we were missing the last time against bohs
7814914 it was a difficult decision to make but i have received an offer that is very good for my career
7814915 i had a great time at aek i thank the president and the fans but the offer is very good for me and my family
7814916 it is a very good proposal and i cannot turn it down i would like to ask for a million apologies because there is so little time in the transfer window for the club to replace me but it was an exceptional proposal
7814917 rivaldo wants to leave but in spite of what he says he remains under contract to aek until the end of this season and will only go if the club gets a replacement
7814918 if he does go it will be with a transfer fee and not as a free transfer
7814919 captian of their own souls the masters of their own fate

7814922 woe to you teachers of the law and pharisees you hypocrites you give a tenth of your spices mint dill and cummin but you have neglected the more important matters of the law justice mercy and faithfulness you should have practiced the latter without neglecting the former
7814923 therefore there is now no condemnation for those who are in christ jesus because through christ jesus the law of the spirit of life set me free from the law of sin and death

7814928 top ten ways to make money in a down economy
7814929 while the national market struggles as a group were generally pretty healthy here
7814930 business certainly has been challenging as it has been for all dealers this year
7814931 trade in values on suvs have decreased in some cases significantly
7814932 the shift from big cars to smaller cars has definitely increased our volume
7814933 normally i have quite a few but now i just have a handful of them those cars are really selling well right now
7814934 if you have a family with three kids and they play soccer or softball you need a bigger car
7814935 two years ago a guy would buy a truck just to have it now that people are more sensitive about gas theyre buying trucks for need
7814936 people are trading in trucks to get better fuel economy vehicles and the people who need trucks are buying that used truck theres still definitely a truck and suv market out there
7814937 its that simple and you can get a less expensive car buying used
7814938 earlier this summer there was a lot of anxiety about gas prices
7814939 but now that prices are lowering people feel like prices arent out of control
7814940 we know were not going back to 2 a gallon but consumers are more confident now
7814941 we have customers that want to get vehicles but are in the process of losing a home
7814942 they still need reliable transportation to get to work school and church
7814943 we are seeing people that have challenged credit or foreclosures pending
7814944 we are seeing more cars for sale in repossession wholesale auctions
7814945 the mess in the home industry has trickled down into the car industry
7814946 but in napa many of our customers have great credit
7814947 it isnt more expensive to buy a car in napa
7814948 at least start by looking locally we are going to be competitive price wise
7814949 we have lower overhead compared to stores on the highway
7814950 shoppers can get a better deal in napa it also helps the city and county of napa keep the sales tax in town
7814951 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
7814952 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
7814953 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
7814954 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
7814955 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
7814956 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants

7814962 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
7814963 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
7814964 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
7814965 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet

7814967 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
7814968 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
7814969 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
7814970 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
7814971 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
7814972 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead

7814995 when you first start riding the bus its hard to get used to the fact that youre on their schedule and you cant jump in and get there in 20 minutes
7814996 but after a little bit of time you get used to it and it works out really well
7814997 i figured it out that its still worth it for me if the bus pass hits 66 its still worth it for me
7814998 buses are crowded let me tell you a lot of people
7814999 ive heard a lot more people say they ride the bus because of the gas prices

7815004 the cause of this mishap was pilot error both men failed to clear their flight paths and did not recognize their impending high aspect mid air collision
7815005 they were doing maneuvers we do every day thousands of times in all of our air combat command flying aircraft
7815006 it was a different set of circumstances but it opens the question of whether jivanjee totally understood those closure moments
7815007 they were both competent and proficient were they has proficient as they could have been had we kept flying for the last three months i cannot answer that but it does pull at your heart and your mind
7815008 with each new mission lopez created a legacy that will be hard to replace
7815009 this is exactly what these men were trained to do
7815010 the navy cant build that training infrastructure in 20 years the only way theyre ever going to get there is to start the draft
7815011 the thing that really upsets me the most is that training is run by contractors
7815012 no matter who wins the election it doesnt matter its not going to stop
7815013 no pact or an agreement should be set without being based on full sovereignty national common interests and no foreign soldier should remain on iraqi land and there should be a specific deadline and it should not be open
7815014 there is an agreement actually reached reached between the two parties on a fixed date which is the end of 2011 to end any foreign presence on iraqi soil
7815015 any decisions on troops will be based on conditions on the ground in iraq
7815016 that has always been our position it continues to be our position
7815017 there is no agreement until theres an agreement signed there are discussions that continue in baghdad
7815018 we cant neglect our sons by giving an open immunity for anyone whether he is iraqi or a foreigner
7815019 the air force has increased the sheer volume of pilots put through the training pipeline and shipped them off to war with the bare minimum training required
7815020 have come directly from basic training as their first exposure to the professional workforce
7815021 this is stuff we can correct through training stuff that happens between the ears
7815022 flight safety is of paramount importance to the air force and every mishap is carefully studied in order to mitigate future risk
7815023 we continue to find the way to reach an agreement between israel and the palestinians
7815024 very heartened by the fact that the negotiations are serious and they are intensive
7815025 in fact i believe that the parties have succeeded in moving their understandings of what needs to be achieved and indeed their positions somewhat closer together over this period of time
7815026 construction in the settlements has increased by a factor of 1 8 by comparison to the same period last year
7815027 the housing ministry initiated 433 new housing units during the period of january to may 2008 compared to just 240 units during the period january to may 2007
7815028 i would like to suggest to my partners not to use it as an excuse and i know they are not using it as an excuse but i understand their frustration sometimes
7815029 but at the end of the day the israeli governments policy is not to expand settlements not to build new settlements and not to confiscate palestinian land
7815030 there were some small activities but they will not influence the ability to negotiate nor the future of the future borders of the palestinian state
7815031 in fact what we need now are steps that enhance confidence between the parties and that anything that undermines confidence between the parties ought to be avoided
7815032 and we will continue to press ahead to get agreement so that we know what is in israel and what is palestinian
7815033 oh its you so put the camera down and prepare my meal already yeah yeah i know im gorgeous but im also hungry
7815034 a lipsync cabaret funrazor sic argos riders face locker room issues
7815035 richard will be feeling happy for the team even though a bit disappointed personally
7815036 im just proud of the fact that he was selected to go there thats an honour in itself as a nation weve done really well we can all be proud of all our team
7815037 it makes me proud to be yorkshire to be english and to be british the feel good factor is superb
7815038 and i hope there will be some kids that are thinking eh i could do that
7815039 once it disappears out of the media in a couple of weeks nobody will be thinking about it any more
7815040 there is something about human excellence about the spirit and the effort that athletes put in that can lift peoples spirits and bring us all together
7815041 three weeks after wimbledon is on tennis clubs are packed with people then it fizzles out again
7815042 i dont think we can possibly do as good a job as sydney and beijing did and with all this money were ploughing into it in london again whats going to happen to the stadia afterwards
7815043 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
7815044 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
7815045 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
7815046 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
7815047 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
7815048 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
7815049 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
7815050 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
7815051 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
7815052 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
7815053 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
7815054 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
7815055 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
7815056 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
7815057 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
7815058 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
7815059 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
7815060 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
7815061 i cant honestly expect to collect from every little guy grandmas selling quilts online and the like but i certainly will be targeting the big guys like google microsoft and smooth operator
7815062 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
7815063 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
7815064 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
7815065 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
7815066 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
7815067 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
7815068 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
7815069 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
7815070 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
7815071 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
7815072 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
7815073 if you all got a chance to said i love you who is will you said to
7815074 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
7815075 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
7815076 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
7815077 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
7815078 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
7815079 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
7815080 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
7815081 never vote for a junior senator running for president regardless of who he she might be

7815102 i dont suppose it may have occurred to you that the cecal valve feature may have been already encoded in the genetic information of the lizard and was selected due to a changed diet or manifested through interbreeding with the indigenous population or maybe nobody ever noticed it before like the aforementioned rat
7815103 changes in appearance dont prove the generation of new genetic information you can change the diet of birds to tougher seeds and the shape of their bills will change you can drink a lot of beer and the shape of your gut will change these lizards changed their diet
7815104 their gut got bigger due to a changed diet and thus we are told that

7815115 we know that schalke is an experienced team but we are only one goal from turning the tie around and we cannot drive ourselves crazy atl tico is a very powerful team and its going to be important for us to score in the first half
7815116 after the first leg match in germany we spoke about trying to fix our mistakes for us it is important to go in front and to do that we have to keep calm and play our cards right
7815117 well have plenty of scoring chances and we have to take advantage of them
7815118 in the first leg match schalke played a very good opening 15 minutes we on the other hand possessed the ball but we werent convincing this wednesday we have to play more vertically and push forward without thinking twice we have to create plays and finish them off
7815119 the game against schalke 04 is one of the most important that we are going to play in we are ready to face up to this because it is a very important game for the players for the club and for the fans and were aware of that

7815126 theyve jumped from generation one to generation four or five it just looks better and feels better
7815127 but the shining light for me over the last few years has been tony hand
7815128 in his first season we had to play most of our games in north wales and yorkshire which was a difficult proposition for a professional sports team but tony handled it superbly
7815129 the inconvenience and pressure was enormous but tony managed the team magnificently
7815130 despite those problems we tried to play entertaining hockey it would have been a lot easier to have just camped behind our blue line and wait for breakaways but we played a blend of exciting hockey and tried to give our supporters a good night out
7815131 it was the same again last season once we had settled into the new rink at altrincham we played the same game tactically but managed to finish a couple of places higher up the table and made the play offs
7815132 you have to be sensible and i was happy with that
7815133 we had a small bench and to be honest towards the end i think we did run out of gas
7815134 but in the play off quarter final sheffield beat us by one small goal and then went on to beat everyone else by two goals to win it
7815135 they were a bigger team than us but pound for pound they were not a better team
7815136 we work to the wage cap and that makes it hard for the coach
7815137 guys who have been here a year or two want more money but if we give it to them we then become a weaker team and tony wasnt prepared to do that
7815138 the wage cap is a bit higher this season it was 5 500 a week net last year and this season its 6 000 the richer teams nottingham belfast sheffield and coventry can go to 7 000 but they can only have 10 imports while we can have 11
7815139 we are still a young team and this is the right way for us to go
7815140 im excited about this seasons line up i think the team is more structured with plenty of firepower and depth
7815141 dwight parrish is a very stable and experienced defencman and david beauregard is a 40 goals a season man brett clouthier is back and hes a great player to have in your side the fans love him and hes great with the kids
7815142 i think we might have the most exciting team in manchester ice hockey history yet nobody talks about us being a major threat we are the dark horses and that could be good

7815217 i cant say whether their intention was to intimidate but if they can do this to an influential writer who has done nothing more than take photographs then one can only imagine the kind of threat that ordinary people in tibet must feel every day

7815232 has been a senator for all who believe that the dream has never died
7815233 two men who have changed my life and the life of this country
7815234 but once or twice in a lifetime they come along just when we need them the most this is one of those moments

7815236 the first thing that will help you make positive memories is there has to be positive choices on your part

7815239 when difficult situations come your way you wont have to wonder what youll do if your values are solid

7815244 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request
7815245 we take call in orders all the time so that working people can stop by and pick up their food to go
7815246 the best thing about our store is our family of employees

7815276 recovery is so key the view is everyone can work toward a level of independence
7815277 we are maintaining hope that people will move forward and recover
7815278 thats the underlying philosophy of the birmingham group we believe in recovery
7815279 we will be alternating the meetings on the topics of education first hand information and support
7815280 we will alternate because those three things are something consumers need
7815281 across the life span we are seeing children and the elderly having mental health issues and we can help to get them in services
7815282 if you dont get the support you need the situation is going to get worse
7815283 at the state of mental health care in the u s
7815284 all citizens will understand that mental health is essential to overall health
7815285 the most important thing is what you do when you realize you have a problem
7815286 the lessons learned here will be translated throughout the veterans affairs system
7815287 it is a testimony to the responsiveness of the va that they have taken this seriously and they have been open with the press and public
7815288 the staff at the dallas va has demonstrated they are committed to making significant improvements to the facility and the level of care provided i was pleased to see progress under way and will continue to closely monitor these enhancements

7815290 sanchez had a months worth of meds but i dont know over what period he didnt take them
7815291 even though their mouth and their nose and so on is open they cant breathe
7815292 and the fact that you are not able to make a noise and youre maybe making some mumbling noises i guess in my head i would say well you know do weve got an airway problem or what i mean there is something going on
7815293 the woman who had dominated discussions for so long could no longer lead debates or keep up with the thread of a drinks party conversation
7815294 on bad days she could hardly remember the beginning of a sentence by the time she got to the end
7815295 watching her struggle with her words and her memory i couldnt believe it she was in her 75th year but i had always thought of her as ageless timeless and 100 per cent cast iron damage proof
7815296 losing dad was truly awful for mum not least because her dementia meant she kept forgetting he was dead
7815297 i had to keep giving her the bad news over and over again
7815298 oh allright it is somewhere but i dont know where another instance of me the compiler will see it while compiling some other source file and we both will leave it to the linker to resolve this
7815299 this is a ramrod job i know it you know it you should be working on the budget
7815300 albert einstein said that insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result
7815301 it was year after year of overspending and borrowing that put us in this mess
7815302 as the us refused to carry out the agreement a grave obstacle to the settlement of the nuclear issue on the korean peninsula has been created
7815303 secondly we will consider restoring the yongbyon facilities to their original state in accordance with strong demands from our relevant agencies
7815304 it would be a big mistake if the us believes that it can carry out a search of our home as it did in iraq as it pleased
7815305 when the six party talks have degenerated into a circus where the strong bullies the weak as it pleases whats the use of the six party structure
7815306 verification is a duty to be carried out by every party that should come at the last stage of the denuclearisation of the whole korean peninsula
7815307 has been pressing us to accept inspections in which they may visit wherever they want collect samples and take measurements as they please
7815308 in breach of our sovereignty and which subsequently caused us to leave the nuclear non proliferation treaty
7815309 the us is making a robber like demand that it will carry out unilateral inspections of us
7815310 si tengo afecto a un pa s se es brasil digamos que es al que le perdono m s cosas

7815312 la suerte fue que por entonces harry potter funcionaba pero no tanto si no hubiera sido imposible comprar acciones de la editorial
7815313 pero nos cost mucho que los medios se interesaran por ella
7815314 primero reeditas cada dos meses luego cada mes y luego semanalmente y piensas aqu pasa algo
7815315 se trata de que nadie sepa el final de que cada lector se enfrente a la historia con ingenuidad

7815320 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
7815321 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
7815322 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
7815323 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
7815324 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
7815325 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
7815326 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
7815327 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
7815328 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
7815329 after he beat her and threatened her with a gun he walked to his car aimed his gun into the air and fired it once as an exclamation point
7815330 everything was going good until he started messing around on me
7815331 im sorry for shooting duke but he hurt me very bad love hurts and you dont play games with people s feelings
7815332 was going to shoot him in the leg but he wouldnt come around to my side of the car
7815333 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
7815334 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
7815335 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
7815336 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
7815337 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
7815338 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
7815339 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
7815340 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
7815341 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
7815342 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
7815343 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
7815344 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
7815345 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
7815346 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
7815347 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
7815348 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
7815349 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
7815350 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
7815351 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
7815352 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
7815353 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
7815354 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
7815355 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
7815356 this is a planning took where all things are going
7815357 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations

7815360 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
7815361 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
7815362 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
7815363 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
7815364 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
7815365 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
7815366 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
7815367 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
7815368 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
7815369 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
7815370 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
7815371 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
7815372 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
7815373 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
7815374 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
7815375 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
7815376 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
7815377 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
7815378 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
7815379 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
7815380 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
7815381 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
7815382 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
7815383 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
7815384 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
7815385 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
7815386 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
7815387 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
7815388 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
7815389 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
7815390 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
7815391 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
7815392 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
7815393 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them

7815403 dass immer mehr menschen immer niedrigere l hne haben ist ein ergebnis der agenda 2010 insbesondere von hartz iv
7815404 die gesetzliche verpflichtung jede arbeit annehmen zu m ssen zeigt ihre fatale wirkung in der lohnabw rtsspirale
7815405 die so genannten volksparteien spd und union spalten das volk in arme und reiche die privatisierung ffentlicher einrichtungen und die hartz gesetze f hren zu armut trotz arbeit und sie zwingen die gewerkschaften in die defensive
7815406 was jetzt noch nicht zu tage tritt ist dass damit auch die rentenerwartung f r zuk nftige rentnerjahrg nge sinkt w hrend im oecd durchschnitt ein arbeitnehmer der heute 1000 euro verdient eine rente von 730 euro zu erwarten hat sind f r ihn in deutschland ganze 400 euro rente vorgesehen damit ist millionenfache altersarmut gesetzlich programmiert das ist ein skandal dass unter diesen voraussetzungen der private konsum das deutsche wirtschaftswachstum nach unten zieht wie vom statistischen bundesamt heute bekanntgegeben ist nicht berraschend in einer solchen situation muss die regierung handeln sie muss die infrastruktur ausbauen die lohnpolitik muss wieder darauf ausgerichtet werden dass sich die einkommen entsprechend der produktivit t und der preissteigerungen entwickeln die gesetze die wie hartz iv zum lohndumping einladen m ssen ge ndert und der allgemeine gesetzliche mindestlohn endlich eingef hrt werden
7815407 dass die koalition die einf hrung eines allgemeinen gesetzlichen mindestlohns und die deutliche erh hung des arbeitslosengeldes ii mit verweis auf fadenscheinige argumente unterl sst ist weder christlich noch sozial das ist einfach nur sch big ein mindestlohn dass zeigen unsere europ ischen nachbarn kostet keine arbeitspl tze und eine starke volkswirtschaft kann sich ohne weiteres menschenw rdige sozialleistungen leisten

7815446 sinds de apollomissies in de jaren 70 weet iedereen hoe onze planeet er vanuit de ruimte uitziet
7815447 het kan veiliger goedkoper en milieuvriendelijker de technologie waarmee door de staat gefinancierde ruimtevaartorganisaties in amerika rusland en europa vliegen is de laatste dertig veertig jaar nauwelijks veranderd neem de vaste brandstofraketten die zijn vervuilend inflexibel en gevaarlijk
7815448 het heelal speelt al een belangrijke rol in onze navigatie en communicatie maar ik denk dat die invloed de komende twintig tot dertig jaar alleen nog toeneemt
7815449 in de jaren zeventig van de vorige eeuw werd voorgesteld dat we in de jaren negentig op vakantie zouden gaan in de ruimte dat is niet gebeurd daarom zoeken wij naar betere manieren om mensen en goederen daar te krijgen
7815450 ik heb vijf jaar op het calvijn college in goes gezeten waar ik havo deed
7815451 ik ga in september beginnen met de propedeuse van de studie maatschappelijk werk en dienstverlening mwd dat is een vierjarige hbo opleiding aan de christelijke hogeschool ede
7815452 wat me vooral aantrekt is de mogelijkheid om straks mensen te kunnen helpen die zelf niet meer uit hun problemen komen het lijkt me bijzonder boeiend om naar hun verhaal te luisteren hen te kunnen adviseren en hen daarmee weer op de rails te krijgen
7815453 je kunt met maatschappelijk werk veel kanten op zelf denk ik vooral aan de jeugdzorg ik zou bijvoorbeeld graag jongeren willen begeleiden die thuis problemen hebben of op school vastlopen
7815454 doordeweeks ga ik op kamers de afstand tussen kapelle en ede is te groot om heen en weer te reizen ik ben nu bezig mijn nieuwe kamers in ede in te richten ik heb er twee een slaapkamer en een studeerkamer in een leuk huis dat ik deel met een andere che studente en de dochter van de huisbaas ik vind dat ik echt geboft heb voor een aantrekkelijke prijs per maand zit ik in hartje ede ik heb zelfs een internetaansluiting
7815455 voorlopig nog niet de eerste tijd wil ik me concentreren op mijn studie ik denk dat ik dat wel nodig heb om goed in het ritme te komen het is toch heel spannend om ineens op eigen benen te staan een nieuwe omgeving nieuwe mensen alles zelf regelen er komt best veel op me af als ik mijn draai eenmaal heb gevonden denk ik er wel over om me aan te sluiten bij het wageningse csfr dispuut dei gratia dat lijkt me een mooie manier om mensen te leren kennen en vriendschappen op te bouwen

7815469 the fact the capuchins predominantly selected the prosocial option must mean seeing another monkey receive food is satisfying or rewarding for them
7815470 we believe prosocial behavior is empathy based empathy increases in both humans and animals with social closeness and in our study closer partners made more prosocial choices

7815483 over the years weve had hundreds of people work on the game and we thank everyone who helped us bring our warhammer passion to life but only current employees that have continued until the end will be credited in the final game
7815484 this policy is disrespectful of the effort of the game developers who worked on the game and misleads both consumers and game industry peers
7815485 the lack of accurate fair and consistent credit standards in the industry poses a serious problem for every game developer by refusing to acknowledge their contributions studio management limits the professional recognition and opportunity for development that
7815486 some people claim that providing complete credit information opens their staff up to contact by unsolicited recruiters or encourages people to leave their job before a game is complete
7815487 its an unfortunate fact that people leave jobs frequently especially in the games industry why refuse to recognize a contributor because through circumstances they may not be able to control theyve changed employers
7815488 this is something that our constituents have told us point blank they dont want

7815512 the most exciting thing is that for the first time in my lifetime i will see a black president
7815513 what he brings to the table is that he transcends being black
7815514 i am concerned about a black president being assassinated and having the rodney king riots in los angeles following us everywhere
7815515 i dont think america is ready to have that racial ceiling broken
7815516 every time there is something critical said about him if he is going to be president he has to put his blackness behind him
7815517 there are some people in this country who wont work for the minimum wage and we need those undocumented workers

7815519 did acknowledge in one of his ads that immigrants are the backbone of the workforce of this country
7815520 i dont think people should be penalized for coming in to work people who hire illegals should be punished not people who are looking for work
7815521 has made it hard for me as a person with brown skin there are a lot of assumptions made about me
7815522 im totally completely against the illegals coming across im a victim of the illegals in my area there have been seven foreclosures of homes purchased by undocumented immigrants who bailed out and went home now the prices of all the homes went down and i cant get refinancing

7815525 federal authorities have scheduled a press conference for tuesday afternoon amid reports that a fortunate traffic stop by aurora police may have disrupted an assassination attempt against barack obama
7815526 a witness interviewed in the case said one of suspects allegedly said the guns were to be used to kill the illinois senator but authorities do not believe the alleged threat put obama in immediate danger authorities told abc news the men had tattoos of white supremacist images
7815527 cbs4 has now learned at least four people are under arrest in connection with a possible plot to kill barack obama at his thursday night acceptance speech in denver

7815532 federal authorities have scheduled a press conference for tuesday afternoon amid reports that a fortunate traffic stop by aurora police may have disrupted an assassination attempt against barack obama
7815533 its unclear precisely why authorities suspect the men were targeting barack obama but one of the officers who was briefed says he was told at least one of the suspects made statements to that effect
7815534 the secret service atf and the fbi are all involved in the investigation a secret service spokesman says the agency is concerned by the proximity to the convention and the items found in the mans car
7815535 its premature to say that it was a valid threat or that these folks have the ability to carry it out
7815536 was directly asked if they had come to denver to kill obama he responded in the affirmative

7815545 it has become clearer to me of late why its such an uphill climb to help people release transactional and penal understandings of what jesus was doing on that cross its not only that we need to relearn our atonement theology its the warp and woof of culture in which we struggle to embrace something other than the party line that hampers us when i was confronted with the anger of the church toward our craftsman i was disillusioned how could we as a church make a logical case for our punitive response being right considering jesus teachings seemed like the thing to do but i was told in no uncertain terms dont ask what jesus would do im sure hes just as fed up as i am clearly the dissonance between the truth and our desires was not even apparent to us the idea that a gift is freely given without strings without a desire for a return on the investment is almost impossible for us to consider its much easier to work out a system of exchange wherein we know the score and can control our destiny and that of others
7815546 there is a host of unwritten expectations that are attached to money apparently if i purchase a gift

7815552 if the incident had been reversed and it had been an atheist that had physically assaulted a theist for postering for a theist event that would easily be considered a hate crime and it frequently is this is the exact reverse scenario
7815553 they are treating it not as a hate crime but as a dispute that arose and led to an altercation
7815554 we dont have anything that suggests that as far as im aware of i know mr trottier was talking about that but certainly from what i see it doesnt look like it falls within what our policies and procedures define as a hate crime
7815555 but were still looking at that as well to cover all the bases
7815556 the first individual smacked me in the face twice and said
7815557 atheists have never been accorded the same respect as those with religious beliefs even though our position originates in logic and reason not myth and superstition this escalation of a systemic although till now hidden discrimination is very troubling
7815558 i think i discovered the hard way the boundaries of freedom of speech
7815559 the fact that an atheist should fear for his well being while advertising for a university event that seeks to promote free inquiry is alarming and though i feared for my life briefly ive never felt as strong about my atheism my colleagues and i have only strengthened our resolve to forge ahead with our agenda to push for secularism science and freedom of thought

7815570 but the militants requested safe passage that was denied then the militants threw a hand grenade in the direction of the villagers to break the siege
7815571 we fear the taliban could replicate the same in buner if they were given a free hand we have held several meetings and decided that we wouldnt let buner go swats way
7815572 we are seeing the writing on the wall if we dont prevent the taliban at this stage there is every possibility the military would launch an operation and the 11million population would be migrating in a state of helplessness to safer areas
7815573 the taliban had already bombed about a dozen girls schools besides bombing 50 cd shops and attacking police stations
7815574 before the taliban resorts to torching more schools we have decided to resist them
7815575 we are not going to let the taliban play with the future of our people we dont want schools to be burnt and our coming generations uneducated
7815576 the good news is that all the political parties are supporting the move because it has paid off in the context of buner
7815577 all the criminals in these areas are carrying out anti social activities in the garb of the taliban the taliban used to be students of religious schools who guided the people on the right path but now the situation is quite the opposite they are leading anti social activities
7815578 we will kill any person seen after midnight we have advised the local population not to come out of their houses

7815586 the government has been waiting for an opportunity to close the camp down
7815587 if people start to have the feeling that the war has been taken to the camps then youre talking about a tinderbox
7815588 the government wants to evacuate the camp by any means peacefully or by force

7815594 that sounds fine when do i move what happens next
7815595 ah well in your case you wont be leaving for a while we are leaving you behind to wind up the personnel work it wont be very pleasant as you will be spending a lot of time terminating the employment of those whose jobs will end due to the move youll probably have a few arguments with the histradut the jewish labour union just play it by the labour laws it will be a good experience for a young bloke like you but dont worry well get you out in the end
7815596 there will be five of you remaining behind now heres the good news you will each be moving into a managers house to prevent squatters we drew lots for you all you won the general managers house you will have two arab servants a humber super snipe car full use of his very well stocked wine cellar and two very well stacked pretty arab maids to look after you you must drive the car yourself keep it locked for as you know we are starting to lose too many cars so try and watch over it how does that sound
7815597 well im not sure on two points did you say that the two pretty arab maids were well stocked or was it well stacked and do i lock them up or was it the car im just a little confused
7815598 i reckon that with a young frisky bugger like you we had better keep you locked up now be a good boy johnny and if you cant be good then for gods sake be careful

7815608 president clinton understands this is sen obamas convention and he is here to do all he can to make sen obama our next president
7815609 were talking about the nominee for the president of the united states
7815610 there are people who are not going to vote for him because hes black
7815611 and weve got to hope that we can educate people to put aside their racism and to put their own interests no 1
7815612 there is no way that a country of 63 million like thailand will let a group of five people form a street gang to seize control
7815613 i wont yield my cabinet wont yield the military and the police wont yield

7815615 the army will not launch a coup the people can be assured
7815616 we need to have greater clarity that this government is going to be around next year

7815632 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support

7815634 accepter des pots de vin est devenue monnaie courante pour certains proches ou ma tresses de responsables corrompus
7815635 well if you dont care for me then i dont care for you either at least not more than i care for the louse on a monkeys backside
7815636 if the governor gets to pick and choose which rulings to enforce were forever on the brink of a constitutional crisis
7815637 seems that there are more than a couple of folks taking notice of your postings tom excellent job i believe cleveland is better off because of the job you did
7815638 tom blumer at bizzyblog brings actual facts about coal miner fatalities to light and gives the bdsers a reality check
7815639 the best blogger in the state and a more talented natural economist than any of those pointy headed keynesian halfwits
7815640 tom blumer is doing stuff that msnbc and ap should have done before providing the teenager farris hassan a national international forum and 15 minutes of fame
7815641 guys like tom blumer cover what really matters and theyre independent enough to tell the truth without fear of aggravating corporate media owners
7815642 bizzyblog made my point with numbers and facts and stuff
7815643 this is why i read bizzy blog he catches the stuff that i manage to miss
7815644 the issues that we are focussing on are not unrelated to the political crisis that hit kenya at the turn of the year
7815645 there is no mention of rs 99 per person for cancellation
7815646 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
7815647 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
7815648 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
7815649 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
7815650 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
7815651 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
7815652 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
7815653 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
7815654 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
7815655 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
7815656 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
7815657 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
7815658 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
7815659 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
7815660 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
7815661 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
7815662 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
7815663 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
7815664 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
7815665 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
7815666 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
7815667 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
7815668 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
7815669 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
7815670 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
7815671 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
7815672 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
7815673 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
7815674 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
7815675 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
7815676 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
7815677 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
7815678 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
7815679 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
7815680 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
7815681 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
7815682 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
7815683 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
7815684 maybe we should have had a discussion before policy is sic put out there publicly mr adams said
7815685 a lot of points and concern about the policy during the meeting
7815686 the basis is right its how you get there and there are some people who have great difficultly in organising a 12 year old to get to school when they dont want to go to school he said
7815687 a lot of us are uncomfortable about this policy but it was a rudd labor commitment and kevin rudd confirmed that yesterday that its a promise he will be keeping she told abc radio today
7815688 i think its fair to say there is a great deal of concern within the caucus
7815689 its a pretty extreme organisation thats got extreme powers that doesnt confront anybody else in australian society he said
7815690 i dont think we need to keep this at the extreme end of where it is at the moment i think we should be able to wind that back somewhat before 2010
7815691 a federal government committed to workplace rights has no justification for keeping the abcc until 2010 greens senator rachel siewert said
7815692 the greens will not shrink from defending the basic human rights of workers including those in the building and construction industry
7815693 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
7815694 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
7815695 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
7815696 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
7815697 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
7815698 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
7815699 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
7815700 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
7815701 who are open to doing something on the production side
7815702 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
7815703 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
7815704 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
7815705 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve

7815707 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
7815708 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
7815709 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
7815710 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again

7815757 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
7815758 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
7815759 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
7815760 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems

7815762 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
7815763 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
7815764 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
7815765 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
7815766 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
7815767 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
7815768 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
7815769 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
7815770 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
7815771 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
7815772 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
7815773 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
7815774 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
7815775 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
7815776 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down

7815790 sterreich als klassisches bergbauernland in mitteleuropa hat die politik f r die berglandwirtschaft und berggebiete im laufe der jahrzehnte auf ein in der gesamten eu beispielhaftes niveau entwickelt sowohl auf sterreichischer als auch auf eu ebene stehen in k rze wichtige entscheidungen an die die gemeinsame agrarpolitik gap und damit auch die politik f r die berglandwirtschaft ber hren die neugestaltung des eu budgets geh rt neben der reform der gap zu den ganz gro en herausforderungen weil damit die gewichtigkeit der gemeinschaftlichen politiken auf dem pr fstand steht die lteste und tats chlich vergemeinschaftete politik der eu darf aufgrund der aktuellen rahmenbedingungen nicht abgebaut sondern muss verst rkt und auf die neuen ziele und bedingungen hin ausgerichtet werden f r die landwirtschaft in den berggebieten und anderen benachteiligten gebieten sind vor allem die instrumente der l ndlichen entwicklung von gro er bedeutung dazu sind in der nationalen umsetzung weiter die finanziellen voraussetzungen auf grundlage des genehmigten programms zu sichern
7815791 die aktuelle internationale situation ist nicht nur von einer beachtlichen dynamik auf dem preissektor schwankungen in beide richtungen werden in der zukunft noch deutlicher ausfallen gekennzeichnet die schwierigeren produktionsbedingungen in den berggebieten verursachen wie auch die einkommensergebnisse zeigen h here produktionskosten auch die abgebrochenen wto verhandlungen signalisieren eine dramatische situation bei der notwendige gemeinsame regelwerke f r akzeptable rahmenbedingungen nicht im erforderlichen umfang umgesetzt werden k nnen
7815792 die diskussionsbeitr ge zum zuk nftigen eu budget sind besorgniserregend weil ganz offensichtlich starke renationalisierende bestrebungen vorhanden sind und die n tzlichkeit eines gemeinsamen rahmens f r die europ ische landwirtschaft untersch tzt oder gar negiert wird die vergangenheit hat jedoch ganz klar gezeigt dass nur eine gemeinsame politik trotz gr ter herausforderungen wie die eu erweiterung kalkulierbare rahmenbedingungen mit sich gebracht hat das erleichterte die l ngerfristige ausrichtung der landwirtschaftlichen betriebe wenngleich die reformwut in den letzten jahren so manche verunsicherung erzeugte umso mehr ist es an der zeit dass mit dem neuen eu haushalt eine nachhaltige positionierung der gemeinsamen agrarpolitik als gemeinschaftsaufgabe erfolgt eine renationalisierung w rde einen fundamentalen r ckschritt bedeuten ohne ber nationale instrumente einen ausgleich herbeif hren zu k nnen
7815793 es ist daher unumg nglich notwendig wirksame flankierende instrumente einzusetzen um einer nicht umkehrbaren aush hlung der berglandwirtschaft begegnen zu k nnen wir brauchen mengen steuernde ma nahmen in der milchproduktion damit der milchmarkt einen kalkulierbaren rahmen und wirtschaftliche perspektive f r die berggebiete hat
7815794 die arge bergbauernfragen fordert flankierende ma nahmen wie vor allem die milchkuhpr mie weil mit dieser ein beitrag zum ausgleich der negativen effekte geleistet werden k nnte
7815795 f r die landwirtschaft in den berggebieten bestehen einerseits wirkungsvolle agrarpolitische instrumente anderseits gibt es konkreten handlungsbedarf zur verbesserung der wirtschaftlichen rahmenbedingungen
7815796 die hohen auflagen im tierschutz und umweltschutz haben nicht nur h here kosten zur folge sie m ssen auch in praktikablen regelungen umgesetzt werden vereinfachungen und b rokratische entlastung vor allem in den bereichen cross compliance und umweltprogramm sind vordringlich so sollte beispielsweise der biokontrollzuschuss automatisiert werden
7815797 in diesem zusammenhang verlangt die arge bergbauernfragen dass die evaluierung der abgrenzung der sonstigen benachteiligten gebiete nicht w hrend der laufenden programmperiode 2010 sondern zu beginn der n chsten periode im jahre 2014 umgesetzt wird

7815806 die letzten beiden jahre haben gezeigt dass ein echter sozialer kurswechsel mit einer mehrheit von rechten parteien im parlament kaum m glich ist soziale fortschrittliche ma nahmen k nnen nur dann umgesetzt werden wenn vp fp und bz im parlament keine mehrheit mehr haben
7815807 nur eine starke sp ist in der lage einen sozialen kurswechsel in sterreich zu schaffen eine stimme f r die sp ist auch eine stimme gegen die mehrheit der rechten im parlament
7815808 es war ja mit dem b rgermeister bereits alles besprochen

7815811 die bundesregelung bringt also auch enorme verbesserungen in manchen punkten
7815812 w hrend sich sp und vp in so pl tzlicher wie aufgesetzter sorge um die sterreichischen familien berschlagen dabei allerdings den ernst der lage v llig verkennen bleibt die fp auf dem boden n chterner fakten
7815813 genau diese fakten belegen das familienpolitische versagen der in scheidung lebenden koalitionspartner und die tats chliche tragweite ihrer vers umnisse
7815814 alleine seit 2002 haben kinderabsetzbetrag und kinderbetreuungsgeld ber 15 prozent die familienbeihilfe seit 2003 satte 13 6 prozent an wert verloren stellt man familienbeihilfe und kinderabsetzbetrag in summe gegen ber ergibt sich gegen ber 1999 nach altersstufen des kindes ein realer verlust von durchschnittlich rund 300 euro monatlich
7815815 dieses modell wird vor allem alleinerziehenden mehr geld bringen das einkommen wird dabei halbiert und dieses geringere teil einkommen der lohn und einkommensteuer unterzogen die dabei ermittelte niedrigere steuer wird dann wieder verdoppelt der positive progressionseffekt f r alleinerzieher liegt bei einer alleinerzieherin mit einem kind und einem monatseinkommen von 1 500 bei einem plus von 1 649 euro im jahresnettoeinkommen
7815816 wollen sp und vp die familien tats chlich entlasten sollten sie sich zun chst mit dem ausma der realen wertverluste auseinandersetzen um nicht weitere kopflose familienpolitische sargn gel zu produzieren
7815817 dieses interdisziplin re gremium hat sich als hervorragendes instrument erwiesen aspekte der frauengesundheit in die gesundheitspolitik einzubringen und umzusetzen das erfolgreiche beispiel in der steiermark kann in kurzer zeit in allen bundesl ndern umgesetzt werden
7815818 um nur ein beispiel zu nennen wie dringend ein derartiger fachbeirat f r das vernachl ssigte thema frauen und gesundheit ben tigt wird in der herz rehabilitation werden sieben mal mehr m nner als frauen betreut herzinfarkte sind aber keine m nnersache wie viele vermuten frauen sind heute nahezu genauso h ufig davon betroffen wie m nner
7815819 hier geht es mir darum frauen zu einem fr hen zeitpunkt einen ausstieg aus der gewaltspirale zu erm glichen und dadurch die gesundheitlichen sp tfolgen zu erkennen und zu behandeln das frauengesundheitszentrums trainiert krankenhausmitarbeiterinnen in 14 fortbildungen gesundheitliche folgen von gewalt zu erkennen und den betroffenen frauen zu helfen da das gesundheitswesen die erste anlaufstelle f r gewaltopfer ist will ich dazu beitragen dass dieses projekt auf m glichst viele spit ler ausgedehnt wird
7815820 vom papstbesuch ist mehr geblieben als eine sch ne erinnerung
7815821 mehr als eine sch ne erinnerung an die begegnung mit dem heiligen vater und an wetterfeste christen geblieben ist
7815822 was die vp heute fordert hat sie durch ihre blockade im sommerministerrat selbst blockiert
7815823 sich jetzt herzustellen und der justizministerin s umigkeit vorzuwerfen ist absurd und zeigt dass die vp im wahlkampf jegliche verantwortung gegen ber der bev lkerung vermissen l sst
7815824 was hat die gesellschaft davon wenn es wegen fehlender pr vention zu straftaten kommt und die t ter dann h rter bestraft werden
7815825 dieses thema muss sachlich diskutiert werden der wahlkampf ist dazu definitiv nicht geeignet
7815826 durch den von sp und vp getragenen beschluss des gemeinderats dem bautr ger arwag diesen teilabbruch zuzugestehen wurden prim r die profitinteressen des bautr gers nachgegeben
7815827 symboltr chtiger k nnten abbrucharbeiten nicht sein die wiener sp zeigt einmal mehr dass ihr soziale visionen schon lang abhanden gekommen sind und ihr nahestehende baufirmen n her stehen als sozialprojekte

7815867 you say hi nice to meet you the next day in the papers youre pregnant with his child
7815868 the media is a bigger animal than i ever will be it just becomes this soap opera and i guess i had a pretty good few episodes
7815869 you feel like its a video sometimes i play these games to make it more amusing like im lara croft or something so i find myself ducking behind cars
7815870 if it was to happen i think youd just have to take it in your stride
7815871 i think ive taken a lot of confidence out of saturday and not knowing i was going to be there because of mcmenimans illness and yet the team had such a good result

7815877 i guess a suspension is not typical but its a typical week in terms of managing your mix

7815884 its really a tribute to one of the simple joys of life time as a family
7815885 the record has taken about a year to make and i think the whole thing reflects change
7815886 i think every record sort of reflects where im at and ive made a ton of changes this year just mentally and in how im approaching everything
7815887 and i think its much more rockin than anything ive done
7815888 we paid good money for him and since then he has played more than 20 premier league games

7815890 he has done very well for us in pre season has looked good in training in the first few weeks of this season and hes a good squad player

7815897 these loggers like gunns are featherbedded by huge taxpayer subsidies and they are destroying an asset which is a multi billion dollar hedge against global warming
7815898 if the forest contractors association really are considering a class action it should be against gunns ltd for all the contractors and sub contractors who have gone to the wall when gunns failed to keep them employed
7815899 this is a much clearer argument for fca to take on
7815900 a class action on behalf of all the jobless scottsdale mill workers would also make more sense
7815901 hes one of the better players obviously in the league
7815902 hes having a big year power wise ive never not seen him play the game the right way he plays the game the right way hes a very impressive player
7815903 its a great accomplishment for somebody with a great deal of ability
7815904 obviously she knew while shes the victim she clearly didnt stand in the way of the cover up
7815905 this was our private matter and i frankly wanted it to be private because as painful as it was i did not want to have to play it out on a public stage as well
7815906 the question for her as well as for him is what is their foundation what gives them a platform to engage in public issues
7815907 their big challenge is convincing people that they will continue to be active in politics and theyre going to continue to have a voice
7815908 an imperfect man with a truly progressive vision who spoke to and for those whom others ignored yes that is who i supported
7815909 an imperfect man who had come to face his own imperfections and was seeking to redeem himself to those closest to him yes that is who i supported
7815910 she knew she should not have participated in him running for president with this bomb waiting to go off she did she kinda loses my sympathy
7815911 i believe we are all owed a huge apology not self serving claims for pity by both john and elizabeth edwards who both knew about the affair and both decided to go forward and seek the democratic candidacy regardless of the titanic risk
7815912 there was anguish excruciating anguish for her in dealing with this
7815913 she was angry and furious and everything but at one point she had to make a choice do i kick him out or do we have a 30 year marriage that can be rebuilt
7815914 i thought it was very naive on both their parts
7815915 it would be very sad if he were the nominee of our party right now
7815916 theres a sensitivity chip thats missing i just dont know what happened i feel as if im trying to scrounge around and pick up the pieces in the midst of this media circus

7815924 we recruited him to be an offensive tackle but we happened to have two multiple year starters at both positions so we didnt want to tip the boat there
7815925 we scheduled anthony at guard and he met our expectations and became a starter but the plan all along was to move him out to tackle during his sophomore year
7815926 and being an offensive tackle is like being a pitcher in baseball

7815946 men are handling the grocery shopping more than ever before either on their own or shared with their spouse
7815947 men are grocery shopping more because they say it gives them time with their spouse partner or family
7815948 in contrast women are more likely to shop independently and say it gives them some time alone
7815949 men tend to buy treats like three different kinds of potato chips while women tend to choose household items such as detergent cleaning supplies and paper items
7815950 shopping enjoyment decreases steadily as consumers age particularly among older women
7815951 when you think about it grocery shopping is not an easy task when you are in your 60s or 70s

7816070 there is still a full series left and thats a lot of football to be played we have to try to keep winning our games and getting the maximum return
7816071 its not an easy thing to do as playing two games a week can drain players physically but it often takes a toll mentally as well
7816072 i thought we were excellent we really should have won
7816073 we dominated the game for about 80 minutes and we created a lot of chances

7816111 i voted for anwar because i think he can look after the interests of malays and other races

7816120 infill housing is something we continuously address theres not a one time solution
7816121 location is everything as its always been in real estate
7816122 for those fortunate enough to be able to buy a house tear it down and rebuild infill housing is a wonderful opportunity to live in a closer in location
7816123 the positive way to look at this is that we are recycling properties
7816124 why spread farther west into undeveloped areas if the infrastructure is already in place why not utilize it
7816125 if you include the new houses full walk out basement its kind of a 3 story house
7816126 from a visual inspection of the exterior anyone can see it far exceeds the size of anything else in the neighborhood
7816127 the trustees were powerless to stop construction because we did not have the funds
7816128 we made it clear to the builder that we were not happy with the design or the scale of the house its not the sort of simple redwood ranch that characterizes most of the homes in craig woods
7816129 when we got home at 11 30 or 12 the house catty corner from us was gone they had knocked it down
7816130 every time i pass by that house its sort of like the dirt in your own home
7816131 you tend not to see it after awhile but its just a shame its a two story whatever i can live with that the fact is its the only house in the neighborhood that does not have any brick and its all white siding
7816132 we just want to maintain the same look of the neighborhood
7816133 we found that even if we did hire a lawyer to beef up the indentures or present association bylaws it wouldnt protect us any more than what we already have
7816134 if youre putting a nice product next to an existing house people shouldnt have complaints but anytime you have change some people have reservations
7816135 tearing down those little houses and putting up the big mcmansions
7816136 my jaw drops every time i see another one go up my gosh its just amazing
7816137 ive seen the insides of a few they have all the extras and theyre gorgeous
7816138 i love all my neighbors sometimes i look at the new homes and think these houses just dont fit together but then other times i guess im getting used to it i think its actually kind of a nice mix now i dont think it looks glaringly horrible
7816139 they gave a sense of majesty and people went wow look at all that space
7816140 many homes are beyond repair and quite frankly in this day and age new homes are more attractive to many buyers than existing homes

7816150 in fill has certainly picked up the pace as suburban land has become more pricey and more challenging farther away from the urban core
7816151 it has caused a lot of anxiety with many existing neighbors who fear the changing nature and architectural appearance of their neighborhood
7816152 because it is a historic district the city wanted to maintain as much control over the developer and design of the homes as they can to make sure that these homes fit the area
7816153 it doesnt inhibit us from developing in the city because we enjoy some of the challenges that come about with building a home that looks like it was built a long time ago
7816154 i can tell you as a developer it costs more because of the requirements but the ultimate goal in in fill building is to improve the neighborhood and have something that fits really good in the neighborhood
7816155 its essentially in response to cookie cutter homes and trying to get away from that
7816156 its really about how the home needs to be in harmony with neighboring homes
7816157 as communities see more in fill projects the process of getting through planning and zoning has expanded
7816158 now we are having to explain to more people about the project i think it has tripled the amount of time it takes to get a project approved what used to take a month now can take three to six months
7816159 when we did our first in fill project in dogtown they were happy we were building something new
7816160 now for example a requirement in dogtown is to have brick on the exterior oftentimes the requirements arent specified by a city ordinance but are encouraged by the architectural review board and or alderman in order to get approval for the project

7816200 in our view this data is a strong indicator that performance of the mobile carriers network is affecting the iphone 3g more than the handset itself

7816221 maybe we should have had a discussion before policy is sic put out there publicly mr adams said
7816222 a lot of points and concern about the policy during the meeting
7816223 the basis is right its how you get there and there are some people who have great difficultly in organising a 12 year old to get to school when they dont want to go to school he said
7816224 a lot of us are uncomfortable about this policy but it was a rudd labor commitment and kevin rudd confirmed that yesterday that its a promise he will be keeping she told abc radio today
7816225 i think its fair to say there is a great deal of concern within the caucus
7816226 its a pretty extreme organisation thats got extreme powers that doesnt confront anybody else in australian society he said
7816227 i dont think we need to keep this at the extreme end of where it is at the moment i think we should be able to wind that back somewhat before 2010
7816228 a federal government committed to workplace rights has no justification for keeping the abcc until 2010 greens senator rachel siewert said

7816233 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
7816234 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
7816235 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
7816236 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
7816237 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
7816238 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7816239 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7816240 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7816241 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
7816242 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
7816243 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources

7816252 how can you bring yourself to imitate a people who are but fuel for the fire
7816253 if it was said to you imitate an object of ridicule a laughing stock you would surely scorn this and become angry how is it then that you imitate the uncircumcised worshipper of the cross in his celebrations how is it that you dress your children with new clothes and inculcate a sense of joy in them how is it that you decorate eggs for them buy incense and celebrate the festival of your enemy in the same fashion as you would celebrate the eid legislated by your prophet sallallahu alaihi wa salam where would such a practice take you except to the anger of allah and his displeasure provided he does not forgive you that is and provided that you know that your prophet muhammad sallallahu alaihi wa salam used to encourage differing from the people of the book in everything that was specific to them

7816260 the broken power model problem as green plug has articulated it simply must be solved
7816261 there is absolutely no reason why the players in consumer electronics cant unite around the emerging green plug standard enabling a single external power supply to power any dc powered product its vital for consumers for manufacturers for utilities and especially for the planet i am delighted to add my voice and my presence to the green plug team and to work enthusiastically for wide adoption of this necessary standard
7816262 with nearly a quarter century in the consumer electronics space jay believes green plug has the right implementation and the right technology to make this standard happen globally

7816265 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7816266 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7816267 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort

7816303 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
7816304 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
7816305 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7816306 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7816307 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7816308 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7816309 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7816310 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7816311 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
7816312 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
7816313 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7816314 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7816315 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7816316 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
7816317 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred

7816362 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
7816363 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
7816364 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
7816365 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure

7816409 the brass opening the addition of strings when the opening melody repeats the inclusion of complex bass lines in measures 14 and 28 and the use of an archaic little cadence at the end of several phrases were all very particular to breiners original
7816410 all the anthems and songs used at the beijing games were orchestrated by chinese musicians
7816411 my arrangements of public domain anthems are original compositions from a legal point of view

7816413 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7816414 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7816415 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7816416 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected

7816431 i think that it is no secret and ive said it to my israeli counterparts that i dont think the settlement activity is helpful to the process
7816432 what we need now are steps that enhance confidence between the parties and anything that undermines confidence between the parties ought to be avoided

7816446 the mentorship program was set up to reduce partisanship in the senate
7816447 obama once you get beneath his patina of aloofness is a real guy
7816448 its just amazing when you look at where he was and what he squandered
7816449 he was in a position to be formidable to be the guy you needed to get by instead he positioned himself in a completely nonviable way he just made himself untenable as a democrat
7816450 but there were people who thought he should get out for his own dignity
7816451 taking the party in a direction thats bad for america take no prisoners partisan attack politics
7816452 for the sake of our state our country and my party
7816453 joe knew what he was going to do long before it became public there were back channel talks between lamont and dodd lamont and kerry before the primary imagine to have your friend john kerry fly into connecticut and campaign against you to have your friend chris dodd film a tv ad against you these are the people you have lunch with every tuesday
7816454 l ook none of the democratic candidates asked me for my support
7816455 john mccain called a week after thanksgiving and said i dont want to get you into more trouble with the democrats than youre already in but would you consider endorsing me in new hampshire
7816456 the media were asking whom id support and i was in my wonderful status as an independent
7816457 last year at the dailykos convention just about all of the candidates came and the democratic leadership council held a convention and none came
7816458 netroots and moveon org controlled the agenda they endorsed obama like they endorsed ned lamont and did to hillary what they did to me in 2006
7816459 is now the frame he will put around any situation even when it doesnt apply
7816460 if youre a nail the whole world looks like a hammer
7816461 he was hurt and to an extent he is still working through it
7816462 i give the mccain campaign days when i dont have senate
7816463 sundays and mondays im very pleased theyre going to use me at all
7816464 mccain needs to do something to shake this race up
7816465 his coalition is not going to be broad enough to win

7816467 i like obama i was in the civil rights movement i went to mississippi to register voters im not going to attack senator obama
7816468 im sure joe would agree that given the muslim settings of possible american military action having a defense secretary named lieberman may not be the shrewdest american move
7816469 its going to be very difficult for joe to operate with the obama white house
7816470 i dont know what hell be doing in terms of his party affiliation
7816471 ive told him many times id love to see him in the gop
7816472 you dont have to sign anything i just held a press conference and said im changing parties it was the easiest political thing ive done in my life
7816473 one of the assumptions that people make is that if they buy virus protecting software that will protect them from all known viruses
7816474 that may well be true but theres an awful lot out there that we dont know about
7816475 so designing more effective systems and designing security models to ensure that we dont have these problems is what the course is based around
7816476 in the industry we refer to people with white hats and black hats which comes from the old westerns
7816477 but realistically were very careful about the people we take onto the program
7816478 we have a strong vetting procedure in the uk we use things like disclosure scotland to ensure that people that were taking on arent coming from a criminal background

7816488 as countermeasures in a situation where the united states violated the agreement
7816489 its not easy for israel to release prisoners some of the individuals being released today are guilty of direct involvement in the murder of innocent civilians
7816490 but we understand the importance of the prisoner issue for palestinian society we believe this action can support the negotiation process and create goodwill
7816491 we had lost hope that my brother would be released because hes been in prison for 32 years
7816492 going to shoot obama from a high vantage point using a rifle sighted at 750 yards
7816493 was directly asked if they had come to denver to kill obama he responded in the affirmative
7816494 clearly we found there are federal implications otherwise we would not have notified them
7816495 its premature to say that it was a valid threat or that these folks have the ability to carry it out
7816496 were absolutely confident there is no credible threat to the candidate the democratic national convention or the people of colorado
7816497 that omission sends a message that verges on the sinister not that ministers have abandoned their commitment to decency and fairness but that when it comes to devising strategies for dealing with the numbers crisis and the other challenges facing the prison estate the monitoring task has simply disappeared off the agenda
7816498 we are concerned that the government seems to be going back on jack straws own statement that we cannot build ourselves out of the prison numbers crisis
7816499 we are not just dealing with overcrowding though overcrowding is a serious problem in some prisons we are also dealing with a system that is overwhelmed by numbers
7816500 the proposal to add 7 500 in these three massive prisons is going simply to add another set of places where regimes will suffer because they will have to accommodate the needs of several different kinds of prisoners who at the moment we expect to keep separate from one another
7816501 for over a decade this government has failed to provide adequate jail places but huge prisoner warehouses the largest in europe are not the right answer
7816502 the arrest is part of an ongoing investigation by lancashire constabulary and greater manchester counter terrorism unit
7816503 this is a very sensitive time for all our communities and we are working hard to ensure everyone is kept up to date with as much information as we can give
7816504 we will endeavour to carry out any searches as quickly as possible to minimise impact on the area concerned however inquiries of this nature are complex and may take time to resolve
7816505 i would like to thank local residents affected by the arrests for their co operation and ask that they remain patient we will ensure people are kept updated in relation to the investigation as and when we can
7816506 inquiries of this nature are complex and may take time to resolve
7816507 anton is up today tuesday for a medical and we hope to get that tied up today
7816508 hes had a slight hamstring strain so it would be unfair to throw him straight in
7816509 we have two players right now who are done for the season i hate injuries especially when they happen to seniors and both of these guys were in the mix for us
7816510 there has also been a lot written about ben hartman with his hip and we just do not know how this is going to progress according to holtz
7816511 my concern there is that he is a running back and we came in with brandon simmons dominique lindsay and j r rodgers we had two seniors and a junior and two of those three are now out jon williams and norman whitley are now going to have to grow up in a hurry and step on the field
7816512 there are a number of other injuries antonio allison who was vying for a spot on the depth chart is out with a knee josh clark a freshman is out with his back
7816513 allen crowder has had surgery on his wrist but he should be fine anthony garner is continuing to rehab his leg martin tanski and wes pittman are both out with knee problems
7816514 the ones who are really affecting the depth chart right now are setzer lindsay rodgers and hartman i hate injuries but they are a part of this game
7816515 one player who we are considering taking the redshirt off of is robert jones
7816516 i am very pleased with the progress of joe womack leonard paulk jacobi jenkins rahkeem morgan and a lot of those skill players right now though with the depth that we have at those positions those guys will redshirt
7816517 demorio waymon has transferred to north carolina central and deronte mcneill has transferred to elizabeth city
7816518 both want to have the opportunity to play right away and we wish them both the best of luck i hate it when young men choose to leave but i understand their desire to play
7816519 we are very excited to have the opportunity to go play in charlotte on the other side of the state where a lot of our alumni and fans are were also excited to be able to play in bank of america stadium and to play a team that is the caliber of virginia tech
7816520 i dont know what to expect out of a lot of the younger players which makes you a little bit nervous and creates a lot of unknowns
7816521 but you just dont know when they walk into a stadium with 72 000 people against a top 20 program with the caliber of athletes that they have if theyll raise their game to a new level or be overwhelmed were going to learn a lot after that first series
7816522 we understand what were walking into we know that were playing a very talented and well coached football team when you look at this team they have 14 starters who are returning from last year they lost a lot of talent but what concerned me most was when bud foster said he thinks this defense will be better than they were a year ago
7816523 he thinks they are quicker and more athletic we understand the challenge that were going to have last year they were in the top five in the country in five major defensive categories we are playing one of the best defensive football teams in the country this opening game its going to be an extremely tall order for us

7816601 we know that young people are prolific users of bluetooth technology and thought this would be an excellent way of communicating directly with them
7816602 we are hoping this transmitter alongside the enforcement and education work we carry out will really impact on all types of underage sales in knowsley

7816623 against the background of the global economic environment and increasing consolidation in the it services industry the combination with infosys represents a compelling proposition
7816624 the only concern i have about this is if people are spotted placing items in the mailboxes will it mean a marker is then put down on them
7816625 im all for giving information anonymously but im sure the crimestoppers number already allows people to do that im not sure how much anonymity these boxes provide
7816626 i think weve got to remember that a lot of crimes are connected to drugs when it comes to stabbings or shootings a lot of it comes back to that we must be getting pretty desperate if we are resorting to this
7816627 having said that im not going to dismiss anything without seeing the results and im sure everyone around here will agree that anything that may contribute to helping reduce crime is a good thing i guess we will all have to wait and see

7816630 its hard to know what to do for the best but we released balloons on the first anniversary and it just seemed like the right thing to do again this year
7816631 but we have had to accept it because there is no choice to do anything but
7816632 we consider the event to be a major success and as a result we would like to come back to wolverhampton to do another one in the future
7816633 i would like to say a big thank you to the public for supporting us
7816634 we started planning the wolverhampton event 15 months ago and for the last year held monthly meetings in pendeford with local residents and as a result we felt very much part of the community
7816635 we had 200 300 volunteers help us at the event and probably another 200 help us in planning for it and they were magnificent
7816636 next year we are holding the event at redhill near nottingham and weve got some ideas already for 2010 2011 and 2012 but after that it really is up in the air and we would love to come back
7816637 its gone very well considering the weather it was better than expected weve had lots of people in and out
7816638 the furthest people have travelled is from wales but weve had people from all over the region its lovely because its like a family theres not that many horticultural shows around and this one is quite big but its a family atmosphere as well

7816654 there are four characteristics which brand a country unmistakably as a dictatorship one party rule executions without trial or with a mock trial for political offenses the nationalization or expropriation of private property and censorship a country guilty of these outrages forfeits any moral prerogatives any claim to national rights or sovereignty and becomes an outlaw
7816655 every time i hear wendy speak i learn something new not just about cape wind but about politics in america she embodies the best of this countrys journalistic tradition reminding us all why a free press is so critical to a free society

7816657 because bats can detect objects with echolocation they seldom collide with man made structures
7816658 an atmospheric pressure drop at wind turbine blades is an undetectable and potentially unforeseeable hazard for bats thus partially explaining the large number of bat fatalities at these specific structures
7816659 given that bats are more susceptible to barotrauma than birds and that bat fatalities at wind turbines far outnumber bird fatalities at most sites wildlife fatalities at wind turbines are now a bat issue not a bird issue

7816668 es beweist uns auch dass wir die richtige entscheidung getroffen haben im sinne unserer kunden und anwender ganz bewusst auf eine lizenzsoftware statt auf open source produkte zu setzen dadurch k nnen wir jederzeit darauf vertrauen dass die weiterentwicklung der l sungen wie auch die vertriebsseitige und technische unterst tzung durch scholl communications permanent gew hrleistet ist was wiederum den kunden konkret im tagesgesch ft zugute kommt im open source umfeld ist dies bekannterma en keine selbstverst ndlichkeit

7816723 that such a large amount of fish is used for the pet food industry is a real eye opener our pets seem to be eating better than their owners
7816724 while much of the criticism has been on the grounds that forage fish could be better used for human consumption directly particularly among the poorer nations of the world rather than in the production of food for farmed fish little attention has been paid to the amount of forage fish used by the pet food industry
7816725 pet ownership is increasing globally the pet food industry is moving towards a constant increase of production and manufacturing and marketing premium and super premium products

7816730 however there is a clear hole drilled exactly in the centre of the base so it would appear to have been lost from a necklace
7816731 it is of course now illegal to import these teeth under the cites agreement
7816732 we have a very serious problem with speed and alcohol abuse they are the dominating factors in serious road accidents
7816733 this legislation will empower the minister to make regulations enabling the suspension of a drivers licence
7816734 weve really got to roll back the death rate on our roads
7816735 we have among the highest road fatality cases in the world and even our own statistics are ropey because we tend to measure road fatalities in terms of people who died on the scene
7816736 so we estimate that around 17 000 people die on our roads each year
7816737 there is a challenge there getting convictions is proving very difficult
7816738 we really need to work much more effectively with the judiciary and magistrates courts in particular

7816779 theres no doubt many horse owners are hendra aware and theres been a modest increase in the number of people calling about possible testing
7816780 the increased number of investigations is providing further assurance that this serious virus is not present in the general horse population across the state
7816781 if you have a concern about your horse you should stay away from it and not hesitate to call because we are here to provide our expertise and support and to take action in cases of concern

7816789 the environment is stimulating and entertaining and theres less fear of falling over
7816790 after a stroke or fall many older people lack motivation and confidence and they dont feel steady on their feet so getting out and about can be an issue and they can find the whole process rather dull
7816791 i can see it working very well on improving strength endurance and stamina
7816792 consistency and practice are key to making progress and this system has huge potential across a wide range of activities which can be tailored to meet individual rehabilitation needs
7816793 the vast majority of stroke survivors cannot use a normal treadmill because they are not in control
7816794 walking is the best possible exercise for their bodies and this system would help enormously

7816799 the high cost of housing and the lack of affordable housing for local families is a crucial issue which can affect the balance and sustainability of communities in many parts of rural scotland including the borders
7816800 while the issue is complex the committee inquiry aims to produce positive practical suggestions that will benefit places such as melrose
7816801 the committee visit provides members with an opportunity to meet and hear from people dealing directly with rural housing issues in the scottish borders through our round table discussion we hope to gain a clear understanding of how well key stakeholders work together to deliver quality affordable housing in the borders

7816810 at this point we need to try anything and obama is anything and if he doesnt do the job we can throw the bum out in four years
7816811 i openly no flamingly endorse obama whether he says hes for gay marriage or not
7816812 i am a horrible catch as i am more married to my work and my guitar than i would ever be to any man woman or child

7816819 we know that straight fines are often paid for by workers through wage freezes cuts redundancies and worse working conditions or by consumers and members of the public
7816820 these proposals for equity fines will ensure that those most responsible for corporate offending bear the cost
7816821 an annual work related death toll in excess of 1 600 is tragic testimony to the fact that the current system of fining companies for health and safety offences has not served as strict enough punishment or strong enough deterrent
7816822 fack welcomes these proposals for equity fines which will lay the punishment for corporate offending at the feet of those who are ultimately responsible those running the business
7816823 was directly asked if they had come to denver to kill obama he responded in the affirmative
7816824 were absolutely confident there is no credible threat to the candidate the democratic national convention or the people of colorado
7816825 that omission sends a message that verges on the sinister not that ministers have abandoned their commitment to decency and fairness but that when it comes to devising strategies for dealing with the numbers crisis and the other challenges facing the prison estate the monitoring task has simply disappeared off the agenda
7816826 we are concerned that the government seems to be going back on jack straws own statement that we cannot build ourselves out of the prison numbers crisis
7816827 we are not just dealing with overcrowding though overcrowding is a serious problem in some prisons we are also dealing with a system that is overwhelmed by numbers
7816828 the proposal to add 7 500 in these three massive prisons is going simply to add another set of places where regimes will suffer because they will have to accommodate the needs of several different kinds of prisoners who at the moment we expect to keep separate from one another
7816829 for over a decade this government has failed to provide adequate jail places but huge prisoner warehouses the largest in europe are not the right answer
7816830 the arrest is part of an ongoing investigation by lancashire constabulary and greater manchester counter terrorism unit
7816831 this is a very sensitive time for all our communities and we are working hard to ensure everyone is kept up to date with as much information as we can give
7816832 we will endeavour to carry out any searches as quickly as possible to minimise impact on the area concerned however inquiries of this nature are complex and may take time to resolve
7816833 i would like to thank local residents affected by the arrests for their co operation and ask that they remain patient we will ensure people are kept updated in relation to the investigation as and when we can
7816834 inquiries of this nature are complex and may take time to resolve
7816835 for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction
7816836 grace to you and peace from god the father and our lord jesus christ

7816839 for after that in the wisdom of god the world by wisdom knew not god it pleased god by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe
7816840 heres gods will just pray for grace to do it

7816849 o law you would climb up into the kingdom of my conscience and there reprove it of sin and take from me the joy of my heart which i have by faith in christ and drive me to desperation that i may be without hope and utterly perish

7816852 j estamos acostumados a realizar festivais mas isso n o torna a opera o menos complicada n s precisamos remanejar o pessoal da cozinha e encarar todo o trabalho de log stica dos ingredientes

7816854 os frutos do mar encontrados no oceano pac fico s o muito bons e al m disso o palomo trouxe uma s rie de especiarias chilenas que d o o sabor todo especial comida
7816855 the troubled conscience in view of gods judgment has no remedy against desperation and eternal death unless it takes hold of the forgiveness of sins by grace freely offered in christ jesus which if it can apprehend it may then be at rest then it can boldly say i seek not active or working righteousness for if i had it i could not trust it neither dare i set it against the judgment of god then i abandon myself from all active righteousness both of my own and of gods law and embrace only that passive righteousness which is the righteousness of grace mercy and forgiveness of sins
7816856 when i see a man oppressed with the law terrified with sin and thirsting for comfort it is time that i remove out of his sight the law and active righteousness and set before him by the gospel the christian or passive righteousness which offers the promise made in christ who came for the afflicted and sinners

7816882 unlike the last time we went to the moon everybody is going to the moon now there are at least a dozen proposals i know of from various countries to go to the moon
7816883 this is going to open a new era of scientific understanding of not just the moon and the formation of the earth moon system but how we can live on another world
7816884 of the moon on the moon and from the moon
7816885 i think the way to sell it is that were going to the moon as a step beyond
7816886 the other is that the moon is an interesting enough place to stay as well people talk about exit strategies on the moon to touch base leave and go to mars i think thats dumb
7816887 if we can work in antarctica for 50 years and still want to go back and do more the moon also is at least as interesting as antarctica
7816888 theres still a lot of science to be done on the moon its a natural world with natural complexity
7816889 were never going to have a long term 50 year plus research base on mars if we cant figure out how to do that on the moon so lets figure out how to do it on the moon
7816890 the moon is hot or cool depending on what your generation is
7816891 but i dont think we have to go sell the moon i think it sold itself
7816892 but im here to tell you its not your fathers oldsmobile
7816893 with humans going back the lunar environment needs to be studied and studied well
7816894 if i were a betting man i would say the lunar program is here to stay
7816895 ive been trying to get nasa to adopt a mission statement of why were going to the moon not six themes not 182 different sub goals

7816925 its disappointing that each year we see a small minority of mainly young men who dont come to the carnival until later they dont come to enjoy the floats and the music they come to fight and commit acts of violence we have seen serious incidents in previous years
7816926 for two hours our officers came under attack from bottles bricks and any debris that was on the ground these were officers who had been working hard all day

7816931 more than 1 million people had a great time at the notting hill carnival and enjoyed an amazing spectacle of colour energy and music
7816932 the bank holiday weekend was the culmination of a series of successful carnival events during the month of august
7816933 while this incident which happened after the festivities were over and people were on their way home is extremely disappointing it is important that it should not overshadow what is europes greatest street party
7816934 we will be working with the police to look at exactly what happened and to prevent incidents like this happening in the future

7816948 if we fight poverty youll see a reduction in abortion rates disease and a lot of other things
7816949 its not about shoving it religion down your throat but identifying what we already agree on
7816950 we have to be the first to acknowledge that religion does not have a monopoly on morality
7816951 you could be agnostic or atheist and still have a strong sense of values
7816952 pimping religion and making it an instrument for one particular political agenda
7816953 this countrys administration has diverted all of their attention away from places like afghanistan where there are real terrorist threats

7817011 damian curran was absolutely excellent against newry city on saturday
7817012 his first season was a difficult one for him my feeling was that he more than contributed but that there was more to come from him as well
7817013 i have seen before with players that it takes them until their second season with us before they show their true form if they dont do it in the second season they usually move on
7817014 damians passing and his influence on the game were first class on saturday and overall he had a very good game
7817015 really what damian has suffered has been similar to other players who have come to linfield
7817016 martin mcgaughey got it then there was stephen beatty and jamie marks there just seems to be players that people dont take to straight away but i think anyone who saw saturdays game will acknowledge how well damian curran performed
7817017 stuart underlined that its about a squad and not a team and he is a realistic contender to alan
7817018 worcester will be tough i think its their last game before the end of their pre season and they will send a strong side over theyll be ready for the start of the premiership
7817019 they are a very physical side so it will be another step up again
7817020 but if we perform like that against queensland i cant see why we cant beat them
7817021 i know a few of the worcester guys and obviously they might have chris latham as well
7817022 they have always boasted a big physical pack and they base their game around that it will be a direct game and a real stern test
7817023 although it was a good win against the reds we cant go over the top about it and there is still a lot to improve
7817024 im sure well go through the video and find those things at the start of the game our forwards were immense and they gave us the platform
7817025 queensland turned the ball over a few times and that allowed us to push them back
7817026 we put pressure on them but we were disappointed not to get more points in the first half thats something we need to work on our patience and the execution of a few plays but all in all it was a good start
7817027 i thought we did very well and we kept them to zero which was one of our big aims our penalty count was still a wee bit high so well have to look into that before the magners league starts i thought it was a big improvement on last week in all facets of play
7817028 worcester are a big side with some big names and it will be a real step up for us after the bath and queensland reds games
7817029 they were very different games which was good in many respects and we are looking to improve again in certain areas it will be a great test for us
7817030 i know this girl is not involved in the security forces
7817031 i totally condemn anyone who targets anyone like this can you imagine how this girl feels if theres a knock shes afraid to open her front door she is very very distressed that people are considering her a target
7817032 shes left her home at present because she doesnt want to be opening the door and she doesnt want people driving past the house and firing at it
7817033 i believe there is an onus on the security forces to get that message out
7817034 this is very serious in an area where there has been an upsurge in dissident republican activity this is very worrying especially when it comes against a background of fewer resources being made available to the psni who have to operate on a reduced budget
7817035 its always a tough place to go and it has extra spice being a derby
7817036 well go there full of confidence and a full squad to chose from
7817037 several first team players travelled with the reserves on saturday as i wanted them to get 90 minutes under their belt
7817038 we conceded from a set piece again and yes it is something that we have to improve on
7817039 you cant afford to let in goals like that and fortunately
7817040 set pieces seem to be a major problem for us and again it has come down to individual errors
7817041 if that continues then i will have to take a look at team selection and making changes
7817042 we move on and look towards the match against crusaders
7817043 its going to be difficult but i expect a better performance from our players
7817044 well take the positives from the second half into the game against bangor
7817045 on reflection maybe the two games that crusaders had was the difference in the opening 20 minutes
7817046 having had a match under our belts will be a good marker for us and a good kick up the backside for this game
7817047 willo has been outstanding in pre season and we missed him on saturday
7817048 he is a good threat at set pieces along with jay magee because i think when we put some balls into the box we caused crusaders problems
7817049 he is a good footballer he passes well and hes intelligent in the balls he tries to put through for the front men
7817050 no wheeze you just puff go along clear throat deep inhale ill just um pant pant be along im just gonna have some cough water
7817051 the fallout of the credit crisis will continue to dampen the global economy over the next 24 months with sharply escalated oil and food prices beginning to test inflation expectations
7817052 we are concerned with the emerging risks of stagflation this presents huge socio political as well as economic risks in the next three to five years opportunities may be limited in such a scenario

7817065 the main driver of demand for our products is urbanization and industrialization in heavily populated countries like china and india and these economies continue to grow strongly
7817066 the terms available to refer to women carry far more overtones and meaning than those referring to men
7817067 the convention persists that men often refer to adult women as girls
7817068 as a grumpy old woman i think the man on the clapham omnibus wont care tuppence
7817069 yet again we find another local council acting in a patronising and politically correct manner
7817070 surely they should trust people in their jobs instead of wanting to abandon common or garden phrases
7817071 it is easy to make fun of individual phrases or words but what we are seeking to do is to be more sensitive and responsive to the needs of others in our society

7817084 i dont know where david jeffrey is coming from when he says they should have won three or four nil
7817085 the chances we had were as good as theirs michael collins had a header well saved and wed two other goalbound efforts blocked
7817086 we contained them they changed their formation to suit us and only for a deflection they wouldnt have scored
7817087 other than the goal any shots they had were straight at paul murphy and they never really troubled us
7817088 our problem was that we had three or four players who didnt perform and you cant afford that in this league
7817089 our performance in li ge was poor but the result was good we did not concede an away goal and we hope that playing the second leg at anfield will make a massive difference
7817090 the entire team did not play well they li ge were organised pressed well and were very aggressive
7817091 football is about winning it does not matter how well you play so long as you come off the pitch having picked up the points
7817092 when you do not play as well as you know you can but you are still getting results then that is a sign of a good team we have got two wins out of two in the league and that is all you can ask for now we will look ahead to the champions league game against li ge and we know how important it is to make sure we get into the group stages i am looking forward to being able to play here on a european night
7817093 we did not play well in li ge and we know we will have to improve at anfield everyone knows how important it is for our season to get into the group stage it would be unthinkable for us not to be in the champions league as players we expect to be there and so do the fans we know all the pressure is on us

7817113 thats a bit of hard one its just an interest in music i have always been into music when we were at school and hip hop came out i was always the person who had the stereo playing tapes it was just a fascination with music in my opinion its the djs who create the music at the end of the day they are defining whats happening when the scene took off i was already a dj i was already into house music or techno or whatever it was when it first came out it was never really an ambition like oh i wanna be a dj it just kind of happened simply because i was into music

7817164 we are continuing our commitment to moving the cost of selling an item on ebay co uk away from the front end insertion fee and increasing the final value fees so that the majority of fees are paid only when you successfully sell an item
7817165 ebay are now clearly taking massive advantage of their position as a monopoly by upping their final value fee to 10 per cent what is a real kick in the teeth is that they then go around advertising their new lower fees i am considering writing to monopolies commision
7817166 yeah isnt it terrible the way that ebay force you to sell your unwanted tat on their website
7817167 i think most old timers will leave and ebay and it will just turnover new sellers like a bad factory turns over new staff so eventually it will just be big sellers and odds and sods

7817200 the successful outcome of the study provides further rationale for the early use of azilect r among parkinsons disease patients
7817201 delaying disease progression is the most important unmet need in the management of parkinsons disease
7817202 the adagio study the first of its kind was prospectively designed to demonstrate if azilect r can slow down the progression of parkinsons disease results of the study show that early treatment with once daily rasagiline 1mg tablets provided significant clinical benefits that were not obtained by those patients where initiation of azilect r therapy was delayed by nine months

7817297 hemos debido salir varias veces de nuestras casas junto a nuestras familias y ni os ya que en los allanamientos la polic a act a violentamente y nos golpean injustificadamente sin respetar a nadie
7817298 es por ello que el gobierno junto con hacerse parte en lo procesos judiciales para aclarar los hechos debe trabajar m s activamente en la soluci n de las hist ricas y presentes demandas sociales particularmente sobre las tierras mapuche
7817299 manifestamos nuestra condena categ rica a este hecho de violencia y esperamos que se realice una investigaci n acuciosa transparente y con pleno respeto a los derechos humanos para determinar qui nes fueron sus responsables
7817300 no obstante hacemos un llamado a no estigmatizar al pueblo mapuche a ra z de este hecho como lo han manifestado algunas autoridades y exigimos que estos lamentables sucesos no constituyan una nueva carta blanca para continuar con la pol tica gubernamental de criminalizar las protestas y reivindicaciones mapuches que ha terminado en violentos procedimientos policiales con saldos de personas heridas y muertas

7817303 la situaci n que afecta a las familias de nuestras comunidades lafkenche y pescadores artesanales que no han negociado con celco es producto de una pol tica que ha desarrollado el estado chileno para salvaguardar los intereses de privados por sobre los derechos humanos consagrados en la carta de las naciones unidas y en todos los pactos firmados por chile como el convenio 169 de la o i t o la declaraci n de las naciones unidas para los derechos de los pueblos ind genas

7817320 encuentro por la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural traw n itrofillke che ka zugu g tramgealu
7817321 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
7817322 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
7817323 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
7817324 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
7817325 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos
7817326 aspectos jur dico pol ticos de la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural
7817327 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
7817328 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
7817329 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
7817330 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre
7817331 esperan que sea recordado por todos dando a conocer a arauco como una empresa que se proyecta hacia el futuro como un referente mundial en el desarrollo sustentable de productos forestales

7817335 we have not found any external links to simi in the execution of the blasts in ahmedabad and surat
7817336 possibly simis role behind the bomb blasts was overlooked while giving attention to the lashkar e tayiba the indian establishment went into slumber after banning simi
7817337 he said simi may not have done direct action like planning to kill so many people
7817338 senior officers are so busy normally that they read only the summary of such confessional statements in nagoris statement the mention of gujarat and rajasthan must be in the third paragraph of page number 17
7817339 we were unaware that he has mentioned any plans of subversive activities in rajasthan and gujarat we knew generally about the threat perception but nothing beyond that
7817340 in the absence of any other evidence i would think the gujarat police investigation is credible
7817341 i can tell you that we have enough evidence in this case to plead for death sentence for the culprits our investigations will withstand trial in any court
7817342 we have no doubt that the same group which planted bombs in ahmedabad was behind the surat bombs the technique used in it didnt work but the bombs were not kept to just scare the people they were meant to explode we know where these bombs were assembled in baroda
7817343 its easier to withstand and tackle external aggression because it unites indians internal subversion divides society
7817344 one should wait for more revelations from the police but we are in precarious times
7817345 the ongoing economic slowdown is certainly dampening consumer appetite and this will lead to further calls for the ecb to adopt a more accommodative approach over its monetary policy although the ongoing threat of high inflation could well ensure that rate cuts remain limited over the next 12 months
7817346 oh cool youre in japan you must have had a lot of experiences do you blog

7817355 politicians who are perpetuating the myth of the greedy geezer voter may want to rethink how they appeal to the important older voter even on the issue of social security the supposed third rail of american politics only 1 in 4 grandparents said they were voting their own interests its time that politicians understand that having been blessed with a long life we have great respect for the long term view
7817356 a grannyvoter is anyone whose voting decisions are influenced by the interests of their grandchildren and future generations according to our poll america is becoming a nation of grannyvoters led by a new generation of grandparents voters are thinking more long term than the politicians give them credit for

7817364 as the sherridon vms project advances we are expanding the program of assessing the six known deposits to test for new larger and deeper ore bodies we have been encouraged by hudbays recent success at lalor lake where testing of a geophysical target generated a 20 million tonne ore body that lies 800m from surface
7817365 the technology exists to find deeper and potentially larger deposits at sherridon where most of the drilling in the last 50 years has focused only on the top 150m
7817366 the dialogue has not been completed it is arrogant and reckless for anybody to come and address parliament mugabe is not mandated by anyone to address parliament nobody has the right to address parliament before talks are completed

7817402 it is only three months since the irish people voted on this and while labour campaigned strongly for a yes all parties and politicians have to respect the outcome there can be no question of simply putting the same question to the irish people once again in any event were there to be another referendum in the current climate i do not believe that it would be likely to produce a different result to the one the people gave on june 12th
7817403 indeed one of the results of minister roches comments may well be to create even more opposition to the lisbon treaty
7817404 other member states have to understand that the outcome of the referendum has created a problem not just for ireland but also for the entire eu
7817405 it is important that we work with other countries to see if these difficulties can be overcome but dealing with lisbon must not be allowed to become the sole pre occupation of the government at a time when we are facing so many other serious economic problems
7817406 people i meet when travelling around munster are far more concerned about the deteriorating economic situation the mounting job losses the rise in prices and the lack of infrastructure than they are in what is going to be done about lisbon

7817422 dai mim ce la devi fare sn al tuo fianco
7817423 creo que la evaluaci n final es muy buena y que la cosecha 2008 que hemos degustado ha sido excelente
7817424 con un promedio de 86 puntos lo que significa que la calificaci n general ha sido muy buena
7817425 en los ltimos a os se ha visto un incremento importante en la calidad de los vinos de la zona este por arriba de los 80 puntos de calificaci n desde el 2000 entre otras cosas por la mejor experiencia que muestran los t cnicos y la mayor inversi n en tecnolog a de las bodegas
7817426 tenemos que trabajar m s en la publicidad de la zona estamos alcanzando buenos niveles de calidad pero necesitamos que eso se conozca hoy la regi n est obteniendo buenas cosechas en varietales y el blanco escurrido ya no es la principal orientaci n de la producci n
7817427 quiero subrayar la presencia que ha tenido el tanat en esta degustaci n una variedad nueva que en la zona se adapta muy bien que puede ser usado en cortes y como varietal puro
7817428 nos jug una mala pasada las lluvias diluyeron mucho las concentraciones de las uvas e incluso ocasionaron problemas de botritis de todos modos hubo buenos resultados porque hemos ido adquiriendo experiencia para enfrentar estos problemas

7817439 the arguments used to encourage suffragists to work within the democratic party for peace sounds to me much like arguments today that pumas should stay with and vote the democrats as they are the only party to fully support womens reproductive choices
7817440 i have met parents who have brought their babies to counties like waterford and kerry to receive the vaccine the fact that babies in cork are denied a vital vaccine solely on the basis of the county in which they were born is totally unacceptable
7817441 the bcg vaccine is administered to newborn babies to prevent tb and a commitment was given that all newborn babies in cork would have access to the vaccine by october 2007 despite this promise almost a year later corks newborn babies do not have access to the vaccine and 10 000 cork babies are now on a waiting list for the tb vaccine
7817442 despite this the government and the hse continue to refuse to accept that a serious problem exists because of their mismanagement and refuse to make resolving this a priority
7817443 we expect loan losses to increase across all asset classes in ireland the uk and the us

7817449 it sounds like a lot of cars on the road for that time of the night and they were most likely returning from the weekend break
7817450 we believe that up to 10 cars were involved which includes those that swerved to avoid the crash then drove off
7817451 there was a diesel spill which is being cleaned away with other debris from the crash

7817459 weve made it very difficult for ourselves and its an overwhelming thought ive been there at blizzard since we started on world of warcraft and its been a very long and arduous journey and to think about taking that journey again with the starcraft franchise is a little scary
7817460 and so to look at starcraft and say well we could make an mmo out of that well yeah but how many years would we have to invest in it to create the quantity of content and the quality of experience that would be required to meet just the minimum standard thats set by the games that are out there right now
7817461 the courts reasoning is like saying that you can get away with murder if you pay the hit man with a check

7817465 chris had a very good 2007 world cup campaign in france and he is a player with a good kicking game and is strong in defence
7817466 this bizarre behaviour was alarming to the people who witnessed it
7817467 we are anxious to speak to anyone who saw the incident so that we can prevent it from happening again

7817470 she told them that it was not illegal to take photographs in a public place and she had not visited any secret areas or military installations they had no legal basis for holding her
7817471 i cant say whether their intention was to intimidate but if they can do this to an influential writer who has done nothing more than take photographs then one can only imagine the kind of threat that ordinary people in tibet must feel every day

7817480 the police must recognise that journalists have a job to do and allow them to go about their business there are clear guidelines laying out how the police should deal with the media and we expect these guidelines to be adhered to
7817481 we are looking into various legal avenues to challenge this unwarranted conduct by the police it is simply unacceptable for members of the press to be obstructed in their work in this way

7817507 last season i was fit towards the end that is the reason the boss brought me here
7817508 obviously there is a big season ahead for manchester united and england and i want to be fit and available
7817509 ive said before we suffered on the counter attack when other teams play a 9 1 formation if you score a goal it changes completely

7817513 os adeptos do d namo receberam com tristeza e indigna o as ac es dos dirigentes do zenit de s o petersburgo os m todos n o desportivos e desleais visam enfraquecer o nosso clube e levar para a sua equipa o jogador do d namo danny
7817514 teoricamente as ac es do zenit est o conforme a letra da lei mas n o devemos esquecer nos que o clube de s o petersburgo encontra se em condi es incomparavelmente mais vantajosas em rela o aos outros clubes

7817521 honey honey whats wrong are you sick are you hurt
7817522 ekim said that fear is one side of a coin the coin is your attitude towards the future
7817523 and choosing your attitude towards the future is the one thing a human being cannot escape from making even making no choice of attitude is choosing your attitude
7817524 ekim said he got this important truth from a book he read when he was a boy given to him by his teachers the book was titled mans search for meaning and was written by viktor frankl a holocaust survivor he wrote that when desperate times are pressed upon you the one freedom you have perhaps the only freedom you have is your choice of attitude
7817525 i wish it were more complicated than that but thats all there is to it you either choose hope or youre stuck in fear either way its your choice
7817526 you know what really helps me choose my way out of fear and into hope
7817527 only i like more space than this and the more people observing the better it helps me focus

7817529 i need to check my growth because i have a family
7817530 but is it that hard to change the bases on which relationships are founded if its that hard to talk your spouse into being 100 on your side while you try to climb mountains so that you both want it equally maybe you should take a good look at your relationship
7817531 i need to check my growth because i have a family
7817532 beloved i need to do something different living like this is killing me
7817533 that was when i realized i was really making a full article which is ironically the fitting comment that her article deserves lets see if we can help crack that damn egg wide open
7817534 i want to live my purpose therefore i become a life coach to help others live their purpose
7817535 where does moral decay go when theres nothing left to rot
7817536 what if instead of focusing all of my energies on my own goals something i was growing weary of i did a complete about face and turned to focusing all of my energies on others
7817537 in the beginning of this journey my wife april wrote most of the journals some where things that i told her and some where her own if i have never thanked her for the tireless support i do so now
7817538 well the last couple of weeks have been rough to say the least
7817539 april was fine and we final had a chance to spend some alone time and we had a lot of things to catch up on
7817540 there is an article about me in the san diego union tribune today and in it the reporter has given his opinion and then shared that my wife and i are getting divorced
7817541 no the muffins not eating me im eating the muffin

7817552 it doesnt mean much to be top after just two games but its good for us to have six points

7817562 lacqua appartiene a tutti e a nessuno pu essere concesso di appropriarsene per trarne
7817563 riguardo al diritto allacqua si deve sottolineare anche che si tratta di un diritto che ha un proprio fondamento nella dignit umana da questa prospettiva bisogna esaminare attentamente gli atteggiamenti di coloro che considerano e trattano lacqua unicamente come bene economico
7817564 lacqua sacra non solo perch prezioso dono del creatore ha scritto recentemente il vescovo di caserta nogaro ma perch sacra ogni persona ogni uomo ogni donna della terra fatta a immagine di dio che dallacqua trae esistenza energia e vita

7817574 the corporate ladder social status designer clothing lots of smart people couldnt care less some of them care more about world poverty global warming and political strife between nations on the other side of the globe
7817575 they falsely mistake most people as being more like them than they are
7817576 they take for granted the fact that everyone around them would be interested in similar things about the world
7817577 its ironic that just as regulators are breaking up one monopoly baa british airways and american airlines are trying to create another our results prove that customers want choice on transatlantic routes
7817578 what am i doing to improve my skills appearance education etc
7817579 i have but only of a little to add as a comment upon the authors theses of smart intelligence as for one comment i believe i understand the various points brought forward but disagree with the constituents as a whole that comprise his points smart is that of in learnt behaviour in other words it is replacing a judgment reaction to that of a thought out analysis whilst intelligence is a process of assimilation of known information compiles this into a mental data base for analysis with this analysis forms a library of choice for possible actions with this is also the ability to as new information is gathered to rationalize this as go or no go to then use these idea as a platform of tools for gain of that of means of gain to what ever is sought by the individual the word or concept of failure is not a working concept for it is not logical failure is simply the result of a process that did not produce to the expectation of the builder intelligence would then review the previous process for analysis of fault location detection take the now known fault re engineer for results then place into action for expected results if the fault is once again experienced then place the smart people in to the position of responsibility for them to receive the blame then go on to build some thing else that will offer a better chance of success
7817580 so often you can slip into a rut of getting it done you tunnel vision yourself into thinking a job or promotion pay raise or the grind is important living with passion means living in integrity with others but most of all with yourself it means no excuses

7817594 wow someone who can clearly articulate the struggles that anyone who is determined to be a success has
7817595 you poor smart talented person you are so persecuted in this world those ignorant fools out there one day you can leave them all behind in the meantime be miserable and try to make yourself feel better by increasing the amount that you hate and despise those stupid normal people
7817596 man i am so much better than that ape of a human being what a bafoon man i am glad i am intelligent enough to see that the things that make him happy or stupid vain empty meaningless things
7817597 happiness in intelligent people is the rarest thing i know
7817598 i smear myself in dog shit and eat it too
7817599 so what was your opinion of me when you first met me
7817600 it would seem to indicate that that would be the most effective solution

7817611 if you buy a 500 1978 pinto from your neighbor you cant very well sell it for 500 right you would have to sell it for say 700 but you cant sell it for 700 unless either a its worth 700 or b you take advantage of someone and make them think its worth 700 when its only worth 500 in either case you step on someone all business transactions must necessarily fit this pattern in order for you to make a profit
7817612 airstrikes on civilian targets uncoordinated house searches and illegal detention of afghan civilians
7817613 we can win fa and the carling cup theyre definitely the two chances we have
7817614 at the moment weve got a chance of winning the league but that may peter out as the season goes on it depends on how we play
7817615 if i talk about putting a strong side out i had my only 19 fit players against bolton at the weekend and one of those obafemi martins has picked up a groin strain
7817616 but i will put out the strongest team i can against coventry because it is a competition we have to take seriously and its going to be a tough place to go
7817617 it should be a good game coventry have started off well although i know they got beaten at the weekend
7817618 they started off with six points from two games and they have a guy i really respect in charge chris coleman who i brought to fulham
7817619 they are a club looking to build and go places with an ambition to be in our league
7817620 its a good test for us but its definitely a competition we will take very seriously
7817621 we want to go there to give a good account of ourselves and hopefully win i cant really afford to rest anyone
7817622 unlike the last time we went to the moon everybody is going to the moon now there are at least a dozen proposals i know of from various countries to go to the moon
7817623 this is going to open a new era of scientific understanding of not just the moon and the formation of the earth moon system but how we can live on another world
7817624 of the moon on the moon and from the moon
7817625 i think the way to sell it is that were going to the moon as a step beyond
7817626 the other is that the moon is an interesting enough place to stay as well people talk about exit strategies on the moon to touch base leave and go to mars i think thats dumb
7817627 if we can work in antarctica for 50 years and still want to go back and do more the moon also is at least as interesting as antarctica
7817628 theres still a lot of science to be done on the moon its a natural world with natural complexity
7817629 were never going to have a long term 50 year plus research base on mars if we cant figure out how to do that on the moon so lets figure out how to do it on the moon
7817630 the moon is hot or cool depending on what your generation is
7817631 but i dont think we have to go sell the moon i think it sold itself
7817632 but im here to tell you its not your fathers oldsmobile
7817633 with humans going back the lunar environment needs to be studied and studied well
7817634 if i were a betting man i would say the lunar program is here to stay
7817635 ive been trying to get nasa to adopt a mission statement of why were going to the moon not six themes not 182 different sub goals
7817636 were going to the moon to learn the skills we need to live and work productively on another world

7817687 entices us to construe the world as a spectacle as a set of significations to be interpreted rather than as concrete problems to be solved practically
7817688 to call these reflections on western reflections an inquiry suggests that the anthropological project can continue unabated with the same old desire for intellectual mastery of the object of study and the same old desire for the enigma of the powerful explanation but world history has decreed otherwise mastery is mocked as first world and other worlds now mirror interlock and rupture each others alterity to such a degree that all that is left is the excess the self consciousness as to the need for an identity
7817689 mastery is no longer possible the west as mirrored in the eyes and handiwork of its others undermines the stability which mastery needs what remains is unsettled and unsettling interpretation in constant movement with itself what i have elsewhere called a nervous system because the interpreting self is itself grafted into the object of study
7817690 to become aware of the west in the eyes and handiwork of its others to wonder at the fascination with their fascination is to abandon border logistics and enter into the second contact era of the borderland where us and them lose their polarity and swim in and out of focus

7817781 wed all love to see a screening test for ovarian cancer
7817782 we believe you are offering a high risk test that has not received adequate clinical validation and may harm the public health
7817783 we are hearing from people that they are very excited about it

7817788 we understand that concerns have been raised regarding the impact that f d a regulation would have on this whole field
7817789 too much of the dialogue has been on how good is the blood test
7817790 the rigorous trial design and the fact that all three primary endpoints were met with statistical significance reinforce the quality of the data supporting the potential for azilect to have an effect on disease progression
7817791 the successful outcome of the study provides further rationale for the early use of azilect among parkinsons disease patients
7817792 delaying disease progression is the most important unmet need in the management of parkinsons disease
7817793 the adagio study the first of its kind was prospectively designed to demonstrate if azilect can slow down the progression of parkinsons disease results of the study show that early treatment with once daily rasagiline 1mg tablets provided significant clinical benefits that were not obtained by those patients where initiation of azilect therapy was delayed by nine months
7817794 studiets grundige opbygning og det faktum at alle tre prim re endem l blev opfyldt med statistisk signifikans er med til at styrke kvaliteten af de opn ede resultater og underst tter s ledes potentialet for at azilect kan have en virkning p sygdomsudviklingen
7817795 de positive resultater i studiet underst tter tidlig brug af azilect til behandling af patienter med parkinsons sygdom
7817796 det at forsinke sygdomsudviklingen udg r det v sentligste ud kkede behov i behandlingen af parkinsons sygdom
7817797 adagio studiet som er det f rste af sin slags blev udformet prospektivt for at p vise hvorvidt azilect kan forsinke udviklingen af parkinsons sygdom resultaterne af studiet viser at tidlig behandling n gang dagligt med 1 mg tabletter rasagilin giver signifikante kliniske fordele som ikke blev opn et hos de patienter hvor behandlingen med azilect f rst blev igangsat 9 m neder senere

7817830 june 6 2008 reported that japans parliament passed a resolution recognizing the ainu and urging an end to discrimination against them
7817831 what i want from the government most is for it to accept its political responsibility for what they have done to us and apologize
7817832 while growing up in hokkaido i tried to hide my identity
7817833 i went to visit the indigenous people in canada when i was a high school student it was my turning point i was shocked to see how proud they were of their culture and tradition now i say proudly that i am ainu
7817834 i want the government to have the courage to admit that the ainu are indigenous to japan expert studies clearly show they were in the hokkaido area before us and co existed with nature there is much to learn from their lifestyle
7817835 are mentioned without identifying the experts for the most part
7817836 once we recognize them as indigenous people experts can move on to discuss their rights and demands
7817837 japans ainu hope new identity leads to more rights japans parliament identified the group as the countrys indigenous people on friday
7817838 but id also like the government to apologize and make way for the sake of the ainu people
7817839 you see so many place names on this land are from the ainu language

7817844 step on my what wow danny you seem to take this field thing too literally
7817845 we might even get there in one piece as long as my engine does not explode again
7817846 i think i might have lung cancer i dont know but i have been coughing up lots of blood
7817847 so danny tell me something you think i see these people as my property part of my personal collection
7817848 brilliant i always manage to offend the over sensitive sort
7817849 what i am saying is these are the people you are studying and i didnt mean to intrude to usurp are you able to follow
7817850 ok but maybe they will like you so very much that they will tell me to bugger off you know i think they get a choice about who gets to dig around inside their skulls
7817851 no i mean for the hosts we will be staying with today did you bring a little something
7817852 brilliant now i have to bribe my way past the door
7817853 oh well screw it man now we have to find some kind of shop we cant show up empty handed like some leeching scumbags
7817854 listen would you mind very much getting a bottle of rum
7817855 no but if i have to pay to enter i might as well get a return on my investment

7817859 ok then danny from now on i will call you danny2
7817860 what did you mean by real shaman a while ago
7817861 no well what i meant was you know you get some types who want to claim they are indigenous such and such and the whole eco botanical nature shaman thing is usually a tool some use to fortify their claim
7817862 ah yeah ok danny you see that i would make sure you keep that in your back pocket when you speak to moses because if there is one man who can sniff out a sniffer its him
7817863 max i coming down now you go have a sit
7817864 nah i just asking if to bring down some ice jackass
7817865 i want to learn more about the ritual and pharmacological aspects of native plants in communities such as yours and how that ties in with identity and issues of power especially with reference to theories of self actualization and practices of locality indigeneity and contested ideas of healing
7817866 so how is it that you want me to help you
7817867 well i heard that you say you are a shaman and
7817868 so to get started i am trying to develop an inventory of the plants that are most significant to your healing practice

7817873 moses laughs delighted at how much of the local parlance i want to adopt at any moment
7817874 so if i can ask where does your knowledge of the properties of plants come from
7817875 i get it from the great spirit and from dreams
7817876 you will need to wash your hands he just finish diggin by the latrine
7817877 so you dont learn about the plants from family or other shamans
7817878 no i learn about them from talking to animals too

7817920 it would be dishonest of me to remain silent after hearing the speech obama delivered on the afternoon of may 23 at the cuban american national foundation created by ronald reagan
7817921 throughout my entire life there has been injustice and repression in cuba never in my lifetime have the people of cuba known freedom never in the lives of two generations of cubans have the people of cuba known democracy this is the terrible and tragic status quo that we have known for half a century of elections that are anything but free or fair i wont stand for this injustice you wont stand for this injustice and together we will stand up for freedom in cuba
7817922 its time to let cuban american money make their families less dependent upon the castro regime i will maintain the embargo
7817923 presidential candidate obamas speech may be formulated as follows hunger for the nation remittances as charitable hand outs and visits to cuba as propaganda for consumerism and the unsustainable way of life behind it
7817924 no small and blockaded country like ours would have been able to hold its ground for so long on the basis of ambition vanity deceit or the abuse of power the kind of power its neighbor has to state otherwise is an insult to the intelligence of our heroic people

7817956 today we honor the indigenous peoples of this land the oldest continuing cultures in human history
7817957 we reflect in particular on the mistreatment of those who were stolen generations this blemished chapter in our nations history
7817958 the time has now come for the nation to turn a new page in australias history by righting the wrongs of the past and so moving forward with confidence to the future
7817959 we apologize for the laws and policies of successive parliaments and governments that have inflicted profound grief suffering and loss on these our fellow australians
7817960 we apologize especially for the removal of aboriginal and torres strait islander children from their families their communities and their country
7817961 for the pain suffering and hurt of these stolen generations their descendants and for their families left behind we say sorry
7817962 to the mothers and the fathers the brothers and the sisters for the breaking up of families and communities we say sorry
7817963 and for the indignity and degradation thus inflicted on a proud people and a proud culture we say sorry
7817964 we the parliament of australia respectfully request that this apology be received in the spirit in which it is offered as part of the healing of the nation
7817965 a welcome to country acknowledges our people and pays respect to our ancestors the spirits who created the lands
7817966 the legal landscape is no different to what it was yesterday or will be tomorrow
7817967 its quite a statement its of great significance monumental its a special moment for the country its inspirational and sets a very high standard
7817968 we hope that canadas apology that was promised in the recent speech from the throne will be as significant and as full as sincere as the australian governments apology
7817969 use this occasion to make a statement of apology to close this sad chapter in our history
7817970 statement of regret rather than a full and sincere apology

7817981 the big white chief come to enlighten his little african brothers
7817982 the tragedy of africa is that african man sic has never sufficiently entered into history the african peasant who for millennia has lived with the seasons whose ideal of life is to be in harmony with nature knows only the eternal recommencement of time in rhythm with the endless repetition of the same gestures the same words in this imaginary where everything always begins anew there is no place for the adventure of the human spirit nor for the idea of progress in this universe where nature commands all african man escapes the anguish of history that grips modern man but he remains immobile amidst an immutable order in which all seems written in advance never does he launch himself towards the future never does the idea occur to him that he might break with repetition and invent his own destiny
7817983 believed they were fulfilling a civilising mission believed they were doing good they were wrong but they were sincere
7817984 colonisation is not responsible for all the difficulties of africa today
7817985 the call of liberty of emancipation and justice and of equality between men and women it is the call to universal reason and to consciousness
7817986 no one can ask todays generations to expiate the crimes of past generations
7817987 this need in which i myself believe so much this need to believe rather than to understand to feel rather than to reason
7817988 i may say that there has been terrorism but the terrorism has emanated from the police not from anybody else
7817989 i have advised the commissioner that i am unable to authorise the prosecutions that have been sought under the terrorism suppression act
7817990 i think the police position is that they have used the terrorism act excessively particularly in opposing bail and possibly leading the people of new zealand to think that there was terrorism by these people
7817991 that has now been belied by the solicitor general in a decision that i think is adroit and i think is objective and i think a very wise decision
7817992 what should happen now as i understand it is that these people should be released on bail and their particular cases should be dealt with according to law
7817993 because i think just having the association with the word terrorism and all of the connotations that come with that with the terrorist acts that happen globally around the world to have that associated with your family and your name has a huge effect
7817994 the people of tuhoe particularly feel like that this operation was directed at them
7817995 ive got some work to do to build bridges there and i acknowledge that
7817996 but in terms of this being a serious risk i stand exactly behind what i did and i expect the people of new zealand would support me in that
7817997 he announced on the first day terrorism and he has not been able to prove it
7817998 he employs kaitakawaenga maori police officers who work in places like ruatoki
7817999 he had the opportunity 18 months ago to say guys i think theres something going on in here get in there and find out it could have been all over and done with inside two or three weeks
7818000 the boss of that operation of that unit the maori liaison officers wasnt even told until the operation had started
7818001 commissioner broad said himself on day one i stake my reputation on it hes blown it he should go
7818002 theres a lot of ill feeling at the present moment theres a lot of anger their mana has been affected
7818003 it is time now in my humble opinion for a reconciliation for the police to apologise and for the police to make recompense so that this can be amended and the mana of the police as well restored
7818004 how dare they arrest tame iti what are the charges that he is leading a terrorist organisation this is bullshit
7818005 the apology will be made on behalf of the australian government and does not attribute guilt to the current generation of australian people

7818028 for tolstoy weber points out science makes death and therefore life itself meaningless in earlier times before the advent of modernity life gave people everything it had to offer so that they lived their lives in full and were ready to go when the time came with the rise of science however what the world has to offer always extends beyond the individuals life span so that finite human lives are now caught up in the infinite march of progress and inevitably remain unfulfilled under such circumstances death has no meaning it can no longer be considered as the natural closing of the life cycle but appears instead as an abrupt and timely end

7818064 when they come to me they often present with another pressing problem such as depression or drug or alcohol abuse or maybe a suicide attempt
7818065 but when you peel off the layers oftentimes the real cause is the abortion that happened in the past
7818066 our society and culture tells us that abortion is now legal and acceptable so why should it cause pain
7818067 and yet those who are involved and a lot of men are also affected feel that their reactions are not normal so they dont seek help their loss is real but they havent been allowed to grieve
7818068 it looks like the combination of high pressure off the coast and the movement of the remnant low will cause a lot of moisture to come up from the gulf
7818069 the center of the system will probably go north of the sumter area but therell be plenty of moisture coming in here
7818070 its a slow moving system and it looks like its going to bring periods of scattered showers and thunderstorms through wednesday
7818071 fays remnants are going to hook up with a front in the north and it could produce heavy rainfall in the north georgia and western carolina mountains

7818094 what i know is that over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition st augustine said at three months we dont know
7818095 you shall not procure an abortion nor destroy a newborn child
7818096 and therefore the following question may be very carefully inquired into and discussed by learned men though i do not know whether it is in mans power to resolve it
7818097 i do not see that which you say must be believed
7818098 in our case a murder being once for all forbidden we may not destroy even the fetus in the womb while as yet the human being derives blood from the other parts of the body for its sustenance to hinder a birth is merely a speedier man killing nor does it matter whether you take away a life that is born or destroy one that is coming to birth that is a man which is going to be one you have the fruit already in its seed
7818099 the environment is stimulating and entertaining and theres less fear of falling over
7818100 after a stroke or fall many older people lack motivation and confidence and they dont feel steady on their feet so getting out and about can be an issue and they can find the whole process rather dull
7818101 i can see it working very well on improving strength endurance and stamina
7818102 consistency and practice are key to making progress and this system has huge potential across a wide range of activities which can be tailored to meet individual rehabilitation needs
7818103 the vast majority of stroke survivors cannot use a normal treadmill because they are not in control
7818104 walking is the best possible exercise for their bodies and this system would help enormously
7818105 she cant go to law enforcement and tell them the truth because she doesnt want to get her friends in a jackpot because theyve already lied to law enforcement
7818106 the issue is to get the little girl back call law enforcement get immunity tell them you lied and say heres the child go get her
7818107 just as we were walking out i covered her up and she stopped me and you may notice we stopped for a brief moment and she told me in my ear that she wanted me to take the umbrella down and she said to me jose im innocent and im going to walk out of this place with my head held high we were about to do that and you all bombarded us you could have had all of the photographs you wanted
7818108 i discussed certain things with the family and what weve decided that if there are any channels or media outlets that continue that type behavior or violate their privacy by coming on their property basically crossing the line and i think you are all adults and you know what crossing the line is and what aggressive reporting is and things like that is
7818109 that is not going to happen any more if you do we will cut off that channel from any interviews and any statements and that channel can get their news from another channel if you want to be on that blacklist or whatever you want to call it continue that type of behavior we are just not going to put up with it we dont have to put up with that
7818110 i didnt know if they were going attack us or what they were going to do

7818112 not just about themselves but about the direction of the country as a whole and theyve got good reason to be worried the fact is the economy is not working for ordinary americans
7818113 when you say the fundamentals of the economy are sound and your top economic adviser is saying youve become a nation of whiners then you dont get it
7818114 youre out of touch and youre not hearing the stories of ordinary americans who are working hard everyday but feel like their just treading water and in some cases sinking
7818115 john mccain has a compelling biography he served america with bravery and distinction and he deserves respect for that
7818116 but his policies dont deserve respect his ideas dont deserve respect because theyre the same old ideas weve seen out of george bush for the past eight years
7818117 the most important issues for me are affordable health care and getting out of the war
7818118 it is just to let people know there are people in town who like sen mccain
7818119 anyone who has been infected with the chickenpox virus is at risk of developing shingles and about 95 per cent of canadians have been infected by the age of 15
7818120 shingles is a disease that starts with a painful skin rash and can lead to weeks months or even years of severe debilitating nerve pain shingles is common unpredictable and very distressing for both those who get it and their families until now there was no way to prevent shingles so the new vaccine is a welcome development

7818212 when the user mouses over a book a contextual popup comes up containing information about the book and a set of associated actions part of the popup is a button menu sort of like a button and combo box widget that allows the user to provide information about what he or she did with the book the first thing to note is that combination of a button in a menu is not standard yet it makes sense because it saves a click for the most important action secondly the menu is effectively a popup within a popup which is a big no no in the classic world but works well in this context the elements of the menu are not buttons but check boxes which allow multiple selection another violation of classic user interface elements but which works very well in this context what is remarkable is how intuitive this gadget is you are interacting with it in the context of a book and each choice is simple and clear such clarity and simplicity was never present in the old interfaces clearly this new approach to uis is great and early adopters are loving it but will it cross over to the mainstream

7818522 dont thank me for only doing what i cant help doing you are thanking me for loving you i love you i have always loved you even when you were hundreds of miles away and we were both living other lives with other people i loved you
7818523 it isnt as simple as that for me thats all i love you you know that i do i have for a long time but it was different for me back then i didnt see you in that way really until i came home and we started dating
7818524 i just cant say that i know it the way that you know it or that i can commit to you the way you are asking me to
7818525 since we are all about thank yous thank you for last night
7818526 lets leave these open the whole time we are here
7818527 i was thinking it would be really nice if we just went to bed
7818528 sure lets stay in its late anyway are you feeling ok are you over tired do you need anything
7818529 you are hyper feminine and i dont even think you realize it
7818530 look at you sitting here all in white the strap of your dress knows exactly when to slip off your shoulder and your laugh is like a little dance how do you do that without even trying you are delicate and arent afraid to be feminine i love that about you
7818531 you are thinking too much sweetheart just let me love you
7818532 i did say i was getting you ready for bed didnt i
7818533 you really have no idea how much i love you or how desirable you are or what you mean to me do you
7818534 kiss me back or tell me to stop tell me you dont want me and ill stop
7818535 i dont know liam i just dont know what i want or need i dont know how i feel im scared
7818536 i dont want you scared or hurting not because of me can you let him go can you leave him out of this and give me a chance to love you like you deserve to be loved where is he tonight
7818537 i want you to say it to tell me so we both hear it and then you can decide if he needs to be here too where is he
7818538 yes hes gone and hes with l isnt he maybe right this second he is holding her like i am holding you dont think for a second you are sitting in that room the way youve allowed him into ours
7818539 he released you he let you go didnt he what does that tell you dont let him take what you are free to give what he doesnt want or need anymore
7818540 look this is it this is that feeling that i dont like the one that makes me take a step back into that place you have pulled me from this is why he isnt mr right why do you insist that he is why have you given me to this man time and time again when i have said he isnt my future
7818541 i still have some of that residual fall out of not understanding why anyone would feel that way about me

7818545 its whether or not the public has a right to be involved
7818546 the no 1 priority for the bush administration aside from logging has been to reduce public accountability
7818547 the united states seeks to shield from judicial review certain rules that bar the public from participation in federal management decisions affecting national forests
7818548 we can confirm that five members of kings troop royal horse artillery london have provided positive samples following their units recent testing as part of the armys drug testing programme
7818549 positive rates in the army over the last three years average around 0 8 compared with over 7 in civilian workplace drug testing programmes in the uk
7818550 one of the purposes of our research is to develop better designs for precast concrete buildings
7818551 this is really important to our industry because well be able to develop structures that can resist natures most difficult loads including earthquakes
7818552 we conducted tests from lower seismicity all the way to higher seismicity and shook the building stronger and stronger each time with a higher intensity
7818553 since that time we have been working to come up with designs that will make these structures survive a northridge earthquake or stronger
7818554 we are only able to perform physical experiments on that one structure but if we can show that our models capture important response properly we can run hundreds of earthquake simulations a year for the cost of a graduate student a fast computer and a software license which at around 50 000 is substantially less than the costs of these kinds of tests
7818555 the englekirk center is very important to the research community and to the industry because it has an outdoor environment where we can perform large scale tests that cant be done anywhere else in the world
7818556 right now theres not much you can do about the vector so it is all a matter of management
7818557 the wheat curl mite is found on volunteer wheat and many different grasses and is blown in the air by winds
7818558 very rarely did you find triticum without wheat streak mosaic
7818559 i really need to survey everywhere i can this year
7818560 in calculating the counties with wheat acreage infected in the northern panhandle early diagnosis could save as much as 9 million for producers by eliminating wasted irrigations
7818561 we werent testing for triticum at that time so it is also a factor to be investigated
7818562 we have the potential to save producers billions of dollars in wasted irrigation and fertilizer costs
7818563 the main time people irrigate in this area is in the late spring and summer during grain fill and heading
7818564 we want to catch it before then if not in the fall
7818565 if we treat all of the lettuce and spinach then theres going to be a very rare instance of exposure to illness causing microorganisms
7818566 whats sad is that the fda after a nearly nine year review selected only two products involved with the massive illnesses in 2006
7818567 i suspect it will take awhile for the supply chain to get into place because of the limited number of irradiation facilities in place in the u s
7818568 these facilities are relatively expensive to build so you have to make sure you have adequate product flow and a market for that product
7818569 it would have to be new construction thats for sure
7818570 we wouldnt expect any immediate adoption and in fact industry wont move forward unless they are sure there wont be a backlash from consumer activists the other issue is that there is a lot more product now being labeled organic and you cannot irradiate products labeled organic
7818571 theres been a lot of research done on that and basically products that have treated with irradiation are as good or better after 14 days typical travel time than those that havent
7818572 we now know that in order to kill e coli on this type of product we can turn down the dosage level the power of the beam effectively and lettuce and spinach remain just as crisp and wholesome as if you grew it yourself
7818573 the american consumer has shown willingness to purchase irradiated products such as strawberries and meats once consumers understand the food safety implications their unfounded worries about the safety of the cold pasteurization process are eliminated even though there are a lot of naysayers and anti irradiation people giving inaccurate information
7818574 the experience with ground beef is that consumers have not reacted negatively to the label
7818575 the only negative reaction is to price it costs more
7818576 in 2006 there were an estimated 50 billion servings of green leafy salads served in this country and there were approximately 1 200 people made ill
7818577 the odds of getting a food borne illness from produce are already extremely low based upon the number of servings that we see but what we have to recognize is that irradiation is one more tool we can use to ensure the safety of our products this is especially important for at risk populations immune compromised folks pregnant women children under the age of eight and elderly these people are at high risk for food borne illness and it may be useful to feed them greens that have been irradiated for that last margin of safety
7818578 the real importance of this rule is that produce companies wouldnt even look at the technology unless the government approved it the new fda rule makes them more inclined to take a fresh look at it
7818579 our immediate goal is to launch the official beachcare web site www beachcare org to inform educate protect and celebrate the worlds beaches
7818580 i love the beach and am thrilled to work in the nonprofit and environmental fields
7818581 this effort will unite psds and western with a very influential group of global movers and shakers in the name of environmental education and responsible coastal management
7818582 the bottom line is that airgun noise from seismic surveys that are thousands of yards distant does not drive away sperm whales living in the gulf
7818583 however some individual whales feeding at depth reduced the rate at which they searched acoustically for their prey when scientists carried out controlled exposure experiments by bringing seismic surveys close by the whales as a result the oil and gas industry has agreed to a best practice attitude that seismic surveys should shut down temporarily when towed airguns come within one third of a mile of whales or groups of whales in the gulf
7818584 sperm whales go to where their food source is and that means very deep water so folks that do see them are marine mammal observers who ride the seismic survey vessels and the workers on the big oil and gas rigs and even that does not happen often
7818585 we now know that the sperm whales in the gulf appear to be their own distinct stock they show genetic and social differences from other sperm whales around the world
7818586 there are believed to be about 500 to 1 500 sperm whales that reside in the gulf
7818587 the five year study has greatly contributed to our knowledge of sperm whales especially those found in the gulf of mexico its also raised new questions we need to know more about such as their feeding and breeding patterns theres still a lot we dont know about these huge creatures
7818588 our dna analysis corroborates what the historical sources say namely that vanilla was a trade item brought to tahiti by french sailors in the mid 19th century the french admiral responsible for introducing vanilla to tahiti alphonse hamelin used vanilla cuttings from the philippines the historical record tells us that vanilla which isnt native to the philippines was previously introduced to the region via the manila galleon trade from the new world and specifically from guatemala
7818589 the pre columbian maya had been managing their forests for millennia to cultivate cacao and to make chocolate and we know they were also cultivating vanilla to use it as a chocolate spice the maya created these forest gardens by introducing different types of species of wild cacao and vanilla from the surrounding forests which meant that species that had previously been geographically separated were then able to hybridize because they were in the same place thats the scenario we present in our research paper for how tahitian vanilla got started it is an evolutionary product but also a maya artifact
7818590 pesach has demonstrated that vanilla species can exchange genes quite frequently across species barriers
7818591 this provides an opportunity to breed new commercial varieties of vanilla through hybridization in the future
7818592 we have scale and infrastructure it almost beggars belief what they are trying to do
7818593 i dont think there is anyone in the world that could open 200 stores by the end of 2009
7818594 use what ive got bit longer it still works great
7818595 the boards are pleased to announce that they have reached agreement on the terms of a recommended pre conditional cash offer for the entire issued and to be issued ordinary share capital of imperial energy
7818596 cest vraiment bizarre de savoir que certains professeurs portent des armes
7818597 parce que nous avons d j des portes ferm es et des cam ras
7818598 les professeurs sont form s pour assurer linstruction de mes enfants et non pour porter une arme les officiers de police eux m mes ont besoin de plusieurs ann es de formation pour g rer les prises dotages
7818599 je ne veux pas que mes enfants se retournent en se demandant qui est arm
7818600 lorsque vous interdisez les armes dans une certaine zone les seules personnes qui sy conforment sont les citoyens respectueux des lois
7818601 il est injuste de demander aux enseignants dassurer des fonctions suppl mentaires en devenant officiers de police
7818602 i am however tibetan before i am dalai lama and i am human before i am tibetan
7818603 every new donor matters every new organ donor has the potential to save a life
7818604 i encourage missourians to consider becoming organ donors when they renew their license
7818605 the new organ donor symbol is an ideal way to draw attention to our states invaluable life saving program as well as the new law gov blunt signed making it easier than ever before to become an organ donor
7818606 while the nfa is tasked to ensure food security and stability of the staple food the farmers as our partners in the program are allowed to do the rice distribution under certain rules and regulations
7818607 rice being sold under ifad are no longer considered nfas but the farmers
7818608 all empty sacks used for the rebagging are even marked ifad program in bold letters to distinguish them from the issuance under the regular distribution original empty sacks recovered from rebagging shall be retained by nfa
7818609 its disappointing that each year we see a small minority of mainly young men who dont come to the carnival until later
7818610 they dont come to enjoy the floats and the music they come to fight and commit acts of violence we have seen serious incidents in previous years
7818611 one success from this was stopping a car with two people in possession of a taser and a baseball bat and we believe they were intent on taking them into the event
7818612 despite taking significant number of potential troublemakers off the streets and seizing dozens of weapons a small minority still managed to marr the end of what had been a largely good natured and peaceful two days of celebrations
7818613 the number of arrests is up on last year but that is predominantly because of proactive policing
7818614 the message is that there is no place for knives at the carnival
7818615 we share the concern of londoners over the recent spate of knife
7818616 as a former resident of ladbroke grove i have watched the notting hill carnival go from strength to strength each year to become an internationally acclaimed event
7818617 nothing beats the sounds of the steel pans the aroma of delicious caribbean food and the dazzling colours of the costume parade
7818618 the carnival is the perfect london spectacle to captivate the world with its dazzling array of costumes and music

7818624 its extremely important just to keep making forward progress rather than trying prematurely to come to some set of conclusions
7818625 we continue to have the same goal which is to reach agreement by the end of the year
7818626 there is no doubt that we seek peace and we are trying to seek our goals and there wont be peace without the release of all prisoners
7818627 this is a great joy for our mothers and our people but it remains a small step because we left behind us thousands of prisoners
7818628 its not easy to release prisoners especially prisoners that were involved directly in terrorist acts against innocent civilians
7818629 are looking at every family and background friend of the suspects and they will continue to do that until they hopefully capture these individuals

7818632 the conventional wisdom has it that part of the reason obama chose biden is that biden is a working class hero from scranton pa
7818633 but theres a problem with that one of the biggest afflictions faced by working people in addition to the threat of foreclosure is the iron grip of credit card debt and joe biden is known as the senator from mastercard mbna since he is from delaware one of the industrys two low tax homes the other being south dakota
7818634 american banker magazine offered up this scenario last week obama picks biden and then wins the election biden leaves the senate and gives up his seat as head of the senate foreign relations committee biden is succeeded as head of foreign relations by chris dodd of connecticut now head of the senate banking committee who has lately been pushing for new restrictions on the card industry dodd in turn gives up his seat running the banking committee so he can run foreign relations he is succeeded as banking committee chairman by drumroll please tim johnson of south dakota south dakota is perhaps the most card industry friendly state in the country as lenders have domiciled their banks there in order to operate under its lenient banking laws

7818645 this was our private matter and i frankly wanted it to be private because as painful as it was i did not want to have to play it out on a public stage as well
7818646 the question for her as well as for him is what is their foundation
7818647 their big challenge is convincing people that they will continue to be active in politics and theyre going to continue to have a voice
7818648 an imperfect man with a truly progressive vision who spoke to and for those whom others ignored yes that is who i supported
7818649 an imperfect man who had come to face his own imperfections and was seeking to redeem himself to those closest to him yes that is who i supported
7818650 she knew president with this bomb waiting to go off she did she kinda loses my sympathy
7818651 i believe we are all owed a huge apology not self serving claims for pity by both john and elizabeth edwards who both knew about the affair and both decided to go forward and seek the democratic candidacy regardless of the titanic risk
7818652 there was anguish excruciating anguish for her in dealing with this
7818653 she was angry and furious and everything but at one point she had to make a choice do i kick him out or do we have a 30 year marriage that can be rebuilt
7818654 i thought it was very naive on both their parts
7818655 it would be very sad if he were the nominee of our party

7818658 the establishment of the latino a studies minor is part of ongoing efforts in the college to ensure programs are relevant for todays student and our rapidly changing world
7818659 im pleased our curriculum reflects current population trends and vast social and political effects of the largest minority on contemporary american culture
7818660 it signals an interest and training in issues having to do with what is now statistically the largest minority group in the u s so of course it would be very valuable to a wide variety of career paths that require knowledge of the diversity of u s cultures
7818661 one thing that makes ku different i would argue is the extent of our emphasis on latin america as a component of latino studies which traditionally has been u s centered
7818662 with the market hardening under the daily hammer blows of worsening economic news one would expect more volatility within the list

7818711 die gesetzliche verpflichtung jede arbeit annehmen zu m ssen zeigt ihre fatale wirkung in der lohnabw rtsspirale
7818712 die so genannten volksparteien spd und union spalten das volk in arme und reiche die privatisierung ffentlicher einrichtungen und die hartz gesetze f hren zu armut trotz arbeit und sie zwingen die gewerkschaften in die defensive
7818713 was jetzt noch nicht zu tage tritt ist dass damit auch die rentenerwartung f r zuk nftige rentnerjahrg nge sinkt w hrend im oecd durchschnitt ein arbeitnehmer der heute 1000 euro verdient eine rente von 730 euro zu erwarten hat sind f r ihn in deutschland ganze 400 euro rente vorgesehen damit ist millionenfache altersarmut gesetzlich programmiert das ist ein skandal dass unter diesen voraussetzungen der private konsum das deutsche wirtschaftswachstum nach unten zieht wie vom statistischen bundesamt heute bekanntgegeben ist nicht berraschend in einer solchen situation muss die regierung handeln sie muss die infrastruktur ausbauen die lohnpolitik muss wieder darauf ausgerichtet werden dass sich die einkommen entsprechend der produktivit t und der preissteigerungen entwickeln die gesetze die wie hartz iv zum lohndumping einladen m ssen ge ndert und der allgemeine gesetzliche mindestlohn endlich eingef hrt werden
7818714 dass die koalition die einf hrung eines allgemeinen gesetzlichen mindestlohns und die deutliche erh hung des arbeitslosengeldes ii mit verweis auf fadenscheinige argumente unterl sst ist weder christlich noch sozial das ist einfach nur sch big ein mindestlohn dass zeigen unsere europ ischen nachbarn kostet keine arbeitspl tze und eine starke volkswirtschaft kann sich ohne weiteres menschenw rdige sozialleistungen leisten

7818717 dass verkehrsteilnehmer die wegen trunkenheit im verkehr also nach 316 des strafgesetzbuches verurteilt werden zus tzlich die fahrerlaubnis entzogen bekommen oder mit einem fahrverbot belegt werden h ngt mit ihrer potentiellen gef hrlichkeit f r andere verkehrsteilnehmer zusammen
7818718 auch wenn es hier um strafen f r unkorrektes verhalten geht muss der gehandicapte in der lage bleiben seinen praktischen alltag meistern zu k nnen
7818719 das k nnen zum beispiel alkoholbedingte fahrfehler sein landl ufig als ausfallerscheinungen bezeichnet
7818720 dies ist wichtig um unverh ltnism ige folgen der trunkenheitsfahrt erst gar nicht entstehen zu lassen fahrerlaubnisinhaber k nnen darlegen dass sie die ihnen abgesprochene eingung zum f hren von kraftfahrzeugen fr hzeitig wiedererlangt haben
7818721 i started painting with coffee because i wanted a cheaper medium that was accessible to me
7818722 when i was a councillor i had a telephone in my house for council business and to use my computer
7818723 the bill for that went to the council when i was appointed as chairman of nhs highland i asked if that line could be transferred to the health board to the best of my knowledge that was what happened and no bill for it ever came to my house i knew nothing about it until about four or five weeks ago when i was contacted by the council after this internal review
7818724 i was not aware of it and if there is a bill for me perchance i will pay it but i have my own phone in the house it is not a problem
7818725 the bill for the phones is sent to the council
7818726 the phones were only for council business and some members would have them in their studies they were separate from their personal landline phones
7818727 one of the reasons for it was the debris that accumulated on the fence itself
7818728 since the accuseds arrest and wide scale media attention the accused became a symbol of ridicule by the public and had to relocate from his home in chatsworth to phoenix a suburb 40km away
7818729 its a squad that i am happy with because i know that all the players are ready to play for the first team when called upon
7818730 some of the players who havent been involved as much recently will get a chance against arbroath but i havent decided on who that will be yet
7818731 weve had them watched over the previous two weekends and i know one or two of the players at arbroath as well as the manager john mcglashan
7818732 we played arbroath in my first game after coming back nearly a year ago and it would be nice if we could get the same result but we will really need to put on a performance because for arbroath this will be their cup final
7818733 the game against hamilton accies was disappointing but thats gone now
7818734 on saturday we played a very good hibs team so to get a point was not a bad result at all
7818735 my only disappointment was that we didnt hurt hibs at all in the second half if we had played the way we did before half time then we would have sent the fans home happy
7818736 jamie is in the first team simply because i believe he is good enough
7818737 in the likes of steven fletcher hibs have one of the best young players in scotland but jamie acquitted himself well and certainly stood up to the test
7818738 being the sponsors of inverness caledonian thistle for flybe is about giving the community unique and once in a lifetime opportunities that wouldnt normally be within reach after the successful flybe community footie festival that we sponsored for primary school teams and held at the club in march we thought that a competition for adult football teams was only fair the club was very keen to help us make the idea become reality and we are now about to give one set of local footballers a day to remember
7818739 the be a pro footballer for the day competition is a fantastic opportunity for an amateur team to learn about the workings of a professional outfit it will be a rare insight into how the team trains in the run up to a game with warm up coaching amp tactics the processes and prep required pre match and even a team talk with the gaffer
7818740 the organisers at strathpeffer pavilion approached fabienne about sponsoring the show
7818741 and she offered to sponsor quite a number of the shows on this tour with these boxes i hope there is one left over for me
7818742 she is feeling very sorry for herself all on her own and wondering what she has done with her life
7818743 as she leaves the office she is thinking that she wishes she had some chocolate she recalls hearing an old man interviewed on the radio who said when asked if he had any regrets that he wishes he had had more sex and she thinks im with him on that one but id have said more chocolate too
7818744 its a good fun romp and a wee bit different from some of ronas other scripts for me
7818745 its very bizarre and fantastical but underneath that there is a lot that people can identify with in terms of the way we feel about ourselves as we get older
7818746 ive always suspected that rona is really a film writer
7818747 i remember asking her when she wrote this how exactly she saw all these locations working and she just looked at me and said well thats your department i just write it
7818748 so basically i have a chair and thats it years ago i worked with an actor named george byatt in a company called theatre pkf and he used to say that we dont need all the paraphernalia of sets and costumes and all the rest of it when in doubt simplify was his motto and that is what we have done so the audience have to use their imaginations and it seems to work funnily enough i had very good reactions from a couple of young teenagers at a show recently which i wouldnt have expected
7818749 when david cameron acquired the building it gave us an opportunity to buy it and change the service provision and try and improve the facility which was a bit of a tough task
7818750 the building was 34 years old at that stage and was looking a bit tired and weary
7818751 these facilities are extraordinarily expensive to run but for me from a community point of view we have got to have these facilities in a city it is just nonsense not to it is a facility that should be in every city and they are becoming few and far between
7818752 where that stands us for the future looking at some of the energy costs being banded about we are pretty apprehensive and a bit nervous about the whole situation especially because it is an old building which is generally inefficient
7818753 we are trying to look at the economics who we can get into bed with we own the building and the land so we have a valuable asset
7818754 i would expect to have an independent ice skating facility alongside an independent curling facility
7818755 two facilities would take that pressure of time away and allow us to give users a much better service
7818756 a lot of these things are holding us back at the moment
7818757 some of those experiences are still not as we would like them to be but we are getting closer
7818758 i want people to come here and have a really nice time
7818759 i have been surprised excited and pleasantly shocked by these comics that are extensions of the songs that i have loved and therefore welcome these amazing stories of pictures and words because they are uncompromisingly inspiring
7818760 it shows you thought is a powerful formidable essence and can have a breathtaking domino effect

7818769 the operation went completely according to plan and the doctor expressed confidence in her excellent result lechaschy doctor bill one of the best in the world specialists in this field of medicine but even he could not yet say whether the voice heard on kaulittsa continue
7818770 he wants to sing well he gestures made it clear that he could immediately after the operation was rushed to the microphone
7818771 initially the operation was planned for monday but for medical reasons it was decided to hold on sunday
7818772 this is a very sensitive time for all our communities and we are working hard to ensure everyone is kept up to date with as much information as we can give
7818773 it can increase the sickness and morbidity of the patient
7818774 patients should insist that doctors and nurses in the hospitals who are attending to them wash their hands before they examine the patients
7818775 as the us refused to carry out the agreement a grave obstacle to the settlement of the nuclear issue on the korean peninsula has been created
7818776 secondly we will consider restoring the yongbyon facilities to their original state in accordance with strong demands from our relevant agencies
7818777 it would be a big mistake if the us believes that it can carry out a search of our home as it did in iraq as it pleased
7818778 when the six party talks have degenerated into a circus where the strong bullies the weak as it pleases whats the use of the six party structure
7818779 verification is a duty to be carried out by every party that should come at the last stage of the denuclearisation of the whole korean peninsula
7818780 has been pressing us to accept inspections in which they may visit wherever they want collect samples and take measurements as they please
7818781 in breach of our sovereignty and which subsequently caused us to leave the nuclear non proliferation treaty
7818782 the us is making a robber like demand that it will carry out unilateral inspections of us throwing away the denuclearisation of the korean peninsula in which the removal of the us nuclear threat is at the centre
7818783 we dont mind staying in the list of countries which are not humbled by the us
7818784 i was at a party in palo alto on saturday night two doors down from steve jobss house and in the morning i was coming out with my bike and walked right in front of him on the sidewalk
7818785 pretty thin i thought his face looked healthy but he was very thin
7818786 maybe we should have had a discussion before policy is sic put out there publicly
7818787 the basis is right its how you get there and there are some people who have great difficultly in organising a 12 year old to get to school when they dont want to go to school
7818788 they choose to stand up for particular oil companies instead of standing up for australian families who need lower interest rates
7818789 its going to be very interesting indeed where the credibility stakes now hang in this place in terms of those opposite and their behaviour in the senate as they begin to launch their assault on this nations best fiscal preparedness for what will be uncertain global economic times ahead
7818790 trading is the mechanism upon which the creation of the grid depends
7818791 from where it is to where it is needed most
7818792 what the average household wants to do is turn on the tap and have the water flow unlike farmers that use their water as an input to production and industry for whom this issue makes sense it makes no sense to the average person
7818793 while moves have been made to enhance environmental flows for the yarra in recent years their application has been delayed as the government has sought to deal with the effect of drought conditions on consumptive supply
7818794 water is not like electricity that can you can beam it into a place it is this tangible real thing if you take it out of a place the footy team may die or the last remaining fish population might disappear

7818798 i want people to understand who we are as a family what our values are
7818799 we have these fake queues at front of 20 stores around the country to drum up
7818800 im delighted to welcome such a diverse group of member companies
7818801 the expansive nature of our membership continues to reflect the transformation of our industry and the broadening of abms footprint
7818802 ian is not in the frame for the ospreys head coach he is under contract with the nzru

7818804 acho que o formato acabou impedindo o aprofundamento de algumas quest es perguntas n o foram respondidas ficou se mais no discurso do que no debate para o futuro da cidade faltou se debater um projeto mais consistente o projeto pol tico que cada um defende mas a iniciativa boa o primeiro debate e acho que a campanha que vai esquentar daqui para frente
7818805 o certo seria evitar a participa o ativa das claques n o sou contra a exist ncia delas mas desde que sejam controladas pelos candidatos que as contratam ou as trazem
7818806 foi uma bela promo o da cat lica o povo do recife teve mais uma oportunidade de conhecer o hist rico e as id ais de cada um
7818807 s vezes com pouco mais de calor mas natural imposs vel realizar um debate deste sem que o clima n o aque a em algumas situa es mas nada possa ter comprometido a festa democr tica
7818808 independentemente dos problemas que ocorreram no decorrer do debate foi muito positivo a gente conseguiu colocar o que era fundamental aquela senhora atrapalhou um pouco e o tempo foi curto para se desenvolver id ias mas em s ntese a minha candidatura conseguiu passar o nosso esp rito e os eixos centrais da campanha
7818809 teve aquela senhora que atrapalhou depois vi que n o era provoca o
7818810 the vast majority of reported crime was as a result of the stop and search powers we were using
7818811 although we had a few assaults reported they werent serious
7818812 we had intelligence to suggest that people at the oval were from a variety of gangs and that they were on their way to the carnival to commit crime engage in disorder and potentially violence
7818813 these gangs were throwing bottles at police officers some members were arrested for substantial offences such as possession of weapons others were detained to prevent a further breach of the peace
7818814 we had concerns that if we let them go on their way they would cause crimes and mayhem
7818815 its disappointing that each year we see a small minority of mainly young men who dont come to the carnival until later
7818816 they dont come to enjoy the floats and the music they come to fight and commit acts of violence we have seen serious incidents in previous years
7818817 for two hours our officers came under attack from bottles bricks and any debris that was on the ground
7818818 these were officers who had been working hard all day
7818819 so whats disappointing is these people are intent on fighting but innocent members of the public get caught up in it and their carnival is spoiled
7818820 one success from this was stopping a car with two people in possession of a taser and a baseball bat and we believe they were intent on taking them into the event
7818821 not only is that a concern for the dogs themselves but it causes people fear and the dogs are used by gangs as a badge of honour and to intimidate others
7818822 as a former resident of ladbroke grove i have watched the notting hill carnival go from strength to strength each year to become an internationally acclaimed event
7818823 nothing beats the sounds of the steel pans the aroma of delicious caribbean food and the dazzling colours of the costume parade
7818824 more than a million people had a great time at the notting hill carnival and enjoyed an amazing spectacle of colour energy and music
7818825 the bank holiday weekend was the culmination of a series of successful carnival events during the month of august
7818826 ive been very impressed its been lively and colourful and people are really enjoying themselves
7818827 the tragic shooting of the toddler rashid rullah highlights once again the terrible consequences of the
7818828 this culture results in easy access casual regard and non accountability
7818829 the adults who own these guns are rarely held to account
7818830 there is no law requiring them to store their weapons safely nor is there any record of ownership
7818831 the government cannot hide behind recent changes in legislation which failed to take the airgun problem seriously enough and make owners responsible for storing their weapons safely
7818832 airguns and their owners could be registered and they should be
7818833 it just highlights how vulnerable people are in the presence of weapons and guns
7818834 people have died as a result of airgun pellets so they are dangerous weapons if not used in a safe environment
7818835 rashids sister is really active and she got hold of the gun and pointed it at her brother
7818836 he was on the high ground and she was on the low ground it hit him right in the middle of the back of his head
7818837 everybodys in shock there are no words to describe it really
7818838 an 18 month old boy today remains in a critical condition in hospital with a serious head injury after what appears to be a tragic accident on sunday afternoon at the youngsters home in birmingham
7818839 as a parent of three youngsters i know that beyond doubt this is every parents worst nightmare
7818840 no matter the circumstances everyones prayers and thoughts should be with little rashid and his family they will be going through absolute hell
7818841 an imperfect man with a truly progressive vision who spoke to and for those whom others ignored yes that is who i supported
7818842 we have a requirement in our constitution to assure that every child grades k 12 has access to a free and public education so that is the primary responsibility of state government and state government needs to be focused on doing that every year
7818843 we are getting absolutely no help from the state not a penny not a dime and a few years back we were getting 40 percent from the state

7818849 that is one of the drivers in the changes that we made
7818850 these are things that we can do right now for the customer
7818851 they may have been changes that we would have made but not necessarily as quickly as we are doing now
7818852 hondas been a fuel economy leader for an entire generation because we bake in good fuel economy at the design stage
7818853 we just really paid attention to detail in fuel economy
7818854 all these little things you start to get a half percent here a percent here you add these up its that attention to detail thats whats given some of our competitors in the past the japanese an advantage
7818855 weve combined all that were going to overtake them or equal them
7818856 availability of mortgage deals remains the biggest issue for borrowers who do not have equity in their homes
7818857 those who have benefited from the decade long housing boom can still qualify for the most competitive rates
7818858 however first time buyers or those who have entered the property market recently will struggle to qualify for the most competitive rates

7818861 maybe we should have had a discussion before policy is sic put out there publicly mr adams said
7818862 a lot of points and concern about the policy during the meeting
7818863 the basis is right its how you get there and there are some people who have great difficultly in organising a 12 year old to get to school when they dont want to go to school he said
7818864 a lot of us are uncomfortable about this policy but it was a rudd labor commitment and kevin rudd confirmed that yesterday that its a promise he will be keeping she told abc radio today
7818865 i think its fair to say there is a great deal of concern within the caucus
7818866 its a pretty extreme organisation thats got extreme powers that doesnt confront anybody else in australian society he said
7818867 i dont think we need to keep this at the extreme end of where it is at the moment i think we should be able to wind that back somewhat before 2010
7818868 a federal government committed to workplace rights has no justification for keeping the abcc until 2010 greens senator rachel siewert said
7818869 the greens will not shrink from defending the basic human rights of workers including those in the building and construction industry

7818872 trotz der fortschreitenden eintr bung der konjunktur wird die entwicklung auf dem arbeitsmarkt zun chst weiter freundlich bleiben allerdings werden die zuw chse bei der besch ftigung deutlich geringer ausfallen als bisher zum jahreswechsel hin wird der besch ftigungsaufbau dann wohl ganz zum stillstand kommen insgesamt wird der zuwachs an arbeitspl tzen in diesem jahr mit einem plus von rund 2 500 nur etwa halb so hoch ausfallen wie in 2007
7818873 durch st ndige scharm tzel zwischen bund und l ndern um zust ndigkeiten in der bildung l sst sich eine bildungsrepublik deutschland nicht gestalten

7818878 zweitens muss auf den tisch des bildungsgipfels das thema bildungsinvestition
7818879 der investitionsbegriff muss zugunsten von bildung modernisiert werden deshalb dringt der vbe auf eine nderung des grundgesetzartikels 115

7818910 die studie unserer partnerorganisation t amp e zeigt trotz einiger erfreulicher entwicklungen bleibt die autoindustrie weit hinter ihren zielen zur ck
7818911 noch 1998 hat der verband der europ ischen automobilhersteller acea versprochen den co2 aussto von neuwagen bis 2008 auf durchschnittlich 140 g km zu senken dieses versprechen hat er gebrochen ganz im gegenteil bek mpft die europ ische autoindustrie allen voran die deutschen autobauer hartn ckig alle vorschl ge der eu f r verbindliche grenzwerte
7818912 man sieht jetzt dass auch hersteller von premiumwagen den verbrauch ihrer modelle deutlich reduzieren k nnen diejenigen die vorher in sachen klimaschutz am schlimmsten versagt haben holen nun am schnellsten auf
7818913 bmw hat nach jahrelangem stillstand eine sehr schnelle letzte runde zur ckgelegt es bleibt aber noch viel zu tun in absoluten zahlen ausgedr ckt hat sich bmw damit n mlich nur vom vorletzten auf den drittletzten platz verbessert und schneidet mit einem co2 aussto seiner neuwagen von durchschnittlich 170 g km noch immer viel schlechter ab als der europ ische durchschnitt wenn aber der konzern in den kommenden jahren den co2 aussto in hnlichem ma e reduziert wie 2007 wird er seine klimaziele anders als etwa vw oder daimler schaffen
7818914 wenn man die top ten der umweltfreundlichsten familienautos betrachtet sieht man welcher flottenverbrauch jetzt schon m glich ist sie sto en im durchschnitt gerade mal 125 g km co2 aus und liegen damit weit unter dem urspr nglich von der industrie versprochenen zielwert von 140 gramm f r 2008 die hersteller sollten also endlich aufh ren gegen grenzwerte zu k mpfen sondern ihre kr fte daf r einsetzen alle ihre autos sparsamer und effizienter zu machen

7818919 his late arrival has made things quite interesting and quite exciting the last week or so
7818920 but hes come in and weve given a fair opportunity to all and he has shown himself to be able to do some things just a little bit different than some of the other guys
7818921 finally after all this after all the surgeries and setbacks finally i can move past it and do something that i want to do
7818922 i think the guy will do a great job of managing our team and the team has responded really well to him and thats where we are going
7818923 weve worked extremely hard over the last two weeks and im proud to be a miami dolphin
7818924 you could feel the momentum leave the team after joe got hurt
7818925 he was a junior but he was certainly one of the team leaders plus he was our quarterback thats a tough situation to be in
7818926 he just told me to work hard and do what i need to do to get back on the field and how you cant really think about what could have been just focus on upcoming season
7818927 i dont know whats going to happen i would assume that hell probably say no and if thats the case so be it ill get some practice today and tomorrow well be ok
7818928 i dont know if three or six plays although i would like to do that i dont know what you get out of that really
7818929 ive never really thought about injuries and im not saying osi did think about it but i saw the tape
7818930 that was meant to be i mean its very unfortunate for him and for the giants but it wasnt like guys rolled up on him that probably wouldve happened in practice at some point the way it occurred he just went down injuries are part of it they come in a lot of different ways
7818931 ive played so many games and not that i havent been injured but ive overcome injuries been lucky in a lot of situations
7818932 this is 18 years whatevers going to happen is going to happen i cant control that i love to play and thats really all i can think about

7818934 were hoping that deion branch can get back but you just never know the timing so theyre moving me around
7818935 weve opened up the offense and freed up the younger guys outside it just gives us more of an option from game to game
7818936 i have to find out what the fits going to be he played pretty well
7818937 the only reason i even saw the ball was because kelly jennngs was yelling d d d
7818938 but if i would have saw the ball there is no question i would have scored i am going to get grief for a whole week they gave me grief as soon as i got off the field
7818939 it was a good feeling to see beltre hit that ball
7818940 hes hit in bad luck all year and hit two line drives tonight that were caught
7818941 i tell him around the batting cage all the time how much he means to us the way he keeps getting after it adrian is banged up but hes physically one of the toughest players ive ever seen play the game
7818942 my wife was having our first child and then there were some complications both for her and our daughter
7818943 its been an up and down ride all year but its been a good roller coaster ride
7818944 we think he could pitch again by saturday or sunday
7818945 then when rosters expand sept 1 we can get him back
7818946 with the giants i asked for my release i didnt see a fit there it wasnt working
7818947 this organization gave me an opportunity to pitch and get to the big leagues which is all i wanted
7818948 everyone understands that we need to become more competitive and i am confident tyrone will be what it takes to make that happen
7818949 i want to see significant improvement in the way they play

7818957 if any middle class white male i come across says he wants to enter television i say give up all hope theyve no chance
7818958 is this evidence of some male conspiracy keeping women down
7818959 he lists five women because he couldnt possibly name all the men in positions of power in tv because he would be there all bloody day
7818960 thats what youre up against its that sort of assumption

7818997 whether the brightest galaxies in clusters grew substantially in the last few billion years is intensely debated our observations show that in this time these galaxies have increased their mass by 50
7818998 most surprising is that in three of the four groups the brightest galaxy also has a bright companion galaxy these galaxy pairs are merging systems
7818999 the stars in these galaxies are already old and so we must conclude that the recent merging did not produce a new generation of stars
7819000 most of the stars in these galaxies were born at least 7 billion years ago
7819001 just occasionally you come across a book that reflects part of your own life and experience in a way that makes you stop and say yes that is the way i remember it happening this is one such book
7819002 this is a very significant book that succeeds in capturing the essence of a period of huge change in the way we look at intellectual property and commons the word revolution is overused but id suggest that it might be appropriate to apply it in this instance more than this keltys solidly focused text offers an effective roadmap for the deeply convoluted raw material that defines this period providing a detailed and well crafted reference for future investigators
7819003 ci sono state un paio di cose che nel primo episodio non abbiamo potuto fare a causa del budget ma anche perch allo studio sembravano eccessive in questo secondo episodio le inseriremo
7819004 abbiamo speso un po di pi aspettatevi quindi un miglioramento in tutto e sappiamo come utilizzare al meglio i soldi che abbiamo anche grazie al produttore ian bryce che la nostra arma segreta
7819005 basarsi sulla lunghezza dello script porta a fare errori perch le sequenze dazione sono molto pi lunghe nella realt che sulla pagina stiamo cercando di rimanere intorno alle due ore ma credo che alla fine sar come il primo film
7819006 transformers aveva tre trame un ragazzo e la sua auto soldati dietro le linee nemiche e la politica di difesa della popolazione la struttura e i paradigmi erano quelli di un film catastrofico sotto multipli punti di vista il secondo film avr una struttura e dei paradigmi diversi saranno come storie parallele
7819007 ritorno al futuro jurassic park incontri ravvicinati e terminator 2
7819008 ci siamo messi a simulare lo stile dei vecchi film della amblin come gremlins o ritorno al futuro cosa che oggi come oggi molto divertente inoltre anche il cartoon era divertente lo stile da commedia poi rende laudience molto pi ampia
7819009 in realt eravamo preparati al peggio ma michael bay si cos arrabbiato a causa delle fughe di notizie per il primo film che decise di mettere in giro false informazioni addirittura dicendo in giro che noi sceneggiatori non sapevamo nulla dei personaggi di stavamo scrivendo il che decisamente doloroso e assurdo ovviamente
7819010 il primo film tutto a proposito del mistero e della rivelazione dei transformer sia come concetto che come specie il che significa che dovevamo nascondere i robot per la prima ora
7819011 uno dei temi riguarda le responsabilit che affronti quando resti lontano da casa lo vediamo nel personaggio di sam che va al college ma anche nei transformers che sono lontani da cybertron
7819012 i rumour non sono esattamente veri e venuto qui ha letto lo script se n andato giorni dopo lo abbiamo incontrato per parlare delle sue lamentele ed stato facile lui non voleva essere identico al personaggio che interpreta sempre e noi gli abbiamo detto che potevamo differenziarlo ci siamo lasciati con risate e sorrisi e sono iniziate le trattative con i suoi agenti ma abbiamo stabilito che non riuscivamo a ottenere condizioni vantaggiose per tutti a volte colpa degli impegni altre volte un attore vuole apparire in un solo film alla volta in questo caso non ci sono stati litigi o dissapori
7819013 due modalit di robot sono un po troppe per il secondo film ma chiss
7819014 e venuto in mente allaltro sceneggiatore il mio socio alex kurtzman ed stato lunico che abbiamo messo sulla copertina dello script

7819020 license to merge special precautions may be required to preserve ip licensing rights
7819021 despite a long history of case law relating to mergers one area remains unclear especially in the entertainment industry the effect of mergers on intellectual property
7819022 the practice of having contracts transfer as a matter of law even if prohibited by the express terms of the contracts without consent may no longer be reliable in the context of transferring ip content and licenses while the impact of a merger on the assets of the parties to the merger is governed by state law ip licenses are also governed by a body of statutory and judicial federal law more recent case law points to a trend of ip law starting to impact how traditional state merger laws treat ip rights as different than that of other assets however the trend is neither uniform nor consistent
7819023 whether a merger effectuates an automatic assignment or transfer of license rights is a matter of state law
7819024 unlike the last time we went to the moon everybody is now there are at least a dozen proposals i know of from various countries to go to the moon
7819025 this is going to open a new era of scientific understanding of not just the moon and the formation of the earth moon system but how we can live on another world
7819026 of the moon on the moon and from the moon
7819027 i think the way to sell it is that were going to the moon as a step beyond
7819028 the other is that the moon is an interesting enough place to stay as well people talk about exit strategies on the moon to touch base leave and go to mars i think thats dumb
7819029 theres still a lot of science to be done on the moon its a natural world with natural complexity
7819030 were never going to have a long term 50 year plus research base on mars if we cant figure out how to do that on the moon so lets figure out how to do it on the moon
7819031 the moon is hot or cool depending on what your generation is
7819032 but i dont think we have to go sell the moon i think it sold itself
7819033 but im here to tell you its not your fathers oldsmobile
7819034 with humans going back the lunar environment needs to be studied and studied well
7819035 if i were a betting man i would say the lunar program is here to stay
7819036 ive been trying to get nasa to adopt a mission statement of why were going to the moon not six themes not 182 different sub goals
7819037 were to learn the skills we need to live and work productively on another world
7819038 its not the next nasa program it is not an entitlement to the it is not a rocket building program it is a strategic direction

7819050 existen constelaciones de hechos matem ticos que se prestan para hacer de ellos una novela bien interesante me pregunto si el tiempo malgastado en muchos de nuestros rollos magistrales en los que tanto abundamos los profesores de matem ticas de todos los niveles no podr a invertirse con gran provecho en contar pausadamente alguna de estas historias apasionantes del pensamiento humano

7819077 no pact or an agreement should be set without being based on full sovereignty national common interests and no foreign soldier should remain on iraqi land and there should be a specific deadline and it should not be open
7819078 there is an agreement actually reached reached between the two parties on a fixed date which is the end of 2011 to end any foreign presence on iraqi soil
7819079 any decisions on troops will be based on conditions on the ground in iraq
7819080 that has always been our position it continues to be our position

7819083 the cause of this mishap was pilot error both men failed to clear their flight paths and did not recognize their impending high aspect mid air collision
7819084 they were doing maneuvers we do every day thousands of times in all of our air combat command flying aircraft
7819085 it was a different set of circumstances but it opens the question of whether jivanjee totally understood those closure moments

7819091 the thing that really upsets me the most is that training is run by contractors
7819092 no matter who wins the election it doesnt matter its not going to stop
7819093 the air force has increased the sheer volume of pilots put through the training pipeline and shipped them off to war with the bare minimum training required
7819094 have come directly from basic training as their first exposure to the professional workforce
7819095 this is stuff we can correct through training stuff that happens between the ears

7819119 there has been this decline in the number of loans approved in the last six months it is down to a very quiet housing market and partly driven by people not wanting to borrow in the context of house prices falling
7819120 the monthly numbers of approvals for house purchase which have fallen by some two thirds over the last year levelled off in july
7819121 it would however be premature to think that the housing market will now start to recover because overall approval activity continues to be very low
7819122 we supplied over 140 megawatts of power to 32 venues across the city and the power did not falter once
7819123 about 30 35 staff were on hand to ensure the closing ceremony was broadcast without a blip on sunday
7819124 we supplied power to 44 television companies transmitting the olympic spectacle to fans back home
7819125 we are in the process of handing out gold medals to 150 staff working out there in stifling heat and humidity then after the paralympics we will roll up the 450km of cable and ship it back to the rest of the business
7819126 we are already on site supplying nine megawatts of power for the construction of the athletes village for london 2012
7819127 but the olympics are actually only a relatively small part of our revenue of 407m

7819151 auf eine echte tiefe rezession deuten die zahlen nicht hin daf r ist einfach die lageeinsch tzung der unternehmen gerade im verarbeitenden gewerbe noch viel zu gut
7819152 das minus im zweiten quartal geh rt mit dem enormen plus im ersten zusammen
7819153 alle unsere modelle sagen wenn berhaupt dann nur ganz leicht unter null vielleicht minus 0 1 oder minus 0 2
7819154 dass der aufschwung jetzt nur f r ein quartal unterbrochen ist und wir sofort den neuen aufschwung sehen werden
7819155 insofern ist nicht davon auszugehen dass wir vielleicht schon in den n chsten ein oder zwei monaten eine bodenbildung sehen
7819156 das wachstum k nnte insgesamt einen kleinen tick unter 2 liegen
7819157 die ezb hat ja ein signal gesetzt dar ber hinaus besteht momentan kein handlungsbedarf
7819158 dass wir den h chsten inflationsberg jetzt langsam erreicht haben
7819159 es ist allerdings auch kein aktionismus angesagt die zinsen zu senken
7819160 eine wirtschaftspolitische strategie die glaubw rdig auf mehr besch ftigung auf preisstabilit t und auf eine nachhaltige steuer und abgabenentlastung der b rgerinnen und b rger setzt ist der schl ssel um den aufschwung zur ck zu gewinnen

7819162 der wachstumsr ckgang im zweiten quartal zeigt dass die konjunktur in deutschland derzeit einem ernsten internationalen belastungstest ausgesetzt ist der andauern wird
7819163 um so mehr muss es jetzt darum gehen die zuversicht und das zukunftsvertrauen der verbraucher zu st rken

7819170 five years ago he might have taken the job and spent most of his time with xs and os
7819171 but hes learned that programs are built on a foundation
7819172 he has always been players coach he has the ability to get the kids to give you everything theyve got
7819173 but he knows it doesnt much matter how much football you know if you cant get the kids to play hard
7819174 if we had the same head coach all four years we would have won more games
7819175 we have spent a lot of time learning new things and new terminology
7819176 im glad they named coach dinwiddie ive known him for four years
7819177 i am a very loyal person ive been with these guys all four years even though i didnt have control of the program
7819178 god has a plan for everybody sometimes we have to be humbled to become a better person that happened to me

7819181 he has run the weight program so all of the guys know him
7819182 he is a much better coach than he was years ago
7819183 right now there is a team that is flying underneath the radar but is going to have a great year
7819184 hes a weight room junkie hes a speed training junkie he sets the bar when it comes to offseason workouts its made him a good player and hes going to get better
7819185 the power that correlates with track and football theyre one and the same
7819186 i realized i had underestimated the rift among democrats the moment i walked into monday mornings breakfast for florida delegates and saw a table full of campaign buttons every one of them for hillary clinton
7819187 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
7819188 feel an obligation to the people who sent them here
7819189 we were not all on the same side as democrats but we are now
7819190 to discuss ways in which his foundation is addressing some of the worlds most pressing problems
7819191 president clinton understands this is sen obamas convention and he is here to do all he can to make sen obama our next president
7819192 were talking about the nominee for the president of the united states
7819193 there are people who are not going to vote for him because hes black
7819194 and weve got to hope that we can educate people to put aside their racism and to put their own interests no 1
7819195 aziel faison really stepped up he is a special back and david highsmith rushed for 120 yards thats depth in the backfield like we havent had before
7819196 the green hope kids played hard and steve katz is doing a great job coaching them but it isnt a great team now
7819197 you cant win with seven turnovers against a really great team
7819198 he played at an intensity level that ive never seen matched
7819199 i feel very blessed to have the chance to coach him

7819206 our preparations for the tournament went well and we managed to get the two sponsors who have already paid the rentals for the venue

7819208 i am sad at their poor performance it was indeed below our expectation our best olarewaju durodola in mens heavy weight was indeed unfortunate to have met a cuba who sent him packing
7819209 i am proud of all the athletes and their supporting team officials as well as the secretariat staff for the working night and day to assist the team
7819210 however i want to praise all the twenty four medalists from football taekwondo athletics for etching their names in the olympic record book
7819211 you are all worthy ambassadors of our great country you not only came but saw and conquered

7819213 he has been granted a gift which amounts to a new state of conscience and being he has been set on a path which tells him he is really going somewhere that life is not a dead end not something to be endured or mastered in a very real sense he has been transformed because he has laid hold of a source of strength which in one way or another he had hitherto denied himself he finds himself in possession of a degree of honesty tolerance unselfishness peace of mind and love of which he had thought himself quite incapable what he has received is a free gift and yet usually at least in some small part he has made himself ready to receive it

7819383 dos tesis se enfrentan en occidente sobre la actitud a adoptar frente a rusia unas explican que conviene apaciguar el oso ruso otras afirman que hay que contenerla las voces de los primeros se oyen sobre todo en la vieja europa los segundos son mayoritarios en estados unidos y en gran breta a as como en polonia y en los dem s pa ses que han estado bajo el yugo sovi tico en el siglo xx para los primeros el inter s de europa ser a establecer las menos malas relaciones posibles con un pa s que es su principal abastecedor en hidrocarburos los segundos explican que s lo la fuerza o por lo menos una muy gran firmeza obligar a los rusos a no ir demasiado lejos el debate no se ha acabado pero ya no cabe duda de que europa tenga un problema ruso en su art culo del 18 de agosto en le figaro nicolas sarkozy preguntaba si la intervenci n de rusia contra tbilissi era una respuesta brutal y excesiva en este caso singular o si inaugura un nuevo endurecimiento de mosc respecto de sus vecinos y de la comunidad internacional entera lo que tendr a inevitablemente consecuencias sobre su relaci n con la uni n europea ah est el reto de la cumbre europea que francia convoc el lunes que viene en bruselas

7819386 b lgica muestra cierto escepticismo y se pregunta qu m s se puede decir tras la reuni n de los ministros de exteriores celebrada el pasado 13 de agosto sobre la crisis georgiana en la que se decidi evaluar la situaci n el 5 y 6 de septiembre tanto en el mbito diplom tico como sobre el propio terreno el lunes 1 de septiembre habr que encontrar un consenso sobre una posici n com n por lo que a partir de hoy se activar toda la maquinaria diplom tica europea para elaborar un texto antes de iniciarse la cumbre
7819387 puede que con esta iniciativa el presidente sarkozy haya querido satisfacer la demanda de polonia y de los estados b lticos que deseaban una reuni n urgente sobre georgia pero todo indica que sarkozy tambi n se marca el objetivo de reforzar la presi n sobre mosc en todo caso la ue pretende levantar su voz ayer el portavoz de angela merkel thomas steg record a los responsables rusos los intereses econ micos rec procos que ligan su pa s a europa
7819388 mosc sube el list n mientras la ue busca una nueva pol tica rusa
7819389 al convocar una cumbre extraordinaria sobre georgia y el futuro de las relaciones con rusia el presidente de la ue en ejercicio nicolas sarkozy tiene como objetivo organizar una frente com n evitando tanto los discursos inflamados como una dispersi n de posiciones que ampliar el margen de maniobra de mosc polonia pidi ayer uniformizar y endurecer la posici n ante mosc alemania el pa s m s vinculado a rusia est en el centro de las atenciones ngela merkel desminti la perspectiva de un enfriamiento de las relaciones con mosc pero avis al kremlin que no podr dictar la pol tica de georgia o de ucrania berl n parece buscar simult neamente evitar la ruptura con mosc y adoptar una posici n de firmeza
7819390 por un lado el poder o moscovita da pocas posibilidades a la otan de ir m s all de la guerra de palabras por otro la precipitaci n en el reconocimiento de la independencia de kosovo parte de serbia como osetia del sur y abjasia son de georgia suscita ahora criticas fundamentadas de la existencia de dos pesos y dos medidas en las chanciller as occidentales no se puede en un momento afirmar que la autodeterminaci n de los pueblos es m s importante que las fronteras y en el otro defender lo contrario el buen sentido com n y la prudencia siempre fue la base de la diplomacia portugal en esta materia ha actuado con inteligencia no se apresur en reconocer a kosovo y por ello tiene margen para defender el derecho internacional en los balcanes como en el c ucaso

7819396 hay un dicho en bruselas si un pa s grande vota en contra de un tratado europeo la ue tiene un problema pero si es un pa s peque o el que lo rechaza el problema lo tendr ste esto es lo que ahora le pasa a los irlandeses unas nuevas negociaciones sobre el tratado de lisboa resultan inimaginables puesto que har an fracasar definitivamente todo el proyecto de reforma a esto cabe a adir que el proceso de ratificaci n ha concluido en muchos pa ses y que en los dem s se encuentra ya muy avanzado por lo tanto irlanda est cada vez m s aislada ahora el ministro de asuntos europeos en dubl n ha dado a entender por primera vez lo que en las dem s capitales llevan tiempo anunciando los gorriones desde los tejados los irlandeses tendr n que votar por segunda vez como ya ocurri en otra ocasi n cuando rechazaron el tratado de niza esto no es una buena soluci n porque con ello queda menospreciada la voluntad del pueblo que se hab a manifestado mediante un procedimiento con forma jur dica tampoco se trata de una soluci n segura puesto que permanece incierto si los irlandeses estar n dispuestos a cambiar de opini n debido a las peque as concesiones que se les pretende hacer
7819397 dick roche ha hecho al estado y a sus votantes un considerable servicio p blico argumentando que ser a necesario celebrar otro refer ndum sobre el tratado de lisboa dadas las consecuencias pol ticas del decisivo voto negativo de junio roche hablaba en su nombre no en el del gobierno al rechazar la idea de legislar el tratado en su totalidad o en parte a trav s del parlamento despu s de un voto de la soberan a popular pero tiene raz n en subrayar la urgencia e importancia de lo que est en juego para la posici n internacional de irlanda

7819400 el se or obama ha empezado bien seleccionando al se or biden quien durante d cadas ha desarrollado sus destrezas en pol tica internacional el vers til se or biden traer tambi n su famosa superficialidad a lo que ya es una campa a en la que los candidatos se dan codazos eso podr a ayudar o da ar a la causa dem crata dependiendo de su habilidad de evitar meteduras de pata cuesti n por la cual tambi n es conocido
7819401 m s que ning n otro candidato que hayamos visto en a os obama tiene la habilidad de inspirar esperanza y un sentido de ilimitadas posibilidades para gobernar especialmente en tiempos tan dif ciles un presidente necesita ofrecer las dos cosas para ganar la presidencia primero tendr que aclarar hacia donde quiere llevar al pa s

7819403 al elegir al compa ero que presentar esta semana en la convenci n nacional de los dem cratas barack obama ha tenido que decidir lo bien o lo mal que su campa a hacia la presidencia se est desarrollando si todo se desarrollara como estaba planeado habr a buscado un compa ero capaz de manejar un estado m s disputado al nombrar a joe biden obama decidi que su campa a estaba viva pero no totalmente bien con una experiencia de d cadas en el congreso biden es senador por delaware un estado fiel a los dem cratas y un pol tico muy conocido en ee uu aporta experiencia en un rea vital de los problemas nacionales que es considerada como una de las debilidades de obama y no menos importante el estilo de hacer pol tica de biden puede vigorizar la campa a mientras que obama es reflexivo biden es espont neo y directo
7819404 el parido dem crata puede despertar algo de euforia en denver esta semana pero una oscura nube de ansiedad se cierne sobre la convenci n del partido
7819405 la sombra de hillary clinton presente en la convenci n
7819406 el xito de la convenci n dem crata depende en medida de si barack obama puede firmar la paz con hillary clinton y los 18 millones de dem cratas que la votaron la convenci n se inici la noche pasada en denver con un discurso de michelle la mujer de obama el desaf o para obama es grande para conseguir cerrar las filas debe superar una fuerte resistencia seg n recientes sondeos de wall street journal m s de un 20 de los seguidores de hillary prefieren votar a john mccain antes que a obama sobre todo son las mujeres blancas mayores de 50 a os las que no aceptan a obama piensan que obama se ha colado y deber a haber dado la oportunidad a clinton de convertirse en la primera mujer presidente en pisar la casa blanca
7819407 la duma se dirigi ayer al presidente de rusia dmitri medvedev con el ruego de estudiar la cuesti n del reconocimiento de las rep blicas de osetia del sur y abjasia en calidad de estados independientes y soberanos en la apertura de la reuni n plenaria de la c mara su presidente boris grizlov declar que la amenaza real de genocidio contra la poblaci n de osetia del sur y abjasia hace que el planteamiento de la cuesti n del reconocimiento de independencia de estas rep blicas sea actual y leg tima
7819408 el presidente de la duma resalt que hay que concentrarse en el desarrollo de la colaboraci n internacional a trav s de la diplomacia parlamentaria y utilizar todas las posibilidades para explicar la posici n rusa a nuestros socios extranjeros y confrontar el actual flujo de falsedades y desinformaci n
7819409 los miembros del consejo de la federaci n votaron ayer un nimemente como nunca antes lo hab an hecho en la agenda del d a figuraban dos puntos principales aprobar dirigirse al presidente de rusia para que reconozca la soberan a de osetia del sur y abjasia y autorizar el incremento del contingente de los soldados rusos de pacificaci n en estas rep blicas el presidente del consejo serguei mironov manifest estamos obligados a apoyar la aspiraci n de los pueblos de osetia del sur y abjasia por la estabilidad la paz y la independencia mironov fundament su posici n en las normas jur dicas internacionales considera mironov que los derechos de abjasia y osetia del sur como entidades aut nomas fueron quebrantados ya en poca sovi tica tras la renuncia de georgia en marzo de 1991 a celebrar un refer ndum para conservar la urss jur dicamente y de facto su soberan a sobre los territorios de osetia del sur y abjasia no se mantiene
7819410 para mosc la reconstrucci n de la esfera de poder rusa es m s importante que el mantenimiento de la relaci n estrat gica la otan est m s interesada en la cooperaci n que rusia dijo el presidente medvedev buena observaci n tanto la otan como la ue siguen sin tener un concepto estrat gico para el caso de que rusia vuelva a actuar como potencia agresiva cuyo m ximo valor no es el di logo pac fico con occidente en la cumbre extraordinaria la ue tendr que volver a luchar por llegar al m nimo denominador com n
7819411 a largo plazo rusia solo puede salir perdiendo la televisi n estatal puede borrar de un plumazo las amenazas internacionales con alardes de fuerza pero una rusia aislada no progresar ni a nivel pol tico ni econ mico el reconocimiento de las provincias rebeldes ser a una se al para otros pueblos cauc sicos de que el separatismo s merece la pena y rusia obliga a la otan y probablemente tambi n a la ue a un cierre de filas que mosc normalmente suele intentar romper
7819412 pol ticos occidentales deber an moderarse y reaccionar con serenidad pues la decisi n del parlamento ruso no cambia nada es un hecho que rusia hace tiempo que ha reconocido a los separatistas en el pa s vecino y es un hecho que occidente con sus a os de pasividad hac a tiempo que ya se hab a hecho a la idea de la divisi n de la rep blica cauc sica es hora de proceder a un desarme verbal
7819413 para los checos la invasi n rusa de georgia tiene una particular resonancia hist rica la europa del 2008 es muy diferente de la de hace cuatro d cadas la uni n sovi tica y el pacto de varsovia ya no existen praga es la capital de una naci n europea orgullosa y libre miembro de la otan y de la ue la rep blica checa tiene como vecinos a democracias amigas como polonia hungr a y eslovaquia cuyos ciudadanos viven de nuevo en paz y libertad pero si las diferencias son claras hay algo que no ha cambiado los principios b sicos que importaban entonces tambi n importan hoy sobre todo nuestra creencia de que naciones libres y democr ticas tienen derecho a que se respete su integridad territorial por lo tanto debemos ser muy claros al decir que el comportamiento de rusia no debe ser perdonado o excusado
7819414 la crisis de osetia del sur nos desconcierta para asegurar nuestra seguridad necesitamos integrarnos en la otan
7819415 el conflicto de georgia ha revelado problemas que se extienden m s all de la regi n acontecimientos recientes han dejado claro lo peligroso que es para la comunidad internacional ignorar conflictos congelados ucrania se ha convertido en un reh n de la guerra emprendida por rusia esto ha hecho que las autoridades ucranianas y sus ciudadanos incluidos los que viven en crimea se pregunten por los peligros que se desprenden del hecho que la flota rusa en el mar negro est anclada en nuestro territorio los tr gicos sucesos de georgia tambi n ponen de manifiesto la falta de efectividad de los mecanismos preventivos ofrecidos por las naciones unidas la osce y otras organizaciones internacionales el conflicto entre rusia y ucrania afecta los intereses de mi pa s en estas circunstancias ucrania no puede permanecer silencioso
7819416 ruptura entre rusia y la otan interrumpida todo tipo de colaboraci n
7819417 rusia est lista para romper relaciones con la otan e interrumpir las negociaciones para ingresar en la organizaci n mundial de comercio wto medvedev y putin cuentan con la aprobaci n un nime del parlamento estados unidos est cuestionando totalmente sus relaciones con rusia y bush insta a los l deres rusos a que cumplan sus compromisos y no reconozcan estas regiones separatistas de hecho la otan hab a ya interrumpido sus relaciones con mosc y dif cilmente rusia podr a actualmente entrar en la wto
7819418 aunque apoyando desde hace m s de diecis is a os estas dos provincias separatistas rusia nunca reconoci su independencia que la pondr a en infracci n con todas las resoluciones de la onu que garantizan la integridad de georgia lo m s veros mil es que el kremlin siga a n alg n tiempo con el suspense para amonedar su moderaci n durante las negociaciones en curso en la onu y con la uni n europea todas las ltimas declaraciones del d o medvedev putin indican tambi n que mosc se prepara para prolongar el conflicto con occidente una vez reconocidas las dos rep blicas mosc podr instalar ah sus bases militares y as legalizar su fuerte presencia actual
7819419 las amenazas occidentales no parecen hacer mella sobre mosc rusia ya dio a entender a eeuu que en alg n momento deber elegir entre seguir apoyando el r gimen de saakasjvili cooperar con mosc rusia apuesta fuerte con la esperanza de que occidente sacrifique a saakasjvili en nombre de la paz ayer medvedev insinu que a occidente le conviene cooperar con mosc y no viceversa refiri ndose sobre todo a la otan que acaba de congelar sus relaciones con rusia en espera de la retirada de las tropas rusas desplegadas en georgia la otan necesita la ayuda rusa para asegurar el aprovisionamiento de sus tropas en afganist n no obstante en este panorama sombr o sigue habiendo un atisbo de esperanza alemania record ayer a rusia que necesita cooperar con la uni n europea para renovar y modernizar su aparato productivo

7819544 we look forward to a resounding success when we make our first attempt to send a beam all the way round the lhc
7819545 among the 30 bodies five of them we believe now were not combatants two women and three children
7819546 we believe those to be family members of the targeted militant mullah sadiq he was important for us to target
7819547 unfortunately there were some civilian casualties although that figure is in dispute i would say but this is why it is being investigated
7819548 return false style cursor help height 26 text decoration none color 777 gt
7819549 the real spelling problems occur when people have learnt the rules or have a bit of knowledge but make mistakes in how they apply this
7819550 if you model it like 2004 youre going to completely miss whats happening
7819551 in pennsylvania we found that the people who are newly registered turned out at a higher rate than people previously registered
7819552 every national poll you see is based on the 2004 electorate
7819553 i dont like to bet but id bet you the 2008 electorate is going to be changed in some pretty fundamental ways
7819554 we have great strength in pennsylvania and were going to be there in great force
7819555 even though sen clinton beat us in the primary we clearly benefited from the time we spent there
7819556 theres a depth of understanding about who sen obama is that is greater than in other places
7819557 the last thing i wanted was another film glorifying the 60s and the baby boomers
7819558 i wanted to take the images and iconography of the 1960s and incorporate them to tell a story that was more a reflection of today than that era
7819559 its the media which has been completely complacent about reporting the protests
7819560 morgen was born two months after the demonstrations this was from his point of view
7819561 morgen wants to motivate and mobilize young people to think about the issues
7819562 it sounds awful to say that you need to have a personal stake to do your duty
7819563 we have a president who is totally unresponsive to the american people
7819564 street protests against the war in iraq should have an effect on him but they dont
7819565 there are a lot of details that the animation just left out
7819566 we need to do something about this dumb stupid war in iraq
7819567 i know theres a political game he needs to play
7819568 i am just hoping that he sticks to a progressive program
7819569 but the market is reacting to it and edging up some
7819570 lately there has been a very strong correlation between oil futures and the u s dollar
7819571 this is a very sensitive time for all our communities and we are working hard to ensure everyone is kept up to date with as much information as we can give
7819572 it can increase the sickness and morbidity of the patient
7819573 patients should insist that doctors and nurses in the hospitals who are attending to them wash their hands before they examine the patients
7819574 running a bookstore has always been an occupation for dreamers
7819575 id like to have one copy of everything in existence
7819576 as the us refused to carry out the agreement a grave obstacle to the settlement of the nuclear issue on the korean peninsula has been created
7819577 secondly we will consider restoring the yongbyon facilities to their original state in accordance with strong demands from our relevant agencies
7819578 it would be a big mistake if the us believes that it can carry out a search of our home as it did in iraq as it pleased
7819579 when the six party talks have degenerated into a circus where the strong bullies the weak as it pleases whats the use of the six party structure
7819580 verification is a duty to be carried out by every party that should come at the last stage of the denuclearisation of the whole korean peninsula
7819581 has been pressing us to accept inspections in which they may visit wherever they want collect samples and take measurements as they please
7819582 in breach of our sovereignty and which subsequently caused us to leave the nuclear non proliferation treaty
7819583 the us is making a robber like demand that it will carry out unilateral inspections of us throwing away the denuclearisation of the korean peninsula in which the removal of the us nuclear threat is at the centre
7819584 we dont mind staying in the list of countries which are not humbled by the us
7819585 ceos in the united states despite our current hard economic times continue to pocket outlandishly large pay packages s amp p 500 ceos last year averaged 10 5 million 344 times the pay of typical american workers compensation levels for private investment fund managers soared even further out into the pay stratosphere last year the top 50 hedge and private equity fund managers averaged 588 million each more than 19 000 times as much as typical u s workers earned
7819586 it showed where the petrol bomb was lit and the person running along the road stopping and throwing it at our house
7819587 if developed countries spent the same amount of money on preventing deforestation and the destruction of peatlands as they do on biofuel subsidies this would halve the total costs of tackling climate change
7819588 if the objective is to eliminate prostitution and thats what they say it is this will fail
7819589 in failing to achieve its objective it will probably take us back beyond the point we had reached where you knew you had some point of contact with the women so that as and when they were ready to exit prostitution you were there to help them
7819590 and it will make the whole scene more open to criminality and more open to exploitation
7819591 we had asked for planning permission for this more than a year ago and when we later contacted the planning department to see what was happening we were told to go ahead with the work and to keep the original fittings
7819592 that is what we have done but i am stunned that they want us to reinstate this stair it is literally a stairway to nothing and in reality it is just a tripping hazard for staff which is why we wanted to do something about it
7819593 we will need to wait for a decision but we may appeal
7819594 the removal of a section of original railings and banister has compromised the appearance and the architectural integrity of the historic staircase
7819595 the unsympathetic removal of original and historically significant architectural features is contrary to policies on listed buildings and has a detrimental effect on the buildings internal character and appearance
7819596 rape is a crime which can take a lot of courage to report
7819597 it can come as a shock for women to hear that their case is not being prosecuted
7819598 rape crisis scotland is calling for a comprehensive study into attrition in rape cases in scotland until we know exactly what the problem is why so many cases are falling down its hard to see how we can know what the solutions are likely to be
7819599 in between bills theres no contact at all from the factors so they dont tell you that theyre going to be doing work or ask if we want anything done
7819600 on this bill up pops 907 32 for clearing the gutters but you dont know that the gutters have been cleaned so you dont know to budget for it the gutters are well above any tree line and its not a leafy area anyway
7819601 the stairs are always the same and sometimes they take 220 for stair cleaning and sometimes its 280 it makes me angry because its not them thats footing the bill
7819602 our research has shown that communications between property managers and the people they serve are often poor
7819603 too many people are going through unnecessary stress because theyre either in dispute with their property managers or arent being told whats going on
7819604 this is not an isolated case the number of householders unhappy with so many different property management firms led us to take our concerns to the office of fair trading in the meantime the scottish government is developing an accreditation scheme to raise industry standards
7819605 the clients should know that theres gutter clearing carried out annually at the property which is all part of good maintenance an annual inspection of the roof anchor is also part of health and safety guidance
7819606 other smaller repairs would be things that the residents themselves will have asked for our factoring fee actually only increased by 1 50 a quarter in february
7819607 we have to act on behalf of what we see to be in their best interests in the absence of specific instructions
7819608 by all means we would love to get together with the owners and find out what were not doing for them which we could be
7819609 we will be consulting individuals national agencies and local groups on all aspects of services delivered by west lothian council to the elderly
7819610 we want our senior citizens to be at the very heart of a decision making process that will help reshape a whole range of our services
7819611 we want our senior citizens to be as mobile as possible we want them to enjoy the best quality of life in their own homes with appropriate support where necessary
7819612 we want to provide the best quality of care for those who need it and we want the elderly to be safe and secure in their own communities
7819613 this was a substantial recovery of a class a drug
7819614 lothian and borders police will always take positive action to remove harmful drugs from our communities i would urge anyone with information regarding drugs to report it to us
7819615 it is taking a long time but then it is a very big complex development so that is to be expected
7819616 we were always told by the council that they expected it to come before committee in october or november of this year and we are still confident that will happen
7819617 he had a library of cloud formations but thats where the artistic side of it comes in he created these beautiful images he was definitely very dedicated even after he was injured and he shouldnt have been flying at all
7819618 this photograph is particularly rare because its signed at the bottom there are other versions around but not many have the photographers signature i think it will appeal to all sorts of people its such a collectable image of edinburgh
7819619 one cannot get successful photographs whilst sitting in the cockpit for ones arms would almost certainly come into contact with the vibrating side of the aeroplane
7819620 its not a complete set but they are autographed and in good condition in the slip case
7819621 he used to do this kind of work before he became a famous stand up its a great poem its really funny its come directly from the family that held it and the provenance is definitely going to help it in the sale
7819622 i couldnt believe they could actually put a ticket on it ill definitely be appealing against the fine even the council must realise its a bit stupid
7819623 i was absolutely gobsmacked on friday morning when i saw the wheels had been taken it was perched precariously on concrete blocks on a steep hill they mustve done it very quickly
7819624 i was several hours late for work its a good thing there were other doctors who were able to cover for me on the ward
7819625 information from randomised trials is critical in allowing doctors to select the right treatment and we hope the campaign will raise awareness of this
7819626 doctors decide how to treat patients based on evidence from clinical trials
7819627 random allocation of different treatments within the context of a research study is the best way to establish robust evidence as to how best to treat patients
7819628 im really happy i just wanted to do something to remember caitlyn
7819629 this is the third year that the fringe has sold in excess of 1 5 million tickets signifying another fantastic year for the worlds biggest arts festival at the start of the festival many were worried about the loss of venues impact of the olympics and the economy in a difficult year with record rainfall and problems with ticketing fringe goers have come out in force and enjoyed the festival
7819630 i saw it as a chance to get involved in the sport again and raise money for a really great cause and edinburgh seemed like a natural base for it
7819631 when debbie died from cancer my friends and my rugby team were a tremendous support its amazing what the rugby community is like at times like those i was getting messages of support from around the world
7819632 i thought about it and in april this year began sending a few e mails out and it grew from there
7819633 now we have a pool of around 50 players from all over the nature of going on tour means everyone has to fund it from their own pocket and because of work commitments not everyone can make it all the time
7819634 but it ensures we can always call on 15 to 20 guys to join up with us weve already had e mails from teams in the czech republic who want to hear from us and even in japan as well
7819635 i chose cancer research uk because they put the money you raise to really good use
7819636 it is a great opportunity for them to realise that through sport they can raise significant funds it is a marvellous initiative
7819637 generous sponsors have provided johns team with rugby kit and prizes for the draw they have even had their own kilts designed and a unique tartan registered to them
7819638 their efforts will help us raise more funds and awareness to help us beat cancer in scotland
7819639 all i know is that it might be a serious blast many of the fire brigades of nearby towns have been mobilized to help
7819640 i hope the money will be used to stop abuse towards the street children
7819641 i really wanted to see russia because i went to a russian school
7819642 i think it was difficult for isla to see the street children in ethiopia
7819643 we used to see them hanging around at street junctions selling paper tissues and we talked to one girl in particular about herself and her family
7819644 it made us realise that we all live in the same world but really were living on different planets
7819645 i think isla is mature for her age but perhaps a lot of that is to do with living in a foreign country and going to a foreign school and being exposed to things that most children wouldnt be exposed to
7819646 barack obama will close the book on the old politics of race and gender of group against group and of straight against gay
7819647 and barack obama will be a commander in chief who understands that young americans in uniform must never be committed to a mistake but always to a mission worthy of their bravery
7819648 it will deliver immediate savings through a fixed price for all of our calls and give us the vital management information we need to move towards a future with all calls and data sharing a single high speed network
7819649 not only is hosted voice offering edinburgh city council fantastic value for money it is also giving them a risk free first step towards whichever converged future they choose to take
7819650 my mind was filled with thoughts of thirst and to avoid thinking about it i counted from one to 12 i did it thousands of times
7819651 i thought a lot about roger and my family my life i looked at my watch all the time and thought ive lived another hour
7819652 neighbours came to bring me food and to sit with me the third day i lost hope but they told me not to
7819653 i was in such a state i thought it was a joke when they called to say they found her
7819654 its basically inevitable that the school will close given that the school roll is 32
7819655 this is what they have been trying to get all along
7819656 practically all the p7s turned out for their final year but most of the pupils in the other classes have found somewhere else its a real shame not just for bonnington but for all the schools that are up for closure
7819657 this is the education departments fault edinburgh city council has made a conscious decision to scaremonger so that this would happen
7819658 parents have been frightened off by all the rumours and they will see the school roll has dramatically fallen and use it against us
