4160000 thats the decision made by the relevant authorities i dont think its going to be a big threat
4160001 washington ap republican john mccain says he has not ruled out choosing pennsylvanias popular former gov tom ridge as a running mate despite his support for abortion rights a hot button issue that could inflame some voters among the partys conservative base
4160002 croatia is at the moment the favourite for the final
4160003 im going to prepare the team the next couple of days for the game against greece but execution is coming from the players in the water
4160004 i dont think rangers have got the money to afford mcfadden
4160005 i would doubt that very much i have never heard that one its a new one for me
4160006 its not going to be easy to keep everybody happy but the players know they bought into it when they came into the club
4160007 theyve seen the strikers and the level of the strikers if they feared that im sure they wouldnt have joined the club
4160008 any player who feels insecure about that you probably wouldnt want them here
4160009 the end game is this if barack obama continues to hide himself from american voters he encourages negative information against him now he might win the election anyway but the obama campaign is making a major mistake by hiding their candidate
4160010 i very much doubt the kid knew the sexual implications of the expression its the grandmother amp mother that have taken it out of context and lets face it a seven year old kid shouldnt be prancing around publicly in her knickers anyway so who else is actually going to see it its a crazy pc world in which we live
4160011 doc you cant be serious i have important match against barcelona next week you cannot amputate my legs
4160012 ah yes but as the philosopher jagger once said you cant always get what you want
4160013 pese a que los riesgos a la baja en el crecimiento persisten los crecientes riesgos inflacionarios son todav a una preocupaci n significativa

4160015 in any way wish to direct super funds as to how they conduct their business
4160016 there could be a match up between the assets in superannuation funds and mortgage lending
4160017 without liquidity they are not prepared to go into them and that is what the government is looking at
4160018 the government is concerned that the market is not coming back quickly enough and as the treasurer has noted in some public comments he is considering what actions could be taken
4160019 the best way for the government to promote the financial sector in the long run is to ensure regulation does not impede new entrants
4160020 if the banks went down that route they would quickly find the securitisers the non bank lenders were back in business
4160021 where theres a buck to be made people respond very quickly
4160022 im very confident that when conditions settle the market will reappear
4160023 these people dont want short term liquidity they want long term funding and the reserve bank is not in a position to provide that
4160024 it is not clear that in the end the interest rates to borrowers would have been any lower
4160025 there are some advantages to the community of having stable and profitable banks
4160026 in 1992 immediately after the collapse of the union of soviet socialist republics the center for world indigenous studies was invited by then president of the supreme soviet ruslan kasbulatov to consult with the withered russian government on appropriate approaches to dealing with the 150 non russian peoples remaining with the russians in what was left of the ussr we suggested that russia germany japan and the united states of america join ten fourth world nations including the san blas kuna of central america tibet sami of scandinavia massai of southern kenya and northern tanzania lummi of the united states of america the crimean tartar and others in a planning body to organize an international congress of nations and states in moscow the russian government and the government of germany were open to working with the ten indigenous nations to plan organize and convene this unprecedented congress of states and nations at a venue in moscow the united states under the leadership of president george h w bush held back and finally opposed this hopeful effort at establishing dialogue between fourth world nations and the worlds states governments on a peaceful approach to long and festering conflicts

4160039 the new seethrus for blackberry pearl are offered in our very popular clear style but will also come in a variety of new eye catching colors that blackberry owners have increasingly started to prefer
4160040 the government should not be looking at programs one at a time it should look at the system as a whole
4160041 in general terms the welfare system has been divided into two allowances and pensions and pensions were designed for people needing income support for a long time
4160042 anything that has happened to pensions in the past has flowed on to the other two pensions they are both indexed by average weekly earnings
4160043 with a relationship of that kind having been established it seems to be a small step before that same criminal identity is in a position to offer a cash payment to achieve the poor performance of a horse
4160044 a large number of persons associated with the racing industry including bookmakers trainers jockeys commission agents and racetrack identities have come to the attention of police as having improper associations with criminals
4160045 the further i probed particularly about allegations of criminal involvement i was satisfied that the racing industry was affected by a more serious blight than had been suggested by the isolated matter of allanson
4160046 access to an anonymised australian crime commission report convinced me that criminal activity in the industry was rampant
4160047 it would be naive to think that some of these things dont reach across the borders
4160048 if you actually have a look at gordon lewiss report he makes it quite clear that no new investigative body is needed
4160049 he actually makes it clear that the powers we have in place in victoria at the moment are adequate
4160050 in a lot better shape than when much of this information was reported
4160051 they cant get over it the rage and its inhuman to ask them to get over it
4160052 i want aboriginal men to take more responsibility to stand up to violence against women and children
4160053 but when it is happening of course government has a responsibility to stop it its not rage thats killing these communities it is the sense of resignation that nothing can change it can change it must change
4160054 we cant minimise how we deal with violence at a personal level it requires accountability and personal responsibility on the part of perpetrators
4160055 in the communities there is still too much denial and looking away
4160056 the prime minister john howard had responded to the call of the indigenous women to come to the aid of them and their children
4160057 once more the white man was being chosen over the dysfunctional black man as the protector of children the defeat of the black man was absolute
4160058 the already persecuted women will be seen as having colluded with the enemy to remove the few strands of self esteem the indigenous man had left
4160059 the main concern i have with what she is saying is that it actually gives a sense of no hope
4160060 one of the problems besetting visual education has been the perception that its role is to train artists rather than to educate all students visually
4160061 in the compulsory years of schooling its role is to achieve visuacy for all students in the same way that mathematics achieves numeracy and english achieves literacy
4160062 in much the same way that one might conceptualise a continuum of texts in the context of the english classroom one might similarly do so in relation to a continuum of images from the most banal to the most aesthetically complex and challenging
4160063 given the specialised discipline expertise necessary to interpret and create images it is thus no longer either defensible or responsible for the visual arts educator to focus only at the traditional end of the spectrum
4160064 this reflects the governments firm view that students must be competent in the foundation disciplines
4160065 it encompasses both the traditional territories of art but also the use of all kinds of visual imagery in every day communication
4160066 theres no point just doing an analysis of contemporary popular culture without understanding the sources from which it draws its references and equally no point in only looking at art history the formal territories of the visual arts without seeing how broadly these apply across the full spectrum of communication
4160067 its like saying the noise of a foghorn because its a noise is something you can compare to beethovens fifth
4160068 they might both be noises but theres a world of difference when it comes to art like guernica in order to understand what a majestic overwhelming thing it is you first have to know something about the language of painting as distinct from the language of photography and the language of advertising
4160069 in re conceptualising the curriculum it is thus critical both to build visuacy in its own right as a curriculum fundamental and in addition to develop ways in which its integral partnership with literacy and numeracy can be maximised
4160070 this will necessitate de mystification of visual education as an elite area accessible only to aficionados and those with exceptional artistic talent
4160071 its an issue of incompetence and cover up and i think they are two matters that will impact on how voters perceive the government
4160072 i think the people deserve to have access to that information prior to going to vote
4160073 there is absolutely no way i am trying or will be involved in any process to cover anything up
4160074 the national offshore petroleum safety authority is investigating and inquiring into all of the issues related to the varanus island gas explosion whether or not the safety inspections were adequate whether or not the reporting was accurate
4160075 let the inquiry take its course then we can make some judgments and determinations about whether or not we need to do things differently
4160076 what this document says is that at best lloyds conducted a desk top review of operational practices in relation to the pipeline
4160077 nothing about a substantive thorough technical assessment of the standards and the fitness for duty of those two pipelines but mr ripper was waving this around as if it is a golden panacea to excuse government incompetence
4160078 i am surprised by the lloyds statement because it seems to contradict our own report
4160079 the reports recommendations are quite clear and what i did in my press conference was quote from the report that no impediment to continued safe operations or compliance with pipeline licence 12 requirements was identified
4160080 the lloyds register group stands by its technical report and the subsequent official statement pertaining to its duties involved in that report
4160081 in the interest of not escalating what has become a very public debate before all the facts are known we believe it is in the best interest of all parties to wait for the findings of the ongoing inquiry into the varanus island incident before making further comments
4160082 it wasnt concerned with any incriminating evidence against haneef but went to the question of his association with the guys in the uk who were suspected to have been involved in criminal conduct
4160083 all of this is damning of mr keelty and mr andrews who have both spent the last 13 months variously pretending that they had evidence incriminating dr haneef that they cannot share publicly
4160084 i had to decide whether haneef passed the character test
4160085 a person fails the character test if he has or has had an association with a person or group that i reasonably suspected was engaged in criminal conduct
4160086 my decision was based on the material provided to me by the department which in turn had come from the afp
4160087 youll be able to ask me the same questions next year and the year after that and the year after that i dont think its ever going to happen
4160088 it is going ahead gunns is still negotiating with a banking syndicate for terms
4160089 senior people in john holland were on site today wal is misinformed about the state of progress
4160090 its an economic dud and one day gunns will thank us were now shifting our focus to sorting out the political system thats allowed it to get this far all the debauching of process
4160091 its time gunns put the pulp mill out of its misery and pulls the plug on the project
4160092 all that it can and some in tasmania would say more than enough
4160093 what has happened today i believe is a landmark in australian legal history
4160094 if mr selim succeeds his damages are going to be huge arent they
4160095 and the reputations of several senior commonwealth officers are going to be completely destroyed
4160096 first of all they proposed a confidential settlement and i said no way
4160097 they have been deceiving me deceiving the public deceiving the prime minister i said i will take this much and not a cent less
4160098 a judgment for the claimant but does not involve the commonwealth conceding any of the specific allegations in the proceedings
4160099 i am not going to provide false promises i am not going to provide false guarantees about there being some simple solution here
4160100 i am trying to turn around a situation which has evolved over many years and we are dealing with the real consequences of climate change
4160101 what we need is an independent forensic audit which details where the water is who controls it and what the best use of the water is
4160102 look at the fellows who were awarded the victoria cross at lone pine gallipoli all seven of them
4160103 seven men in the one action yet nobody in the first wave received the victoria cross because there was nobody alive to record what they had done
4160104 if seven were awarded the victoria cross on days two and three of the fighting then surely then there must have been some who were worthy of it on day one
4160105 i do not know of any braver act than to accept death
4160106 he sheean went back and strapped himself to his gun and tried to keep japanese aircraft away from his mates in the sea and he knew he was going to die
4160107 they went up the chain of command in vietnam but by the time they came out the other end they changed the recommendations were never reviewed what normally happens at the end of a conflict they have a thing called the end of war list an end of war review and you go back through what alterations were made to recommendations over the time of that conflict these particular issues werent considered as part of that end of war review
4160108 the most dramatic and effective act of individual audacity in the history of the aif
4160109 although the army attempted to change the quota late in the vietnam war that amendment did not occur
4160110 army unit commanders sometimes made nominations that exceeded the quota some awards were therefore struck out
4160111 i think over the years its become an issue that a number of people just couldnt let go of ours was the first review focused on the honours and awards that related to the battle of long tan and when we examined the circumstances and the facts as such as we could determine we came up with the recommendations that we made
4160112 as far as we could determine the case to uphold the citation was not made
4160113 we didnt feel free in our terms of reference to recommend the setting aside of foreign awards guidelines
4160114 however there was a precedent for that when former howard minister mal brough did actually set the guidelines aside but that is a ministerial and government prerogative
4160115 im comfortable our report was considered and pretty well supported by the government response and i wish the tribunal well in their further consideration
4160116 i and my colleagues have been very frustrated by advisers in various departments in canberra who just would not believe the words of people who were at the battle
4160117 i was recommended originally for the distinguished service order and that was downgraded to the military cross
4160118 military crosses for my two platoon commanders an appropriate award for them were also downgraded because you could not have three military crosses in one company and thats protocol

4160130 west virginia university law professor bob bastress jr filed the suit on behalf of former georgia congressman bob barr along with the libertarians candidate for vice president wayne root and two west virginia residents
4160131 i know there have been a lot of questions asked if he was forced out of the door etc etc
4160132 the clear fact is we sent out on the website an honest statement by the chief executive on monday night explaining the situation
4160133 if people want to put their twist on it there is not a lot we can do
4160134 we are disappointed to lose carlos but we will take the money and hopefully we will spend it wisely
4160135 we told the truth there is nothing untoward as far as rangers is concerned and carlos will confirm that indeed he already has
4160136 when we signed carlos for 3m we never thought we would sell him for 10m in a years time
4160137 there are no percentages going to other clubs its a clean deal financially its a good deal for rangers although football wise it is not we have to accept it and get on
4160138 we promised we would spend the money and we will do it what we mustnt do is say we will sign every player by saturday and put ourselves under pressure
4160139 i think we will end up being just fine roll call or no roll call
4160140 i happen to believe that we will come out stronger if people feel their voices were heard and their views were respected
4160141 thatll cost me more because gas retailers are charging a lower price for cash purchases and a higher price when you use your credit card and using your debit card is same as cash right

4160153 our capacity cuts for next year are not a sign that we believe customers will not go on holiday they are about delivering our merger plans and cutting out unprofitable and duplicated product
4160154 capacity can be added relatively easily if demand remains strong
4160155 peoples holiday is sacrosanct and our trading metrics show no evidence that customers are curtailing their holiday plans
4160156 we find that people are even more keen to get away on a great value holiday and relax in the sun when the economic environment gets more difficult
4160157 both sides agreed to redeploy the troops who are stationed in the pagoda near the temple to the lowest possible number in order to avoid confrontation with each other

4160177 activision blizzard is committed to making the best games possible and has elected at this time to reduce the number of titles that radical is developing from four games to two
4160178 therefore we will be proportionately reducing the size of our studio
4160179 thanks to safer vehicles aggressive law enforcement and our efforts countless families were spared the devastating news that a loved one was not coming home last year
4160180 you can be sure that were not stopping here the quest is not over until that bottom line number is zero
4160181 as these new statistics show we are making progress but far too many of our friends neighbors and family members are still getting killed or seriously injured
4160182 credit is not bad its bad if you use it badly i encourage people to look at it as a tool that they manage you can get good rates rewards frequent flier miles you use it dont let it use you
4160183 the most important thing to improve your score is to have a credit card an installment loan is a fixed payment and you dont have to manage surprises
4160184 a credit card is self managed and you decide how much you charge each month how close you get to your limit whether you let it grow each month or pay it off
4160185 at 600 to 620 it would mean a higher fee up to around 700 and above that no additional fee
4160186 a 20 000 limit over several cards with just 4 000 charged is better than one card with a 5 000 limit with the same 4 000 charged you want to show youre not charging up to the max
4160187 many inquiries in a short period of time might suggest you are trying to take on large amounts of debt both issues are signs of risk
4160188 as long as its on the credit report whether its open or closed low balance or no balance or old or new if its on the report the score is going to count it when counting that mix or when looking at the ideal number of cards closing it is never going to help your score
4160189 so many people are using credit to live beyond their means
4160190 in an ideal world everybody would pay in full and youd use your credit card for convenience there are times when it is neat to be able to use credit where you can spend more than you pay in one month or at holidays or for emergency but youve got to stop and create a plan to get it paid back it keeps your revolving balance low
4160191 manage your debt so that 28 percent of gross monthly income is your housing payment 38 percent for all payments to creditors
4160192 everything revolves around him and his schedule which is great with me
4160193 i m lucky in that my real work doesn t start until after he goes to bed
4160194 i get to wake up with him first thing in the morning or in the middle of the night
4160195 he s at that age where he s so amenable to being on the tour bus and on the go and sleeping in a crib on the tour bus it just works out great
4160196 thats so cool i never thought how perfectly he fits into your schedule

4160199 we had an option to make the deal permanent at any stage so i spoke to him and asked him if he would be happy to stay
4160200 we wish marlon all the best he is a good pro and he made a contribution last season he has worked hard in pre season and has made an impact but he has chosen to move on for the time being
4160201 were hoping he will travel up later today for talks and a medical and we are very hopeful that we will sign him up
4160202 i would think it is unlikely that it will be done by saturday but we will make every effort
4160203 of all our targets justin was top of the list so its excellent to get the chance to open talks with him
4160204 hes got fantastic potential hes already a very good player an england under 21 international hes very well schooled and hes got a lot of premier league experience with both arsenal and sunderland
4160205 we had jeremie aliadiere come from arsenal and we know in terms of his lifestyle he is a good professional

4160224 this was one more effective way for us to communicate with folks who may not normally see other communications we have with voters who are paying closer attention to the race
4160225 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered
4160226 so if politics has become no more than a mere epiphenomenon of entertainment a shadow play of a shadow play why not go to the source
4160227 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered
4160228 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill

4160233 oh yes very pleased just started about 5 days and is just an improvement already
4160234 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4160235 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4160236 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4160237 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4160238 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4160239 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4160240 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4160241 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4160242 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4160243 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4160244 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4160245 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4160246 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4160247 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4160248 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4160249 this was a big game for us we had this one circled for a long time
4160250 a few of us felt we really needed this game to prove to ourselves we do mean business and were ready to win the gold medal
4160251 they knew what to do to take us out of our game
4160252 kobe had a lot of good dunks that was crazy
4160253 they pretty much picked us apart in 2006 the only way to change that was to be aggressive
4160254 were built to play defense we will eventually impose our will and wear them down
4160255 the defense in the second quarter turned it around for us
4160256 we played very good defense im proud of our effort
4160257 every time we go out of the hotel they are celebrating us
4160258 the state has committed 150 million through bond financing toward the federal city project which will help design and construct a marine force reserves headquarters building and provide improvements to numerous facilities throughout the site this is a critical investment that will help retain an estimated 1 660 jobs in the area and add roughly 300 positions for a total of 1 960 jobs in addition to spurring indirect economic development opportunities and investments throughout the region even more attractive for future economic expansion and additional job gains
4160259 while today is a great step forward in this project it is not an end
4160260 since march millionaires have been minted overnight among small landowners in rural red river and de soto parishes with the action moving up to subdivisions in south shreveport land that might have leased for 200 per acre last year now commands up to 30 000 per acre plus a 30 percent royalty on production
4160261 my job to come up with scoops id say it is but that some days i do my job better than others
4160262 if the rays and marlins can contend i dont believe in making excuses for other teams that dont
4160263 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4160264 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4160265 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4160266 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4160267 ten minutes before the semis were due to be played we were summoned to the reception area and told the games had been cancelled due to the elite teams running over
4160268 that was it despite our protests that we had all paid the same entrance fee and had the same rights as the elite teams
4160269 the competition was split into three sections elite teams senior teams and recreational teams middleton colts were in the recreational section
4160270 to make progress you have to win matches and had middleton qualified for the semi finals they would have played in the semi finals all three sections were played to a finish
4160271 what happened was that we did talk about running a consolation competition for teams who had not qualified for the latter stages of the main contests or plate contests
4160272 but due to the original competitions running late because of injuries penalty shoot outs etc it was decided we would not have the time or enough pitches to run a consolation knockout
4160273 it would have meant going beyond 6pm and after 6pm we would have had no first aid cover and would not have been allowed to continue
4160274 it was regrettable that we couldnt give teams such as middleton extra games but we did not deny them any games in the original competitions
4160275 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
4160276 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
4160277 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
4160278 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
4160279 im very hopeful but i have to say that since i took over here ive brought a lot of players in so if i miss out this time i cant complain too much
4160280 im delighted with the new players we have and well keep working hard to get one or two more
4160281 we have to be realistic with the values of these players and the wages if were not happy we wont bring them in
4160282 we need to strengthen in three areas and were working hard to do it sometimes one or two doors seem to open near the end of the transfer window
4160283 bardo phil bardsley didnt travel to ireland he had a hamstring injury but hes okay kieran richardson missed three days training but he was back on monday and pascal chimbonda is back after recovering from a dead leg
4160284 were in decent shape apart from the long term lads yorkie dwight yorke wont be able to play on saturday
4160285 we should have a fairly decent squad to pick from
4160286 i would expect all our new signings to start in terms of the ex tottenham lads and dioufy
4160287 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4160288 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4160289 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4160290 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4160291 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4160292 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4160293 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4160294 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4160295 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4160296 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4160297 who are open to doing something on the production side
4160298 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4160299 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4160300 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4160301 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4160302 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
4160303 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
4160304 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
4160305 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
4160306 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
4160307 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
4160308 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4160309 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4160310 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4160311 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4160312 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4160313 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4160314 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4160315 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4160316 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4160317 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4160318 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4160319 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4160320 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4160321 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4160322 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4160323 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4160324 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4160325 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4160326 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4160327 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4160328 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4160329 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4160330 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4160331 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4160332 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4160333 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4160334 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4160335 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4160336 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
4160337 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year

4160339 what you leave behind is not what is engraved in stone monuments but what is woven into the lives of others
4160340 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4160341 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4160342 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4160343 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4160344 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4160345 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4160346 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4160347 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4160348 these young people have clearly worked hard and we should celebrate their s
4160349 as the british economy slows down perhaps heading towards recession
4160350 although i welcome the scottish governments commitment to encouraging scots out of their cars in favour of greener alternatives it is no substitute for the more comprehensive funding that was previously available to all local authorities to support greener travel
4160351 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
4160352 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1

4160403 los primeros en entregar informaci n fueron personeros del consejo de seguridad nacional cosena la fuerza terrestre nos entrega un promedio de 3 000 copias semanales y la polic a ha dado uno de los nueve registros solicitados pero en lo que respecta a marina y fae no han presentado ning n documento

4160405 it is an insult to the 99 per cent of trainers jockeys and bookmakers and anybody else who works in the industry
4160406 obviously it is pretty distressing but a lot of this is in the context of a historical situation
4160407 clearly it is really important for the industry to be clean and to be perceived to be clean because punters will want to bet in an industry where they are really assured of the integrity of that industry
4160408 that is our goal we believe that it is in much better shape now than when a lot of this information was reported
4160409 it was not handled right by our officer but whether there was a violation of our policy that is subject to punishment i dont know
4160410 instead of helping us he asked michael what he was on

4160418 it hasnt really sunk in it is still a shock my first olympics i never could have imagined to have a meet like this walking away with three gold medals and three world records is just amazing
4160419 i think the excitement of it caught up with me i knew he was going to be a strong finisher so i just tried to hold on but it wasnt good enough on the day
4160420 coming into that relay we knew we had as good a chance as anyone else and we got confidence as it went on
4160421 we have never won it at the olympics before and thats an amazing honour and to beat the world record by so far is unbelievable its such a great way for me to finish the meet and celebrate with the girls
4160422 i feel a bit sad that its over because i have been looking forward to this my whole life
4160423 i kept my head focused on bringing it home for the team because i was the anchor and that is what the anchor has to do
4160424 our investigation revealed that ubs had knowledge that a market collapse was looming but did not disclose that information to the lender
4160425 the center of gravity of this action remains squarely in alaska
4160426 the three most important factors the court must consider in assessing a transfer motion under the location of sen stevens the location of potential witnesses and the location of the events at issue continue to weigh overwhelmingly in favor of transfer
4160427 furthermore transfer to alaska is the only way to permit sen stevens even a minor role in his reelection campaign
4160428 where the crimes were committed where the indictment was properly returned and where all the parties and their counsel are located
4160429 on occasion participated in phone calls or sent e mails from the district of columbia
4160430 most of the people who hate us are people it is truly an honor to be hated by reactionary creeps with strange agendas and the daily mail most people who know about modern pop culture know about gta and like or dislike it on its own merits
4160431 the liberal democrats have been telling the government for some time now that the system is too complicated
4160432 the fact that for the first time official error has cost more than customer error and fraud shows that the system is now so complex that even those working in it are baffled by it
4160433 its one of the harsh realities that we can only take 28
4160434 its been a bit of a moving target with all the medical backgrounds of these blokes
4160435 we still have some who may not be available to us in the first instance and when you consider all of those permutations that was the way the cards fell
4160436 rocky is obviously in doubt for the first one and dean has the ability to cover that position as well as lock just as hugh has
4160437 nathan has done well to date but the most obvious choice there came down to a call between dan and nathan thats what we have opted for in this instance
4160438 at the same time he will have an opportunity to have a break i believe his wife is due in a couple of weeks thats a slight positive but hes very disappointed at the moment
4160439 sharpie has been a huge part of this team for a long time you only have to look at how much he has contributed to the western force in particular this year how well he played for their team
4160440 ive got no doubt hell be back in the wallaby team soon
4160441 you dont wish that on any player obviously hes been part of our program to date its an opportunity for the other two blokes sam cordingley and brett sheehan
4160442 they are well versed in how we play the game and how we hope to play the game
4160443 its just a matter of them stepping in and taking over that role
4160444 i know peter wants to win the tri nations but he must realise he will be measured according to his ability to transform the team and to make it representative of the countrys population for the 2011 world cup
4160445 we have also seen nothing of the new type of rugby peter has spoken of
4160446 it is interesting that coloureds and blacks traditionally support the all blacks when they play at newlands
4160447 gee i really hope i can get an exemption i really need an exemption
4160448 we want to send him back to change out of these clothes get him warm clothes get him by a fire and have him just relax for the next 24 hours at least

4160450 this looks like a great smart adventurous show that i definitely want to go for
4160451 hey this is my favorite show i think you should try out for it youd be awesome
4160452 all men are frauds the only difference between them is that some admit it i myself deny it
4160453 theres a lot of up front costs to biodiesel so for now were going to have to invest money into blenders
4160454 and working with other schools helps us in bids in getting the best possible prices
4160455 a lot of communities are attached to their older buildings and do everything they can to keep them up and running
4160456 there are some up front costs but as long as its not a huge cost its something we can do right now
4160457 through these purchasing agreements we save on everything from supplies and services and can negotiate bulk arrangements for school buses gas office supplies furniture insurance liability library books painting products
4160458 the largest part of renovations was at the high school we replaced all the boilers and most of the windows there but across the district the impact was with the control systems
4160459 we can now program the heating and cooling systems to come on and off and to go up in temperature and down in temperature
4160460 we will continue the practice of having a month or two gap between turning on the boilers and the chillers
4160461 boilers are in energy savings mode set back to 68 degrees each night
4160462 the polar regions are barometers of change for the climate of the earth as a whole the 19 million square kilometers of sea ice that form each winter had been a blind spot so far and the seals help us fill in that part of the story
4160463 animals that carry tags are just as good at foraging just as good at catching food as animals without them
4160464 longer term they have just the same sort of survival rates as animals that dont carry them so theres no effect on the seals and the few seals that are out there collecting this data are doing an enormous service if you like to broader science and also to their own species
4160465 this wasnt the deepest or most talented team weve brought to the national meet but the kids stepped it up and swam great
4160466 they rose to the occasion every last one of them swam fast and we just fed off of each other and kept going faster it was pretty exciting
4160467 jimmy obviously led the way but we had a lot of guys step up
4160468 to finish 1 2 in the 200 backstroke was exciting that doesnt happen often
4160469 3 d printing has been around in some form for decades but better quality and lower prices have taken it from prototyping rough models to actually making components for end use if youre designing a critical part you dont want to go into mass production without an accurate prototype in hand something you can test tweak and improve through several iterations
4160470 given the extremely difficult market conditions we are pleased with our ability to increase margins and maintain our profitability
4160471 with economic uncertainties and higher fuel prices it appears many would be purchasers of rvs and boats are currently deferring big ticket purchases

4160503 no 2 is making emissions better and using less gas
4160504 we are targeting pickups suvs and vans thats the really big market
4160505 if you start with a gas guzzler that gets 12 miles per gallon or a school bus that gets 7 miles per gallon and increase that the impact is far bigger

4160549 it appears that the government has misread the nationalist mood of the people of jammu which is also supported by strong public opinion in the country this is the first time in history that the government has succeeded in even alienating nationalist opinion
4160550 the government should at least at this late hour recognise the gravity of the situation and speedily take a just and fair decision rather than adopt a do nothing policy
4160551 the constitutional right to religion of the pilgrims has to be made effective the myopic attitude of the government and its snail like speed in finding a solution has allowed the situation to escalate

4160777 varf r betala f r n got man inte vill ha
4160778 det logiska r att man betalar f r det man vill ha ingen ska tvingas betala f r n got man inte vill ha i dag finns ett stort utbud med betalkanaler som fungerar och konkurrens mellan dessa s varf r skulle det inte fungera f r svt ocks fr gar sig micke
4160779 det r enkelt att med digital tv begr nsa tillg ngen till svt s kanaler s att enbart de som betalar avgift kan se det kallas betal tv och anv nds av andra programbolag varf r kan inte svt anv nda sig av det
4160780 konstigt att svenska folket ska beh va tvingas att betala f r n got en mycket liten sj lvupptagen och urusel yrkesgrupp vill ha finansierat varf r inte inf ra skatt p p tvingat ny rsfyrverkeri alla betalar det men bara ett f tal vill se el ndet
4160781 man kan inte ge vissa medier gr ddfil med beskattningsr tt svt konkurrerar med privata mediebolag och skall d rf r konkurrera med lika villkor redan nu b r de privata medierna anm la saken till eu domstolen
4160782 13 procent betalar inte och d sl s det p trumman det betyder ju ocks att 87 procent faktiskt betalar r inte det en ganska stor siffra sj lvklart vore det ju bra om 100 procent betalade men r det m jligt verhuvudtaget fr gar jag mig
4160783 det finns v l inte n gon i landet som aldrig tittat p tv att betala skatt inneb r ju inte att att man m ste f tillbaka varje krona f r egen privat del men det r det v l m nga som gl mt i det nya egosamh llet

4160788 there is no reason why fares should go up as a result of this for the consumer it means they will have access to a much bigger network we will coordinate our schedules to make it easier to connect between airlines and you will have greater access to cheaper fares
4160789 there will be nothing to stop the customer from taking a fare with aa outbound and taking a fare with ba on the inbound leg
4160790 it is anti competitive it will force up fares and it will mean that passengers get a worse service because if you get rid of competitors by combining ba with aa you have got no one snapping at your heels to make you improve your product
4160791 this is an open market and that is the big difference between now and 2001 anybody can come in and compete
4160792 you are the ones who built this campaign and barack wants you to be the first to know who will join him in leading our movement for change

4160800 o allahs apostle how is the divine inspiration revealed to you
4160801 sometimes it is revealed like the ringing of a bell this form of inspiration is the hardest of all and then this state passes off after i have grasped what is inspired sometimes the angel comes in the form of a man and talks to me and i grasp whatever he says
4160802 the angel caught me forcefully and pressed me so hard that i could not bear it any more he then released me and again asked me to read and i replied i do not know how to read thereupon he caught me again and pressed me a second time till i could not bear it any more he then released me and again asked me to read but again i replied i do not know how to read or what shall i read thereupon he caught me for the third time and pressed me and then released me and said read in the name of your lord who has created all that exists has created man from a clot read and your lord is the most generous

4161011 it is one of the fundamental rules of investing and building your wealth portfolio and now with stock markets in retreat and daily profit warnings forex can offer just that
4161012 it is maturing especially in the far east and japan in japan there is 15 billion a day traded by the stereotypical japanese housewife if you look at the financial stories there it is all dollar yen or euro yen
4161013 that figure might be a bit generous but it is big
4161014 fx will gain as a percentage of the overall pie drawing in new participants and a higher number of accounts and volume and within the fx pie retail is growing it is a double whammy
4161015 trading forex in an appropriate manner and with stop losses in place can be a way of playing risk trades for a retail trader the main value of utilising forex trading strategies is that they are able to fine tune their risk willingness and risk aversion and trade around that
4161016 forex dealer members were created as a sub category of futures commission merchants but the legal status was unclear therefore big institutions werent interested in getting involved
4161017 outside the reach of the banks wholesale retail and wealth management divisions
4161018 we have been in the retail fx business for two years and are in 80 countries this is a big accomplishment what is interesting is managed accounts these dont exist on the institutional side and very few know what it is it is a goodsized client segment we are going after the smaller institutions
4161019 demand for retail fx is recognised as a potential gap in some banks coverage models leveraging off an existing platform is the accelerated route to growth
4161020 the farm bill paves the way for large financial institutions to get investors in the us this makes the market for us more competitive but at the same time gives us white labelling opportunities we didnt have before
4161021 currency has had bad publicity over the years it wasnt transparent now we can use the ebs mid market price in our pricing engine and create a spread customers can sleep easy in their beds at night knowing they wont be ripped off
4161022 there are only so many speculative retail fx clients so the platforms need to keep feeding clients in with white labelling banks are way behind they wont catch up to a saxo so they latch onto saxo technology instead
4161023 what will make us money with fxs is the ebs sales force with their relationships with the 1100 banks that contribute prices to ebs
4161024 retail is exciting it is growing and maturing and as it evolves we want to have a grown up response in that we offer this changing marketplace exactly the products it requires
4161025 from upper tier banks and futures commission merchants to lower tier banks such as in cyprus and switzerland we will licence our system to the top companies and service and customise for them
4161026 the forex dealer member can offer this to its clients
4161027 the farm bill is the next step and it is a pretty significant step generally the fx markets will be re organised in a fashion to withstand scrutiny higher barriers mean higher quality providers within an environment with even greater regulatory standards
4161028 20 million is for platforms that do not offer excessive leverage which is a standard requirement by retail fx clients to offer leverage like customers want the regulators demand double the minimum so that would be 40 million
4161029 in addition most retail dealers make markets and have a book meaning they carry net open exposure which requires further capital charges of 6 of the notional amount
4161030 those that havent registered using the zelener exclusion will now have to that has been changed in the bill this is good for our market the goal of the regulator is to make it fair and to give the customer a level of protection
4161031 we dont even know how many will have to register yet
4161032 the number of introducing brokers will significantly decrease which should increase the profit margins for the largest retail fx providers since their rebate expenses should decrease
4161033 because it is commonly called the farm bill and not the online fx bill fx traders might say i dont own any pigs so why should i care we will help the message get delivered and regulators will let the customers know it adds credibility and might help usbased companies compete overseas
4161034 over the last 10 years we have witnessed the acceptance that all markets are interrelated therefore anyone who has an interest in trading us and japanese stocks should consider currencies and the impact geo political risks can have on them and in turn on the values of those assets in effect trading forex can act as a partial hedge against currency movements
4161035 because the fund customers are squeezing them on equities fees they dont look at fx they have no idea what they are paying for currency
4161036 most lobbyists hedged their bets by donating freely to members of both parties
4161037 1 million of the top lobbyists contributions or 57 percent went to democrats while 715 000 or 40 percent went to republicans
4161038 im a creature of the senate the more senate democrats there are the better for business and the better for the country
4161039 the kind of interconnect between parts of the system will allow the equivalent of two full length feature dvd movies to be moved around in the space of a second
4161040 every aspect of the system has been put together to be the most powerful and yet the most energy efficient
4161041 you let that be the last time you ever walk by somebody and not open up your mouth to speak because even a dog can wag its tail when it passes you on the street
4161042 if you want to you can get all the way to this seat
4161043 its difficult at the tactical level to know each and every engagement in each town
4161044 to punish georgia for daring to try to integrate with the west
4161045 the united states of america stands strongly as the president of france just said for the territorial integrity of georgia
4161046 i would consider that to be bluster from the foreign minister of russia
4161047 we are very concerned about these reports it is a serious situation
4161048 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4161049 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4161050 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4161051 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4161052 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4161053 the softening overall market for intellectual property and delays experienced in realizing expected synergies
4161054 we believe the market continues to show signs of softness and so we have taken decisive restructuring actions to resize the company in both of our processor and analog business groups
4161055 these restructuring actions will reduce our quarterly spending by approximately 5 million
4161056 the write down reflects current market realities but our belief in the long term growth and strategic value of the chipidea analog business remains strong
4161057 were in markets such as digital tv that we expect to grow at a nice rate around 20 percent a year generally even though it was weak this quarter
4161058 as we work to achieve our capacity expansion and growth goals to meet the increasing demands of the global photovoltaic market in the coming years we are very pleased to have ldk as a long term partner and look forward to their supply in order to secure an important part of our wafer needs
4161059 with our new usb phy ip products we continue our efforts to provide our proven ip in the most advanced technology nodes enabling our customers immediate access for next gen development
4161060 as usb market growth soars customers are seeking our usb ip solutions such as phys and controllers to be released in the market at the lowest possible cost and the fastest time to produce

4161062 wpg americas is a strong addition to our channel strategy that will further enhance our customer support and penetration into our targeted markets
4161063 furthermore wpg holdings has enjoyed three decades of success in asia and their recently announced expansion into the north american market gives them the inherited capabilities and track record of a global leader with the energy and responsiveness of a start up
4161064 wpg americas is embarking on an avago focused program which will bring avago product expertise to a very broad customer base across all avago product groups
4161065 additionally this will result in a unique opportunity for avago and wpg americas to implement a dynamic technical sales and marketing model targeted to support customers in newly emerging markets or markets previously under served leveraging our efficient and proven operating model wpg americas will quickly mobilize avago focused field resources to serve customers in avagos strategic market segments within the americas region
4161066 as the economic cycle unfolds it seems inconceivable that we will not see a more significant reduction in spending on electronics even in the most resilient of industry sectors and regional markets
4161067 therefore in coming months we expect to see signs of a widespread slowdown in the electronics sector which would directly impact semiconductor sales
4161068 semiconductor sales in june 2008 were slightly higher than our expectations at 25 5 billion sales for the first six months of 2008 were 5 percent higher than in the same period last year but the market is likely to be relatively soft in coming quarters
4161069 we remain conservative in our forecast for semiconductor sales in 2h 08 and 1h 09
4161070 projected sales of about 140 billion for 2h 08 would represent growth of around 3 percent compared to the same period last year and lead to annual sales of about 267 billion and an annual growth rate of about 4 percent for 2008 as a whole we expect a relatively weak start to 2009 before a stronger second half of the year sets the market up for an annual growth rate in the mid to high single digits
4161071 the percentage year over year change in chip unit growth rate is approaching negative growth which has historically signaled a bottoming process
4161072 no excess chip inventories are in the channel helping with acceleration of unit growth when end market demand picks up again
4161073 front end bookings are down 46 percent from the peak verses average peak to trough of 48 percent
4161074 we expect an in line quarter with booking declining 25 percent quarter over quarter at the low end of the guidance range of minus 15 percent to 25 percent
4161075 we also expect downside risk to the october quarter consensus estimates though we do not expect applied to include any solar revenue in the guidance given uncertainties associated with the timing of qualifications
4161076 although competitors continue to make noise about the imperfection of applieds solar technology we believe applieds continues to hit its milestones though there have been several quarters of delays along the way
4161077 thus we still see a tremendous market opportunity in solar as applied is among a few that are working on a technology that could make the total cost of module deployment energy generation at or below grid prices by calendar 2010 theoretically before even industry cost leaders such as first solar
4161078 heading into applieds july report on august 12 we expect revenue to be slightly above consensus given lowered expectations
4161079 overall we believe the report will be slightly positive for the stock due to better than expected f4q silicon bookings strong display business and good f3q solar bookings
4161080 however we believe those positives will be offset by weaker f4q guidance on sequentially lower silicon and service revenues and weaker margins
4161081 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4161082 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
4161083 our expertise in algorithm development logical synthesis and silicon optimization make us a unique one stop shop for end to end security solutions
4161084 netxens flexlom solution clearly differentiates them from other 10gbe vendors and should accelerate the industry transition from gigabit to 10gbe
4161085 server makers are reluctant to commit 10gbe connectivity to the motherboard because the market has not coalesced around a single phy interface for 10gbe
4161086 the sole purpose of this buyback is to remove partially the dilution from employee profit sharing
4161087 this repurchase program is separate from the multi phase plan with philips and philips will not use this program to dispose of its remaining stake in tsmc
4161088 carriers are conducting trials because they want to deploy 100g systems at an earliest time and we are feeling that pressure
4161089 choosing a modulation scheme is just the beginning of the project
4161090 we need to define the whole architecture for a 100g photonics module so that we can derive at a sound decision on issues like as where to draw interface lines between the parts of these modules such issues could take six months of discussion
4161091 companies will bring 100g products to market soon they will be big clunky and have relatively high power dissipation but they will work
4161092 with this specification component vendors can see their way to take all the modulators for a 100g
4161093 whats needed is investment from the component industry in integrated photonics for 100g
4161094 long haul dense wavelength division multiplexing has been stalled at 40gbit s for some time now even as carriers have pushed hard for an upgrade to 100gbit s
4161095 the oifs decision brings a common approach to modulation methods and it will also help lower the cost of transceiver components
4161096 we are creating an implementation that lets vendors pack 40 to 80 channels of 100g signals into a single fibre
4161097 that could expand the amount of capacity on a single fibre from 1tbit s to 2tbit s today to as much as 8tbits s
4161098 we are completely complementary with the ieee effort and depend on them to create a standard for signals we can capture and modulate
4161099 if the ieee group chooses a scheme that uses four 25gbit s channels it will map easily to the oif standard but the oif module architecture will work with whatever approach the ieee defines

4161109 basic transportation will no longer be enough for increasingly empowered consumers they want an automotive experience that matches their lifestyles and lets them move seamlessly from life inside the vehicle to their world outside
4161110 in the face of such significant and chaotic change finding clarity will require the automotive industry to take sweeping and rapid action two of the greatest areas of opportunity are meeting consumer demands for environmental accountability and using technology to transform the way the industry develops products and goes to market
4161111 this camouflage is a perfect example of the extent to which china went to create the perfect games
4161112 i would say that you have to again put it in context you have got the same in sports when for instance in a rowing boat you have four rowers who have qualified for the olympic games and suddenly the coach decides that he must change one of the athletes to perform it is exactly the same

4161140 we are willing to engage in discussions with unionbancals special committee which has been our policy all along and there is no change to that
4161141 is seen as an attempt to raise the price of the tender offer
4161142 was characterized by decreasing household final consumption expenditure and smaller fixed capital formation
4161143 clearly the growth dip in spring could have been worse
4161144 for the second half of this year we believe in moderate and clearly below potential growth but not in an outright recession
4161145 the financial market turbulence the rise in oil prices and the decline of the u s dollar are now showing effects on germany
4161146 the government can stick to its deliberately cautious growth forecast of 1 7 percent for this year

4161148 while inflation and higher fuel costs are pressuring suppliers retailers and customers worldwide were confident that wal mart is well positioned for this economy
4161149 wal mart continues to execute well and deliver solid results in a challenging economic environment
4161150 big potential to expand globally so that should be the focus
4161151 that was not sufficient to offset the losses in terms of low price brands
4161152 make no mistake if this monster monopoly is approved it will be third time unlucky for consumers
4161153 it will still be bad for passengers bad for competition and bad for the u k and u s aviation industry
4161154 i believe this is also good news for the industry
4161155 the job of the regulators is to assess the long term impact of the alliance on competition not to provide special protection from the immediate challenges of the economic cycle with which every other airline has to deal
4161156 our investigation revealed that ubs had knowledge that a market collapse was looming but did not disclose that information to the new hampshire higher education loan corp
4161157 we will vigorously defend ourselves against this complaint as we believe that we worked in the best interests of our investor and issuer clients this complaint attempts to link a single client interaction with overall market conditions which affected all student loan issuers and as such we believe there is no basis for these specific allegations
4161158 their goal should be to figure out how to get student loans out
4161159 given that we have been in discussions with them and nhhelco regarding the unique issues being raised by the state
4161160 i always get criticised for it the javelin being bad and it is bad but cant they recognise the progress im making if people cant recognise that progress then theyre blind

4161164 this was a big game for us we had this one circled for a long time
4161165 a few of us felt we really needed this game to prove to ourselves we do mean business and were ready to win the gold medal
4161166 they knew what to do to take us out of our game
4161167 kobe had a lot of good dunks that was crazy

4161180 hes so nice and grounded and sweet as can be hes the real deal hes a teen idol
4161181 she was great shes a very normal 15 year old girl and i guess that makes her extraordinary considering the circumstances
4161182 she works hard and shes got a good attitude i think with the right direction and the right choices she can do some great things
4161183 hes a very nice guy and we had a real good time together
4161184 shes such a different character than jan shes earthy with no ulterior motives
4161185 you know shell either be a great mother or be the greatest example of what not to be as a mother
4161186 itll be interesting to see michael and jan now they always have a power struggle he had it all last season and now shes got it back again and it keeps them an interesting couple
4161187 they do their own singing and their own dancing in the film
4161188 you get the opportunity to see both of these guys go for it in a real way thats fun and energetic mac definitely can carry a tune he does a great falsetto in the movie and a baritone and alto as well he has a range he plays a range of emotions in the film as well as octaves
4161189 when i came on they asked do you want him in the movie and i was like of course not to include him in the movie would have been sacrilege i had to have isaac in the film
4161190 when i went to shake his hand and tell him how much i loved him and what a great job he did he hugged me back and looked me in the eye and said make a great film man

4161198 britney and kevin wanted to settle but there were issues of how much time we wanted and there was an upcoming court hearing scheduled
4161199 when we were recording at sound city studios i found it very easy to get drunk and stay there
4161200 i also found it easy to amuse my friends joshua any time hes down i just want to make him happy and nothing delights him more than seeing me on rollerblades one night i got sh faced and long story short when the head of sound city one of the pre eminent recording studios wakes you up at 7 in the morning in their upstairs parking lot and youre wearing nothing but a tank top cutoffs and rollerblades youve got f ing problems
4161201 i was rolling with a certain hollywood figure who may or may not have been aforementioned as a guest singer on this record and this tattoo artist i was rolling with in order to keep her in my life as my friend it meant the end of the potential for another aspect of our relationship so it was more of a disappointment
4161202 thats the worst kind of heartbreak in a way because it was the heartbreak of being an adult
4161203 i get off the phone with this girl and i said out loud f now im a f ing fool
4161204 i dont care what anybody says when youre hanging out with celebrities you never expect to get involved with them emotionally no matter how much you like them
4161205 this album is kind of i hate to sound corny but its kind of a mature look at hollywood
4161206 i fell in love with hollywood the city itself in a randy newman sort of way so i guess the album is about a variety of things di swinging in hollywood and acting tougher than you really might be
4161207 i really believe if you want to keep doing what were doing in this business youve got to grow
4161208 you have to go somewhere you have to be on a curve not on a line
4161209 not that its a good one but i have some sort of reputation and i could f that up doing the wrong thing thats suddenly a consideration thats never been present before thats going to affect everything the trick was learning how to give appropriate time to certain things but what im glad to see is really on this record its the same story two best friends having a sh s and giggles good time making rock and roll
4161210 the hayes family is comfortable with dr kraus recommendation to not conduct an autopsy
4161211 we are overwhelmed with the outpouring of support and love from isaacs dear friends colleagues and fans from every corner of the world and we thank each and every one of them for their kind thoughts and prayers
4161212 im pretty sure riddler gets his shot ed nigma gets his moment
4161213 its a very very awesome prison i majored in architecture in college and design is how i actually started in for super max designing that prison it had to be the kind of thing that was a character in and of itself
4161214 were in a world where instead of just trying to contain a guy whos really big youre trying to contain a guy who can in the case of icicle who can freeze things what kind of a cell would a guy like that need in order to have his powers neutralized so to escape from super max they have got to go through the most elaborate heist weve ever seen involving superpowers because the prison itself kind of has superpowers
4161215 what we wanted to do and i think well continue to do as the studio continues to push the movie forward is to be able to put queen in the center of a much bigger universe
4161216 in the same way that marvel is starting to do when youre in the filmed dc universe where this world and this world and this world they all exist in an interrelated web its the kind of thing that i think absolutely is about spelling out a couple different roads for a couple different characters
4161217 by the time a movie like this comes out we will all understand origin stories and mainstream audiences now are willing to suspend their disbelief to the point that we can believe that a world exists where superpowers exist and people dress up in costumes so now what now what do we do and i call this superhero 2 0
4161218 we do deal with his origin hes got a very interesting origin with a desert island and everything else but we get to the core of green arrow not by showing where he starts but by pushing him into a key moment in his life where everything he has is lost and hes got to earn it all back i think for audiences its going to be a great way to get to know a new character
4161219 we provided intake documentation and the judge said it was insufficient
4161220 the judge said he should have informed the court sooner and because it was the second time hed missed court in this case she issued the warrant
4161221 working towards getting him some help and we hope that will be taken seriously by all parties in this case

4161225 theres a time and place for everything and now is the time
4161226 i felt like there was no bigger event in hip hop at this moment than me and t i working together
4161227 it was always turmoil between our camp and his camp us as the bosses of our companies everyone is gonna follow our lead wed figure if it aint no problem and we dont have no issues no beef then theres no reason we shouldnt be able to get together and make music that was an executive decision that was made on both our behalves
4161228 i was surprised just as much as everybody else was
4161229 i talked to luda and he said it was time to sit down do business make grown man moves both of them got albums coming out time to try new things cris did something for t i too that nobody heard yet its about to come out soon its a good move
4161230 its showing that once great minds set their differences aside they can make something happen
4161231 thats two grown men not two grown males grown men
4161232 its actually been really fun weve been listening to our ipods and i slept for a lot of the time weve been just keeping each other busy

4161239 you get all those wee wee jokes and that sort of thing
4161240 he e mailed me right away and said holy sh the nintendo is named after you
4161241 the reason my parents chose that is because they didnt really have a name picked out when my mom was pregnant

4161259 i put it on top of my 360 toward the back
4161260 nate your 360 is at dog level it sucks that your new headset is ruined after only two days of use but its your fault the dogs are going to chew on anything small that is down on dog level thats what dogs do dont be mad at the dogs
4161261 but ive only had it for two days they wont take it back
4161262 if the unit failed because of a manufacturer defect youd be ok but items used as chew toys arent covered son
4161263 you dont hate the dogs and dont be mad at them because they only did what comes naturally to dogs if you have material possessions that are important to you you need to keep them somewhere when you arent using them that you know is safe i know this sucks its a hard lesson for you just be sure to learn the lesson and not leave stuff you care about laying where the dogs can get it when you arent there it isnt the dogs fault for doing what dogs do its your fault for being careless with your stuff
4161264 stop it you will if you take care of your things use your head youre a smart boy all you need to do is put stuff like that in a desk drawer or high up where the dogs cant reach it listen i am not going to replace 50 headsets because you didnt think to take care of them but ill replace the headset for you this once just promise me that you took the lesson to heart and you will take care of your stuff from now on
4161265 quit whining well talk more about this later tonight when youre done feeling sorry for yourself
4161266 the brief filed today by the trial lawyers in the dupont case in response to my offices amicus brief filing is truly disappointing
4161267 our brief is solely based on the issue of due process and whether or not our supreme court follows the same standards as established by the u
4161268 what is amazing to me is that while our brief is based solely on the legal principles of due process and the right of appeal the trial lawyers brief led by several big out of state law firms does not address that legal issue in any way and instead spends their time attacking my secretary who has not been involved in one meeting on this issue and who does not deserve this kind of treatment
4161269 shame on these trial lawyers for attacking this hard working state employee and grandmother simply because i as governor dared to ask a legal question about due process thats just not right its these kinds of tactics that i believe have made people so discouraged about our legal system and after seeing up close and personal how they operate i am committed now more than ever to protecting the legal rights of all west virginians
4161270 the biotech industry continues to deliver many promising new drugs making some of these companies an attractive proposition to the large pharmaceutical concerns

4161278 the comparatively high growth in the second quarter was most likely driven by a relatively strong contribution from net exports
4161279 however since the euro area has recently been slowing significantly and hungarian industrial activity has been weakening net exports should not be expected to boost growth in the third and fourth quarter
4161280 home prices in the u s are likely to start to stabilize or touch bottom sometime in the first half of 2009
4161281 prices could continue to drift lower through 2009 and beyond

4161319 the people in and around the lion family have always been supportive and i look forward to re joining that group as the head baseball coach i believe in the direction that dr husak is taking the program and the athletic department and i feel that lmu as a whole is structured and ready to win from top to bottom upon reflecting on my personal experiences at the university and talking to current and former coaches it is extremely clear that lmu is destined for great things the bottom line is it is a great time to be a lion
4161320 jason is widely respected and has been regarded as one of the premier assistant coaches and recruiters in the country over the past few years
4161321 his experience coaching at college baseballs highest levels coupled with his previous years coaching at lmu makes him a great fit for our program there is no doubt that jason is ready to take the reigns as our head coach and we feel that he will create an environment that will allow our student athletes to compete for championships graduate and grow as people jason was on the coaching staff the last time our program made the postseason and it is our goal to have many more trips under his guidance

4161357 veteran with an injury or illness incurred during military service could use to get free treatment at a local hospital if the va hospital is too far away
4161358 there is one idea i have urged that mccain nor obama have not
4161359 lets rename the va the department of veterans advocacy and let the new va take the lead in providing each veteran with the benefits and care they have earned
4161360 need to start addressing the issue of long term care
4161361 of vital importance for people with disabilities and our families and friends
4161362 federal long term care policy still heavily favors institutionalization countless people with disabilities are forced to give up their freedom in exchange for assistance
4161363 obama nor mccain lists long term care as an issue on their main web pages
4161364 obama does have a nine page platform addressing disability issues
4161365 support of a major piece of proposed legislation that would make it much easier for people to receive medicaid funded assistance in their homes
4161366 this proposal is deceptive and is hazardous because it will allow unregulated and unrestricted experimentation on human embryos
4161367 b oth sides know that the average voter knows little about the complex issue
4161368 becoming even more so in a marketplace that is becoming more competitive and profit driven
4161369 steps they are taking to maintain their margins can threaten their mission
4161370 safety net providers really are caught in the competitive crossfire of an increasingly profit driven health care marketplace
4161371 no safety net hospital wants to limit access or ration care but faced with a growing demand for uncompensated care and increasingly limited funding options at every level of government some are left with no choice
4161372 although on the other hand the connection isnt so far fetched i am using the radiative transfer equation to describe light propagation in tissue and that was originally developed for modeling stellar atmospheres

4161383 voters that this will win over are those that are looking for an excuse to vote for obama
4161384 they just needed one signal that if i vote for him more babies can be saved than if we keep wrangling over whether roe v wade is going to be overturned

4161389 it sounds perhaps frivolous but its a very serious thing
4161390 the event is more of an invitation to a revolution more than a party in a sense until we come out of the closet and let people know our numbers politicians think they can ignore us
4161391 this is showing those who arent religious that there are other social groups im not going to pretend im religious so i can be part of a group

4161397 wild things does its too be expected from a novelist but could provide problems on the other end of the camera if those emotions cant quite be expressed visually
4161398 the dark scenes are the point of the movie and i hope that they maintain that point because i think children can identify with a character who is upset it gets intense because were representing the things inside of the kid they represent his struggles either him being too angry or being confused or not feeling like he belongs theyre a gargantuan extension of the way hes feeling inside

4161412 but the bulbs contain small amounts of mercury a neurotoxin and the companies and federal government havent come up with effective ways to get americans to recycle them
4161413 the problem with the bulbs is that theyll break before they get to the landfill theyll break in containers or theyll break in a dumpster or theyll break in the trucks workers may be exposed to very high levels of mercury when that happens
4161414 drug dealers are using the internet to move from the back alleys into our living rooms
4161415 customers who havent even seen a physician can illegally purchase addictive pain killers and other controlled substances from so called online pharmacies
4161416 but modern technology cant disguise the fact that buying prescription drugs online can be as dangerous as taking drugs offered by a street corner thug
4161417 narcotics sold over the internet have led to deaths overdoses and addiction nationwide we are determined to shut down these dangerous and illegal web sites and prosecute those who profit from them
4161418 reminiscent of the sheets circulated after the tv pilot has just played to its sample audience in burbank
4161419 the kind of language he uses and the kind of behavior he exhibits in the public domain toward women objectifies them and leads to bad things for our society and to domestic violence
4161420 ive said all along this has got to be resolved
4161421 this has been very very difficult for the city for the state and thats obviously why we need a resolution
4161422 they outright said if you vote for barack obama this law is going to pass your wages would go down you could lose your job
4161423 though we sympathize with the airline industrys needs to cut costs and raise revenues doing so on the backs of those who seek to protect us is ill conceived
4161424 if the airlines refuse to waive baggage fees at the check in desk we would like to suggest that you develop a system to bill directly to the department of defense so that soldiers going to war dont have to concern themselves with whether or not their reimbursements went through
4161425 we know you understand the financial burden that service members and their families often face they may not have the extra money to cover the fees up front
4161426 we believe that our service members have more important concerns than paying baggage fees keeping track of receipts and hoping for an eventual reimbursement
4161427 its good to see american airlines has done the right thing hopefully the other airlines will follow suit
4161428 we always understood that soldiers traveling on duty were reimbursed by the military for the fees on required excess baggage
4161429 the choice for us to forgo payment for a third checked bag from the department of defense was clear
4161430 the new waiver policy for military personnel begins immediately american airlines will work closely with the department of defense on issues such as this in the future
4161431 further it is both rep klein and rep youngs hope that the department of defense can change its policy of asking soldiers to front the cash
4161432 esperamos que tambi n hoy las tropas rusas se retiren de zugdidi ciudad georgiana casi en la frontera con abjasia y que tendremos todo el control sobre gori

4161438 people in the middle of the country may just be staying home
4161439 summer travel is down a little bit but in smaller communities its down more significantly they have less disposable income so higher fuel prices affect them disproportionately it just comes down to having less money to spend so you stay home

4161477 i just love it its so gossipy and superficial its amazing

4161485 todos los presidentes venezolanos han citado a bol var pero actualmente hay un nuevo proyecto nacional y una constituci n que a ade el adjetivo de bolivariano por considerar que el libertador representa las m s preciadas virtudes republicanas
4161486 antes bol var era igual a patria pero ch vez ha convertido el bolivarianismo y el chavismo en sin nimos hace una metamorfosis del mito para que se parezca a l y a lo que sus seguidores piensan
4161487 del bol var para todos al bol var para ch vez
4161488 el culto a bol var es un hecho consumado entre nosotros todos los mandatarios han hecho uso de bol var no es pues un hecho novedoso ni alarmante su utilizaci n indiscriminada para los fines m s diversos
4161489 ch vez manipulando a bol var se atribuye poderes que nadie le ha concedido y no respeta el resultado de un refer ndum
4161490 si esta rep blica se llama bolivariana y finalmente el libertador ya no es una figura usada por las elites sino que se ancla en el pueblo me parece una consecuencia natural y l gica que muchas de las acciones de este proyecto nacional de izquierda lleven el adjetivo bolivariano
4161491 antes la figura de bol var se usaba como herramienta para unir y ahora ch vez lo usa para dividir a la sociedad lo usa como arma de guerra un arma dif cil de combatir porque los venezolanos no podemos renegar del dolo para renegar as de ch vez
4161492 it is absolutely unequivocally okay to date a single dad at your childs school
4161493 the truth of the matter is when it comes to dating its slim pickings out there the pool just isnt that large and if youre a single mom where else are you going to meet men besides you want to date guys you have a common denominator with right well having kids that go to the same school and are around the same age is a huge thing to have in common divorced dads come with built in practicalities and conveniences too such as not having to hire a babysitter whenever you want to see each other
4161494 bringing the divorced dad home with you and or having sex with him right away is inappropriate and will make things awkward for everyone
4161495 make sure they understand that the two of you are just getting to know each other
4161496 if youre flip about dating him like you stand him up sometimes or dont call him back or whatever that will create a very negative ripple effect when you date someone in the same circle as is the case if his child goes to your childs school your best dating manners must be in place be considerate
4161497 telling your teen to avoid strangers on the internet doesnt work
4161498 the internet creates a false sense of intimacy if your daughter has been talking to someone online she probably feels like she knows him hes not going to be one of those people who would hurt her no way the only problem is that sometimes many times shes wrong
4161499 you need to talk to your teen about the false sense of intimacy that develops online and how fake it can be as well as the dangers that can happen
4161500 what is it shes seeking from this person from myspace once you figure that out how can you help her fill that void in a healthier safer way most of todays teen girls are desperate for a connection once they meet the first person who will give that to them their judgment often goes out the window part of it is that theyre not getting that connection at home or from friends its a normal need but theyre going about it in a dangerous way
4161501 you may want to use real life examples of girls who been murdered raped or whove disappeared after meeting someone on myspace facebook or craigslist google donna jou for starters shes a 19 year old who went on a date with a guy she met on craigslist last year and hasnt been seen since dont tell her about these cases in a lecturing way or a holier than thou way
4161502 you want to come from an im concerned about this because angle parents should stay away from phrases like you should or you shouldnt try im concerned or im worried instead the last thing you want her to do is shut you out
4161503 if they do meet someone online and you later find out about it ask your teen what made her think this was okay
4161504 this might make you get out of your own head and into your teens logic they have a whole other logic about meeting people online than we do theres no way to understand them unless you get a sense of where theyre at not where they should be at keep in mind its part of the teenage years to feel invulnerable and quote unquote unique they truly believe this will not happen to me parents need to show there are other teens just like them out there and it did happen to them
4161505 we competed in two events and came home with two medals each

4161545 we are in a high energy cost period but once that cycle calms down technology and competition will make global fights more accessible to the typical citizen fares will drop which means airlines must reduce costs globally oriented joint venture deals will help lower airline costs its part of that cost reduction solution

4161728 cases of possible threats by russia directed at georgia with the intention of taking control over the baku ceyhan pipeline

4161735 unilateral and frequently illegitimate actions have not resolved any problems moreover they have caused new human tragedies and created new centers of tension judge for yourselves wars as well as local and regional conflicts have not diminished more are dying than before significantly more significantly more today we are witnessing an almost uncontained hyper use of force military force in international relations force that is plunging the world into an abyss of permanent conflicts we are seeing a greater and greater disdain for the basic principles of international law and independent legal norms are as a matter of fact coming increasingly closer to one states legal system one state and of course first and foremost the united states has overstepped its national borders in every way this is visible in the economic political cultural and educational policies it imposes on other nations well who likes this who is happy about this in international relations we increasingly see the desire to resolve a given question according to so called issues of political expediency based on the current political climate and of course this is extremely dangerous it results in the fact that no one feels safe i want to emphasize this no one feels safe because no one can feel that international law is like a stone wall that will protect them of course such a policy stimulates an arms race i am convinced that we have reached that decisive moment when we must seriously think about the architecture of global security

4161875 it was quite a complex incident and certainly had a lot of demands
4161876 theres only one other time that a tractor trailer busted through the guardrail about 15 years ago but just the cab was hanging over the edge
4161877 other than that i dont think a vehicle has ever actually made it into the water
4161878 the unique nature of this incident and its aftermath have posed challenges for us all
4161879 but i want to commend the response of our state and local agencies and first responders for their quick and decisive action when they arrived on the scene
4161880 we had no problems talking to firefighters on the bridge the divers in the water or the officers in the air
4161881 from our perspective all the partners worked well and there was no communication breakdown
4161882 overall it was a pretty coordinated activity for such a complex operation

4161920 she had a really severe infection in the bone around one of her eyes the infection had come from her sinuses we admitted her immediately and took her to the operating room in an attempt to save her vision
4161921 this is someone who has lived in new mexico her whole life and we were the only people there to watch over her
4161922 we were happy to finally be able to send her home and out of the hospital but when she left she cried bitterly she considered us her family it really tore me up
4161923 i think its just basically a sign of how sick our health care system is
4161924 we need a system where people can see a doctor and get their medicine and transition from one level of care to another
4161925 whats happened with healthcare reform in the past is that we have the politicians talking about what should be done the great thing about healthcare united is that this is the first time that theres been an organization thats really trying to bring healthcare workers to the forefront where they should be

4161927 some of the greatest advances in medicine came about because of large public health campaigns and movements enormous numbers of people were saved by such innovations as mass vaccinations and sanitary water and sewage treatment systems if we can start to look at healthcare reform with the notion of it being an effort to improve public health than i think were on the right track to make a lot of good changes

4161948 a wikipedia editor emailed political wire to point out some similarities between sen john mccains speech today august 11 on the crisis in georgia and the wikipedia article on the country georgia
4161949 given the closeness of the words and sentence structure most would consider parts of mccains speech to be derived directly from wikipedia
4161950 nonetheless at least two political science professors have weighed in saying the similarities are more than coincidental and wouldnt be tolerated from their own students
4161951 given that mccain by his own admission cant use the internet its a bit of an ironic situation though perhaps it counts as progress of some sort
4161952 we want this independent project to be absolutely transparent and open to the public in real time because people who are at risk for developing respiratory problems need to know immediately if there is high ozone
4161953 there are serious gaps in tceqs existing ozone monitoring network
4161954 parents teachers school officials and anyone concerned with breathing healthy air while outside need to be quickly informed about the quality of the air ozone information that can be 1 or 2 hours old simply is not good enough to protect peoples health
4161955 there were 28 days when ozone was measured above the health standard down from 36 in 2006
4161956 since ozone formation depends on energy from the sun and since rain and clouds block energy from the sun the weather in 2007 most likely contributed to cleaner air
4161957 the 2008 ozone season should answer if it was the weather or pollution reductions that made houstons air cleaner but the odds are high that we wont have two quiet ozone years in a row so we need to be prepared to protect our health and the health of our children the best way to do this is to reduce outdoor exposure when ozone levels are unhealthy
4161958 we cant control the weather and we certainly cant keep praying for record rains to help with houstons ozone problem
4161959 short of figuring out how to control the weather we have to work together to reduce all man made sources of ozone pollution
4161960 watch out new york this gypsy is a wallop packing show of raw power
4161961 this tells us that sleeps role in emotional memory preservation is more than just mechanistic
4161962 in order to preserve what it deems most important the brain makes a tradeoff strengthening the memorys emotional core and obscuring its neutral background
4161963 emotional memories usually contain highly charged elements for example the car that sideswiped us on the ride home along with other elements that are only tangentially related to the emotion such as the name of the street we were traveling on or what store wed just passed
4161964 we were interested in examining whether sleep would affect memory for all of these elements equally or whether sleep might allow some of the event features to decay at a faster rate than others
4161965 our results revealed that the study subjects who stayed awake all day largely forgot the entire negative scene they had seen with their memories of both the central objects and the backgrounds decaying at similar rates
4161966 after an evening of sleep the subjects remembered the emotional items smashed car as accurately as the subjects whose memories had been tested only 30 minutes after looking at the scenes
4161967 by contrast sleep did little to preserve memory for the backgrounds i e street scenes and so memory for those elements reached a comparably low level after a night of sleep as it did after a day spent awake
4161968 this is consistent with the possibility that the individual components of emotional memory become unbound during sleep

4161981 the issue of race is there in political campaigns and not just this one people talk in code it is the 800 pound gorilla in the room that is ignored by mutual agreement so it never gets dealt with head on
4161982 it is very difficult to have a frank conversation about race even when you tiptoe around the periphery it can degenerate into a shouting match
4161983 blacks feel like they have more responsibility for exposing and discussing racism whites generally feel that they dont want to be involved
4161984 the code is used to remind people that the opponent is black one of the reasons why people talk about it in muted terms is because its an old racial taboo particularly in the south

4162000 in the beauty pageant of alternative fuel natural gas vehicles may have gotten miss congeniality in all of this it just wasnt sexy and it might have been overlooked
4162001 americans have not shown a willingness to give up anything for fuel economy
4162002 its natural to look at natural gas as a viable alternative
4162003 we have not found that one solution so we have to look at all options
4162004 at that point theres no reason why anyone would drive a vehicle that burns gas
4162005 once youve got the energy storage that enables a highway capable vehicle can recharge in minutes not hours and is cost competitive with internal combustion youve cracked the code

4162024 my first response is its a comedy were really making fun of ourselves the whole movie is about actors and actors who try to do things to be taken seriously so in the context of the movie im really comfortable thats how it comes off
4162025 everybody of course is entitled to their opinion when you make a movie you have to kind of go with your gut i feel like our heart is in the right place with it
4162026 with any comedy anything you put out there some people are gonna get it some people are gonna be into it and other people wont but the movie ive screened it so many times with audiences its fun to see audiences laugh everybody doesnt take it as seriously when you get outside of it and people talk about these issues we all want to laugh at ourselves

4162041 that was special but it was also strange because shes always been the baby and now the baby was having a baby

4162043 those living in the corporate society feel very pressured so we think theres a need to get them out of the office and to see for themselves the families who are really in need
4162044 in reality the only possibility of avoiding such a crunch appears to be if a major recession reduces demand and even then such an outcome may only postpone the problem
4162045 while the forecast is controversial and extremely bullish even allowing for some increase in capacity over the next few years a supply crunch appears likely around 2013
4162046 the implication is that it will quickly translate into a price spike although there is a question over how strategic stocks might be used to alleviate this
4162047 its a very seminal period an opportunity to both celebrate 20 years of content and the fact that the source was a leader in chronicling the culture of hip hop
4162048 im on a mission to restore it to the community that gave birth to it and open the door to those that currently enjoy and influence that hip hop culture
4162049 its exciting because we believe that we can do it
4162050 we shared with him what we were trying to do the vision of hip hop and where we thought it needed to go and he thought it was refreshing and clever
4162051 were just going to expand on what the source has always done well
4162052 a core focus but not 80 percent of the book
4162053 i think that what were trying to do is evolve it as hip hop has evolved and become an international force to evolve it without losing its core essence that was the centerpiece of its earliest beginnings and greatness but it has to evolve just like hip hop has to evolve
4162054 scott the pair were fired in 2006 and subsequently launched hip hop weekly an us weekly like magazine chronicling the lives of urban music stars when the magazine filed for bankruptcy it was millions of dollars in debt
4162055 it is a force nobody can deny the force or the power of the source but is it the same as it was five years ago no
4162056 it does not deliver with the same punch that it used to
4162057 if they are true to the dna of the publication
4162058 it left off so much of what is the key ingredients of hip hop and lifestyle now which is lifestyle fashion online new media international aspects of how people embrace content
4162059 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again

4162081 we came up with a lot of enforced errors against warrington and in the last 18 weeks of playing that has been uncharacteristic from us
4162082 lo sentimos profundamente por la gente surosetia y los familiares de nuestras fuerzas de paz que murieron a manos de los agresores georgianos
4162083 hace s lo unos minutos los rusos entraron en poti en tanques
4162084 algunos de los tipos llevan brazaletes azules lo que significa que deben ser fuerzas de paz
4162085 ahora no hay ning n blindado o tropas en la ciudad de poti
4162086 creo que lo que hicieron fue volarlas con algunos explosivos
4162087 esperamos que tambi n hoy las tropas rusas se retiren de zugdidi ciudad georgiana casi en la frontera con abjasia y que tendremos todo el control sobre gori
4162088 dauuummmm my parents sure did a good job on me
4162089 there is no way that i will ever live in a pink house
4162090 honey i understand that you have reservations about that pink house
4162091 if you dont like it i just wanted you to know that ive found a suitable back up property we could always live here instead i just love it
4162092 our affiliates have asked us for more local items because theyve gone hyperlocal themselves
4162093 all of us are in the same boat with charter trying to kill public educational and governmental access television because that bandwith is worth literally 12 million dollars a year to them

4162095 a huge number of people in reno sparks and washoe county will no longer have access to the information programming and media that was provided for them by federal law
4162096 unless a wide majority of viewers go out of their way to buy the digital box and actively search out the public education and government peg channels they will miss the opportunity to see what their local governments are doing

4162101 from a potent covert operations unit to a league of democracies that can bypass the balky united nations from an expanded nato that will bump up against russian interests in central asia and the caucasus to a revived us unilateralism that will engage in rogue state rollback against his version of the axis of evil in all it s a new apparatus designed to carry the war on terror deep into the twenty first century
4162102 if youve followed senator john mccain at all youve heard about
4162103 the thought of his being president sends a cold chill down my spine he is erratic he is hotheaded he loses his temper and he worries me
4162104 no dissent no opinion to the contrary however reasonable will be entertained
4162105 hardheaded is another way to say it arrogant is another way to say it hubristic is another way to say it too proud for his own good is another way to say it its a quality about him that disturbs
4162106 but what you may not have heard is an extended critique of the kind of commander in chief that captain mccain might be
4162107 i personally think the issue is of such paramount importance that
4162108 war prosperity is like the prosperity that an earthquake or a plague brings
4162109 war is harmful not only to the conquered but to the conqueror
4162110 to defeat the aggressors is not enough to make peace durable the main thing is to discard the ideology that generates war
4162111 the root of the evil is not the construction of new more dreadful weapons it is the spirit of conquest
4162112 we should immediately call a meeting of the north atlantic council to assess georgias security and review measures nato can take to contribute to stabilizing this very dangerous situation

4162145 the last four days felt longer than four years it was very hard to lose the first gold of my home olympics but i got a lot of support from my family and coaches and the chinese people
4162146 there was no pressure on me because i had already won the 10m gold
4162147 it really affected my performance because the rain made my gun slippery and i missed several targets

4162158 we have long stood for the normalization of relations between syria and lebanon on the basis of equality and respect for lebanese sovereignty one of the steps that has long been required is the establishment of a proper embassy for syria in lebanon and vice versa
4162159 now if the syrians will go ahead and demarcate the border between lebanon and syria and respect lebanons sovereignty in other ways then this will have proved to be a very good step
4162160 its quite a compelling activity i didnt like being retired at all
4162161 people will wonder how can i think about going back to that if i was a golfer people wouldnt raise their eyebrows its just dangerous period

4162165 hes very down to earth and theres no airs and graces
4162166 i will wait until the final training session and see how he is in training thats when i will make a decision on that
4162167 hes an excellent pro hes been working totally independently to anything that might be happening outside the football and any speculation has been dealt by his agent hes just been getting on with things professionally in training
4162168 if you ask any manager they always want their best players available dimitar is no different
4162169 he is a great player and is carrying himself superbly well through this and we want him to stay but if it is my personal opinion i have no preference one way or another you have to go with what is happening
4162170 hes our player he is at our club and he is a fantastic player it would be great for him to stay
4162171 it is nothing to panic about we have performed very well in recent friendlies they have been great attacking performances so it is not something that concerns me
4162172 we are aware there are only two weeks to go before the end of the window that is something we are working on constantly anyway
4162173 we work without rest to look for players and weve always known the deadline day is the august 31

4162189 we have recently taken a decision to formulate a long term national policy on ex servicemen in consultation with all stakeholders
4162190 a decision has been taken to construct around 1 75 000 houses in four phases under the married accommodation project map
4162191 in the first phase around 50 000 houses are being constructed in 86 cities which are expected to be completed next year in addition we have also approved phase ii of the project for construction of 67 000 dwelling units at the cost of rs 9 400 crores

4162198 we want him to promise he will never leave a priest in ministry after four allegations have been made we want him to promise he will never try to free a convicted child molester from prison early
4162199 did it ever occur to you in 2002 what it would mean to the victims if you had been successful in facilitating early release of this convicted offender
4162200 that fact that he would never function as a priest again was what most of the victims i spoke to were most concerned about not whether he was in prison or not
4162201 we have tried as you know a number of avenues to see if your sentence might be reduced or parole given early i personally hope you will not lose hope
4162202 this is a fathers letter to a son in prison a sinful son and it was designed to give him some hope and encouragement
4162203 because somebody has to tell me information that i might base a letter on and it isnt always sure what a victim will make of such a letter sometimes victims resent being addressed by a bishop out of the blue we ask the victim when can the cardinal apologize when can the cardinal come into the process that is asked right at the beginning
4162204 i would have loved to receive a letter from the cardinal i would like to have that chance to ask questions about my case that would be part of my healing process
4162205 i dont think that anything is going to change but i do think it is important to be heard and this is our way of doing it
4162206 senator clinton understands and appreciates that there are supporters who remain passionate but she has repeatedly urged her supporters to vote for senator obama
4162207 i think some of her supporters have been less than gracious
4162208 ensure that the voices of everyone who participated in this historic process are respected
4162209 the only way a democratic party will have the credibility to elect a democrat in november is if the party uses a legitimate process to choose its nominee
4162210 we are not per se a clinton support group we are a democratic party get your act together support group
4162211 between one candidate john mccain who has always put his country first worked across party lines to get things done and one candidate that has not
4162212 joe lieberman has said things that are totally irresponsible when it comes to barack obama here we have a leader for the future really a great leader for the future and one that comes along only every now and then and they know it so they have to undermine him and one of their best weapons of course is someone who is considered by some to be a democrat
4162213 the democrats in the senate are in a tough spot they have 51 votes joe lieberman organizes with them
4162214 in 85 days or something they will have five more democrats they wont need him to make the majority and it will be interesting to see what the leadership in the senate the democratic leadership in the senate does at that point in terms of joe liebermans chairmanship of his committee
4162215 its hard when youre in a primary election losing is very very difficult

4162217 we can have a piece of offshore drilling but we have to renegotiate the terms
4162218 here we have big oil drilling getting the profits not paying the royalties we want to say in a very protected way you may be able to drill here in the context of a fuller package of renewables and when you do the taxpayers should benefit from that

4162223 crop yields for all the cereals would drop by a third and we would see fields ravaged by disease and weeds
4162224 and the irony is that this threat comes at a time when we are being urged to make food production a priority if the bellies of our european politicians werent full theyd never be considering this legislation
4162225 if this legislation is passed the risk to consumers is far greater from there being nothing on the food shelves in future than from any risk of chemical residue
4162226 this threat to farming is much too far down the line than it should be we must take more time to look at alternatives and invest in research and development before removing these essential chemicals

4162234 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4162235 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4162236 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4162237 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4162241 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4162242 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4162243 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4162244 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4162245 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4162246 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4162247 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
4162248 everyone has their own opinion of what i should do but i think that its my life

4162250 and i think the only decision i can make is to be 100 per cent supportive of myself and not doubt myself at all
4162251 i think planning whats going to happen next year or this fall is going to happen after this week right now all im thinking about is how am i going to play good this week how am i maybe going to possibly win this
4162252 im not going to think about the future right now
4162253 i kind of feel sad for the guidance that she seems to not have in the right direction if she wants to be a golfer she should really concentrate on the being on the womens tour and dealing with them and learning to win

4162255 i never used the r word that gave me an opening but i dont have a timeframe i have a lot on my plate and im excited about the next chapter
4162256 so many times in my career weve left a classic traditional golf course and gone to a new modern style course
4162257 so its nice to be doing the opposite for once

4162259 so hopefully word will spread to the players that this is a great golf course a fun place to play and it will help the tournament out thats no 1 helping the tournament out
4162260 im in a position where i need to play well
4162261 i would be here because i thought it was a good year to support the event when they were changing venues and they needed that support
4162262 its not very long so you dont really need to hit drivers every hole its a tight enough golf course where you can enjoy it as well it requires attention and theres a lot of tricky holes out there its got a lot of variety

4162306 freedom and democracy are under attack but we will not allow this enemy to win the war by restricting our freedoms
4162307 blood must flow there must be widows orphans hands and limbs must be severed and limbs and blood must be spread everywhere in order that allahs religion stand on its feet
4162308 for these militants jihad is a holy war an armed struggle to defeat nonbelievers or infidels and their ultimate goal is to establish an islamic worldwide empire
4162309 islam as a religion does not condone violence the radicals represent only themselves an extremist and violent fringe
4162310 important to make a distinction the vast majority of muslims and arabs are peace loving
4162311 at this point we believe only the male in the black hat was involved is a suspect
4162312 its definitely tested us being in a band together but the great thing is that when things are going really well you get to share it together
4162313 our desire to do middle eastern music really has nothing to do with politics but the love of the music
4162314 im drawn to these strong symbols that do have political charge sometimes with our music we do like to push it especially with our video
4162315 there were some things i wanted to do that were really crossing the line that we didnt end up doing
4162316 ive lived in la forever and i really feel something happening down here that ive never felt ever
4162317 we consider this video though it names no one to be a photographic list of an anti semitic nature and therefore liable to criminal prosecution
4162318 allah is the only true god and muhammad is his messenger
4162319 internal personal struggle to do ones best to resist temptation
4162320 there is no god except allah muhammad is the messenger of allah
4162321 south ossetia is a joint venture between kgb generals and an ossetian gangster who jointly utilise the money disbursed by moscow for fighting with georgia
4162322 when you have a choice between doing nothing and doing a stupid thing it is better to do nothing
4162323 any georgian government that would have done differently would have fallen immediately
4162324 georgians always helped me and i dont feel any pressure now
4162325 today it is quite obvious who the parties in the conflict are they are the us uk israel who participated in training the georgian army ukraine who supplied it with weapons we are facing a situation where there is a nato aggression against us
4162326 we have reason to remember how hitler used this very doctrine little more than half a century ago to undermine and attack substantial parts of central europe
4162327 the remaining residents of these villages are facing desperate conditions with no means of survival no help no protection and nowhere to go
4162328 largely dispel the idea that health care is a purely local service
4162329 the medical travel market is a bit over hyped today but economics dictates why it will become huge over time if a supplier has very high prices and erratic quality it creates an opening for nimbler rivals
4162330 this is not a straw village clinic with rusty scalpels
4162331 they may be based in columbia south carolina but they have competitors and customers in colombia south america as well as in south africa and in asia
4162332 american patients will not make or break any international hospital but being able to attract them will enhance its reputation
4162333 the bigger difference is the way health care is delivered
4162334 innovation will come from many places as the health care market goes global and flat very fast
4162335 is not really about exporting patients it is importing competition
4162336 en als je nagaat dat japan onze paal heeft geraakt en in de andere wedstrijd amerika nog bijna voor ons fataal gelijk had gemaakt dan mogen we niet klagen
4162337 ja bijzonder we hebben deze plek er gelukkig nog uit weten te slepen
4162338 if this shoot had gone any longer i would have gone mad
4162339 it was full immersion in this world fortunately the kids kept me sane they knew what was going on and they could talk about it one of the kids parents was even a psychologist so we had some professional guidance through this horror but in the end it all came down to catherine and ellen and whether they would have the strength to see this through
4162340 i have to say ellen page was as committed as you can be to a single project and catherine who is as warm a person as you can imagine gave herself over to gertrude it was incredible to see her change from her role as harper lee in capote which was such a beautiful and delicate dramatic performance to her presence as gertrude she could have played her as such a monster but she finds a way to make her human
4162341 we really bonded we had no egos on set and we leaned on each other to get through it at times i think it was almost harder on catherine than it was on me there were times when i felt like a real jerk
4162342 i think there were moments when we werent that nice
4162343 and given the material and the characters we were playing thats to be expected its stressful and its all consuming and it affects you
4162344 i was in a position where i felt myself judging gertrude i know you hear actors say you cant judge the character youre playing but i judged gertrude and let me tell you even though there arent supposed to be good guys and bad guys in this i have a definite opinion about who the bad guy is
4162345 thats just me as a person as far as the work goes i found myself asking the same questions the audience probably does you know how does something like this happen theres something in us that we clearly dont want to see and i think tommy did a good job teasing out the demons
4162346 i did a lot of research on psychological torture and the stories stick with you
4162347 there are a lot of victims out there and a lot of them never have a chance to be heard i felt i had to make this movie for sylvia likens and the other victims of abuse out there whose stories are never told things never change if people ignore the truth and i think as horrifying as this movie is it s the truth and that really is scary
4162348 a nation which can prefer disgrace to danger is prepared for a master and deserves one
4162349 russia looks stronger economically and militarily than it really is the siloviki ex kgb oligarchs know it so do we

4162354 affordable housing covers a whole range of areas from public housing to an inability of people to be able to buy their first home
4162355 we want the conference to highlight all of the areas which would preclude people buying or renting affordable accommodation
4162356 im keen to understand what role the council might play and we have had discussions with a number of people regarding the formation of a housing co operative
4162357 we want to try and find out ways in which other areas have dealt with this issue and hopefully then find some interested people locally who will pick up some of the ideas and run with them

4162366 on hinchinbrook island i saw one of the guinea pigs standing on the beach with his back turned to us
4162367 his back was just one mass of huge long wide flat blisters it was a horrendous sight that drove home to us just how careful and vigilant we had to be and what we were dealing with
4162368 an english scientist was standing behind him legs spread wide with a scalpel and his hand slicing open these huge blisters and the fluid was fast running in a flood down the rest of his body to the ground
4162369 the pocket entered right next to me and i breathed it in

4162379 i would reiterate it is not our intention to destroy her garden but to remove noxious weeds and hazardous material
4162380 my property is not overgrown it has healthy trees and palms for shade and privacy
4162381 i had seven trees cut and containers filled and taken away
4162382 i am being victimised never is the work my gardener does satisfactory
4162383 my worry is that they say it is overgrown and that means chainsaws and if i let them in what can i do to stop them if they start flattening everything
4162384 in six months there will be more trees more palms more leaves on the ground and it will start all over again
4162385 it is a vicious cycle and i am just victimised
4162386 i think they are only interested in bulldozing and concrete

4162526 during the investigation a barrel was seen moving by itself by a couple of people in the cellar and the name tom was picked up by one of the two mediums the smoking room revealed its secrets
4162527 the mediums picked up the name william as the invisible occupants name although he said through spirit communication using a glass that he was happy with the name john a name given to him by the landlady who thinks of him as one of the family
4162528 there was a lot of strange knocking and the glass was going mad on the table
4162529 a medium who came in as a guest also sensed a death by fire which might tie in with the historical evidence that shows that a fire gutted the building in 1904
4162530 the spirits of four holy men were sensed and that ties in very nicely with rumours that a tunnel once led from the cellar to the nearby church

4162549 we went to an ohio state football practice and i was really amazed at how big all the players were
4162550 i looked at football and all the team spirit there was in it and i said to myself thats something id like to try out
4162551 its a shame the sport and the league were really growing in europe youd have as many as 45 000 coming to the games
4162552 negotiate with theocracy that seeks to keep women subservient to men and uneducated and kill anyone who converts to another religion

4162554 drug addicts do not come to their addiction from a social or environmental vacuum this court should not close its eyes to the multifarious circumstances of disadvantage and deprivation that frequently precede and precipitate a descent into illegal drug use
4162555 nor can i accept that the exercise of free choice in the use of drugs is always of equal dimensions it is not every decision to use drugs that can properly or fairly be characterized as a decision made in the exercise of free choice the will of an individual can be overborne or undermined not only by acts of another person but also the pressure of circumstances i do not accept that most drug offenders are truly exercising free will when they choose the degradation despair criminality and cycle of imprisonment that can follow the initial use of illegal drugs the circumstances that propel the offender to use drugs are often if not usually beyond his or her control they may or may not be combined with a vulnerable personality or even a weakness of character many drug offenders have not had the life experiences or the normal developmental path that permit a conclusion that the decision to take drugs was a decision made in the exercise of a free choice in the sense in which that phrase is ordinarily understood

4162561 we are impressed by deep commitment to maritime traditions at atlantic challenge and very excited about the opportunities for our students district youth will undoubtedly benefit from this unique opportunity
4162562 it is significant that the after school sailing program is the first partnership we present to community youth under the rasa partnership
4162563 broadreach and msad 5 began their collaboration more than a year ago to increase youth involvement in unique area offerings such as those out of atlantic challenge
4162564 the need to have solidarity and maintain a balance in football
4162565 i can guarantee continents like south america and africa are behind us on this as they are the main suppliers for big european clubs and are suffering from the exodus of their players
4162566 what we dont have is information on exactly where caylee was last the one person who has that information is casey anthony and she is not providing information thats accurate to us

4162569 ultimately this will allow us to create better biofuel crops
4162570 right now about half of the biofuel crops dont have genomic databases and the ones that do are in many different places and are annotated differently which makes it difficult to compare and use the information
4162571 our biofuel genomic database portal will include information on any crop that can be used to produce cellulosic ethanol including all the grasses such as corn rice maize wheat and other biofuel species such as poplar willow and pine
4162572 this will save researchers a lot of effort so we expect it to be a valuable resource for scientists at msu and around the world
4162573 cellulosic biofuels offer one of the best near to mid term alternatives we have on the energy production side to reduce reliance and imported oil and cut greenhouse gas emissions while continuing to meet the nations transportation energy needs
4162574 developing cost effective means of producing cellulosic biofuels on a national scale poses major scientific challenges
4162575 and these grants will help in developing the type of transformational breakthroughs needed in basic science to make this happen
4162576 who do you call a slave you f ing jew
4162577 i dont want to be killed for my t shirts
4162578 this is very disturbing to me that i am living in new york city and that i own a boutique for more than five and a half years in neighborhoods which are suppose to be the most open minded and tolerant to any kind of art but instead people dont understand me hate me and dont let me express myself the way everyone should be able to in new york
4162579 these low cost amplifying devices can look tempting to individuals with hearing impairment because of the significant cost differences
4162580 but our research found that the low cost aids generally dont meet the fitting requirements to help a hearing impaired person and could potentially damage a persons hearing
4162581 aside from being of extremely poor quality very low cost hearing aids those under 100 have the potential to damage your hearing because they send very loud sounds into the ear the studys mid range hearing aids 100 500 were of higher quality and were not considered a safety hazard
4162582 based on the research the best advice for consumers is to talk to an audiologist because hearing aids have complex technical features they need to be fitted and customized to the individual
4162583 currently more than 32 million people have a hearing impairment yet only about 25 percent of those use hearing aids
4162584 meanwhile the aging population is growing and hearing loss becomes more common as we become older

4162589 it was intended for students in michigan who are underrepresented in college applications and attendance
4162590 there are academically qualified students in this state who arent applying for college
4162591 i tell students to set some limits and allow yourself to meet people outside of the virtual world
4162592 life can be viewed in virtual time but it can only be experienced in real time
4162593 one of the most important conversations that should be held prior to a student entering college is the money talk with parents
4162594 as uncomfortable as it might be having the discussion before school starts will ensure a happy college experience for the entire family
4162595 we actually advise students to consider getting a credit card if they do not have one when they arrive on campus
4162596 simply because todays world assumes that every consumer has one
4162597 its ok if that means you have to use a tax return that is a year old
4162598 until the student graduates the fafsa must be renewed each year shortly after jan 1 for the upcoming year
4162599 its easy to take the stressors of college and focus on how you look
4162600 there is a genetic component and an environmental component so if you already have a genetic predisposition the stressors of college life could increase your risk for disordered eating
4162601 find out what your body can do for you rather than comparing yourself to the person sitting next to you in class
4162602 in the past many families would plan to arrive early to avoid the crowds but this actually created larger crowds in the early morning hours
4162603 by spreading check in times throughout the day the demand for elevators carts parking spaces and traffic congestion will lessen and make more of a less stressful event
4162604 other resource books of this type did not address some of the issues that plagued our students disproportionately so we the summer university program excellence required staff authored this book
4162605 anytime you see things suspicious or out of place call 911 immediately
4162606 we dont want students to get tickets if they dont have to
4162607 as summer comes to a close law enforcement officers across the state will be working hard to catch drunk drivers before they kill or injure innocent people or themselves
4162608 celebrating the end of summer responsibly is simple plan ahead and always designate a sober driver
4162609 a lot of central texas and blackland region yields have been disappointing
4162610 it was so wet so cold on todays rating that yield projection for the area of 155 bushels to the acre is just amazing whats interesting in the report they lowered planted acres and increased harvested that tells you they got the crop back in replanted it or the crop survived on some acres that werent expected to
4162611 this will give incentive to feed more and convert more to ethanol

4162613 in 1999 and 2005 ifc helped us upgrade and expand our corrugated paper and packaging business these investments have speeded our modernization efforts significantly
4162614 the new technologies have improved the quality of our products making them more competitive and familiar in international markets this has increased sales and profitability and enabled us to increase employment
4162615 ifc is pleased with altyn ajydars progress over the last 10 years
4162616 the company has the opportunity to reach new markets after diversifying into building materials which will also benefit the growing construction industry in the kyrgyz republic and across central asia this investment underlines ifcs continuing commitment to companies that generate employment and foster economic growth in frontier markets

4162619 i collected it and took it to the vet for treatment and thats when we discovered it had a very unusual microchip
4162620 i nicknamed it herman the german and set about trying to track the owner down
4162621 i was told to contain the cat and keep it in isolation while defra tried to trace it but they were unable to
4162622 so after four months in isolation i was told the cat could be rehomed
4162623 she barely recognised the cat because shes so fat from lying about in a cage for so long but shes a very happy and very lucky owner
4162624 i would say 110 is where it might go something like that
4162625 cooperation with ifc is important for us to help people change their living conditions we hope it will strengthen our institutional capacity and enable us to expand our mortgage portfolio
4162626 ifc wants to help bai tushum make housing more affordable for people in the kyrgyz republic we are optimistic that our support will strengthen bai tushums mortgage business making it a model for other kyrgyz financial institutions
4162627 we were pleased with the waca reaction that the new playing dates offer local fans including corporate groups wanting to entertain at the cricket good dates for a pre christmas test match
4162628 the united states spent 45 years working very hard to avoid a military confrontation with russia

4162630 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
4162631 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
4162632 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
4162633 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
4162634 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
4162635 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas

4162641 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche
4162642 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados

4162651 no queremos que sea una firma m s de la que muchos han firmado sino que nos preocuparemos d a a d a hora tras hora de que este convenio pueda llegar a su etapa final lo que se recupere aqu no es para hacerlo picadillo de cebolla sino que ser algo hist rico para el pueblo mapuche
4162652 hemos recuperado la totalidad del espacio que ocupaba la fuerza a rea y estamos con la parte t cnica con nuestros asesores que es el observatorio de derechos de pueblos ind genas y con los ejecutivos del gobierno regional para avanzar metro a metro y ac no poemos hablar de bicentenario sino de reinvindicaci n y reconocimiento de nuestros territorios
4162653 la culminaci n de un proceso de conversaci n de dialogo que hemos desarrollado y que ha tenido muchas vivisitudes en el camino los anuncios de la presidenta el 1 de abril son los caminos para dar respuestas a las necesidades que tienen nuestros pueblos
4162654 que quisieramos iniciar con todas las comunidades de nuestro pa s la presidenta bachelet nos ha se alado que este es el camino y las comunidades de maquehue nos enorgullesen porque han entendido y hecho efectiva esta invitaci n estos hechos que parecen peque os van marcando nuestra historia este convenio contiene una serie de iniciativas de inversi n donde nos comprometemos la administraci n p blica los servicios a cumplir los anuncios de la presidenta de este nuevo pacto por el re conocer en este convenio se conjugan valores de participaci n de respeto de sensibilidad social y de compensaci n con los pueblos originarios de la deuda hist rica que tenemos como sociedad
4162655 hoy en las palabras de la propia intendenta el t rmino compensacion fue utilizada y el propio convenio habla de la demanda de recuperaci n territorial
4162656 este tipo de racismo social y ambiental es una violaci n de derechos humanos y es una forma de discriminaci n que viene agrediendo al medio ambiente la salud biodiversidad la econom a local la calidad de vida y seguridad en nuestras comunidades esta discriminaci n racial es ocasionada por las pol ticas p blicas y privadas y que se manifiesta en la intenci n de que los costos e impactos sean asumidos por nosotros los mapuches junto a la exclusi n manifiesta en la toma de decisiones que afectan nuestras vidas

4162660 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas
4162661 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
4162662 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades
4162663 esta violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales
4162664 hay un uso excesivo de la facultad de los fiscales que han ordenado el ingreso de funcionarios de fuerzas especiales y del grupo de operaciones especiales
4162665 de mantenerse esta l gica lo m s probable es que vamos a cosechar desgracias
4162666 en nuestro pa s han sido declarados enemigos los j venes que expresan su descontento por la ausencia de perspectivas de futuro los estudiantes que se oponen a la mercantilizaci n de la educaci n los trabajadores sindicalizados que luchan por condiciones laborales dignas y los mapuches que exigen la restituci n de sus tierras ancestrales
4162667 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
4162668 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
4162669 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
4162670 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
4162671 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
4162672 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos

4162680 for those in industry the number of geoscience jobs will grow by 22 from 2006 to 2016 much faster than the projected total of a 10 increase for all occupations according to the u s bureau of labor statistics

4162797 this act is the legacy of the countless children including danny keysar whose parents founded kids in danger who have been killed or injured by unsafe childrens products and toys
4162798 it is to honor their memories that we must now undertake the implementation of this landmark measure
4162799 this new product safety law is responsive to the mounting evidence and dire consequences of our broken product safety net this bill patches up our current system by giving the cpsc the resources regulatory authority and enforcement tools it needs to protect consumer from hazards posed by unsafe products
4162800 we applaud congress and the president for supporting this critical reform and urge the cpsc to implement this law effectively
4162801 this long overdue law gives the cpsc the shot in the arm that it desperately needs
4162802 it is now up to the cpsc to use the tools given to them by this law and restore the confidence of consumers in the products on store shelves
4162803 this is a huge victory for consumers over big business
4162804 this law puts safety first by making new and important changes like requiring that toys be tested for safety before they are sold and creating an internet database where consumers can share information about dangerous products
4162805 protecting americas littlest consumers better was always a good idea but now its the law
4162806 we look forward to working with a stronger cpsc with more tools at its disposal
4162807 we especially appreciate the visionary features of the new law such as its ban on toxic phthalate chemicals in childrens products and its creation of a revolutionary new publicly accessible database of potential hazards
4162808 for the first time it bans several chemicals from childrens toys at the same time it requires more research be conducted on those chemicals rather than allowing potentially dangerous exposures while research is underway i hope the message is clear chemical companies can not neglect their responsibility to do well designed safety research and then use the lack of evidence of risk as a justification to sell potentially dangerous products
4162809 we hope the enactment of this law marks the beginning of an era of more transparency and scientific integrity not only at the cpsc but all federal agencies

4162811 the one year vaccination frequency recommendations for rabies found on many vaccine labels is based only on historical precedent not on scientific data
4162812 of particular note has been the association of auto immune hemolytic anemia with vaccination of dogs and vaccine associated cancers in cats
4162813 the reason i had to write this book is the veterinarian choosing collegiality over fixing their vaccination protocols the legislation drafts are already written making companion animals living property rather than a couch which they are by law and also would be a deterrent to over vaccination through loss of companionship damages it all boils down to this over vaccination has caused physical and fiscal harm knowingly due to their business model and the failure of veterinary ethics
4162814 mondays claim from howard wolfson clintons communications director during the campaign that two thirds of edwards supporters would have supported clinton is just not supported in data collected directly from those who actually participated in the caucuses
4162815 had edwards not been running and if nothing else had changed my data suggest that obama would have ended up even further ahead of clinton than he was
4162816 as the campaign progressed few edwards supporters i knew gave any indication that clinton was their second choice
4162817 in my own caucus which i chaired when our edwards group was initially declared non viable there was discussion of moving but to obama not clinton in the end we gained viability by bringing over richardson and biden forces and by negotiating with the obama group
4162818 an iowa campaign without edwards would have had a totally different dynamic with a different focus on issues with different media coverage for all of the candidates and probably with some breathing room for bill richardson or joe biden
4162819 if youve never been in iowa during a caucus campaign you cant begin to understand how the dynamic works how candidate focused it really is take out one candidate and its an entirely different animal

4162822 we used to think air pollution was a problem that primarily affects the lungs we now know it is also bad for the heart
4162823 there doesnt have to be an environmental catastrophe for air pollution to cause injury
4162824 were talking about very modest increases air pollution can be dangerous at levels that are within the accepted air quality standards
4162825 patients with cardiovascular disease shouldnt exercise outside on days with increased air pollution levels on very polluted days they should consider staying inside and during the winter they should limit exposure to fireplace smoke
4162826 of course the real solution is to reduce air pollution
4162827 the review by dr simkhovich and his fellow authors make it quite clear that air pollution is linked to cardiovascular disease
4162828 they suggest that this is another compelling reason to campaign for improved air quality while at the same time studying therapies to minimize the risk of exposures
4162829 globally xdr tb has resulted from a combination of poor tb control practices poor adherence to medications inappropriate use of second line drugs lack of laboratory capacity to culture tb or assess drug susceptibility and high hiv prevalence
4162830 in order to prevent an escalation in xdr tb we need to ensure adherence to the cornerstones of tb management which include directly observed therapy isolation of infectious cases and contact investigations we also need to institute routine rapid and standardized methods to assess drug susceptibility of tb isolates
4162831 our amnesia about what is natural is the greatest threat to the environment
4162832 some may say that it is irresponsible to make such predictions pending further detailed study to be sure of every point however we will never be certain about every detail and it would be irresponsible to remain silent in the face of what we already know
4162833 lack of political will and the greed of special interests
4162834 simply enforcing the standards of the magnuson stevens act and the u s national marine fisheries service would result in major improvements in u s waters within a decade
4162835 before symptoms develop and you become aware of the bugs presence it has already begun to attack your cells similarly fish and other organisms are affected by contaminants before behavioral changes appear our technology detects heretofore undetectable changes to act as an early warning system
4162836 this means the technology could not only help monitor environmental quality but may be used to enforce important water quality standards
4162837 this study was all the more exciting to be a part of due to its potential applications in protecting human health
4162838 california public school students are continuing to make solid steady progress learning the skills and concepts necessary for success in school and in life since 2003 532 494 more california students have become proficient in english language arts and 415 129 more students have become proficient in math while we still have a lot of work to do to reach our goal of universal proficiency this years gains are particularly encouraging considering they build upon five years of steady growth
4162839 the results also show significant increases in science and social science california has some of the highest standards in the nation and i am exceptionally proud of the hard work and dedication of our students teachers administrators paraprofessionals and parents that led to this achievement
4162840 while we celebrate the progress made by all subgroups of students over the last five years we cannot lose sight of the fact that more than half of our students and too many students of color are still not meeting our high standards
4162841 it is good news that all students continue to improve it is imperative that we help those students who have historically struggled the most to accelerate their learning so they may effectively and fully participate in school the workforce and in society
4162842 it is a moral and economic imperative that we close the achievement gap california cannot afford to allow our latino students and our african american students to continue to lag academically behind their peers
4162843 while we must close the gap that exists between all subgroups i am acutely concerned about our african american students african american students as a whole scored in english language arts just one point above latino students a subgroup that includes a significant number of english learners this coupled with an alarming dropout rate among african americans indicates a crisis in the education of black children
4162844 my statewide p 16 council has made a series of recommendations aimed at closing the achievement gap and improving the way we provide education services to african american students we must redouble our efforts to find and share effective strategies that will help african american students succeed

4162860 at reception scott morris was taking a call he told the defendant he wouldnt be a moment and to take a seat
4162861 mr morris then had to leave the reception momentarily but indicated he would be back quickly he said he could hear the word ldquo bastard
4162862 mr morris warned the defendant that he would call security and asked if the words were being directed at him
4162863 at this point a health care assistant came to reception and the defendant swore when telling her the man had been on the phone and was ignoring him
4162864 she said the defendant had his finger constantly pressed on the bell
4162865 when she asked him to take a seat the defendant became very agitated he came so close their faces were touching
4162866 he then shouted lsquo listen white bitch ill sit down when i want to sit down
4162867 she said he lifted his left hand above his head and she believed he was about to hit her
4162868 a security guard tried to deal with the incident he said the defendant was gesturing with his fingers in the shape of a gun saying lsquo ill come back and shoot you
4162869 they were a little late for their appointment and the defendant was clearly concerned that they had missed the appointment
4162870 i accept that his behaviour was completely unacceptable but this was a one off loss of control

4162893 healthy market fundamentals continue to present opportunity in local real estate as conditions tilt towards buyers in years second quarter
4162894 according to figures from the multiple listing service mls of the chattanooga association of realtors southeast tennessee and northwest georgia saw 1 759 units sold in the second quarter this figure represents a 19 6 percent decline from the 2007 second quarter comparing this years first and second quarter sales market statistics reflect a 20 percent increase
4162895 with the local market filled with plentiful choices in housing and at affordable and realistic prices chattanooga is showing why this is the right real estate market for more and more people ready to make the move
4162896 were finding our clients who are ignoring the hype and opening the door to the great opportunities this market presents are very happy with what they find but we cant say how long these conditions are going to last
4162897 i think our market is underperforming as buyers continue to sit on the sidelines trying to time the market
4162898 the reality is this is the right time the right market and delaying a decision isnt going to serve the serious buyer waiting around kicking the tires it only keeps someone from realizing all that homeownership has to offer with tax saving opportunities freedom to make home improvements the chance to build up your nest egg and all the social benefits homeownership does to strengthen the community the benefits of homeownership reach far and wide
4162899 good jobs and economic development strongly impact real estate markets with the recent announcement from volkswagen and the ancillary effects it will bring to our region the local market will remain viable and rewarding for many years to come

4162908 with violence escalating the troubled state of jammu and kashmir is again at the brink of catastrophe
4162909 to end this cycle of tragedy the government should order security forces to act with restraint and all parties should try to settle the dispute peacefully
4162910 political leaders and civil society in jammu and kashmir should seek a mutually agreeable solution to the immediate crisis so that peace is restored
4162911 however unless there is justice for previous crimes jammu and kashmir will remain a tinderbox that can be set aflame by anyone with a vested interest in the conflict

4162951 im really hoping the update helps a lot of existing owners that are frustrated with the difficulty to enjoy the game ive spent a lot of time on tuning the difficulty particularly on recruit and soldier and brought more folks through to play it so this should be closer to the mark in being accessible from very casual to hardcore gamers and believe me im still including a challenging mode for those that want it

4162966 with the number of hispanic internet users in the u s expected to rise to nearly 21 million by 2010 its clear that marketers have a tremendous opportunity to grow their consumer base by successfully targeting hispanics online
4162967 the problem is most marketers have questioned if and how online venues are an effective channel for communicating with hispanics in conducting this research we set out to help our clients understand if and how they can use online communities to successfully engage members of this important consumer segment and what differences within this broad and diverse population should be considered in formulating a community strategy our findings offer valuable insight not only for businesses evaluating online communities but also for marketers considering other online channels such as social networks as a strategy for engaging hispanics online

4162978 cyberbullying is a relatively new phenomenon as is social networking
4162979 it is therefore not surprising that there have been relatively few prosecutions in this area
4162980 as a tool to address all manner of cyber crimes

4162990 the potential for alarmism is high and therefore this paper invites the highest level of scrutiny which it does not in my view sufficiently bear to warrant publication
4162991 people often talk about this as the internet service revolution
4162992 that will eventually lead to machines that have lots of server capacity lots of low cost computing low cost storage and that will let us write software in an even more ambitious way eliminating the last constraints we have
4162993 to encompass all interactive techniques the touch the speech the vision
4162994 because theyre fairly developed in the labs i can say that in 10 years will be widespread
4162995 you might get artificial intelligence or robotics but those are still so undeveloped at least in terms of widespread impact

4163079 every time there is a by election we will take part never has the bn missed any by election the voters in permatang pauh should be given a choice as to who they want as their representative

4163083 about 20 6 per cent of malaysians suffer from high cholesterol putting them in the high risk bracket for coronary heart diseases
4163084 we are fully aware that most malaysians eat out due to their busy schedules and also because of the easy access to food be it malay chinese indian western eastern food of their choice
4163085 its because many are suffering from chronic diseases that the ministry has embarked on the healthy cafeteria concept where people are alerted on what they eat and the calories they consume in each meal

4163091 health departments and non governmental organisations should continue organising programmes on the benefits of mothers milk to create greater awareness among mothers
4163092 therefore i hope programmes like these will help increase the knowledge about mothers milk and the option to look for the best nutrition for children

4163102 people like to listen when anwar says he can reduce the petrol price some people may believe him
4163103 its not just a new face we need its new faces
4163104 my big concern is that anybody we bring in now probably wont be ready to start the premier league season
4163105 we cant hide the fact that we need new players everybody knows it we have to get five or six players in before the season starts
4163106 we are proud to be associated with the desaru pengerang international triathlon and we see it as an event which will put the beach resort of desaru on the world map

4163116 we have added the mixed triples this year in a bid to enlarge the championships some 62 bowlers from 11 countries will be here to contest the four events
4163117 we have decided to let leo messi play in the olympics
4163118 both have been training hard and are reaching their peak so with a favourable draw i think the girls will be able to win a medal
4163119 both the girls worked very hard in korea during the one month stint interestingly chew chan is faster and she has added some speed on certain techniques while elaine is definitely better prepared compared to 2004 athens outing
4163120 the training now is more focused on skill which is very crucial and they are training three times a week but the sessions are short and intense
4163121 if i perform well and get a good draw theres a chance of me beating the odds
4163122 ive also done some homework by watching video clips of some of my opponents im more or less ready for the challenge
4163123 its better than rugby safer it is very easy to get injured in rugby
4163124 i played rugby in school i was a backliner but very few make it to the national team i did not make it
4163125 however its a victory for me and malaysian bowling as now people in the us know about our prowess in the sport the outstanding run here is also a confident booster before i start my pba womens tour campaign
4163126 now i know where i stand among the professionals a top four finish is a fantastic achievement but i must prepare well for the tour as the malaysian public will have higher expectations
4163127 i may not be competing in any tournaments during the fasting month
4163128 however i will be training by myself during that period
4163129 games like that definitely leave a sour taste in your mouth but it makes you more determined to get them in the future
4163130 in terms of physicality were used to playing against teams that are going to beat the crap out of us because we are so good
4163131 people have to stop us somehow and thats the way theyre going to stop us especially people like us penny taylor and myself and belinda snell who you just cant let go to the basket because well kill people
4163132 so theyre going to really stop us anyway that they can and generally thats when black eyes and broken bones occur
4163133 the great thing about the american team is that most of them are very good friends of ours so when we get out on the court we know it isnt personal but it is a dogfight and people are going to get hurt
4163134 whatever however you want to do it youve just got to go out there and do whatever it takes to win gold we play hard we dont try to play dirty
4163135 theres a very healthy rivalry thats good for womens basketball
4163136 we have prepared for the beijing olympics for seven years and now we are ready we are very con dent indeed that we will stage a successful olympics
4163137 of course we hope that these will be a great games even the greatest
4163138 i think australia were the better team in 2004 and frankly we could not have hoped for more than a silver
4163139 i think australia would again be everyones favourites and that is not a bad thing for us as favourites it can sometimes be a struggle to meet the expectations of people
4163140 we were supposed to be the team to beat in sydney in 2000 but struggled through the group matches before winning the final
4163141 we are now in a similar situation as in 1996 when we won our first gold medal it was a very open competition but there was no pressure on us
4163142 we are one of the teams that can go far in the tournament
4163143 but so can australia germany spain and korea we have to take it one match at a time and see what happens
4163144 the world cup is still two years away so i dont know
4163145 this is surely my last olympics but i will take a decision on my future after i return home from beijing
4163146 i want to continue playing for my club for a few more years it is possible to play at the top level when you are over 30 but hockey is a pretty physical sport
4163147 one really has to be in top condition and it shows if you are not in shape that is the time to give up you have to live for the sport my body still feels good though
4163148 when i played the first time i played to win
4163149 it is no different now i still play to win
4163150 i think if anyone in the world can possibly do it its michael
4163151 i think it will be a great story over the nine days of competition there will be a lot of people watching hoping to see history
4163152 theres a large number of nations that are going to take the medals this time
4163153 im sure this will be the most spread of medals weve ever seen at the olympic games
4163154 great britain were fourth at the world championships in the points score a lot of small european nations will come along and take some
4163155 i think the french have been big improvers after their trials theyre probably well and truly the favourites in the mens 4x100 freestyle
4163156 it the injury was a setback especially mentally but at the same time it helped me being away from the media for a while no interviews for three or four weeks
4163157 its really kept me relaxed i havent had anxiety about the whole olympics because ive just been in rehab so i think its really helped mentally
4163158 ive had a lot of treatment on it and this is the olympics so im sure that with all the adrenalin flowing im going to be at 100 per cent im going out there to win the gold medal even with all my setbacks
4163159 usain bolt has done something no ones ever done and thats run the 100 metres hat fast
4163160 hes set the world on fire with the 9 72 the 9 76 and the 9 8 hes on fire right now and a 19 6 just to top it all off in the 200 it shows that hes an all around athlete
4163161 asafa should be the favourite but hes been the dark horse and i think thats how he likes it he doesnt have any pressure on him
4163162 im feeling pretty well and really excited that im running fast
4163163 the plan was to train through the trials to peak at the olympics
4163164 bershawn beat me at the trials thats cool second place doesnt really matter in the trials what matters is the olympics and what happens there
4163165 even though i didnt win the trials im still a marked man because im the defending world champion
4163166 theres nothing to worry about ive trained all year i want to have fun and stay relaxed
4163167 my main objective is to be on the podium and bring home a medal
4163168 its an honour to work with him he has coached a lot of olympians and gold medallists
4163169 it was kind of risky but thats the chance you have to take to excel in athletics you have to take chances
4163170 im just very confident this year going 13 strides through 10 hurdles and i want to do that in the olympics as well
4163171 its going to come when it comes you have to be patient
4163172 i saw the birds nest it was really very nice
4163173 im not trying to let the olympics overwhelm me too much i know its a distraction im just trying to relax
4163174 we have one gate in our process we call a styling freeze which is happening in the middle of september
4163175 of course it would have been more meaningful if i had won a medal in athens i came so close but now im only looking at the 2008 olympics thats my desire
4163176 i believe i have a chance of making the final in fact i think that we have a 200 per cent chance as i believe that azizul hasni awang will also make the final that gives a 50 per cent chance of a medal and we cant complain
4163177 azizul is a tremendous talent and i am more matured and physically stronger i believe that we have a great chance if we keep focused
4163178 thats not me i love attention and why should i deflect it to someone else but it is a fact that azizul has improved tremendously over the last year
4163179 for me this is good as there is someone to share the pressure with
4163180 i dont think we should be underestimated in the team sprint though i have to say that the french dutch and spanish are just a little ahead of us just yet
4163181 still anything can happen and who knows we may just deliver a medal
4163182 qualifying is a dream fulfilled and being the flagbearer is a tremendous honour it also means it is recognition of what i have achieved and means pressure but i believe i have prepared well in spain and am just raring to go
4163183 a victory for anwar in permatang pauh is crucial for the pakatan rakyats future
4163184 but 70 per cent said they did not believe it
4163185 voters there are a unique lot having some kind of bond with anwars family
4163186 even umno members voted for wan azizah in the past elections
4163187 if bn can reduce anwars majority say by between 2 000 and 3 000 votes it will be seen as a confidence vote for bn

4163197 its low volume the ftse 100 certainly seems to be stuckbetween 5 450 and 5 550 on the upside

4163230 right now were still on yellow and were still working hard
4163231 theres a little bit of caution but boy hes looking good and were excited and happy for him
4163232 ive come out a couple times and actually played defense and chased him down and made him work to explode and cut
4163233 hes really getting close i cant tell you how excited we are about how far hes come in such a short period of time i have to keep it in perspective but were going to be very smart here and im not going to do anything until the trainers give the green light
4163234 im not a doctor im just telling you where we are right now
4163235 hes made tremendous strides and i would think with carnell anything is possible
4163236 weve got size weve got speed weve got youth weve got a lot of talent and its up to me to get it out of them when its all said and done i hope we have some hard decisions to make
4163237 somebodys got to step up antonio bryant is doing that antonio bryant is the one guy i think from a talent standpoint and obviously now getting some experience in these last three weeks that is picking it up but we need a couple more guys to do that starting sunday i hope
4163238 hes got a lot of talent if you just watch the raw talent you see a guy with size speed and excellent hands hes learning two or three positions right now hes cross training which is really hard but im really impressed with him hes a tremendous worker and he made some plays today again that are exceptional were excited about him
4163239 its hard to imagine that at this point we are at wednesday and hes still not able to move around at full speed id like to see him start and finish a practice before we declare him ready to play
4163240 well its a good start the punt return and kickoff returns are the first play of offense we like to start outside our own 20 or 25 yard line i think we were one of the top teams in football in starting inside our 20 obviously our third down defense our punt return opportunities have to get better we still have a ways to go on our kickoff return we didnt function there as well as id hoped although it was the first preseason game thats got to be an area where we create field position we do have some dynamic returners and guys with pride and hopefully it continues to get better and better special teams coordinator rich bisaccia is one of the best in football in my opinion
4163241 he proved he can run he can catch he can block he can cover kicks hes learned this tremendously difficult offense to learn were really pleased with his abilities that he put on tape he didnt get nervous he showed real poise hes a football player that guy did well for himself
4163242 nothing really has changed here we are in the third week of training camp and youre talking about key football players rb cadillac williams petitgout galloway and garcia we miss those guys but the status hasnt changed pup he doesnt seem close to coming back on the practice field but he is working hard its a credit to him its a hard time for him
4163243 yeah yes there sure is thats why hes not active at this point in time i do know our training staff is working hard and luke is working hard the injury just isnt ready to go yet
4163244 i think hes had a consistent camp as he always does hes a guy that can play inside or outside and hes functional on any phase of special teams hes a team guy and hes a reliable football player
4163245 it is remarkable he got hurt in the last preseason game and hes had some long dark hours during the rehab lonely times but hes in a position now to reap the benefits of all this hard work and we need to see him do that come sunday night

4163251 yes we generally go well in the rain but we cant count on that i enjoy knockhill and the team is eager to make headway in the standings
4163252 i will only be carrying nine kilos in qualifying so hopefully this will translate into a strong grid position in race one which with a bit of luck will give us a good start to the weekend

4163261 the global economy is in a tough spot caught between sharply slowing demand in many advanced economies and rising inflation everywhere notably in emerging and developing economies
4163262 the global economy is at the point of maximum danger
4163263 global institutions are lagging behind in their reactions to modern challenges
4163264 in the recent past the global economy has managed to take large shocks in stride but we think its capacity to absorb them is being increasingly challenged
4163265 how it will navigate through the latest turbulence in financial and commodity markets will crucially depend on how successfully policymakers respond to a fast changing set of risks in many advanced and emerging economies
4163266 the policy doctrines that got us into this mess are bankrupt
4163267 no world leader seems able to discuss the problem let alone forge a solution
4163268 the financial system looks substantially worse now than it did a month ago

4163285 few summits generate such a yawning gap between the rhetoric of world leaders on fighting poverty and climate change and the reality of their comfortable daily lives than at the annual g8 gathering
4163286 if we dont get leadership in the g8 we are in trouble so this summit really has to come up with some pretty substantial proposals if we are not going to see things get significantly worse particularly for poor countries
4163287 all the main issues are transborder issues be it terrorism the food crisis or climate change we are no longer in the era where we can be bound by national borders
4163288 if you think of the g8 as a club of the most influential countries in the global economy its hard to see how you can keep china and india out
4163289 we need these institutions to continue to lend and facilitate economic growth
4163290 troubles are growing so rapidly at some small and mid sized us banks that as many as 150 out of the 7 500 banks across the us could fail over the next 12 to 18 months other lenders are likely to shut branches or seek mergers
4163291 this is a very serious banking crisis theres just no question about that
4163292 is nothing less than an x ray of the entire us financial system

4163294 it is not possible for his party to double its votes especially now that sbys popularity has declined
4163295 pd will have to form a coalition with other parties
4163296 the more coalition partners he has the weaker he will be as he will have to make more compromises
4163297 in 2004 we were new we had nothing and we got 56 seats
4163298 we will defend our seats and build on the foundation we have laid
4163299 a persons popularity goes up and down i am sure when the time comes sbys popularity will rise again
4163300 sbys popularity has declined because of economic factors the increase in fuel and food prices and high unemployment rate
4163301 in fact food prices were soaring even before sby raised the fuel prices in may the high food prices caused hardship to the masses
4163302 sby is seen as achieving success only in the area of security like the peace deal in aceh and the crackdown on terrorists
4163303 his anti corruption campaign once hailed by the middle class is now perceived as being discriminative cracking down only on certain people in a poor developing country filling the stomachs of the grassroots counts very much
4163304 they see the rest of the parties as being part of the government those who are not satisfied with the government will vote for pdip

4163306 chinese people all over the world name their children with word combinations that mean greatness or beautiful things numbers which affect every aspect of life have also been given meanings that are either good and auspicious or bad and negative

4163314 fourth place is probably the worst spot you can get in the olympic games especially by a 10th of a second its extremely disappointing but having said that its the second fastest ive ever been in my life
4163315 obviously i would have loved the medal the first medal for canada would have been awesome to have i couldnt pull through but that doesnt mean we wont be having one soon
4163316 obviously theres added pressure to trying to be the first but this is the olympics
4163317 this is the biggest pressure cooker you are going to find in competition and i thrive on that stuff
4163318 christian bale assault charges result in ultimate punishment that or just a caution
4163319 yes i was a bit nervous at first as primeworks studios set up is a huge one with more than 700 creative staff under me and having to manage the company not only on the local front but also at the regional and international levels
4163320 we provide the content if we are unable to sell finished products like a tv programme or film we can opt to break it down to sell just the script the idea or even the concept
4163321 we can also tailor make programmes for example our clients can choose their talents and give their concept and we can produce for them it depends on what our clients want this way we will be able to support the industry better
4163322 we want to expand on a global platform by exporting more malaysian made content of all genres if we dont do this now we will never move forward and we will never get our products out
4163323 in a nutshell the producers from the tv3 ntv7 8tv and tv9 are working together under primeworks studios
4163324 when we consolidate we have a richer pool of talents and therefore able to sell our content across the borders we are more concerned of the global scenario
4163325 for example if the philippines wants us to produce a sports reality show we would then send our producers there to study the social and cultural scenes of the country so that they get an idea of how to create a show that is attractive and relevant to its viewers there this will also help in opening up their minds
4163326 we have to be ambitious injecting more fresh ideas as the programmes we produce need to be engaging entertaining and relevant
4163327 we are competing on the same ground with other production houses we want astro and rtm to be comfortable with the fact that we are not governed by the four stations
4163328 our intention is not to stifle the industry the existing production houses can still supply to the four channels
4163329 previously programmes like entertainment and magazines shows were sourced internally as it reduced costs but when it comes to dramas our grand brilliance sdn bhd gbsb provides less than 20 per cent of the titles the remainder goes to outside production houses

4163345 i want to show the many things ibu zain did at different phases of her life from childhood to her senior years
4163346 this involved a lot of reading and listening to recorded audio tapes of ibu zains past interviews
4163347 i even went to see her son sulaiman shakib and writer adibah amin we talked about the script and they okayed it without many changes
4163348 all she ever wanted was to see future generations free from colonisation including that of the mind

4163368 one of the things that i said when i met with the governor at one point is that some day shes going to have to stand before god and account for her public service and i hope that shes going to have something better to say than what she does to this point on the protection of the innocent unborn but i said if you go to god and you say well i didnt understand how important this was or i didnt understand that this was such a crucial issue then as your bishop im the one responsible because i didnt do enough to try and make sure of that i told her i wasnt comfortable with that and so i wanted to make sure that she understood what a serious matter this was

4163373 when we interview prospective new territory directors two of the qualities we look for are the innate passion for the game and a strong business background
4163374 we are convinced that mr mignogna has not only the passion for golf but the ability to share his passion with youngsters and to grow the game of golf

4163475 the problem with running a campaign thats based on cult of personality is that cracks in the grandiose facade of obamas life become very damaging
4163476 thats where you can get a readers attention and have substantial impact
4163477 is nothing but a series of lies that were long ago discredited
4163478 the reality is there are many lie filled books like this in the works cobbled together from the internet to make money off a presidential campaign
4163479 the book is going to change a lot of opinions
4163480 its a different version of the man than hes been presenting
4163481 this is an attempt to perpetuate those politics for four more years
4163482 one of the reasons i wrote this book is to keep obama from getting elected
4163483 as it became clear that he was going to win the democratic nomination for president it seemed irresponsible to stand by as so many were offering admiration piety even worship to of all things a politician because the idea of barack obama as a reformer is a great lie
4163484 one thing weve learned so far with biographies in the 21st century is that every book is going to be one persons take
4163485 man of the people the maverick life and career of john mccain
4163486 especially in politics you have a crowded book market and theres probably room for five or six takes that can be totally different
4163487 its ultimately up to the reader to decide which one he likes
4163488 senator obamas campaign encouraged senator clintons name to be placed in nomination as a show of unity and in recognition of the historic race she ran and the fact that she was the first woman to compete in all of our nations primary contests

4163508 i am impressed they are a young side and very keen to learn with a great attitude to training and their rugby their defense is a lot better than i thought it would be so i have been pleasantly surprised about that as a squad they are very skilful and i am really looking forward to watching them play tomorrow night against bath i have only coached rugby league before but the principles of league and union are similar in a lot of areas i am really excited about this challenge
4163509 i am really excited about working with ulster i have been with the team for a few months now and i have enjoyed it so far
4163510 i have always supported ulster one of my earliest memories is watching dr irwin winning an inter pro title here at ravenhill i am enjoying working alongside gg and the rest of the squad and am very much looking forward to the season ahead
4163511 i really enjoy belfast and working with the players they are a great bunch of lads i admire the supporters who come to ravenhill rain hail or shine and i hope they keep up the singing voices this season
4163512 according to irs records approximately 600 individuals residing in the city of duncanville who received social security or veterans benefits during 2007 have not received their economic stimulus payment therefore duncanville residents are eligible to receive over 180 000

4163516 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia
4163517 we insist that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
4163518 russia is putting its aspirations at risk by taking actions in georgia that are inconsistent with the principles of those institutions
4163519 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten a neighbor occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it
4163520 as we move forward the united states and europe must review our multilateral and bilateral arrangements with russia in light of its actions
4163521 im interested in good relations between the united states and russia
4163522 but in the 21st century nations dont invade other nations
4163523 im interested in good relations between the united states and russia
4163524 but in the 21st century nations dont invade other nations
4163525 we see them generally complying and moving back to a position where they can make their exit
4163526 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity
4163527 it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4163528 we will support any decision made by the people of south ossetia and abkhazia
4163529 obviously a little odd to have two educational institutions have to evacuate a building the same day because of cooking
4163530 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4163531 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4163532 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4163533 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4163534 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4163535 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4163536 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4163537 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4163538 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4163539 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4163540 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4163541 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4163542 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4163543 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4163544 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4163545 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4163546 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4163547 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4163548 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
4163549 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
4163550 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4163551 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4163552 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4163553 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4163554 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4163555 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy

4163564 shove off i want to see what happens to anne boleyn at the end of the other bolyen girl no seriously my cousin just ruined it for me i was pretty sure her head gets chopped off like in real history but i couldnt exactly remember because i slept through most of american history in 10th grade it just happened too
4163565 shortly after we started restoring it the original stained glass windows were stolen
4163566 theyd even pulled some of the fireplace bases off and had them sitting in the middle of the room
4163567 my immediate concern is security since this is a historic property
4163568 they were just part of that era when architecture went to extremes
4163569 it was in real bad shape when we started and we did a tremendous amount of work
4163570 it was challenging and at first we had a very good time
4163571 the neighborhood makes it really difficult to keep the house up
4163572 as happens in that neighborhood unfortunately when new ownerships are not quite as fit as the previous one its downward step by step and thats what happened here
4163573 its another for the inspections department to have the manpower to get out there and actually do it
4163574 i think it has a great chance of being sold
4163575 i hope it will appeal to a preservationist who will restore it
4163576 friedman tells stories well with a keen eye for wars absurdities and his own fading illusions of wars glory

4163588 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4163589 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4163590 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4163591 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
4163592 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4163593 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4163594 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4163595 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4163596 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4163597 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4163598 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4163599 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4163600 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4163601 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4163602 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4163603 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4163604 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4163605 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4163606 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4163607 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4163608 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4163609 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4163610 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4163611 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4163612 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4163613 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
4163614 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
4163615 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
4163616 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4163617 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4163618 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4163619 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4163620 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4163621 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4163622 im sorry if anybody thought or took it the wrong way and thought that it was offensive
4163623 poor reputation for insensitivity toward racial issues has been further harmed

4163626 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4163627 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4163628 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
4163629 learning in america is a prisoner of time for the past 150 years american public schools have held time constant and let learning vary some bright hardworking students do reasonably well everyone else from the typical student to the dropout runs into trouble
4163630 i want to apologize for the disruption and difficulty this issue may have caused to our customers and our partners your confidence in vmware is extremely important to us and we are committed to restoring that confidence fully and quickly
4163631 we are doing everything in our power to make sure this doesnt happen again
4163632 vmware prides itself on the quality and reliability of our products and this incident has prompted a thorough self examination of how we create and deliver products to our customers we have kicked off a comprehensive in depth review of our qa quality assurance and release processes and will quickly make the needed changes
4163633 the issue was caused by a piece of code that was mistakenly left enabled for the final release of update 2
4163634 this piece of code was left over from the prerelease versions of update 2 and was designed to ensure that customers are running on the supported generally available version of update 2

4163637 what will u s suburbs look like in 40 years
4163638 the suburbs have three destinies none of them exclusive as materials salvage as slums and as ruins
4163639 we will have to return to traditional modes of inhabiting the landscape villages towns and cities composed of walkable neighborhoods and business districts and the successful ones will have to exist in relation to a productive agricultural hinterland because petro agriculture as represented by the infamous 3000 mile caesar salad is also now coming to an end fortunately we have many under activated small towns and small cities in favorable locations near waterways this will be increasingly important as transport of goods by water regains importance
4163640 if gentrification continues in a significant way large numbers of suburban households looking for urban stimulation may end up switching places with minority central city dwellers stirring the ethnic pot in both places
4163641 in 40 years perhaps well get beyond our fixation with
4163642 el gobierno boliviano va a garantizar autonom as para toda bolivia pero en el marco de la legalidad y de la constitucionalidad
4163643 siento que s lo quieren plata los prefectos opositores y no tocar otros asuntos sin interpretar lo que piensa el pueblo boliviano
4163644 yo llego a la conclusi n de que el pueblo boliviano quiere autonom as quiere una nueva constituci n pol tica del estado
4163645 ahora ning n prefecto puede hablar de dos tercios m s de dos tercios de la gente quiere juntar la nueva constituci n con los estatutos auton micos

4163648 una vez que pongan a consideraci n este documento esperaremos las reacciones del mismo para continuar en una pr xima sesi n entre los prefectos y el presidente y cerrar preacuerdos que permitan viabilizar el trabajo de las mesas t cnicas y tem ticas
4163649 creo que ese ser el camino hacia delante en virtud de que no estamos notando en los prefectos que no hay una convicci n de los prefectos de reconocer que hay un proyecto de constituci n con una amplia legitimidad
4163650 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4163651 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4163652 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4163653 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4163654 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4163655 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4163656 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4163657 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4163658 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4163659 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems

4163669 dont look so worried arthur the drug bust is just a publicity stunt my grand children are typical teenagers really its a phase they all go through these days
4163670 the whole bloody world is going through a phase if you ask me
4163671 will it come out the other end is the question
4163672 yes well who knows good old arthur same old pessimist i see
4163673 hopefully i will get a bit more freedom to run around the pitch and cause a bit of terror only at the end of last year was i let off the leash that style of play suits me best being able to move forward and get back

4163675 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4163676 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

4163694 the religious right certainly isnt dead because they would just ignore it if that was true
4163695 as a liberal democrat i look at you folks as the 800 pound gorilla in the room if you all show up and vote in 08 you will decide who becomes president

4163701 how evangelicals became over committed to the bible and what can be done about it
4163702 and regarding books it means no facial for sure illustrations of god or jesus and that includes the ceiling of the sistine chapel

4163711 we need not resolve the difficult question of when life begins when those trained in medicine philosophy and theology are unable to arrive at any consensus the judiciary at this point in the development of mans knowledge is not in a position to speculate as to the answer
4163712 if the suggestion of personhood of the preborn is established the abortion rights case of course collapses for the fetus right to life is then guaranteed specifically by the 14th amendment
4163713 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4163714 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4163715 we have water sunshine we even have an active volcano we have more energy than we need
4163716 we cant talk about what christianity has to say about mormonism and politics
4163717 we cant talk about what christianity has to say about anything in public

4163736 oh no no no not me dont put me down in that camp
4163737 some conservatives signed it but i know they didnt read it
4163738 we in the pro life movement have got a decision to make if this were a football game it would be the fourth quarter with one second on the clock we the lifers trail the choicers by three points were on their goal line its fourth down and its the super bowl do we go for the field goal and the tie in hopes of sending the game into overtime or do we run a play and go for the touchdown and the win
4163739 i dont see how you cannot have govt with large numbers of people who have no familial ties with one another hence that is what i mean that govt prevents chaos that is everyone being their enforcer of contracts with peple being far removed from each other in vast commerical country like ours
4163740 when it comes to fundmental liberties we have the courts to check on tyranny of the majority
4163741 so i gather you object to the 14th amendment which extend the courts power to curtail encroachment of fundemental rights to the states

4163764 are making major life decisions on the basis of health care concerns
4163765 we think this implements the shared responsibility concept that was the hallmark of health care reform
4163766 it makes sense to us to say to companies that offer minimal or no benefits you have to make a small contribution
4163767 theres a lot of evidence that the more patients are required to pay more for their care the more that they make economic decisions about what to get or what not
4163768 while some of that may be perfectly reasonable and acceptable what i worry about is people not getting care that is really essential for their health
4163769 we know from past economic downturns that employers and individuals tighten their budgets as a whole but they certainly tighten their health budgets
4163770 ate here last night check it out before it gets discovered
4163771 we still by and large believe its white we believe its male we believe its gay we believe its other we believe its you know women who are promiscuous and we think its not me
4163772 fact of the matter is that people hear about hiv and we know about hiv but we never believe that hiv could happen to us
4163773 im pretty sure hiv presented itself several times i just never thought it could happen to me so i didnt care
4163774 what it really means to have to manage this disease on a day to day basis
4163775 cuts in programs would have to be considerably above 1 billion to meet patersons state savings figure
4163776 we have got to stop this frenzy about spending and lack of accountability
4163777 we need from the legislature real and reoccurring cuts we need a sense of understanding of how serious this problem can get
4163778 say the principle reason is that they are seldom sick
4163779 when it comes to latinos what may appear to be the well known effects of socioeconomic inequality on health care may also be conditioned by unique social cultural and economic circumstances
4163780 thats the real gap i think were facing the ability to provide a medical home for a spectrum of this population
4163781 if a knife is to be re used on another person it first has to be sterilized
4163782 we have also discouraged the traditional practice of forcing the circumcised males into sexual intercourse to prove their manhood after the wound heals to avoid the spread of
4163783 we have no motivation to low ball because wed just end up in a budget mess
4163784 our concern was that it creates tremendous confusion for people to get one notice and then another
4163785 im sure they are doing this because the courts dont currently have jurisdiction over the dmhc
4163786 what we have tried to do is to offer enrollees options
4163787 there was a desire on both sides to find a conclusion to this issue
4163788 this is a very important agreement this turns a new page in our relationship
4163789 this agreement signed today is designed to resolve the last major historical issue that has stood in the way of a more normal relationship between our two countries
4163790 under this agreement each countrys citizens can receive fair compensation for past incidents when fulfilled the agreement will permit libya and the us to develop their relations
4163791 the important role libya is playing internationally and expressed his hope that cooperation between the two countries would continue
4163792 he was promised a severance and he should get his severance
4163793 its a slap in the face to the supporters of the university
4163794 it sends the message that its more about money than winning souls
4163795 you tell the critics mr roberts has done nothing wrong
4163796 he has not misspent and lived lavishly off oru money
4163797 theirs was a new york love a checkered taxi ride burning rubber and like the city their passion was open 24 7 steam rising from their bodies like slick streets exhaling warm moist white breath through manhole covers stamped forged by delaney bros
4163798 toads of glory slugs of joy sang groin the dwarf as he trotted jovially down the path before a great dragon ate him because the author knew that this story was a train wreck after he typed the first few words
4163799 like a mechanic who forgets to wipe his hands on a shop rag and then goes home hugs his wife and gets a grease stain on her favorite sweater love touches you and marks you forever
4163800 but what is going to win or lose the race is economic policy and economic development
4163801 we live in a region that is one of the richest in natural resources
4163802 why arent we leading the way and becoming the energy center of the u s
4163803 todos os personagens desse filme ser o idiotas mas n o totalmente desprez veis
4163804 apesar da ambienta o em washington na realidade o filme conta a hist ria de pessoas incrivelmente cretinas que fazem coisas extremamente est pidas relacionadas com sexo e outras coisas o que torna tudo mais interessante que n o se tratam de pol ticos
4163805 meu personagem n o portanto muito diferente dos outros idiotas que interpretei para filmes anteriores dos irm os coen um personagem triste e idiota mas tem tamb m um lado cruel e brutal que n o tinha por sua vez em everett de e a meu irm o cad voc 2000 quando li o roteiro dei muitas risadas absolutamente louco e aceitei na hora
4163806 o filme conta a hist ria de pessoas que atravessam a t pica crise da meia idade tanto profissional pessoal ou sexual tudo isso se entrela a depois com quest es de seguran a nacional e isso que torna o filme uma f bula pol tica a trama toca a cia e o mundo das academias e do fitness a todo custo e conta o que acontece quando estes dois mundos se cruzam e se enfrentam
4163807 n o imaginava que meu personagem seria um cretino total que masca chiclete bebe gatorade at n o poder mais e tem um c rebro queimado de tanto escutar ipod meu coment rio para joel e etha foi um cretino total mas no fundo no fundo tem um grande cora o posso defini lo como um alpinista social uma pessoa que tenta desesperadamente fazer carreira
4163808 esperem um filme divertido que abre uma janela original para o mundo olhando o de maneira n o muito direita
4163809 ate here last night check it out before it gets discovered
4163810 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten a neighbor occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it
4163811 not every wrong or even every violation of the law is a crime
4163812 so many chemists went to the wall because of pan
4163813 the only way they would have been compensated would have been that 55 million stop and think of that
4163814 im not aware of any other case in this country where the government has accepted a claim against it for abuse of public office and paid such a large amount to a private individual
4163815 a loca o de reas para recolha ou estacionamento colectivo de ve culos
4163816 a disponibilizar um espa o e n o a prestar um servi o
4163817 cedemos este espa o a troco desta taxa este estacionamento n o uma concess o isto a ocupa o de um espa o e pelo qual se paga uma taxa e as taxas est o isentas de iva n o estamos a prestar um servi o ao automobilista este o nosso entendimento
4163818 que se aplica s esplanadas em que se paga em fun o de um espa o perfeitamente circunscrito pela ocupa o
4163819 na zona envolvente ao centro c vico e ao centro hist rico n o h um parque propriamente dito de estacionamento um parque circunscrito
4163820 reclamar e argumentar com base no facto de n o ser um parque de estacionamento definido
4163821 um parque perfeitamente definido com uma configura o adaptada ao estacionamento se ali houvesse parqu metros haveria raz o para cobrar o iva como j existe no teatro municipal da guarda
4163822 the concept of torture could also be altered by products in this market it is possible that some day there could be a technique developed to extract information from a prisoner that does not have any lasting side effects
4163823 experiments indicate that the advantages of these devices are such that human operators will be greatly enhanced for things like photo reconnaissance and so on
4163824 in the intelligence community there is an extremely small number of people who understand the science and without that its going to be impossible to predict surprises this is a black hole that needs to be filled with light
4163825 were not going to be reading minds at a distance but that doesnt mean we cant detect gross changes in anxiety or fear and then subsequently talk to those individuals to see whats upsetting them
4163826 thats why we now find we are in a position to cut interest rates
4163827 we cannot wait to see a fall in inflation before we start cutting rates because by then it would be too late
4163828 i would expect like the reserve bank that any reduction in interest rates would be passed on by the banks
4163829 but i can understand why their chief executive officers are being cautious about giving rolled gold guarantees about these things because theyve got other factors that they have to worry about as well
4163830 the banks will carry a very heavy onus to explain any variation from any reduction by the reserve bank in the rates as compared with what they actually do its difficult to imagine a circumstance where the government could directly control interest rates without a whole range of adverse consequences occurring
4163831 if they havent got anyone with enough guts im prepared to risk myself to do it
4163832 hendra virus is going to come back again and again and again because it comes from bats and theres millions of bats and theyre a protected species we need to know a lot more about it

4163966 these and other firearms related issues likely will and should occupy the attention of our legislators during the 2008 session one hopes that organizations like the nra and georgiacarry org will continue to proactively educate and advocate on behalf of the inherent second amendment rights of all law abiding georgians just as the lawyers representing such citizens in the district of columbia will be doing in the supreme court early next year
4163967 the extent to which georgias laws restrict the carrying of a firearm by an otherwise law abiding citizen as a result of these long standing but little known laws is startling and such laws should be amended for example unlike california georgia law prohibits the carrying by a holder of a carry permit of a firearm on a bus or a train or even at or near a train or bus stop parking lot

4163970 and once you hit that water the water is moving so quickly down river she did try to grab onto a rock near shore but was unable to do so if you were down there and saw the water theres a seam down there that just takes you to the middle of the river and then she just disappeared
4163971 even knowing i could have died just jumping in the water i ran down the path then i just lost sight of her
4163972 i just saw her in the water for about three seconds then she resurfaced i saw her hug the shore and at first i was relieved because i thought she had a life jacket but then i found out it was a backpack they were all young kids something that troubled me was that there was a man in charge who was about age 18 and i counted 23 children thats not good maybe if there was more eyes on maybe that wouldnt have happened

4163980 the issue is how quickly they can push these things through parliament
4163981 joe lieberman has said things that are totally irresponsible when it comes to barack obama here we have a leader for the future really a great leader for the future and one that comes along only every now and then and they know it so they have to undermine him and one of their best weapons of course is someone who is considered by some to be a democrat
4163982 i was struggling not so much with the heat but i didnt prepare for the matches as well as i should have done after all the flying and stuff

4163987 its been a great few days but thats a big slap in the face but we have to try and turn it around now we are absolutely gutted were disappointed for everyone at home who supported us its not a nice position to be in after thinking we were going to go in for a medal tomorrow
4163988 i think we will go and have a bit of a tear let it all out have a swim down and we have some people who need our support tomorrow

4163994 if i had gone to a normal mainstream school i probably would have done all right but i wouldnt have got such good results its strange to think that i probably wouldnt have done as well as i did if i hadnt been kidnapped when i was a baby

4164017 under ronnie irani we won two trophies in successive years in 2005 and 2006 and when you get a taste of that success you want it so badly

4164191 the photographs contained on the damaged external hard drive represented hundreds of hours and research of biologists in the rainforest or photographs taken while hiking through dense virgin jungle where no one probably has ever been before as far as the foundation knows many of these photographs represent the only scientific evidence of new discoveries of plant and animal species that may be on their way to extinction it is important that we learn more about these species so that we can offer them better protection

4164242 however even more important than their technical know how the cbl folks seemed to genuinely care about the situation i was experiencing and went out of their way to try to understand the full extent of my problem with cbls help i was able to get fully back up and up and running with my work in just a couple of days with a minimum of disruption to the business

4164261 getting those files back especially my email store was a huge relief
4164262 i expected this crash would wipe me out until mid january
4164263 i was stunned that cbl turned it around so fast in the silly season it meant my clients and editors never noticed any difference in my work
4164264 according to recent surveys of college students 97 own a computer 94 a cell phone and 56 an mp3 player moreover a recent alloy college explorer study found that 50 of college students own laptops while a compusa survey revealed that 70 of students dont routinely lock up their laptops when the computers are not in use fifty thousand property crimes are reported on college campuses annually with burglaries estimated to occur every ten seconds
4164265 when we realized the magnitude of our crash and how much data was corrupted in the fall we knew

4164269 a wikipedia editor emailed speech today august 11 on the crisis in georgia and the wikipedia
4164270 given the closeness of the words and sentence structure most would consider parts of mccains speech to be derived directly from wikipedia
4164271 nonetheless at least two political science professors have weighed in saying the similarities are more than coincidental and wouldnt be tolerated from their own students
4164272 given that mccain by his own admission cant use the internet its a bit of an ironic situation though perhaps it counts as progress of some sort
4164273 theres a depth of knowledge a breadth of knowledge and an extent of historical experience that doesnt compare between the two on russia policy
4164274 you cant compare a 15 year historical record to three or four statements over the course of 15 months
4164275 the mccain campaign relies on big money lobbyists and theyll rely on him
4164276 in the you scratch my back world of washington 931 million gets the special interests the best government money can buy but just think of the payday these lobbyists might expect in a mccain administration

4164283 when i came back my pc had reverted to dos mode and was flashing a very nasty sounding error message indicating it could not read the c drive any more i guess that was payback for slacking off at work
4164284 i was missing a month of email and many notes i planned to use for future jobs sharwood recalls
4164285 i was in quite a state it was a week until christmas and i had deadlines to meet before and immediately after the holiday season i worried that this could hurt my reputation for reliability and quality
4164286 i couldnt believe it when someone called me back on a sunday night
4164287 i may not have had any data but at least i could see i was on the road to recovery
4164288 i got mail from real people who obviously knew about my job
4164289 while this was a very difficult decision we feel it was the right thing to do for the future of midway we view every game as an investment that must meet certain standards for quality scheduling and profitability midway remains committed to producing the highest quality entertainment as evidenced by our strong holiday line up which includes tna impact blitz the league ii and mortal kombat vs dc universe starring a team of mk characters and some of the most recognizable dc comics personalities such as batman the joker and superman
4164290 id say i spend about 30 of my time at ep watching acts
4164291 but they changed everything back in 77 so im told and nearly every band that came after them has been subconsciously or overtly influenced by them
4164292 i think kraftwerk also live off past glories to an huge extent i enjoyed the olympia and picnic shows largely down to the visuals but theres far better electronic music out there now
4164293 i hadnt forgotten it id just built up a big enough piss to fill a dunnes bag and he was finished lucky bastard
4164294 past glories i think youre forgetting the excellent comeback album tour de france from a few years back all of which was new material
4164295 such a pile of begrudgers and yes the majority doing the moaning arent even going or are threatening not to go
4164296 in the future think for a bit and be more choosy about what you flash the cash at
4164297 think for a bit and be more choosy about what you flash the cash at
4164298 next up for the attempted bag o piss treatment ladies n gentlemen the blizzards

4164302 the imam is to be followed and if he prays standing then pray standing
4164303 the imam is to be followed if he says takbir then say takbir bow if he bows raise your heads when he raises his head when he says sami a l lahu liman hamida say rabbana laka l hamd and prostrate when he prostrates
4164304 the imam is to be followed say the takbir when he says it bow if he bows if he says sami a l lahu liman hamida say rabbana wa laka l hamd prostrate if he prostrates and pray sitting altogether if he prays sitting
4164305 allahs apostle used to raise both his hands up to the level of his
4164306 sami a l lahu liman hamida rabbana walaka l hamd
4164307 you see me facing the qibla but by allah nothing is hidden from me regarding your bowing and submissiveness and i see you from behind my back
4164308 perform the bowing and the prostrations properly by allah i see you from behind me or from behind my back when you bow or prostrate
4164309 al hamdu lil lahi rabbil ala min all praises are for allah the lord of the worlds
4164310 may my parents be sacrificed for you what do you say in the pause between takbir and recitation
4164311 paradise became s near to me that if i had dared i would have plucked one of its bunches for you and hell became so near to me that said o my lord will i be among those people then suddenly i saw a woman and a cat was lacerating her with it claws on inquiring it was said that the woman had imprisoned the cat till it died of starvation and she neither fed it no freed it so that it could feed itself
4164312 o allahs apostle we saw you trying to take something while standing at your place and then we saw you retreating
4164313 i was shown paradise and wanted to have a bunch of fruit from it had i taken it you would have eaten from it as long as the world remains
4164314 when i started leading you in prayer i saw the display of paradise and hell on the wall of the mosque facing the qibla i never saw good and bad as i have seen today
4164315 what is wrong with those people who look towards the sky during the prayer
4164316 they should stop looking towards the sky during the prayer otherwise their eye sight would be taken away
4164317 it is a way of stealing by which satan takes away a portion from the prayer of a person
4164318 whenever any of you is in prayer he should know that allah is in front of him so none should spit in front of him in the prayer
4164319 o aba ishaq these people claim that you do not pray properly
4164320 by allah i used to pray with them a prayer similar to that of allahs apostle and i never reduced anything of it i used to prolong the first two rakat of isha prayer and shorten the last two rakat
4164321 o aba ishaq this was what i thought about you
4164322 as you have put us under an oath i am bound to tell you that sad never went himself with the army and never distributed the war booty equally and never did justice in legal verdicts
4164323 i pray to allah for three things o allah if this slave of yours is a liar and got up for showing off give him a long life increase his poverty and put him to trials
4164324 whoever does not recite al fatiha in his prayer his prayer is invalid
4164325 by him who sent you with the truth i cannot offer the prayer in a better way than this please teach me how to pray
4164326 when you stand for prayer say takbir and then recite from the holy quran of what you know by heart and then bow till you feel at ease then raise your head and stand up straight then prostrate till you feel at ease during your prostration then sit with calmness till you feel at ease do not hurry and do the same in all your prayers
4164327 i used to pray with them a prayer similar to that of allahs apostle the prayer of zuhr and asr reducing nothing from them i used to prolong the first two rakat and shorten the last two rakat
4164328 the prophet in zuhr prayers used to recite al fatiha along
4164329 the prophet used to recite al fatiha along with another sura in the first two rakat of the zuhr and the asr prayers and at times a t verse or so was audible to us
4164330 o my son by allah your recitation made me remember that it was the last sura i heard from allahs apostle he recited it in the maghrib prayer
4164331 why do you recite very short suras in the maghrib prayer while i heard the prophet reciting the longer of the two long suras
4164332 i prostrated behind abu l qasim the prophet when he recited that sura and i will go on doing it till i meet him
4164333 i prostrated behind abu l qasim the prophet when he recited that sura and i will go on doing it till i meet him
4164334 the people complained against you in everything even in prayer
4164335 really i used to prolong the first two rakat and shorten the last two and i will never shorten the prayer in which i follow allahs apostle
4164336 you are telling the truth and that is what i think a tout you
4164337 the prophet used to offer the zuhr prayer when the sun just declined from its highest position at noon the asr at a time when if a man went to the farthest place in medina after praying he would find the sun still hot bright the sub narrator said i have forgotten what abu barza said about the maghrib prayer the prophet never found any harm in delaying the isha prayer to the first third of the night and he never liked to sleep before it and to talk after it he used to offer the morning prayer at a time when after finishing it one could recognize the person sitting beside him and used to recite between 60 to 100 verses in one or both the rakat
4164338 a barrier has been placed between us and the news of heaven and fire has been thrown at us
4164339 the thing which has put a barrier between you and the news of heaven must be something which has happened recently go eastward and westward and see what has put a barrier between you and the news of heaven
4164340 by allah this is the thing which has put a barrier between us and the news of heaven
4164341 o our people verily we have heard a wonderful recital quran which shows the true path we believed in it and would not ascribe partners to our lord
4164342 verily there was a good example for you in the ways of the prophet
4164343 i recited the mufassal suras at night in one raka
4164344 this recitation is too quick like the recitation of poetry i know the identical suras which the prophet used to recite in pairs
4164345 the prophet uses to recite al fatiha followed by another sura in the first two rakat of the prayer and used to recite only al fatiha in the last two rakat of the zuhr prayer sometimes a verse or so was audible and he used to prolong the first raka more than the second and used to do the same in the asr and fajr prayers
4164346 did allahs apostle used to recite in zuhr and asr prayers
4164347 the prophet used to recite al fatiha along with another sura in the first two rakat of the zuhr and asr prayers a verse or so was audible at times and he used to prolong the first raka
4164348 the prophet used to prolong the first raka of the zuhr prayer and shorten the second one and used to do the same in the fajr prayer
4164349 may allah increase your love for the good but do not repeat it again bowing in that way
4164350 my prayer is more similar to the prayer of allahs apostle than that of anyone of you
4164351 this i e ali made me remember the prayer of muhammad
4164352 he led us in a prayer like that of muhammad
4164353 we used to do the same but we were forbidden by the prophet to do it and were ordered to place the hands on the knees
4164354 you have not prayed and if you should die you would die on a religion other than that of muhammad
4164355 go back and pray again for you have not prayed
4164356 by him who has sent you with the truth i do not know a better way of praying kindly teach me how to pray
4164357 when you stand for the prayer say takbir and then recite from the quran what you know and then bow with calmness till you feel at ease then rise from bowing till you stand straight afterwards prostrate calmly till you feel at ease and then raise your head and sit with calmness till you feel at ease and then prostrate with calmness till you feel at ease in prostration and do the same in the whole of your prayer
4164358 subhanaka allahumma rabbana wa bihamdika allahumma ighfirli i honour allah from all what unsuitable things is ascribed to him o allah our lord and all the praises are for you o allah forgive me
4164359 i saw over thirty angels competing to write it first
4164360 malik bin huwairith used to demonstrate to us the prayer of the prophet at times other than that of the compulsory prayers so once he stood up for prayer and performed a perfect qiyam standing and reciting from the holy quran and then bowed and performed bowing perfectly then he raised his head and stood straight for a while
4164361 malik bin huwairith in that demonstration prayed like this sheikh of ours abu yazid
4164362 by him in whose hands my soul is no doubt my prayer is closer to that of allahs apostle than yours and this was his prayer till he left this world
4164363 when allahs apostle raised his head from bowing he used to say
4164364 o allah save al walid bin al walid and salama bin hisham and aiyash bin abi rabia and the weak and the helpless people among the faithful believers o allah be hard on the tribe of mudar and let them suffer from famine years like that of the time of joseph
4164365 the imam is to be followed say takbir when he says it bow when he
4164366 o allahs apostle shall we see our lord on the day of resurrection
4164367 do you have any doubt in seeing the full moon on a clear not cloudy night
4164368 do you have any doubt in seeing the sun when there are no clouds
4164369 you will see allah your lord in the same way on the day of resurrection people will be gathered and he will order the people to follow what they used to worship so some of them will follow the sun some will follow the moon and some will follow other deities and only this nation muslims will be left with its hypocrites allah will come to them and say i am your lord they will say we shall stay in this place till our lord comes to us and when our lord will come we will recognize him then allah will come to them again and say i am your lord they will say you are our lord allah will call them and as sirat a bridge will be laid across hell and i muhammad shall be the first amongst the apostles to cross it with my followers nobody except the apostles will then be able to speak and they will be saying then o allah save us o allah save us there will be hooks like the thorns of sadan in hell have you seen the thorns of sadan
4164370 these hooks will be like the thorns of sadan but nobody except allah knows their greatness in size and
4164371 all this is granted to you and a similar amount besides
4164372 allah said that is for you and ten times more like it
4164373 i do not remember from allahs apostle except his saying all this is granted to you and a similar amount besides
4164374 i heard him saying that is for you and ten times more the like of it
4164375 i saw a person not performing his bowing and prostrations perfectly when he completed the prayer i told him that he had not prayed
4164376 had you died you would have died on a tradition other than that of the prophet muhammad
4164377 we have been ordered to prostrates on seven bones and not to tuck up the clothes or hair
4164378 i have been ordered to prostrate on seven bones i e on the forehead along with the tip of the nose and the prophet pointed towards his nose both hands both knees and the toes of both feet and not to gather the clothes or the hair
4164379 wont you come with us to the date palm trees to have a talk
4164380 tell me what you heard from the prophet about the night of qadr
4164381 once allahs apostle performed itikaf seclusion on the first ten days
4164382 i have been ordered to prostrate on seven bones and not to tuck up the hair or garment
4164383 shall i show you how allahs apostle used to offer his prayers
4164384 the latter used to do a thing which i did not see the people doing i e he used to sit between the third and the
4164385 we came to the prophet after embracing islam and stayed with him he said to us when you go back to your families pray such and such a prayer at such and such a time pray such and such a prayer at such and such a time and when there is the time for the prayer then only of you should pronounce the adhan for the prayer and the oldest of you should lead the prayer
4164386 i will leave no stone unturned in making you offer the prayer as i have seen the prophet making us offer it
4164387 be straight in the prostrations and none of you should put his forearms on the ground in the prostration like a dog
4164388 malik bin huwairith came to us and led us in the prayer in this mosque of ours and said i lead you in prayer but i do not want to offer the prayer but just to show you how allahs apostle performed his prayers
4164389 like the prayer of this sheikh of ours i e amr bin salima
4164390 the proper way is to keep the right foot propped up and bend the left in the prayer
4164391 i remember the prayer of allahs apostle better than any one of you i saw him raising both his hands up to the level of the shoulders on saying the takbir and on bowing he placed his hands on both knees and bent his back straight then he stood up straight from bowing till all the vertebrate took their normal positions in prostrations he placed both his hands on the ground with the forearms away from the ground and away from his body and his toes were facing the qibla on sitting in the second raka he sat on his left foot and propped up the right one and in the last raka he pushed his left foot forward and kept the other foot propped up and sat over the buttocks
4164392 whenever we prayed behind the prophet we used to recite in sitting peace be on gabriel michael peace be on so and so once allahs apostle looked back at us and said allah himself is as salam peace and if anyone of you prays then he should say at tahiyatu lil lahi wassalawatu wat taiyibatu assalamu alalika aiyuha n nabiyu wa rahmatu l lahi wa barakatuhu as salam alaina wa ala ibadil lah is salihin all the compliments prayers and good things are due to allah peace be on you o prophet and allahs mercy and blessings be on you peace be on us an on the true pious slaves of allah if you say that it will be for all the slaves in the heaven and the earth ash hadu an la ilaha illa l lahu wa ash hadu anna muhammadan abduhu wa rasuluhu i testify that none has the right to be worshipped but allah and i also testify that muhammad is his slave and his apostle
4164393 allahumma inni audhu bika min adhabil qabri wa audhu bika min fitnatil masihid dajjal wa audhu bika min fitnatil mahya wa fitnatil mamati allahumma inni audhu bika minal ma thami wal maghrami o allah i seek refuge with you from the punishment of the grave and from the afflictions of masiah ad dajjal and from the afflictions of life and death o allah i seek refuge with you from the sins and from being in debt
4164394 why do you so frequently seek refuge with allah from being in debt
4164395 a person in debt tells lies whenever he speaks and breaks promises whenever he makes them
4164396 allahumma inni zalumtu nafsi zulman kathiran wala yaghfirudhdhunuba illa anta faghfirli maghfiratan min indika war hamni innaka antal ghafururrahim o allah i have done great injustice to myself and none except you forgives sins so please forgive me and be merciful to me as you are the forgiver the merciful
4164397 peace be on allah from his slaves and peace be on so and so
4164398 dont say as salam be on allah for he himself is as salam but say at tahiyatu lil lahi was salawatu wat taiyibatu as salamu alaika aiyuhan nabiyu warahmatu l lahi wa barakatuhu as salamu alaina wa ala ibadillahis salihin if you say this then it will be for all the slaves in heaven or between heaven and earth ashhadu an la ilaha illallahu wa ashhadu anna muhammadan abduhu wa rasuluhu then select the invocation you like best and recite it
4164399 i used to lead my tribe of bani salim in prayer once i went to the prophet and said to him i have weak
4164400 where do you want me to pray in your house
4164401 in the lifetime of the prophet it was the custom to celebrate allahs praises aloud after the compulsory congregational prayers
4164402 when i heard the dhikr i would learn that the compulsory congregational prayer had ended
4164403 the wealthy people will get higher grades and will have permanent enjoyment and they pray like us and fast as we do they have more money by which they perform the hajj and umra fight and struggle in allahs cause and give in charity
4164404 shall i not tell you a thing upon which if you acted you would catch up with those who have surpassed you
4164405 la ilaha ilallah wahdahu la sharika lahu lahul mulku wa lahul hamdu wahuwa ala kulli shai in qadir allahumma la mani a lima ataita wa la mutiya lima manata wa la yanfau dhal jaddi minka l jadd none has the right to be worshipped but allah and he has no partner in lordship or in worship or in the names and the qualities and for him is the kingdom and all the praises are for him and he is omnipotent o allah nobody can hold back what you give and nobody can give what you hold back hard efforts by anyone for anything cannot benefit one against your will
4164406 allah has said in this morning some of my slaves
4164407 the people had prayed and slept but you were in the prayer as long as you were waiting for it
4164408 the prophet after finishing the prayer with taslim used to stay at his place for a while
4164409 i think and allah knows better that he used to wait for the departure of the women who had prayed
4164410 when the prophet finished the prayer with taslim the women would depart and enter their houses before allahs apostle departed
4164411 i remembered a piece of gold lying in my house and i did not like it to divert my attention from allahs worship so i have ordered it to be distributed in charity
4164412 whoever ate from this plant i e garlic should not enter our mosque
4164413 the prophet said whoever eats from this plant he meant garlic should keep away from our mosque
4164414 whoever eats garlic or onion should keep away from our mosque or should remain in his house
4164415 once a big pot containing cooked vegetables was brought on finding unpleasant smell coming from it the prophet asked what is in it he was told all the names of the vegetables that were in it the prophet ordered that it should be brought near to some of his companions who were with him when the prophet saw it he disliked to eat it and said eat i dont eat for i converse with those whom you dont converse with i e the angels
4164416 the prophet said whoever has eaten this plant should neither come near us nor pray with us
4164417 ghusl taking a bath on friday is compulsory for every muslim reaching the age of puberty
4164418 some people say the eyes of the prophet sleep but his heart
4164419 none from amongst the dwellers of earth have prayed this prayer except you
4164420 have you ever presented yourself at the id prayer with allahs apostle
4164421 none except you from amongst the dwellers of earth is waiting for this prayer
4164422 if your women ask permission to go to the mosque at night allow them
4164423 we think and allah knows better that he did so so that the women might leave before men could get in touch with them
4164424 the prophet said if the wife of any one of you asks permission to go to the mosque do not forbid her
4164425 intertape has posted strong second quarter results despite the current difficult north american economic environment and unprecedented increases in commodity prices
4164426 the company has been successful in recovering much of these increases through a disciplined approach to instituting higher selling prices for its tape and engineered coated products which comprise the majority of our revenues
4164427 while our net income for the second quarter was a disappointment i am confident that the issues have been isolated and that our management team has initiated the appropriate actions to correct them
4164428 with the combination of focused execution and diversified growth platforms we are well positioned to continue our eight years of sequential growth
4164429 what can we do to make the tabula rasa new player experience great
4164430 takk og pris for at det bare var en dr m
4164431 anecdotally a lot of interest is being expressed and there are some who are buying
4164432 has been on par or nearly on par with the u s dollar for some time now and that has many thinking that it has levelled off and probably isnt going any higher
4164433 in a good position because they know what their currency is going to be and their exchange rates
4164434 theres a limit to our second home real estate market
4164435 what were finding is that the people were getting inquiries from and who appear to be buying are baby boomers that have retired or are about to retire
4164436 there was definitely an increase in the number of canadians buying property in florida
4164437 they say oh boy we can finally buy our property after renting all these years then they say well what is happening with the economy is it going to go lower are we going to buy and then lose money
4164438 it is best to have the funds to pay for a u s property up front especially when the currencies are at or near par
4164439 they can take out a mortgage on that or do a line of credit or some personal debt
4164440 if you take the u s way youre probably not going to be really bad off when it comes to currency fluctuations
4164441 in the u s if youre a non resident they require you to put down 30 to 40 per cent of the property value
4164442 plus you need six months worth of reserve you have to put six months of your mortgage payments insurance payments and your property taxes in an escrow account looked after by an escrow agent
4164443 theyre not looking to come down to florida and flip a property
4164444 in a lot of cases their children will be of age and they will want to use it
4164445 the large overall monthly gain was once again attributable to gasoline prices which jumped 4 1 per cent in the month
4164446 some relief may be in the offing on indications that gasoline prices moved lower in august though the annual rate of inflation is likely to remain above 5 5 per cent through the third quarter which will likely keep the fed wary
4164447 as auditors get deeper and deeper into what they see as a recession they get less and less comfortable about taking managements opinion on writedowns
4164448 you could have some big numbers coming out oct 31 year end for these banks nothing good is going to come out oct 31 theyre not going to say hey we had a huge one time gain that we forgot to tell you about
4164449 we see strong fundamentals in our core railway tie and utility pole markets
4164450 at the same time our wide network provides us with the raw material resource supply the treating ability and economies of scale that should enable us to capture more of our existing clients business and expand our customer base
4164451 if it doesnt then its not going to be around for long but were giving it a chance to see exactly what it can produce
4164452 de scores van de eerste twee ruiters op de eerste dag waren gewoon net iets te laag
4164453 het dier wilde te graag was te heet zoals wij dat zeggen
4164454 we hebben heel veel tijd ge nvesteerd om in deze ring te trainen steeds ging het goed op de een of andere manier was het nu net allemaal iets minder
4164455 we zijn niet ontevreden die amerikanen wilden we zeker niet treffen dit is ook geen gemakkelijke tegenstander maar als je verder wilt komen hoor je van dit soort jongens te winnen
4164456 for nearly three quarters of a century social security has helped provide americas seniors with a safe and secure retirement and helped millions of other americans who have fallen on hard times
4164457 rather than work to strengthen social security mitch mcconnell has led the charge in washington to privatize social security and reduce the guaranteed benefits our greatest generation has earned that is wrong
4164458 despite mitch mcconnells best efforts to dismantle it social security continues to provide much needed support for our seniors and many others and we must do all that we can to strengthen and preserve this vital program

4164683 given that we have been in discussions with them and nhhelco regarding the unique issues being raised by the state
4164684 our investigation revealed that ubs had knowledge that a market collapse was looming but did not disclose that information to the new hampshire higher education loan corp
4164685 we will vigorously defend ourselves against this complaint as we believe that we worked in the best interests of our investor and issuer clients this complaint attempts to link a single client interaction with overall market conditions which affected all student loan issuers and as such we believe there is no basis for these specific allegations
4164686 their goal should be to figure out how to get student loans out
4164687 given that we have been in discussions with them and nhhelco regarding the unique issues being raised by the state
4164688 has no impact on that settlement and ubs clients in new hampshire will be made whole under the settlement proposal
4164689 as our nation enters the sixth year of military involvement in iraq and the seventh year in afghanistan it is difficult to grasp the immense sacrifices our military community has made over the course of this fight
4164690 operation homefront was founded to meet the needs of the military community during these difficult times and airgas is proud to join others in supporting this work to give vital aid to those who have given so much to this country
4164691 one of the things that makes me most proud of our company is the generosity of airgas associates
4164692 every day airgas associates give back to the communities where they work and live i look forward to continuing the airgas charitable tradition with our new friends at operation homefront
4164693 the funny thing is that weve actually had people say to our faces yeah i downloaded your album off some website
4164694 it basically translates to i stole your music and i like it
4164695 i am convinced that honoring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4164696 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect senator obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again
4164697 theyve finally after all these years theyve gotten the names out all of these people had been told never to mention they were with the oss
4164698 were saying the oss was a lot bigger than they were saying
4164699 raising taxes is like putting a band aid on an amputated limb
4164700 as we have seen over the past seventy three years tax increases do not address the fundamental structural flaws in the social security program instead they eat away at americas potential for economic growth
4164701 currently the social security program gives younger workers a meager rate of return on their contributions into the system and fosters dependence on the federal government under a personal accounts program workers of all income levels would have the opportunity and freedom to accumulate personal wealth to enjoy in their retirement years
4164702 the first people who used the gobero cemetery were kiffian hunter gatherers who grew up to two metres tall
4164703 the most amazing find so far is a grave with a female and two children hugging each other they were carefully arranged in this position this strongly indicated they had spiritual beliefs and cared for their dead
4164704 we can learn a lot about how humans adapt to dramatic climate change from these remains the environment changed a lot on several occasions over a relatively short time and we can read this unique record to reconstruct how people coped
4164705 when congress made death valley a national park in 1994 it set aside these areas for all americans to enjoy as quiet natural and free from damaging dirt bikes atvs and other off road vehicles the courts ruling will help ensure that congresss promise to the american people will be kept
4164706 this decision protects the unique biological resources in death valley national park from off road vehicle abuse
4164707 the court rightly found that the county sat back and waited too long before raising these issues the county was well aware that the federal government intended to protect the resources of these areas in 1979 when the wilderness study areas were designated
4164708 ill bet the horned lizards and chuckwallas are dancing in the desert washes right now
4164709 hopefully this sound decision will let us move beyond bogus road claims to focus on working together to better sustain one of our most valuable assets here in eastern california our wild desert
4164710 what the hell do you think youre doing get your hand out of my pants
4164711 well im sure byrn wants to tell you and hasnt found the right time
4164712 bryn and mikael broke up and just stopped talking in the office altogether no one really paid attention because they just left each other alone all she would say was things didnt work out then bryn found out mikael was dating amie theyre cubicles were all next to each other and one day a huge fight broke out in the middle of the sales floor and hr had to have a talk with mikael well i guess bryn was so pissed off that she didnt care what people found out anymore she tried to tell amie it wasnt a good idea to date him but you know amie shes got a really low self esteem shes in her late 37s and has never been married
4164713 why does bryn care who he dates shes better off
4164714 thats the thing after bryn talked to amie and she didnt care what bryn had to say bryn told herself if anyone asked what happened she was going to tell the truth she said after dating awhile she thought he was a little aggressive but one night he hit her and put her in the hospital
4164715 he head butted her in the face and split her cheek open she had to go to the hospital for stitches and missed 8 days of work she filed a restraining order against him outside of the office and everything amie knows the entire story but she doesnt care she thinks theyre going to get married but mikael constantly says its not serious
4164716 i think so but what can they do it happened outside of work and it was a personal issue because of the whole incident their cubicles are as far apart as possible once word got out i think there was a lot of whispered conversations but both of them are still working there
4164717 i dont think so even my old boss doesnt like him much these days

4164721 we find greatest joy not in getting but in expressing what we are men do not really live for honors or for pay their gladness is not the taking and holding but in doing the striving the building the living it is a higher joy to teach than to be taught it is good to get justice but better to do it fun to have things but more to make them the happy man is he who lives the life of love not for the honors it may bring but for the life itself

4164912 were not expecting a notable gain in existing home sales until the second half of this year but the improvement is another sign that the market is stabilizing
4164913 buyers taking advantage of higher loan limits for both fha and conventional mortgages will unleash some pent up demand as inventories are drawn down prices in many markets should go positive later this year
4164914 in other areas such as sacramento a rapid price decline has induced buyers to come into the market and sales are now rising
4164915 the relationship between home prices interest rates and income has improved to the point where buyers are more serious about making offers
4164916 consumers need to be aware of local market conditions and comparable sales prices to have a clear picture of a homes value
4164917 realtors understanding of local markets negotiating expertise and transaction experience are invaluable to both buyers and sellers today as much as ever
4164918 its been good to play in the pre season cup but this is what it is all about
4164919 i cant wait to get out there it has been a long and frustrating haul but it is almost over now
4164920 i feel like a new person ive just about put it all behind me and now i want to get on with my life and my career
4164921 they are all good mates and i was proud for them
4164922 yeah it was tough for me but there was nothing i could do about it
4164923 i guess i brought it on myself if i hadnt done what i did i would have been there with them
4164924 the mariners are one big happy family and i am indebted to people like lyall gorman and the management team for helping me especially in the appeal process
4164925 mark has been through a lot so it was good of him to take the time to talk to me and try and help out
4164926 the thing i learned most from him was to move on and look to the future there is no point looking back
4164927 he has also been great with my goalkeeping ive learned so much watching him and listening to him
4164928 hopefully those five weeks will go quickly then this chapter in my life will be all over
4164929 you wont be getting any extraordinary boasting or claims from him
4164930 it is the case that he has endeavoured to obtain some assistance from those who gave him religious guidance to try to behave in a way other than his paedophilic tendencies would indicate
4164931 tragically for his children he had failed on a number of occasions in that regard
4164932 hes a person who has an insight into the nature of the offending and the consequences of it
4164933 he used lollies and other intelligent means to manipulate a very little girl and boy
4164934 its one of the harsh realities that we can only take 28
4164935 its been a bit of a moving target with all the medical backgrounds of these blokes
4164936 we still have some who may not be available to us in the first instance and when you consider all of those permutations that was the way the cards fell
4164937 rocky is obviously in doubt for the first one and dean has the ability to cover that position as well as lock just as hugh has
4164938 nathan has done well to date but the most obvious choice there came down to a call between dan and nathan thats what we have opted for in this instance
4164939 at the same time he will have an opportunity to have a break i believe his wife is due in a couple of weeks thats a slight positive but hes very disappointed at the moment
4164940 sharpie has been a huge part of this team for a long time you only have to look at how much he has contributed to the western force in particular this year how well he played for their team
4164941 ive got no doubt hell be back in the wallaby team soon
4164942 you dont wish that on any player obviously hes been part of our program to date its an opportunity for the other two blokes sam cordingley and brett sheehan
4164943 they are well versed in how we play the game and how we hope to play the game
4164944 its just a matter of them stepping in and taking over that role
4164945 i know peter wants to win the tri nations but he must realise he will be measured according to his ability to transform the team and to make it representative of the countrys population for the 2011 world cup
4164946 we have also seen nothing of the new type of rugby peter has spoken of
4164947 it is interesting that coloureds and blacks traditionally support the all blacks when they play at newlands
4164948 to do that in the final when it really matters makes me really proud of it
4164949 four years ago i had a disappointment when he went into the olympic trials as the national 100m record holder but failed to make the athens team but it makes it all worthwhile when you can get back and get a silver medal
4164950 when i missed the last team it was one of those turning points when i asked is this for me but i thought i had a lot more to offer and i wanted to get the best out of myself i wanted to see where my potential could take me
4164951 hes probably out there waiting to say i told you so
4164952 he was the mastermind behind the 200 shift for me he deserves the silver medal as much as i do its probably a credit to his professionalism and hard work that i got there today
4164953 i had to do 30 or 40 per cent more training and that was very challenging getting my body used to doing all that work
4164954 i was just trying to get my body going as quick as possible to go as fast as i could for as long as i could and that was good enough
4164955 i came into this meet wanting an individual medal and i am going home with two
4164956 between geelong and sydney theres a history of great games going back to the final a couple of years ago
4164957 from my point of view it was one of the most memorable games ive ever played in although we lost it was a cracker
4164958 i saw the ball sail over my head as nick davis kicked the goal i wasnt on him at the time but it was gut wrenching
4164959 i was literally about eight metres in front of nick and two metres in front of the goal line so i saw it yeah
4164960 its no ammunition for tomorrow nights game its a while ago now
4164961 a few of us have watched the round five game and it just shows how important it is to play a consistent game against a team like geelong
4164962 we stayed with them for three quarters and then gary ablett blew us out of the water in the last quarter and it cost us the game
4164963 it does give you confidence to know you can go with them and we had a few injuries last week was a week where we just wanted to get the win to get the momentum up so we could play like we did against geelong earlier in the season
4164964 hes certainly a threat and theres plenty of homework to be done on goodes
4164965 il faut arr ter le choc de la guerre a demande un peu de temps mais a progresse
4164966 mme rice sera demain en g orgie porteuse dun certain nombre de documents qui permettront de consolider le cessez le feu

4164969 cest un travail difficile qui est long qui est compliqu mais a progresse
4164970 la g orgie dont nous respectons lint grit territoriale lind pendance et la souverainet doit pouvoir revenir une vie normale
4164971 nous esp rons quil tiendra parole et que ces op rations cesseront
4164972 nous allons travailler dur pour voir si nous pouvons arriver mettre un terme cette crise
4164973 our producers pride themselves on fairness we have to trust producers and we have to have the public trust us
4164974 we dont know we know a little bit but this is a reality show and we have no way of knowing whats going to happen
4164975 will the film series evermore known as indy lite hold up when compared directly to a revived indiana jones
4164976 the chronicles of narnia the lion the witch and the wardrobe
4164977 it could be more deadly for people who have an unknown cardiovascular abnormality
4164978 you go through these ups and downs but i think it doesnt get any more down than this
4164979 dramas keep popping out of nowhere this williams is just another one someone has cursed the club in the last five years
4164980 its been tough for the club you had the salary cap scandal the coffs harbour rape allegations then losing games the mason saga i dont think it can get any worse from now on
4164981 its been pretty tough to take no matter who you are as a person
4164982 he is a very tough character he doesnt show much emotion on the outside on the inside hes probably hurting
4164983 the club has been understanding and supportive of me throughout my career
4164984 we definitely miss him williams on the field theres no doubt about that
4164985 hes a freak in attack and defence we miss him but he had his reasons
4164986 the bottom line is it was up to him he went about it his way what i can say is that i would not have done it this way
4164987 in london we will set the program and that will be it
4164988 i knew i wasnt a great athlete or performer earlier in the day
4164989 i knew if i ran at 10pm at night i would never get beaten
4164990 anything between 8 and 10 at night i wasnt as good stick me on at 3pm in the afternoon and you have a problem
4164991 ive got fans who want to know that when they go to a stadium that what they are watching is legitimate and not wwf wrestling where they know its fixed
4164992 we still have to hope that the sport can hold out against doping and that is what we have to build on
4164993 we need to wait for the russian athletics federation to report on that
4164994 there is no doubt that this has been a big problem we have seen the preliminary report the athletes have been taken out of the games
4164995 we will want to know exactly what the background is
4164996 but we are less likely in future to stumble upon them
4164997 this russian situation has been targeted for over a year for good reason
4164998 like a shark with a bit of blood in its nostrils
4164999 i think its disgusting and i dont think its proportionate
4165000 next time there is a police charge brought against someone from another club just have a look at the scale of the coverage
4165001 collingwood sells newspapers if its collingwood its a mad frenzy its like a shark with a bit of blood in its nostrils
4165002 as proven anyone can beat anyone on a given day and thats the mindset that you have to have
4165003 does he do all the hard yakka and then finds himself handing the side over to another coach in 2011 that would be grossly unfair
4165004 last year was messy because of perhaps the people who were involved because of what was or what wasnt written in the contract and needed to be done at a certain date and was allowed to roll on
4165005 ive spoken to eugene and ive spoken to james club chairman brayshaw this week but my main concern is winning games of footy
4165006 the mens quad sculls should make the final and i think if they have a good one in todays semi final theyre a genuine medal chance
4165007 if everything falls into place the way we expect it to i think well comfortably win four medals
4165008 i dont think thats necessarily all we can win but from experience i just tend to look at these things conservatively and say well well probably win one out of every two we think we can win but theres obviously always the chance we could win more than that too
4165009 if we win two golds then wed be doing cartwheels
4165010 those are the two youd probably circle at this stage but if you look down the list you never know
4165011 they usually start fast and slow down at the end but they started slow early and absolutely flew home so thats going to give them a lot of fuel for the final
4165012 the mens eight after their dramas earlier in the week can absolutely get amongst the medals great britain and canada are probably one two but our boys ripped it at their second training today so youve got to watch out for them
4165013 definitely we got a break there because we were only running on three and a half cylinders there
4165014 this really has been one of the toughest regattas because youve had to deal with the heat and humidity then the whole issue with the transport the teams bus seats were too cramped and its all led to many casualties mostly amongst our opponents
4165015 weve got the old beijing belly striking entire teams weve got events where the gold silver and bronze medallists at the world championships havent even made the finals here the german men and womens eights havent made the final
4165016 on 5 we are going to wave at the mirror miss america styles 5 4 3 2 1

4165024 mentoring is a way to share institutional knowledge develop individual skills and help people navigate their role and their careers
4165025 often this is done informally but increasingly organizations are expecting their experienced people to serve as mentors in a more consistent way
4165026 each mentoring situation is different and your role as mentor will shift depending on the person and their goals
4165027 by understanding the seven kinds of things mentors do youll be able to clarify your role and create an approach that makes sense keep in mind this isnt a prescription for how to be a mentor you wont be doing all seven things all the time
4165028 movies can be a great tool to stir thinking and conversation about leadership
4165029 i started using movies when i was teaching at west point and then at the naval war college
4165030 movies like a case study offer real life portrayals of examples of leadership in crisis viewers can use these portrayals to discuss the behaviors they would like to emulate or avoid during similar circumstances
4165031 using purposeful viewing participants can key into leadership behaviors that are both positive and negative
4165032 they can reflect on their own reactions to those behaviors and whether the behaviors are conducive to good leadership
4165033 i asked one group in the audience to look at the relationship and how bagger developed and built on it another group was asked to view how bagger assessed the golfers ability while a third group was asked to comment on the golfers challenges and how bagger supported him through these challenges this provided excellent commentary for discussion around themes of coaching and developing others
4165034 certainly many factors are at play in each of these scenarios but underlying many of todays economic headlines we can see that unethical behaviors have contributed to the problems
4165035 ethical leadership is needed to respond to economic troubles and address the complex challenges that individuals organizations and nations will continue to face
4165036 energy and food costs are no laughing matter but in much of the world the united states is seen as a gluttonous consumer of more than our share
4165037 we should pause and consider at a personal and professional level if we are pushing an agenda of excess
4165038 many lenders underwriters and investment fund managers seem to have fallen into the trap of pride thinking that they are immune to failure
4165039 everyone gets angry at times but when carried to extremes it can lead to abuse and destruction blaming lying and manipulation are signs of anger and will stall the clear innovative thinking that is needed to address complex problems
4165040 as baseline measurements for skill development competencies are helping organizations broadly assess employees expertise mastery and qualifications for various jobs competency management will continue to play a key role in the alignment of employees goals with overarching corporate strategy goals and values
4165041 many organizations continue to be challenged with the development of the processes tools and organizational capabilities necessary to effectively implement and sustain the competency management system
4165042 in recent months ive been giving presentations working closely with client organizations and attending conferences throughout europe
4165043 a common refrain is the pressure to develop leadership talent and understand how to do that with four different generations simultaneously

4165046 it hasnt really sunk in it is still a shock my first olympics i never could have imagined to have a meet like this walking away with three gold medals and three world records is just amazing
4165047 i think the excitement of it caught up with me i knew he was going to be a strong finisher so i just tried to hold on but it wasnt good enough on the day
4165048 coming into that relay we knew we had as good a chance as anyone else and we got confidence as it went on
4165049 we have never won it at the olympics before and thats an amazing honour and to beat the world record by so far is unbelievable its such a great way for me to finish the meet and celebrate with the girls
4165050 i feel a bit sad that its over because i have been looking forward to this my whole life
4165051 i kept my head focused on bringing it home for the team because i was the anchor and that is what the anchor has to do
4165052 we are impressed by deep commitment to maritime traditions at atlantic challenge and very excited about the opportunities for our students district youth will undoubtedly benefit from this unique opportunity

4165055 libby just snuck in but i thought pang broke from the start it was a fairly sizeable break
4165056 the gods have smiled nicely upon us and we were able to go ok there we have to be thankful we got her there
4165057 i think as with a few other people here she took things too easy and the semis are crackerjack fast you cant take your foot off the pedal at all
4165058 when you come to these things you see so many emotions going on it takes a very strong person to hold it together all the time hopefully shes overcome that and will go well in the final
4165059 i put in 100 per cent even though it may not be as quick as i would have liked but then i still have the 50 metres to go which i am really looking forward to
4165060 the first 100 was great the second 100 was not that great but i made it through and that was the main thing and i have another try at it today
4165061 i still have the confidence it is still up very high but i am hurting a little bit

4165121 were in a situation where we will be able to ride this storm and weve promised our teachers that theyll have everything they need to serve their kids
4165122 we are not going to levee a tax thats one dime higher than what we need to serve our schools
4165123 this proposed rule gives federal agencies an unacceptable degree of discretion to decide whether or not to comply with the endangered species act
4165124 we need to focus our efforts where they will do the most good it is important to use our time and resources to protect the most vulnerable species it is not possible to draw a link between greenhouse gas emissions and distant observations of impacts on species
4165125 this decision will not stop global climate change or prevent sea ice from melting
4165126 if adopted these changes would seriously weaken the safety net of habitat protections that we have relied upon to protect and recover endangered fish wildlife and plants for the past 35 years
4165127 its a great time to give the guys a break and give them time to re focus on the remainder of fall camp

4165133 you know tom ridge is one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro choice and i dont think that that would necessarily would rule tom ridge out
4165134 i think its a fundamental tenet of our party to be pro life but that does not mean we exclude people from our party that are pro choice
4165135 and i think ridge is a great example of that
4165136 far moreso than bloomberg because bloomberg is pro gay rights you know a number of other issues

4165143 for many here the recent oil bonanza has revived memories of the boom of the 1970s then too the region was up to its eyeballs in liquidity buying up large swaths of london and new york and then plop oil went south and the good times came to an abrupt halt in fact while americans look back on that period with a grim resolve that it never be repeated so too do many arabs the entire episode is remembered now with collective shame the idea that the region managed to parlay all that wealth into three decades of violent turmoil and harrowing poverty
4165144 a lot of stories you read about young kids are negative
4165145 these 70 plus kids practice three to five times a week to become the best in the country and theres not a word said about them in the local media

4165156 entiendo que dentro exista esa corriente que quiz s sea mayoritaria deben entender tambi n que las ocasiones pasan y cuando no se aprovechan se pierden y creo que es muy bueno que se planteen entregar las armas porque es una salida estupenda para una situaci n que ellos mismos han dinamitado

4165168 there is absolutely no logic and objectivity in the move
4165169 its totally uncalled for totally not based on any logic
4165170 we are happy that the world now has an idea of how the regime is vindictive

4165173 there is a real chance that safaa may die during the operation
4165174 the liver kidney intestines are all squished to the sides his lungs are very small its hard to believe he is able to breathe
4165175 sometimes when we see other children play he starts to cry
4165176 i dont buy him certain toys like soccer balls because he looks at me and when he throws it far away he cant go and get it even at his age he understands
4165177 i used everything i have to rescue my baby i tried to do something but i cant
4165178 i found out that all the money in the world couldnt save him but i did realize that money could save lives
4165179 the mission is to bring people to hospitals who have life threatening problems and dont have money i dont care where they come from
4165180 the center is almost the only beacon of hope for patients seeking treatment for cancer
4165181 we said we cannot turn a blind eye to these patients they are pleading please help so we cannot just ignore that we dont have the millions to cover so many iraqi patients so we said lets try something else
4165182 in many cases children come with diseases who have just advanced to a level that you cant give any curable treatment
4165183 if you saw the patients months earlier six eight 10 months earlier you can do many other things that now just arent doable
4165184 we tried to get her into a hospital in iraq and the doctor kicked us out
4165185 there was shooting and firing outside we fought with the doctor we fought to get her in i lost all hope
4165186 i was watching my daughter die in front of me slowly and there was nothing i could do
4165187 we dont know what will happen when we open safaas abdomen and we take this tumor out
4165188 safaa has a chance of survival definitely if he survives today so today is the most critical day in safaas life
4165189 this is such a happy occasion you brought happiness into the hearts of parents
4165190 i will tell you the truth tears come to your eyes youre saving a life
4165191 when you look at somebody that had a life threatening problem and you could with money save that life youve got to sit back and say you helped make this world just a little better and thats what its all about

4165213 alle panden zijn hier nu vergeven en er zitten vooral caf s en restaurants in er is geen zicht op dat daar de komende tijd meer zaken vergelijkbaar met de onze bij komen
4165214 we hebben dit altijd erg leuk gevonden om te doen de ligging van de winkel midden in het dorp is uniek de meeste klanten die van de sluiting hebben gehoord vinden het ook jammer dat we weggaan

4165247 and itll probably take me another 10 or 15 years to do the rest of it

4165277 die diskussion um ein ende des aufschwungs halte ich f r verfehlt
4165278 jedenfalls sollte uns die konjunkturelle durststrecke nicht dazu verleiten rezessiongefahren herbeizureden
4165279 in geldpolitischer hinsicht gibt vor allem der steile anstieg der verbraucherpreisinflation seit letzten herbst infolge massiv steigender energie und nahrungsmittelpreise anhaltenden anlass zur sorge
4165280 die hvpi rate wird sich daher ber die kommenden monaten nur langsam verringern und voraussichtlich auch im n chsten jahr nicht unsere stabilit tsgrenze von knapp unter zwei prozent unterschreiten
4165281 umso wichtiger ist es zu verhindern dass sich die menschen dauerhaft auf hohe inflationsraten einstellen

4165292 all the parents and people that helped with our team this year
4165293 i cant say enough good things about the story time program
4165294 it was evident that a lot of care and thoughtfulness went into arranging this program for the kids a big thank you to all involved with the planning and implementation of it
4165295 i just felt that a third party would help to blend party lines working for the best interests of the town

4165302 all the parents and people that helped with our team this year
4165303 i cant say enough good things about the story time program
4165304 it was evident that a lot of care and thoughtfulness went into arranging this program for the kids a big thank you to all involved with the planning and implementation of it
4165305 i just felt that a third party would help to blend party lines working for the best interests of the town
4165306 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4165307 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4165308 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4165309 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4165310 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4165311 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4165312 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4165313 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4165314 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4165315 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4165316 wichtig war dass wir uns ber der 6 400er marke behauptet haben
4165317 ohne absprache oder gar zustimmung durch die gremien der mlp
4165318 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4165319 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4165320 cest avec 769 000 hommes que la france assure la paix et les bienfaits de sa civilisation ses 60 millions dindig nes
4165321 some consumers were paying thousands of dollars to be added to someones account to get a short term increase in their credit rating
4165322 im thrilled with fair isaacs willingness to take a second look at this
4165323 when you have someone as an authorized user on a credit card you give them an escape route
4165324 if you lose your job or get into a horrible financial mess youre not dragging them down with you
4165325 when i went to college i was listed on my dads credit card as an authorized user but i was strictly told it could only be used for emergency purposes and not to buy a round of beer for everybody
4165326 when its done in a family environment where the practices of sound credit are taught its very beneficial
4165327 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4165328 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
4165329 the fico 08 scores of legitimate authorized users will now reflect the information on their credit reports about the account s on which they are authorized users
4165330 vantagescore excludes authorized user trade lines whether with good or bad payment histories to ensure the risk assessment of a credit applicant represents the true credit risk of the prospect and not the originating borrower with whom the authorized trade line is associated
4165331 lenders do not have to consider the credit history of spousal authorized users unless the information is available
4165332 the millions and millions of consumers who wouldve seen their scores go down are not going to see that happen
4165333 were in an environment when the banks are getting it from all sides
4165334 consumers are defaulting a little more than usual but also using their credit more than usual
4165335 that doesnt feel like a situation thats getting better it feels like they are being picked on
4165336 card issuers are viewing risk differently now than they did just a year or two ago
4165337 making your payments on time is no longer enough to be considered a good credit risk you have to keep your balances low relative to your available credit and be chipping away at that balance rather than skating by on minimum payments
4165338 between the sub prime crisis the housing market the economy and the fact that a lot of people are living off of their credit cards the banks are trying to immunize themselves against the point in time when more people will not be able to keep up with their credit card payments weve seen a lot of complaints from consumers who had been cardholders for years and had always paid on time and thought it would count for something but who have now seen their credit limit cut
4165339 but if i saw my credit line being cut id call and throw a hissy fit about it because you have no chance of seeing it readjusted without that you can shop around for other deals but that could be tough given your circumstances so start by talking to your card company they may be looking at everybody and deciding if theyre still a good risk but they still dont want to lose you as a customer
4165340 pay the bills on time be a good user of credit if you have to use credit and stand up for yourself if there are changes made that you dont think should have happened to you if you dont stand up for yourself you know the credit card companies will be doing whats best for themselves and not for you
4165341 an operating room charge already includes routine services equipment and supplies
4165342 but then i look at the bill and i will see the same routine supplies billed out again
4165343 ultimately you are responsible for that bill and that could affect your credit
4165344 sometimes you have to step in and spend a lot more time than you would like to resolve it sometimes you even need to pay it first and then deal with the insurance company

4165709 the fool has said in his heart there is no god
4165710 for the wrath of god is revealed against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who hold the truth n unrighteousness because that which may be known of god is manifest in them for god hath showed it unto them for the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen being understood by the things that are made even his eternal power and god head so that they are without excuse because that when they knew god they glorified him not as god neither were thankful but became vain in their imaginations and their foolish heart was darkened professing themselves to be wise they became fools and changed the glory of the uncorruptible god into an image made like to corruptible man and to birds and four footed beasts and creeping things
4165711 but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of god for they are foolishness unto him neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned for who hath known the mind of the lord that he may instruct him but we have the mind of christ
4165712 for the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness but unto us which are saved it is the power of god
4165713 the wicked through the pride of his countenance will not seek after god god is not in all his thoughts
4165714 and even as they did not like to retain god in their knowledge god gave them over to a reprobate mind to do those things which are not convenient being filled with all unrighteousness fornication wickedness covetousness maliciousness full of envy murder debate deceit malignity whisperers backbiters proud boasters inventors of evil things disobedient to parents without understanding covenantbreakers without natural affection implacable unmerciful who knowing the judgment of god that they which commit such things are worthy of death not only do the same but have pleasure in them that do them
4165715 now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen
4165716 but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to god must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him

4165759 a nasty clique of girls constantly spread rumors about jessica and one that spread like wildfire was that she was gay
4165760 this particular strain that has just hit nigeria has hit well before the migratory movement of birds heading south from europe and asia and so therefore its not likely at all that wild birds played a role in this new outbreak
4165761 for nigeria in particular its been quite serious as far as their economy goes and the direct impact on their poultry industry h5n1 being a zoonotic disease meaning infectious to humans it continues to pose a threat to human health these highly pathogenic h5n1 strains as far as nigeria is concerned we are watching it quite closely in the poultry markets because it obviously is a food security issue
4165762 what we have suspected has caused most of the outbreaks has been through the movement of domestic poultry domestic chickens or domestic ducks these animals are moved both legally and illegally within a nation and internationally and that is how this disease spreads quite a bit however wild birds have played a relatively small role in moving the disease from country to country during their migration movements however a lot of those times those infections dont result in larger infections of poultry and people this particular strain that has just hit nigeria has hit well before the migratory movement of birds heading south from europe and asia and so therefore its not likely at all that wild birds played a role in this new outbreak
4165763 its huge and its not limited to poultry and even influenza but both legal and illegal movement of domestic and wildlife animals and products is largely unrecorded and unregulated and undefined and given the increased globalisation of todays world where we have much more contact with different species of animals wildlife and livestock and humans with the trade were seeing an increase in occurrence of these major infectious diseases
4165764 nigeria has been one of those countries that have been wonderfully working very diligently their government with their internal forces and external international assistance and theyre doing a wonderful job of responding to these outbreaks
4165765 sometimes even though a developing country may have a little bit less infrastructure sometimes its easier for them to contain some of these outbreaks because you dont have the highways you dont have so many commercial poultry farms where you have people moving from one to another constantly and so in some ways its almost easier to keep a handle on some of these outbreaks in developing countries as opposed to more developed countries but it always varies on the type of outbreak that occurs where it occurs and in what species it occurs

4165841 wonder if they need any more volunteers in the changing tent
4165842 its hard work and last year when the three of us did this we were exhausted by the end of the day
4165843 uh huh you can have happy hour after i crawl into bed at 8

4165855 for some time relative calm was maintained in south ossetia
4165856 the war games included a us navy supercarrier battle group an us navy expeditionary carrier battle group a royal navy carrier battle group a french nuclear hunter killer submarine plus a large number of us navy cruisers destroyers and frigates playing the
4165857 a strategic diversion has been created for russia the south ossetia capital has been shelled and a large georgian tank force has been heading towards the border american marines a thousand of them have recently been in georgia training the georgian military forces russia has stated that it will not sit by and allow the georgians to attack south ossetia this could get bad and remember it is just a strategic diversion but one that could have horrific effects
4165858 cases of possible threats by russia directed at georgia with the intention of taking control over the baku ceyhan pipeline
4165859 russia actively tends to isolate the central asian region from direct access to world economy especially to energy supplies if georgia government is destabilized western access to baku caspian sea and further will be limited
4165860 ever since the continents started interacting politically some five hundred years ago eurasia has been the center of world power the key to controlling eurasia says brzezinski is controlling the central asian republics
4165861 brzezinski russias invasion of georgia is reminiscent of stalins attack on finland
4165862 the russians deliberately provoked the fighting in south ossetia and timed it for the olympics this is a long standing russian effort to get rid of president saakashvili
4165863 and i want to stress im not a warmonger and i dont want a new cold war any more than dimitri does the russians wish to re establish a historic area of hegemony that includes ukraine and it is no accident that the other former soviet republics are watching this and extraordinarily upset as putin progresses with an attempt to re create a kind of a hegemonic space
4165864 the unipolar world refers to a world in which there is one master one sovereign one center of authority one center of force one center of decision making at the end of the day this is pernicious not only for all those within this system but also for the sovereign itself because it destroys itself from within what is even more important is that the model itself is flawed because at its basis there is and can be no moral foundations for modern civilization
4165865 unilateral and frequently illegitimate actions have not resolved any problems moreover they have caused new human tragedies and created new centers of tension judge for yourselves wars as well as local and regional conflicts have not diminished more are dying than before significantly more significantly more today we are witnessing an almost uncontained hyper use of force military force in international relations force that is plunging the world into an abyss of permanent conflicts we are seeing a greater and greater disdain for the basic principles of international law and independent legal norms are as a matter of fact coming increasingly closer to one states legal system one state and of course first and foremost the united states has overstepped its national borders in every way this is visible in the economic political cultural and educational policies it imposes on other nations well who likes this who is happy about this in international relations we increasingly see the desire to resolve a given question according to so called issues of political expediency based on the current political climate and of course this is extremely dangerous it results in the fact that no one feels safe i want to emphasize this no one feels safe because no one can feel that international law is like a stone wall that will protect them of course such a policy stimulates an arms race i am convinced that we have reached that decisive moment when we must seriously think about the architecture of global security
4165866 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
4165867 the position of the russia side is not proceed beyond the peacekeeping zone but we have to respond to provocations
4165868 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4165869 we dont want them here what we need is friendship and good relations with the russian people
4165870 we let her stay here and now shes blaming everything on us
4165871 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
4165872 it is not easy to turn around the existing forces by 180 degrees
4165873 de facto territorial integrity of georgia is limited because of the conflict
4165874 this problem can be solved only through the search for mutual solutions
4165875 the fact that the biggest number of bombs fell on purely economic and civilian targets clearly indicated that was a premeditated thing and it had nothing to do only with abkhazia or south ossetia
4165876 why would one attack them unless there is some other purpose
4165877 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
4165878 the message is that russia has perhaps not accepted that it is time to move on from the cold war and it is time to move to a new era in which relations between states are on the basis of equality and sovereignty and economic integration
4165879 we will use u s aircraft as well as naval forces
4165880 rally the free world in the defense of a free georgia
4165881 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia and insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
4165882 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4165883 i have to say that the reports are not encouraging about russias respect for this cease fire
4165884 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
4165885 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
4165886 either support for a virtual project or real partnership with russia on issues that demand collective action
4165887 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
4165888 blind knowledge is working at useless ground and crazy faith is living the dream of its liturgy a new god is a word or the mere sound dont seek and dont trust for all is mystery
4165889 its called the american dream because you have to be asleep to beleive it
4165890 in the days ahead we will use us aircraft as well as naval forces to deliver humanitarian and medical supplies
4165891 to let in all forms of humanitarian assistance we expect russia to ensure that all lines of communications and transport including seaports airports roads and airspace remain open for the delivery of humanitarian assistance and for civilian transit
4165892 you have heard the statement by the us president that the united states is starting a military humanitarian operation in georgia
4165893 it means that georgian ports and airports will be taken under the control of the us defense ministry
4165894 continue our efforts to rally the free world in defense of a free georgia
4165895 reshaping us policy toward russia will take longer than the months between now and january 20 when a new president takes office but mr bush can at least atone for his earlier misjudgments about mr putin and steer policy in a new direction that his successor would have to deal with
4165896 looting burning villages and killings of civilians that are in areas under russian control
4165897 this causes great concern as it is not clear whose orders the russian troops are executing and why russia does not honour the declared ceasefire
4165898 a vast mission of peacekeepers observers and other monitors who will record the illegal actions by russian troops
4165899 georgias territorial integrity and the withdrawal of the occupation army must be the main objectives to be pursued by the international community after military actions are discontinued
4165900 serious mistakes can be made that have to be paid for a long time afterwards
4165901 then the thrust was reduced and this reduction and the loss of headwind component both made the situation worse
4165902 i dont like to write but i love to have written
4165903 think about the last time someone told you about a brand odds are you did not rush down to the nearest store to check it out you probably did a quick search online to see whats being said and read what others are saying were not just doing it for big ticket items were researching everything and anything from hotels to hdmi cables to paperclips for the office were also comparing prices
4165904 i wish for bloggers and all journalists i could crinkle my nose like samantha stevens and whoosh away all the bad pitches they get every day alas i can only try to tidy up my little corner of the shift communications universe and maybe a little more bloggers are learning that their popularity means they get the same uneven pr service solicited or not that all media gets pr pros are learning that bad pr practices beget much swifter and more public retribution than in the past maybe these factors will combine to make us better

4165915 there were several drivers behind this latest release including significant client input our continued mission to improve software interfaces and ease of use and a focus on delivering technology that provides an obvious return on investment
4165916 equally important several of these new capabilities will open new markets for partners and us particularly with those enterprises seeking to instantiate best practices across their organizations

4165922 we must stand united against the threats emanating from terrorism terrorists with their disruptive agenda will never succeed in discouraging us from our resolve to build a strong india or from working with our neighbours to eliminate this menace from our region or from our commitment to forge co operative relations with other countries across the world
4165923 the ideologues of terrorism have little respect for human life they incite violence and mindless destruction
4165924 we should pause and reflect on how our conduct and our actions are promoting unity we must ask ourselves whether our actions are contributing to strengthening of the national fabric and bringing about tolerant thinking
4165925 we should demonstrate our ability to listen to each other to understand each other and if perceptions do not agree give to the others the freedom to hold their views
4165926 as a developing country our demands for energy are growing we cannot let lack of energy become a constraint on our ability to deliver high levels of growth
4165927 with the challenges of increased oil prices and climate change the question of energy security confronts us we need to look at energy mixes that are sustainable in the long run and are cleaner sources of energy gradually making deliberate shift to renewable energy
4165928 technologies increasing efficiency in energy intensive sectors need to be developed any contribution to save energy is a step towards environment protection and in saving the wide diversity of flora and fauna on the planet
4165929 but there are several tasks that await completion and new challenges that need to be addressed a nations work never ends
4165930 implementation done in a transparent and accountable manner will ensure that welfare schemes reach the genuine beneficiaries in a timely manner thus preventing corruption in our system and enhancing efficiency in governance
4165931 seventy per cent of our population lives in villages and is dependent on agriculture therefore the development of india will not be comprehensive or complete unless there is development in the rural areas and increased agriculture productivity
4165932 we must look at a nationwide addiction focussed eradication programme eliminating addiction and fighting social evils can be a slow process as it involves changing attitudes

4165938 when we stayed in the basement of the mansion i noticed there was gold stored in that hole in the wall since the owner was so obsessed with greed and unwilling to share his good fortune i sealed the wall so he wouldnt find it
4165939 the government has failed to meet the aspirations of the people we gave a memorandum to the governor demanding its dismissal
4165940 this calls for the resignation by the chief minister from his post and in case he does not quit the governor should direct him to either take a trust vote or submit a fresh list of supporting mlas
4165941 there is no need for a leadership change at this juncture when many development projects are in the pipeline

4166102 we actually have more customers carrying more products then at the same period in 2007 although with the current economic situation these increases were not sufficient to offset the decrease in sales we experience with many of our customers the increased strength of the canadian dollar also had a negative impact of more than ca 400 000 on our us sales compared to last year
4166103 a decline in sales combined with a decrease in foreign exchange gains and forward exchange contract gains explain the difference between 2008 and 2007
4166104 furthermore under the credit agreements the company must comply with certain restrictive covenants including the requirement to maintain certain financial ratios at the end of the second quarter of 2008 the company was not in compliance with one of these ratios subsequently and as required by the canadian institute of chartered accountants emerging issues committee abstract eic 59 the company reclassified a long term portion of the term debt amounting to 1 865 000 to current liability even though no accelerated repayment has been demanded by the lender the company is currently discussing amendments to its loan covenants with the lender and certain measures are being implemented to re establish the situation

4166125 alle russischen medien sind abgeschaltet es gibt keine richtigen informationen
4166126 die georgischen soldaten glaubten in eine bung zu ziehen landeten aber mitten in einem krieg ich habe mitleid mit den einfachen georgischen soldaten rund 4000 sind bereits gefallen obwohl die nicht verstehen wof r man sie k mpfen l sst
4166127 ich denke dass wir bei diesem treffen die m glichkeit haben werden die situation in s dossetien detailliert zu er rtern und einen gewichtigen beitrag zur stabilisierung in unserer region zu leisten in diesem zusammenhang erkl rt sich die t rkei bereit jede hilfe zu leisten
4166128 sie haben sich auf ein abenteuer eingelassen zu dem ich mich bei einem solchen vorbereitungsstand den ich bei den georgischen truppen beobachten konnte nie entschlossen h tte
4166129 heute kann die georgische armee unter keinen umst nden ein ernsthafter gegner f r die russen sein
4166130 sie haben eine kleine armee die sich offen gesagt kaum von den streitkr ften eines dritte welt landes unterscheidet
4166131 bis sie einen hohen professionellen stand erreicht wird noch viel zeit vergehen
4166132 seine t r stand immer f r jeden israeli offen der kam um in israel hergestellte waffen anzubieten
4166133 der krieg in s dossetien aus der perspektive der georgier in russland
4166134 wir verstehen den gerechten zorn den jeder anst ndige mensch in diesen tagen versp rt und trauern zusammen mit euch der toten und verdammen die georgische f hrung die auf niedertr chtigste und t ckischste weise die gewalt einer t dlichen waffe auf die schlafende stadt zchinwali niederlie
4166135 wenn wir fr her noch die hoffnung hegten die br derlichen v lker ossetiens und abchasiens berzeugen zu k nnen in einem einheitlichen staat zu leben so verstehen wir jetzt genau dass das unm glich ist
4166136 die zeit alle wunden heilen wird und die v lker georgiens ossetiens abchasiens und russlands als gute nachbarn leben werden und verstehen dass regenten wie saakaschwili kommen und gehen und zwischen uns nach wie vor br derlichkeit glaube und liebe herrschen
4166137 he said he was interested in volunteering but that was obviously a lie
4166138 we are deeply saddened by the news that bill gwatney has passed away

4166141 without the missing leadership emphasis management at all levels will continue to regard the commitment to equality and diversity as superficial tokenistic and unimportant
4166142 open to the charge of institutional racism as its policies procedures practices and actions however unintended can be seen to have disproportionate detrimental and discriminatory outcomes for bme solicitors
4166143 the report clearly demonstrates that the sra has not learnt the lessons of the 2006 initial impact assessment and continues to disproportionally target bme lawyers and solicitors in all facets of its regulatory work
4166144 the sra appears to be incapable of putting its own house in order
4166145 token lip service to equality and diversity is not the way to dispel allegations of institutional racism
4166146 radical root reform is required as a matter of urgency
4166147 there has been so little done in terms of remedying problems its an outrage

4166152 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect senator obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again
4166153 what will u s suburbs look like in 40 years
4166154 the suburbs have three destinies none of them exclusive as materials salvage as slums and as ruins
4166155 we will have to return to traditional modes of inhabiting the landscape villages towns and cities composed of walkable neighborhoods and business districts and the successful ones will have to exist in relation to a productive agricultural hinterland because petro agriculture as represented by the infamous 3000 mile caesar salad is also now coming to an end fortunately we have many under activated small towns and small cities in favorable locations near waterways this will be increasingly important as transport of goods by water regains importance
4166156 if gentrification continues in a significant way large numbers of suburban households looking for urban stimulation may end up switching places with minority central city dwellers stirring the ethnic pot in both places
4166157 in 40 years perhaps well get beyond our fixation with
4166158 die verbraucher reagieren darauf mit umschichtungen verzicht und gedrosseltem konsum

4166162 provide a place for people to share information ask questions and learn about cycling in our town
4166163 obviously we like this idea that chad files has brought to us much better because its not just raising awareness of bicycles its also teaching those who arent aware of the rules of the road the rules of the road as they go
4166164 ive truly relished working with my longtime partner tom cruise to revitalize united artists and i am proud of all that weve accomplished in the past two years reinvigorating the brand and developing such a strong slate of films

4166202 no it doesnt make sense to pay off a loan and have your money tied up in a depreciating asset
4166203 you have an auto loan at 8 but your car is depreciating so i wouldnt worry about paying that off and have your money tied up in a depreciating asset
4166204 you have credit card debt at 15 but i wouldnt worry about paying it off because you used the card to buy gold coins and they are appreciating so you have a lot of equity there

4166270 i think in 50 years darwinian evolution will be gone from the science curriculum people will look back on it and ask how anyone could in their right mind have believed this because its so implausible when you look at the evidence
4166271 sorry breaking news shows that the wright brothers lied aviation is dead please prepare for landing and finding an alternate mode of transport thank you
4166272 t he only way we can strip evolution from the science curriculum is by destroying science in this country altogether if thats the promise of these creationists lets hope we have the courage to destroy faith even more quickly
4166273 a great ideological war is raging between the godless people like me who trust life and the gutless the talking heads of the extreme religious right who fear death and fear the godless and fear ongoing life in the future when they no longer exist
4166274 science and religion are at war and only one of them is going to emerge victorious
4166275 the conflict between religion and science is inherent and very nearly zero sum
4166276 the great depression refuted the classical notion that recessions were always self correcting
4166277 many creationists have tried to refute the theory of natural selection but none has been successful

4166288 he said he was interested in volunteering but that was obviously a lie
4166289 we are deeply saddened by the news that bill gwatney has passed away
4166290 its something we talked about right before our first game we had a team meeting and they put together a little highlight video for us and posed the question what is your legacy going to be but its not necessarily something we talk about every day
4166291 the only way you can have a legacy is to win gold and the only way to win gold is to focus on the task at hand
4166292 if you start thinking about other things you can lose your mind a little bit
4166293 the good thing about this team is that nobody is doing that
4166294 theyre a shooting team who likes to run so we definitely have to defend well
4166295 the market is much more focused on demand destruction than on supply concerns
4166296 the concern now is that the demand destruction in the u s will spread like a virus to other countries
4166297 yesterdays report was one of the most bullish in a year
4166298 the overriding sentiment of the market is bearish because of the negative demand outlook

4166315 we have a pretty good idea that the restrictions will slow things down but we wont know the true impact until september
4166316 because of the olympics and other factors therell no doubt be higher prices
4166317 the olympics impact is one of a number of things happening associated with china to make companies rethink their sourcing strategies
4166318 its adding to the larger psychological effects of risk associated with working in china
4166319 for those limited companies that still produce goods for export in beijing they probably shifted some production to other facilities in china to meet u s consumer demand
4166320 the impact on u s consumers is most likely nil
4166321 many companies have said to the chinese because of this the christmas orders cant be filled and we cant move christmas to february
4166322 so now those purchase orders have gone to other countries
4166323 some foreign companies are facing complications and are wishing these games would be over soon
4166324 the government said we dont care because we have only one goal which is a safe olympics a picture perfect olympics
4166325 they said we dont want business now come back in two months
4166326 ive been a google fan for years and i use it every day perhaps a few hundred times i love the search engine it has delivered the best results i want it to stay that way

4166344 assuming the consummation of a final agreement i would anticipate that the 50 50 sharing arrangement may result in annual revenue between 100 million and 150 million for all asia once the system is rolled out across china
4166345 the manager asked him if he needed to talk at that point he turned in his badge and left the building
4166346 he said he was interested in volunteering but that was obviously a lie
4166347 when he left yesterday he voluntarily left we asked him whats going on do you want to talk about something it was lets talk it was not about termination
4166348 we still dont have a motive and its going to be difficult to determine that

4166351 michelle and i are heartbroken to hear about the tragic loss of chairman bill gwatney were praying for his family and friends and all who worked with him and loved him
4166352 it makes you wonder what got into somebody to do something so horrible
4166353 i am convinced that honoring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion

4166359 venus was the best player in the world she has just won wimbledon
4166360 she has big serves that i cant receive but i told myself to calm down and play my best
4166361 wow you cant see this kind of crowd anywhere else it helped me and pushed me a lot this is a present i give to the beijing olympic games but i have no time to celebrate i have more matches to go
4166362 we played like we wanted to win we played together
4166363 we were very aware of their offensive sets we were very aware of their personnel and we played like that so we were kind of a step in front of what they wanted to do because we kind of knew everything already
4166364 any time you get beat its embarrassing and thats enough
4166365 and we can really use that as a tool to help us with our defense now and thats the name of the game because if you play good defense no matter how youre shooting the ball youre going to be in the game
4166366 i dont think the pick and roll tonight was as big a problem as it was in 06

4166372 le est n poniendo todos muchas ganas como es el caso de rolando ur os que est entrenando m s que en los siete a os que yo llevo aqu m s fuerte lo que demuestra la ilusi n que tiene por volver a jugar aunque este sobrecargado
4166373 esto no garantiza que ur os est para el inicio de la temporada algo que se ir constatando con el d a a d a
4166374 al igual que chema rodr guez que aunque est mejor de lo previsto ya que su evoluci n es muy positiva para este tipo de lesiones siempre es aconsejable cumplir con todos los plazos hasta octubre o noviembre pero los plazos lo marcan los m dicos
4166375 habr que ver como les afecta esto ya que mi experiencia como jugador me dicta que estas temporadas son mas complicadas y el peligro esta ah ya que el esfuerzo que est n realizado en pek n les puede pasar factura
4166376 est n trabajando con nosotros con una gran ilusi n y dedicaci n y aunque su capacidad de aprendizaje sea m s lenta se est n enriqueciendo como deportistas y personas estamos encantados con todos ellos
4166377 es dif cil marcarse objetivos ahora mismo todo va a depender de c mo comencemos la temporada si estamos bien es absurdo plantearse el objetivo de la permanencia habr a que ir a por algo m s
4166378 personalmente me voy encontrando bien y cada vez mejor pasa el tiempo y los entrenamientos y uno tiene m s ritmo m s all de los goles lo importante es poder disputar los partidos que es la nica manera de estar en forma y poder jugar en la liga

4166453 judges are not politicians in robes nor are they prizes to be won by aggressive special interests
4166454 when a california supreme court unilaterally amends the state constitution or a wisconsin supreme court announces that it will act as a super legislature to strike down medical malpractice legislation because it disagrees with the actual legislatures conclusions the judiciary has ceased to act as a judicial branch and is just another branch of government as a first choice i would prefer the judiciary to be a judiciary but if it is not going to do so then it is hard for me to see why the self appointed philosopher kings should not be directly answerable to the voters
4166455 but with so many modern judges bent on writing law by fiat doctors firemen and used car salesmen are just as qualified to opine on judicial philosophy in fact wed prefer the used car salesmen

4166550 the poem to my mother by palestinian poet mahmud darwish my translation i long for the bread of my mother and the coffee of my mother and the touch of my mother and childhood grows inside me a day over the chest of a day and i love my life because if i die i am embarrassed for the tears of my mother take me if i came back as a scarf for your eyelashes and cover my bones with grass baptized by the purity of your heels and bind me with a lock of your hair with a thread loose in the edge of your dress maybe that would make me god god i become if i touch the core of your heart place me if i return as fuel in the fire of your oven a rope for clothes on your roof because i lost the ability to stand without the prayer of your day i aged so please return the stars of childhood so that i can join the baby birds in the path of return to the nest of your waiting
4166551 from mahmud darwishs funeral thanks sherene who took the picture instead of writing about shoes and arab culture why dont these foreign correspondents write about the place of poetry in arab culture at least classical orientalists like philip hitti who i still like to read used to write about that i cant imagine a funeral like that for a poet in the u s is donald rumsfeld considered a poet

4166554 whoever prayed at night in it the month of ramadan out of sincere faith and hoping for a reward from allah then all his previous sins will be forgiven
4166555 whoever prayed at night the whole month of ramadan out of sincere faith and hoping for a reward from allah then all his previous sins will be forgiven
4166556 allahs apostle died and the people continued observing that i e nawafil offered individually not in congregation and it remained as it was during the caliphate of abu bakr and in the early days of umars caliphate
4166557 i went out in the company of umar bin al khattab one night in ramadan to the mosque and found the people praying in different groups a man praying alone or a man praying with a little group behind him so umar said in my opinion i would better collect these people under the leadership of one qari reciter i e let them pray in congregation so he made up his mind to congregate them behind ubai bin kab then on another night i went again in his company and the people were praying behind their reciter on that umar remarked what an excellent bida i e innovation in religion this is but the prayer which they do not perform but sleep at its time is better than the one they are offering he meant the prayer in the last part of the night in those days people used to pray in the early part of the night
4166558 allahs apostle went out in the middle of the night and prayed
4166559 amma badu your presence was not hidden from me but i was afraid lest the night prayer qiyam should be enjoined on you and you might not be able to carry it on
4166560 he did not pray more than eleven rakat in ramadan or in any other month he used to pray four rakat let alone their beauty and length and then he would pray four let alone their beauty and length and then he would pray three rakat witr
4166561 i asked o allahs apostle do you sleep before praying the witr he replied o aisha my eyes sleep but my heart does not sleep
4166562 whoever fasted the month of ramadan out of sincere faith i e belief and hoping for a reward from allah then all his past sins will be forgiven and whoever stood for the prayers in the night of qadr out of sincere faith and hoping for a reward from allah then all his previous sins will be forgiven
4166563 it seems that all your dreams agree that the night of qadr is in the last seven nights and whoever wants to search for it i e the night of qadr should search in the last seven nights of ramadan
4166564 we practiced itikaf seclusion in the mosque in the middle third of the month of ramadan with the prophet in the morning of the 20th of ramadan the prophet came and addressed us and said i was informed of the date of the night of qadr but i was caused to forget it so search for it in the odd nights of the last ten nights of the month of ramadan in the dream i saw myself prostrating in mud and water as a sign so whoever was in itikaf with me should return to it with me for another period and we returned at that time there was no sign of clouds in the sky but suddenly a cloud came and it rained till rain water started leaking through the roof of the mosque which was made of date palm leaf stalks then the prayer was established and i saw allahs apostle prostrating in mud and water and i saw the traces of mud on his forehead
4166565 search for the night of qadr in the odd nights of the last ten days of ramadan
4166566 i used to practice itikaf for these ten days i e the middle 113rd but now i intend to stay in itikaf for the last ten days of the month so whoever was in itikaf with me should stay at his place of seclusion i have verily been shown the date of this night of qadr but i have forgotten it so search for it in the odd nights of the last ten days of this month i also saw myself in the dream prostrating in mud and water
4166567 look for the night of qadr in the last ten nights of the month of ramadan
4166568 look for the night of qadr in the last ten nights of ramadan on the night when nine or seven or five nights remain out of the last ten nights of ramadan i e 21 23 25 respectively
4166569 the night of qadr is in the last ten nights of the month ramadan either on the first nine or in the last remaining seven nights of ramadan
4166570 i came out to inform you about the night of qadr but
4166571 stop this cant we all just be happy that you have eight healthy children that you have five and that you have one
4166572 new deal policies and the persistence of the great depression a general equilibrium analysis
4166573 real gross domestic product per adult which was 39 percent below trend at the trough of the depression in 1933 remained 27 percent below trend in 1939
4166574 similarly private hours worked were 27 percent below trend in 1933 and remained 21 percent below trend in 1939
4166575 the weak recovery is puzzling because the large negative shocks that some economists believe caused the 1929 33 downturn including monetary shocks productivity shocks and banking shocks become positive after 1933
4166576 the monetary base increases more than 100 percent between 1933 and 1939
4166577 positive monetary shocks should have produced a strong recovery with employment returning to its normal levels by 1936
4166578 new deal cartelization policies are a key factor behind the weak recovery accounting for about 60 percent of the difference between actual output and trend output
4166579 the great depression was very significantly prolonged in both its duration and its magnitude by the impact of new deal programs
4166580 new deal labor and industrial policies did not lift the economy out of the depression instead the joint policies of increasing labors bargaining power and linking collusion with paying high wages prevented a normal recovery by creating rents and an inefficient insider outsider friction that raised wages significantly and restricted employment the abandonment of these policies coincided with the strong economic recovery of the 1940s
4166581 regime uncertainty why the great depression lasted so long and why prosperity resumed after the war
4166582 the family they have questions and they want answers and no one is doing nothing about that
4166583 o allahs apostle inform me what allah has made compulsory for me as regards the prayers
4166584 you have to offer perfectly the five compulsory prayers in a day and night 24 hours unless you want to pray nawafil
4166585 inform me what allah has made compulsory for me as regards fasting
4166586 you have to fast during the whole month of ramadan unless you want to fast more as nawafil
4166587 tell me how much zakat allah has enjoined on me
4166588 by him who has honoured you i will neither perform any nawafil
4166589 if he is saying the truth he will succeed or he will be granted paradise
4166590 he who wants to fast on ashura may fast and he who does not want to fast may not fast
4166591 fasting is a shield or a screen or a shelter so the person observing fasting should avoid sexual relation with his wife and should not behave foolishly and impudently and if somebody fights with him or abuses him he should tell him twice i am fasting
4166592 by him in whose hands my soul is the smell coming out from the mouth of a fasting person is better in the sight of allah than the smell of musk allah says about the fasting person he has left his food drink and desires for my sake the fast is for me so i will reward the fasting person for it and the reward of good deeds is multiplied ten times
4166593 who remembers the narration of the prophet about the affliction
4166594 i heard the prophet saying the affliction of a person in his property family and neighbours is expiated by his prayers fasting and giving in charity
4166595 i do not ask about that but i ask about those afflictions which will spread like the waves of the sea
4166596 there is a closed gate in front of those afflictions
4166597 then the gate will not be closed again till the day of resurrection
4166598 would you ask hudhaifa whether umar knew what that gate symbolized
4166599 there is a gate in paradise called ar raiyan and those who observe fasts will enter through it on the day of resurrection and none except them will enter through it it will be said where are those who used to observe fasts they will get up and none except them will enter through it after their entry the gate will be closed and nobody will enter through it
4166600 whoever gives two kinds of things or property in charity for allahs cause will be called from the gates of paradise and will be addressed o slaves of allah here is prosperity so whoever was amongst the people who used to offer their prayers will be called from the gate of the prayer and whoever was amongst the people who used to participate in jihad will be called from the gate of jihad and whoever was amongst those who used to observe fasts will be called from the gate of ar raiyan whoever was amongst those who used to give in charity will be called from the gate of charity
4166601 let my parents be sacrificed for you o allahs apostle no distress or need will befall him who will be called from those gates will there be any one who will be called from all these gates
4166602 yes and i hope you will be one of them
4166603 when the month of ramadan starts the gates of the heaven are opened and the gates of hell are closed and the devils are chained
4166604 when you see the crescent of the month of ramadan start
4166605 whoever established prayers on the night of qadr out of sincere faith and hoping for a reward from allah then all his previous sins will be forgiven and whoever fasts in the month of ramadan out of sincere faith and hoping for a reward from allah then all his previous sins will be forgiven
4166606 whoever does not give up forged speech and evil actions allah is not
4166607 allah said all the deeds of adams sons people are for them except fasting which is for me and i will give the reward for it fasting is a shield or protection from the fire and from committing sins if one of you is fasting he should avoid sexual relation with his wife and quarrelling and if somebody should fight or quarrel with him he should say i am fasting by him in whose hands my soul is the unpleasant smell coming out from the mouth of a fasting person is better in the sight of allah than the smell of musk there are two pleasures for the fasting person one at the time of breaking his fast and the other at the time when he will meet his lord then he will be pleased because of his fasting
4166608 we were in the company of the prophet and he said he who can afford to marry should marry because it will help him refrain from looking at other women and save his private parts from looking at other women and save his private parts from committing illegal sexual relation and he who cannot afford to marry is advised to fast as fasting will diminish his sexual power
4166609 do not fast unless you see the crescent of ramadan and do not give up fasting till you see the crescent of shawwal but if the sky is overcast if you cannot see it then act on estimation i e count shaban as 30 days
4166610 the month can be 29 nights i e days and do not fast till you see the moon and if the sky is overcast then complete shaban as thirty days
4166611 start fasting on seeing the crescent of ramadan and give up fasting on seeing the crescent of shawwal and if the sky is overcast and you cannot see it complete thirty days of shaban
4166612 you vowed that you would not go to your wives for one month
4166613 o allahs apostle you vowed to stay aloof for one month
4166614 the two months of id i e ramadan and dhul hijja do not decrease in superiority
4166615 we are an illiterate nation we neither write nor know accounts the month is like this and this i e sometimes of 29 days and sometimes of thirty days
4166616 none of you should fast a day or two before the month of ramadan unless he has the habit of fasting nawafil and if his fasting coincides with that day then he can fast that day
4166617 no but i would go and bring some for you
4166618 you are permitted to go to your wives for sexual relation at the night of fasting
4166619 and eat and drink until the white thread of dawn appears to you distinct from the black thread of the night
4166620 that verse means the darkness of the night and the whiteness of the dawn
4166621 we took the suhur with the prophet then he stood for the prayer
4166622 what was the interval between the suhur and the adhan
4166623 the interval was sufficient to recite fifty verses of the quran
4166624 but you fast without break no food was taken in the evening or in the morning
4166625 i am not like you for i am provided with food and drink by allah
4166626 whoever has eaten should not eat any more but fast and who has not eaten should not eat but
4166627 the person who gets discharge after casting a look on his wife should complete his fast
4166628 allahs apostle used to kiss some of his wives while he was fasting
4166629 i testify that allahs apostle at times used to get up in the morning in a state of janaba from sexual intercourse not from a wet dream and then he would fast that day
4166630 if somebody eats or drinks forgetfully then he should complete his fast for what he has eaten or drunk has been given to him by allah
4166631 i saw the prophet cleaning his teeth with siwak while he was fasting so many times as i cant count
4166632 the prophet said but for my fear that it would be hard for my followers i would have ordered them to clean their teeth with siwak on every performance of ablution
4166633 i saw allahs apostle performing ablution similar to my present ablution and then he said whoever performs ablution like my present ablution and then offers two rakat in which he does not think of worldly things all his previous sins will be forgiven
4166634 i had sexual intercourse with my wife in ramadan while i was fasting
4166635 i had sexual intercourse with my wife while i was fasting
4166636 take this basket of dates and give it in charity
4166637 should i give it to a person poorer than i by allah there is no family between its i e medinas two mountains who are poorer than i
4166638 i had sexual intercourse with my wife on ramadan while fasting
4166639 should i feed it to poorer people than we there is no poorer house than ours between its medinas mountains
4166640 get down and mix sawiq powdered barley with water for me
4166641 when you see the night falling from this side then a fasting person should break his fast
4166642 you may fast if you wish and you may not fast if you wish
4166643 it is not righteousness that you fast on a journey
4166644 allahs apostle set out from medina to mecca and he fasted till he reached usfan where he asked for water and raised his hand to let the people see him and then broke the fast and did not fast after that till he reached mecca and that happened in ramadan
4166645 allahs apostle sometimes fasted and sometimes did not fast during the journeys so whoever wished to fast could fast and whoever wished not to fast could do so
4166646 they had a choice either to fast or to feed a poor person for every day and said that the order of this verse was cancelled volumn 003 book 031 hadith number 171 narated by aisha sometimes i missed some days of ramadan but could not fast in lieu of them except in the month of shaban
4166647 isnt it true that a woman does not pray and does not fast on menstruating and that is the defect a loss in her religion
4166648 whoever died and he ought to have fasted the missed days of ramadan then his guardians must fast on his behalf
4166649 o allahs apostle my mother died and she ought to have fasted one month for her missed ramadan shall i fast on her behalf
4166650 my mother died and she had vowed to fast but she didnt fast
4166651 when night falls from this side and the day vanishes from this side and the sun sets then the fasting person should break his fast
4166652 o so and so get up and mix sawiq with water for us
4166653 o allahs apostle will you wait till it is evening
4166654 o allahs apostle if you wait till it is evening
4166655 when you see night falling from this side the fasting person should break his fast
4166656 o allahs apostle will you wait till it is evening
4166657 when you see night falling from this side the fasting person should break his fast
4166658 the people will remain on the right path as long as they hasten the breaking of the fast
4166659 get down and mix sawiq with water for me when you see night falling from this side the fasting person should break his fast
4166660 we broke our fast during the lifetime of the prophet on a cloudy day and then the sun appeared
4166661 were they ordered to fast in lieu of that day
4166662 the prophet sent a messenger to the village of the ansar in the morning of
4166663 do not practice al wisal fasting continuously without breaking ones fast in the evening or eating before the following dawn
4166664 i am not like any of you for i am given food and drink by allah during the night
4166665 i am not like you for i am given food and drink by allah
4166666 do not fast continuously practise al wisal and if you intend to lengthen your fast then carry it on only till the suhur before the following dawn
4166667 i am not similar to you for during my sleep i have one who makes me eat and drink
4166668 i am not similar to you for my lord gives me food and drink
4166669 who amongst you is similar to me i am given food and drink during my sleep by my lord
4166670 if it the crescent had not appeared i would have made you fast for a longer period
4166671 o you people be cautious do not practice al wisal
4166672 my lord gives me food and drink during my sleep do that much of deeds which is within your ability
4166673 do not fast continuously day and night practise al wisal and if anyone of you intends to fast continuously day and night he should continue till the suhur time
4166674 i am not similar to you during my sleep i have one who makes me eat and drink
4166675 your brother abu ad darda is not interested in the luxuries of this world
4166676 your lord has a right on you your soul has a right on you and your family has a right on you so you should give the rights of all those who has a right on you
4166677 do those deeds which you can do easily as allah will not get tired of giving rewards till you get bored and tired of performing religious deeds
4166678 whenever i liked to see the prophet fasting in any month i could see that and whenever i liked to see him not fasting i could see that too and if i liked to see him praying in any night i could see that and if i liked to see him sleeping i could see that too
4166679 i never touched silk or velvet softer than the hand of allahs apostle and never smelled musk or perfumed smoke more pleasant than the smell of allahs apostle
4166680 o abdullah have i not been informed that you fast during the day and offer prayers all the night
4166681 dont do that fast for few days and then give it up for few days offer prayers and also sleep at night as your body has a right on you and your wife has a right on you and your guest has a right on you and it is sufficient for you to fast three days in a month as the reward of a good deed is multiplied ten times so it will be like fasting throughout the year
4166682 fast like the fasting of the prophet david and do not fast more than that
4166683 how was the fasting of the prophet of allah david
4166684 it would have been better for me if i had accepted the permission of the prophet which he gave me i e to fast only three days a month
4166685 let my parents be sacrificed for you i said so
4166686 you can not do that so fast for few days and give it up for few days r ray and sleep fast three days a month as the reward of good deeds is multiplied ten times and that will be equal to one year of fasting
4166687 fast one day and give up fasting for a day and that is the fasting of prophet david and that is the best fasting
4166688 i have the power to fast better more than that
4166689 i have been informed that you fast everyday and pray every night all the night fast for some days and give up fasting for some days pray and sleep for your eyes have a right on you and your body and your family i e wife have a right on you
4166690 he used to fast on alternate days and he used not to flee on meeting the enemy
4166691 i do not know how the expression of fasting daily throughout the life occurred
4166692 whoever fasts daily throughout his life is just as the one who does not fast at all
4166693 fast on alternate days and recite the whole quran once a month
4166694 you fast daily all the year and pray every night all the night
4166695 if you keep on doing this your eyes will become weak and your body will get tired he who fasts all the year is as he who did not fast at all the fasting of three days a month will be equal to the tasting of the whole year
4166696 then fast like the fasting of david who used to fast on alternate days and would never flee from the battle
4166697 isnt it sufficient for you to fast three days a month
4166698 there is no fast superior to that of the prophet david it was for half of the year so fast on alternate days
4166699 replace the ghee and dates in their respective containers for i am fasting
4166700 o allah give him i e anas property and children and bless him
4166701 o abu so and so have you fasted the last days of this month
4166702 when you finish your fasting of ramadan fast two days in shawwal
4166703 the prophet said have you fasted the last days of shaban
4166704 none of you should fast on friday unless he fasts a day before or after it
4166705 did allah s apostle use to choose some special days for fasting
4166706 no but he used to be regular constant in his service of worshipping who amongst you can endure what allahs apostle used to endure
4166707 while the people were with me on the day of arafat they differed as to whether the prophet was fasting or not some said that he was fasting while others said that he was not fasting so i sent to him a bowl full of milk while he was riding over his camel and he drank it
4166708 a man vowed to fast one day the sub narrator thinks that he said that the day was monday and that day happened to be id day
4166709 allah orders vows to be fulfilled and the prophet forbade the fasting on this day i e id
4166710 no lady should travel on a journey of two days except with her husband or a dhi mahram
4166711 no fasting is permissible on the two days of id ul fitr and id ul adha
4166712 no prayer may be offered after the morning compulsory prayer until the sun rises and no prayer after the asr
4166713 one should travel only for visiting three masajid mosques masjid ul haram mecca masjid ul aqsa jerusalem and this my mosque at medina
4166714 o the people of medina where are your religious scholars i
4166715 this is a good day the day on which allah rescued bani israel from their enemy so moses fasted this day
4166716 its a very seminal period an opportunity to both celebrate 20 years of content and the fact that the source was a leader in chronicling the culture of hip hop
4166717 im on a mission to restore it to the community that gave birth to it and open the door to those that currently enjoy and influence that hip hop culture
4166718 its exciting because we believe that we can do it
4166719 we shared with him what we were trying to do the vision of hip hop and where we thought it needed to go and he thought it was refreshing and clever
4166720 were just going to expand on what the source has always done well
4166721 a core focus but not 80 per cent of the book
4166722 i think that what were trying to do is evolve it as hip hop has evolved and become an international force to evolve it without losing its core essence that was the centrepiece of its earliest beginnings and greatness but it has to evolve just like hip hop has to evolve
4166723 it is a force nobody can deny the force or the power of the source but is it the same as it was five years ago no
4166724 it does not deliver with the same punch that it used to
4166725 if they are true to the dna of the publication
4166726 it left off so much of what is the key ingredients of hip hop and lifestyle now which is lifestyle fashion online new media international aspects of how people embrace content
4166727 if anything we want to restore it restore it to greatness and its no 1 spot

4166733 tractor outdoor has always prided itself in being able to secure and manage the most iconic sites in cape town
4166734 we pride ourselves on being able to continually deliver effective iconic signage solutions for our clients in cape town under what is widely regarded as a restrictive and bureaucratic outdoor environment we are proud to be associated with the green point visitors centre and will continue to work with them to come up with further creative ways of funding this fantastic project we would further like to thank the city of cape town for working with the green point joint venture to ensure that this project was a success

4166742 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4166743 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4166744 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4166745 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4166746 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4166747 this network effect and rapid protection against these new tactics is why businesses are increasingly moving their e mail security into the cloud
4166748 i have six kids ive been through it all and i can tell you that having twins is different its hard
4166749 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4166750 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4166751 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4166752 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4166753 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4166754 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4166755 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4166756 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4166757 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

4166788 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
4166789 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4166790 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4166791 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4166792 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4166793 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4166794 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4166795 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4166796 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4166797 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4166798 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4166799 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4166800 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4166801 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4166802 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4166803 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4166804 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4166805 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4166806 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4166807 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4166808 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4166809 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4166810 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
4166811 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
4166812 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle

4166818 finalmente pascual pienso que los que llevamos tanto tiempo colaborando en rebeli n de alguna forma deber amos buscar espacios con los que poder entre nosotros mismos conseguir una mayor aproximaci n nbsp ideol gica para que desde nuestras limitaciones personales culturales y pol ticas nos ayud ramos a una mejor colaboraci n y que como dijera gramsci contribuir de forma m s eficaz a que se genere el intelectual colectivo que posibilite finalmente un verdadero proyecto organizativo revolucionario

4166821 desde la ptica marxista del estado y la democracia recogiendo adem s la experiencia del movimiento obrero internacional en la lucha por sus reivindicaciones econ micas y pol ticas se hace preciso abrir un debate en el seno de iu para analizar la forma de impulsar la eficacia de la acci n de los cargos electos y militantes de iu implicando adem s a los electores y a la base social en la que se sustenta su acci n pol tica
4166822 los cargos electos de iu en un r gimen de democracia formal limitada y poco participativa para el conjunto de los ciudadanos dif cilmente pueden conseguir que se aprueben sus propuestas que afectan a la mayor a social y que l gicamente chocan frontalmente con los intereses de la clase dominante si su acci n pol tica se limita a ejercerla en el estricto marco parlamentario estatal de las comunidades o de las corporaciones locales sin m s respaldo que da el n mero de diputados o concejales que disponga
4166823 es necesario que se constituyan formas de organizaci n y participaci n ciudadana de forma permanente que refuercen la eficacia de la acci n pol tica planteada por los cargos electos propiciando la informaci n y su implicaci n en la defensa de sus intereses canalizar de arriba abajo y de abajo arriba toda la informaci n y propuestas de acci n

4166826 i knew something had hit my windshield and i felt glass spray at my face
4166827 i looked down and i saw my leg was bleeding
4166828 i saw the hole and i figured it had to have been a bullet
4166829 after i saw my leg i was actually worried that maybe a bullet had gone into my leg
4166830 i was terrified it was very scary i felt very lucky very blessed i mean had my seat been up a little bit further i realized it could have gone and hot me
4166831 i really didnt i wasnt looking around my main goal was to get out of three
4166832 the damage is big in the dressing room nothing can stop me from leaving now
4166833 there is no question that any deal will be done with regards to didier kenyon said

4166835 didier is in rehab and will continue to be a chelsea player i think we can squash that one
4166836 the miners strike was intense repetitious and demanding and i felt the text of gb84 should reflect that
4166837 that the media blurs fact with fiction every singe day
4166838 ok maybe not exactly how most people would phrase it but the sentiment is the same
4166839 a joke went the rounds that beijing was the only place in the world where you had to phone a restaurant before going out for dinner not to reserve a table but to check that the building hadnt been demolished this struck me as a little exaggerated until one evening when after driving up and down the same street several times in an increasingly desperate search for a favourite restaurant we realised that it had indeed been swallowed up by a large building site we retreated to a large and evidently very popular restaurant on the other side of the road the food was very good and a few weeks later my friend decided to go there again when he arrived he found only a corrugated iron fence a large hole in the ground and signs announcing the citys next construction project

4166851 its this four decades of unbelievably brilliant compounded wine knowledge thats been rammed into this little community that weve got over here in hong kong
4166852 its like walking into a candy store and everything is five star quality chocolate as opposed to going into a walmart and having to look for the chocolate stand
4166853 i would say beating the number one player in the world has got to be up there
4166854 the feeling the emotion involved is huge its something i have to not think about right now because theres still work to be done in this tournament
4166855 i didnt serve really well it was what it was it hasnt sunk in yet
4166856 im very excited for the moment im very excited about my semi finals here and i dont want to think about a medal
4166857 im here to purchase the more symbolic products such as umbrellas stamps and commemorative coins
4166858 this is my 15th olympics and i have a collection of mascots and things so i have to get the mascots there are five of them so i have to get all five of them
4166859 there are four groups of best selling items and they include badges apparel hats as well as plush toys
4166860 im taking the opportunity to celebrate this event go olympic go go china go
4166861 it would be an honor to beat padraig harrington or sergio
4166862 im ready to go out and play with either one of them it dont matter who paul azinger u s captain puts me against
4166863 he had the pressure on him all week and he just got off to a horrendous start i cant think of a worse way to start on a golf course that is just frightfully difficult
4166864 once you get behind the 8 ball and you have that kind of aggression that kind of power game you start thinking birdies and then all of a sudden you short side yourself and start making bogeys and it begins to snowball if ever there was a golf course you could discount a poor round this would be the one
4166865 one more good round and ill be in good shape im excited about it
4166866 the greatest test of golf i have ever played and the toughest course
4166867 this was a big game for us we had this one circled for a long time
4166868 a few of us felt we really needed this game to prove to ourselves we do mean business and were ready to win the gold medal
4166869 they knew what to do to take us out of our game
4166870 kobe had a lot of good dunks that was crazy
4166871 they pretty much picked us apart in 2006 the only way to change that was to be aggressive
4166872 were built to play defense we will eventually impose our will and wear them down
4166873 the defense in the second quarter turned it around for us
4166874 we played very good defense im proud of our effort
4166875 every time we go out of the hotel they are celebrating us
4166876 very agitated and shaking and they feared for their safety
4166877 they introduced themselves and at that time he johnson pulled out a handgun and shot chairman gwatney several times he then turned and left the business
4166878 we are deeply saddened by the news that bill gwatney has passed away
4166879 since june senators obama and clinton have been working together to ensure a democratic victory this november they are both committed to winning back the white house and to to ensuring that the voices of all 35 million people who participated in this historic primary election are respected and heard in denver to honor and celebrate these voices and votes both senator obamas and senator clintons names will be placed in nomination
4166880 i am convinced that honoring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4166881 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect senator obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again

4166884 one of the steps that has long been required is the establishment of a proper embassy for syria in lebanon and vice versa
4166885 now if the syrians will go ahead and demarcate the border between lebanon and syria and respect lebanons sovereignty in other ways then this will have proved to be a very good step
4166886 to reactivate the work of the joint committee to demarcate the lebanese syrian borders within a mechanism and a set of priorities
4166887 it is not possible to mark the borders in shebaa farms as long as there is still israeli occupation the occupation must end
4166888 to activate and step up the work of the joint committee on people missing from both countries
4166889 around two dozen convicts affiliated with various political and criminal armed outfits in southern nepal have fled
4166890 weve caught five of them the rest of the fugitives are still at large and we have intensified our search
4166891 all the leaders stressed the importance of standing by a sovereign free georgia and its territorial integrity and agreed on the need for russia to stop the violence abide by the ceasefire and withdraw its forces
4166892 our position on georgias territorial integrity is not going to change no matter what anybody says and so i would consider that bluster coming from the foreign minister of russia and we will ignore it
4166893 we expect that our humanitarian aid would be allowed to get in by air land or sea
4166894 all of those issues that you mention are certainly ones that people are going to be talking about all around the world
4166895 right now were focused on making sure that we can get the cease fire in place and cemented so that we could protect innocent life
4166896 the days and months to come will determine the future course of us russian relations
4166897 but by the same token my personal view is that there needs to be some consequences for the actions that russia has taken against a sovereign state
4166898 clearly we have helped the georgians build up their military and we are going to be supportive of them
4166899 said we will stand by them and that we will defend their freedom
4166900 i dont want you to think that were sending in troops im not saying that
4166901 what im saying is that we have helped them help themselves and equipment is going to be critical in that regard theyve lost a lot of it
4166902 it was the russians themselves who agreed to the peace plan that president sarkozy presented on the international allies behalf
4166903 so we would hold them to the agreement that they signed on to
4166904 we are not there to defend the ports we are there to provide humanitarian aid

4166959 the op indicated earlier that the leds have an integrated resistor
4166960 intelligence focal point for the gathering of required geoint source data and the production of the ussocom common database in support of the sof mission and training preparation systems mtps
4166961 we spend a lot of time and effort in developing high resolution elevation data colorizing imagery and digitizing and conflating the vector feature data to correlate with the imagery
4166962 turnaround time is too long current time from collection to product generation can be anywhere from 30 to 90 days
4166963 this prevents large size areas from ever being created it is just too cumbersome
4166964 with unconstrained freedom of movement our customers can fly through or drive on 3 d terrain with a 200 km far horizon while maintaining a rate of 60 frames per second
4166965 its based on the esri arcgis platform which provides a great deal of built in support for nearly any kind of geospatial data out there
4166966 since this terrain generation capability is integrated with the tools that most customers are probably already using to manage their geospatial data assets our terrain tools extension enables them to leverage these assets more effectively for the creation of high fidelity virtual environments
4166967 ground level environments were generally small in geographic coverage with a greater amount of cultural content such as buildings trees and other features aerial environments were optimized for flying at a high altitude over greater distances with expansive geographic coverage but little to no ground level cultural content
4166968 we have to make the experience of a dismounted soldier looking at a building from a meter away just as realistic as the view from a uav looking at the same building from thousands of meters in the air all within the same virtual environment
4166969 in constructing such an environment we must bridge the gap between the super highresolution ground level source data photographs survey data and the lower resolution remotely sensed data aerial and satellite photography and digital elevation models and make the transition between these data types believable
4166970 the cga provides a set of all the standard national geospatial intelligence agency worldwide data sets raster product format vector product format and digital terrain elevation data along with some interesting commercial data such as natural vue 2000 and the nasa 90 meter worldwide data elevation model
4166971 what this means is that units involved in modeling and simulation will have unprecedented user friendly easy to access worldwide geospatial data at global strategic tactical and urban scales to support training and simulation exercises as well as actual operations
4166972 most current cgf applications utilize one of the common simulation terrain database representations such as openflight compact terrain databases and others these database formats having been derived from the classic visual simulation tool chain are not generally correlated with the geospatial data used by c2 and analysis systems this lack of correlation can produce serious anomalies in the simulation results
4166973 because of this there will be degradation in speed of the simulation in comparison to current real time optimized database formats streaming of just in time geospatial data will also prove a challenge as compared to off line production and execution of static optimized databases
4166974 this is a terrain processing layer inside vr forces that simulates on top of the native geospatial data not a derived visual format
4166975 as vr forces is simulating on top of the exact same geospatial database that is used in the corresponding c2 system the anomalies due to a lack of correlation are eliminated
4166976 were in the process of finalizing our vr forces roadmap for 2009 and are working on a firm release date for the gems features
4166977 these ortho mosaics and 3 d site models provide increased situational awareness and meet the operational needs of warfighters
4166978 sand tables have been a staple for military training and mission rehearsal since the invention of sand there is something about having a single stable reference terrain that allows groups of people to focus on the mission rather than how they should interpret a flat map
4166979 the models are computer numeric control cut from a solid foam block according to the digital elevation model then printed with map graphics aerial imagery or a combination of both
4166980 the model gives everyone a view of the area of interest and supports multiple conversations simultaneously unlike a computer generated view which forces everyone to look at the scene from the same position and angle the models may be of any size and virtually any scale for which data is available
4166981 one thing that we are actively pursuing in geospatial r amp d that will have a significant impact on modeling and simulation is the value of having a common battle management language bml
4166982 we think that the evolving capability of bml represents a key technology that can potentially unite the disparate systems involved in battle management particularly bml has the potential to create realistic train as you fight modeling and simulation capability we are also interested in how the geospatial component of bml or geobml will evolve as a subset and in parallel with bml

4166998 we breezed through beijing in fast forward pedaling past storefronts decorated with chinese flags a mother washing her toddlers face a pair of soldiers standing at attention a block or two later the traffic cleared and the stone walls of the forbidden city appeared through an archway we saw a cobbled courtyard stately trees and hordes of chinese tourists

4167060 if part of our problem is that the chinese are going to eat meat and youve got to have corn and soybeans to feed the chinese their meat then why isnt it just as legitimate for the chinese to go back and eat rice as it is for us to change our policy on corn to ethanol

4167069 well i got here by the grace of god alone
4167070 well i dont understand why are you here and your best friend is not
4167071 what makes your friend so different hes a sinner too why is he in hell and you not
4167072 i dont know why god had mercy on me i do know that i was elect and my best friend wasnt hes in hell because god thought that was for the best
4167073 are you saying that your friend isnt here because the eternal and holy god damned your friend before he even existed and you are here strutting about because god chose you over everyone else
4167074 wait wait youre actually saying that the eternal and holy god who sent his only begotten son to rescue humanity and all of creation decided before humanity existed that humanity consisted of only an elect few and the rest he damned to an eternity of torture why on heaven would he do that
4167075 well now i know that eternal and holy god indeed had mercy on sinners
4167076 im in heaven ultimately because i believed and got here
4167077 god had mercy on me a sinner even on the weakness of my faith which was nothing but the blind grasping of a drowning man
4167078 i speak only the words that the holy spirit has elected for me to speak now that i am perfected
4167079 in light of your failure to nominate competent candidates for president of the usa and thus to govern yourselves we hereby give notice of the revocation of your independence effective immediately
4167080 her sovereign majesty queen elizabeth ii will resume monarchical duties
4167081 none besides the obvious ones that come with such a relationship
4167082 dac ma njuri pe blog la tine nu comenta pe blog la mine

4167085 tasks at hand will expand to fill the time allotted
4167086 my people dont invite others because they dont know anyone outside of our own circle
4167087 the united sates is now accepting musharrafs removal as a fait accompli
4167088 they just want that he should not be humiliated we dont want his humiliation either
4167089 they are saying if you do it according to the book its none of our business they have pushed against mr musharraf
4167090 with one voice they said this is the time you have to be with the democratic forces
4167091 but no one is actually in the mood to see what it is going to be like to be in the post musharraf era
4167092 that which is hateful to you do not do to another the rest of the torah is all commentary now go study
4167093 audio panton cogito singularis listen to everything think for yourself
4167094 my first response is its a comedy were really making fun of ourselves the whole movie is about actors and actors who try to do things to be taken seriously so in the context of the movie im really comfortable thats how it comes off
4167095 everybody of course is entitled to their opinion when you make a movie you have to kind of go with your gut i feel like our heart is in the right place with it
4167096 with any comedy anything you put out there some people are gonna get it some people are gonna be into it and other people wont but the movie ive screened it so many times with audiences its fun to see audiences laugh everybody doesnt take it as seriously when you get outside of it and people talk about these issues we all want to laugh at ourselves
4167097 its amazing hes a really funny actor and he doesnt get a chance to do comedies
4167098 when the russians come across an abandoned georgian military installation they are not leaving them as is
4167099 if russia does not step back from its aggressive posture and actions in georgia the us russian relationship could be adversely affected for years to come
4167100 they clearly had a great advantage in having superior air power and a lot of force that they were able to bring to bear
4167101 my own view is that its a strange thing but since 2004 every august there has been an exchange of fire between the south ossetians and the georgians this year it escalated very quickly and it seemed to me that the russians were prepared to take advantage of a situation and did so very aggressively
4167102 punish georgia for rather more than their part in the annual exchange of fire but for daring to try to integrate with the west
4167103 signal to the rest of the former soviet union against trying to move out of the russian sphere of influence
4167104 i am convinced that honoring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4167105 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect senator obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again
4167106 i am convinced that honoring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4167107 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect senator obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again
4167108 i am convinced that honoring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4167109 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect senator obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again
4167110 a lot of people just want change right now and sen obama represents more change
4167111 he flies around on a 12 6 million corporate jet
4167112 if john mccain lost his social security hed get by just fine would you
4167113 make no mistake john mccain would eviscerate social security as we know it and leave millions of seniors hanging out to dry
4167114 not ready to lead and obama has run a positive national message but also battleground state ads calling mccain like president bush
4167115 put hard working americans first by growing the economy eliminate tax cuts for companies that send jobs overseas create new jobs at home invest in education and cut taxes for working families
4167116 the platforms that nbc has for its exclusive olympics coverage the obama campaign says
4167117 the global war on terror and the conflict in georgia
4167118 for anyone who thought that stark international aggression was a thing of the past the last week must have come as a startling wake up call after all georgia is a small remote and obscure place
4167119 a cease fire that holds is a vital first step but only one
4167120 u s credibility is on the line as the bush administration stumbles to respond to the russian invasion of georgia so far the administration has been missing in action
4167121 set the record straight on reports of the press adjustments more often applied to the reporting of say
4167122 on day 32 colbert democrats receive 8 247 more than the control
4167123 to give a sense of scale the average monthly amount received by all candidates at all points in time in the data is 21 107 so we are talking about a bump of roughly two fifths over the normal rate of receipts
4167124 we need fresh new leadership in washington d c a proven leader like mike huckabee he wasnt too well known on the campaign stump until he got his biggest break the stephen colbert bump
4167125 thats a 300 percent increase after a two and a half minute interview if he keeps up that pace between now and the election hell be the first candidate ever to get elected with 88 128 000 percent of the vote
4167126 we have long stood for the normalization of relations between syria and lebanon on the basis of equality and respect for lebanese sovereignty
4167127 the results of this years election will have an enormous impact on the competitiveness of our countrys businesses and workers
4167128 through these tours were setting out to build member awareness about how policy issues in washington impact millions of americans jobs
4167129 oprah has not been asked to introduce him is not expecting to be asked to introduce him and i would doubt that she would want to introduce him king said
4167130 she thinks this is his moment i know that she is planning to be there
4167131 may well do so at the democratic national convention in denver
4167132 i am hearing from people who talk directly to the obama campaign that colin powell will endorse senator obama and he may well give a speech at the democratic national convention explaining his endorsement of obama kristol who also is a contributor to fox news said on the cable news channel today
4167133 people are very confident that powell will endorse obama and they think it may well be the case that powell will speak on wednesday at the democratic convention kristol added
4167134 thats the national security night thats also the night the vice presidential nominee will speak
4167135 obviously served the first term in the bush administration i dont think that was a happy experience honestly for secretary powell and for whatever reason i think he has decided that he is going to endorse obama
4167136 i am not attending either political convention as i have said for some time i know both candidates and i am studying their positions and statements i have not decided who i will vote for
4167137 we are deeply saddened by the news that bill gwatney has passed away his leadership and commitment to arkansas and this country have always inspired us and those who had the opportunity to know him our prayers are with his family during this time
4167138 he said he was interested in volunteering but that was obviously a lie
4167139 battleground states 16 states in which the presidential candidates margin of victory was less than 8 percentage points in 2004 obama has outraised mccain in pennsylvania ohio wisconsin and more
4167140 battleground states the obama ad throws an imaginary book at mccain it opens with a cover picture of
4167141 supported george bush 95 percent of the time spending 10 billion a month in iraq record oil prices giving iraq a 79 billion oil surplus that hurts our economy
4167142 barack obamas plan end the war responsibly the ads narrator states
4167143 better schools no more tax breaks for oil companies barack obama the middle class first
4167144 a steady hand on the tiller and an experienced one
4167145 the events of the last few days show that there are many places in the world where we dont necessarily anticipate this kind of conflicts breaking out
4167146 and it does require a steady hand on the tiller and an experienced one
4167147 we also have to understand what this is about the centuries old ambitions of the russians to establish the russian empire
4167148 whatever happens i dont want to know anything about a contract during the season i want to sign with the cubs before the season starts if they dont sign me sorry but i must go thats what carlos zambrano thinks
4167149 cubs general manager jim hendry spent a lot of money this offseason

4167161 that was the toughest audience all his close friends were there
4167162 braudis put his arm around me and said great fucking book kid mckeen says
4167163 i want critics to like the book but its more important to me to get positive feedback from people like that even hunters widow anita thompson who is very difficult to please shes very protective of his legacy gave me a great shout out on her blog
4167164 i knew that he was not a perfect human being
4167165 but i hated learning about his abuse of women and friends you could be his best friend in the world but in his reckless desire of women hed take your wife home it didnt matter that you were his best friend thats disturbing to me but i really admired his commitment to the struggle of being a writer in the early years when he received no positive feedback
4167166 i suppose like others i expected a mad dog character
4167167 in fact thompson was a polite quiet soft spoken almost shy guy
4167168 walking up to the stage his body changed he became this loping figure jerking his head around trying to play up to the role like all hunter speaking engagements it was a disaster but he had to do them he made more money from those than writing i discovered how he lived from paycheck to paycheck even when he was at the top of his game he lived hand to mouth
4167169 in my first thompson book hunter s thompson published in 1991 i put in a comparison to mark twain and an academic editor took it out editors win
4167170 barack obama recently finished a 500 000 total overhaul of his 757 and as part of the new design he decided to remove the american flag from the tail
4167171 you know the truth is that right after 9 11 i had a pin
4167172 shortly after 9 11 particularly because as were talking about the iraq war that became a substitute for i think true patriotism which is speaking out on issues that are of importance to our national security i decided i wont wear that pin on my chest
4167173 thomas jefferson said that dissent is the highest form of patriotism
4167174 a lheure actuelle linitiative mane plut t de la france qui assure la pr sidence tournante de lunion europ enne ue et les am ricains se sentent sans doute en quelque sorte vinc s aussi proposent ils un format o ils dominent
4167175 in the 90s there was a zine explosion all around the world
4167176 florida really had a pretty rippin zine culture there were a lot of really good ones coming out of tampa brandon valrico st petersburg and clearwater
4167177 i liked the fact that you get exposure to all these different views more than you would get in the mainstream media
4167178 especially in tampa because things here are so spread out and so dead zines were a way to find those other creative type people out there that were doing interesting things
4167179 it was freedom of speech freedom of the press in the purest form
4167180 when you go to a copier make copies fold them over and staple it yourself you dont have to answer to anybody
4167181 in two phone calls i could arrange an interview with david bowie
4167182 youd find a couple bands youd never know of whole genres of music youd never find otherwise
4167183 it was really cool because youd find them all over the place
4167184 youd go anywhere and there would be so many zines it was so awesome being in the presence of so many creative people
4167185 myspace message boards pdf files and the high cost of postage
4167186 there was just that allure of i dont have to spend money to print it
4167187 i think punks and print is starting to part ways
4167188 and i think there will always be a kind of person that will prefer print over online someone who is going to prefer the homemade to the mass produced someone who is going to prefer something gritty and personal to the glossy magazine

4167191 when j s wright present motorbike record holder makes an attack on his 150 m p h record established this year he will ride a machine which represents the last word in streamlining to such an extent are the streamlining principles carried out that certain parts of the cowling were built with the rider on the machine much as a tailor fits a suit to a customer the power of the racing motor has been boosted to deliver well over 100 h p by the use of a supercharger and it is expected that this motorcycle will reach a speed of 170 m p h
4167192 you didnt go there so you cant cheer for them you cant ditch your own school even if its as pathetic as carnegie mellon
4167193 the fact that financials are on the mend is part of whats giving the market buoyancy today
4167194 the only hope that this market has is that with the commodity prices having come down fairly substantially over the last month or so that trend will continue if it continues it will go a long way in helping the fed not have to raise rates
4167195 we think the recovery will be shaped more like a nike swoosh with gradual improvement in 2009
4167196 versus last year full size trucks are still going to be down but we are seeing some incremental improvement in july versus june and august versus july
4167197 its not going to counteract the shift that we really started to see in april
4167198 as americans become more environmentally conscious many of us look for ways to shrink our carbon footprint one great way to go green is to support local farmers
4167199 however our readers tell us how challenging it can be to put together an entire meal using local ingredients so epicurious is touring the countrys farmers markets to offer inspiration and tips for eco minded cooks of all levels
4167200 we were pleased with the waca reaction that the new playing dates offer local fans including corporate groups wanting to entertain at the cricket good dates for a pre christmas test match
4167201 we also took feedback from players that the changes could be accommodated without compromising what will be a de facto world test cricket championship between australia and south africa
4167202 the people of jammu have suffered from gross discrimination the problem in j amp k is not hindu vs muslims jammu region vs kashmir region but its nationalists vs separatists

4167204 it pakistans comments on events in jammu and kashmir does not help create the right type of atmosphere for carrying on the composite dialogue

4167208 could help explain the incidence of some types of skin cancer in patients
4167209 very hard to relate to humans and sun induced skin cancer
4167210 moisturiser use is much greater among women however skin cancers and in particular the type of skin cancers studied in this research seem to be more common among men
4167211 the potential for alarmism is high and therefore this paper invites the highest level of scrutiny which it does not in my view sufficiently bear to warrant publication
4167212 why should we trust anything john mccain says hes cheated on his wife
4167213 as we coasted along streets that were as flat as a moo shu pancake mccartney was almost giddy isnt this the best way to see a city he shouted
4167214 a vacuum cleaner has motors in it it goes voom voom it makes the house clean
4167215 we have seen first hand how asbestos has wreaked havoc on americans working in naval shipyards automobile plants and the construction industry most often this is through their employers conscious choice for profits over a workers health
4167216 the economic value of a music file is about one euro whereas a movie is valued at about 15 euro based on that we define a commercial level as damages greater than 3000 euro

4167225 the home minister syed hamid albar was even reported to have said that the bar council should bear the consequences if it went on with the forum
4167226 one would have expected these same politicians in this day and time to prevail upon the extremists groups for tolerance and understanding
4167227 religious tolerance can only be nurtured by dialogue and understanding
4167228 instead they continue to sacrifice these fundamentals for political expediency

4167233 if that flag really does represent turkish cypriots as claimed how is that the cyprus olympic team introduced by christofias does not even have one turkish cypriot on it he should explain why a single turkish cypriot is not taking part in the olympics

4167238 we have said that this is a condition driven process
4167239 we let her know about the policy and instead shes now selling a photograph of the offending knickers
4167240 it takes it to a whole new level when you see the game on a screen thats more than 50 feet wide if they wanted to book a four hour window we could certainly go later in the evening if the theatre manager has the staffing they could go till two in the morning

4167501 desverg enza impropia de un presidente el hecho de que circunscriba la discusi n sobre rtvv a los aspectos t cnicos sin haber dado un solo paso por constituir su consejo asesor solicitado reiteradamente con la presentaci n de una proposici n no de ley y que el pp ha votado en contra
4167502 que la oposici n a la que canal 9 maltrata sistem ticamente en sus informativos y programaci n le ayude a salvar una situaci n financiera de una empresa que desde hace una d cada es insostenible econ mica y socialmente y que necesita cambios profundos y no s lo maquillaje
4167503 si camps quiere consenso en el modelo de rtvv debemos hablar de todo y no s lo de cuestiones t cnicas
4167504 debemos hablar de modelo de informativos del futuro de los trabajadores de rtvv de la calidad de la programaci n de la utilizaci n de productoras externas del uso del valenciano del nombramiento de la direcci n de la capacidad t cnica y profesional de los responsables del ente de la participaci n de los trabajadores en la gesti n del apoyo al audiovisual valenciano y de un largo etc tera que sistem ticamente el pp ha rechazado

4167508 la ltima por cierto la presentaci n de la propuesta para la que se constituyera de una vez el consejo asesor de rtvv y que el pp vot en contra
4167509 ni un contrato programa ni un nuevo modelo de financiaci n solucionar n el problema b sico de rtvv que es que el pp la considera de su propiedad y la pone al servicio de sus intereses partidistas m s espurios
4167510 para hablar de consenso y pedir ayuda a la oposici n primero hay que permitir el juego a todas las opciones pol ticas y dejar de insultarlas ya que si nos llama para hablar y nos pide que vayamos con las manos atadas y la boca tapada eso no puede ser un di logo sino un mon logo y para mon logos ya tenemos la actual programaci n de la televisi n y la radio p blica valenciana
4167511 permita que las discusiones entorno de los modelos que cada partido tenemos respeto del ente rtvv tengan cabida en programas de canal 9 y en los informativos con una discusi n de profesionales y t cnicos de cada una de las formaciones pol ticas en debates p blicos en el que podamos trasladar a la ciudadan a para qu queremos una televisi n p blica y que sea ella la que pueda opinar directamente

4167608 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me

4167632 you know marcel proust french writer total loser never had a real job unrequited love affairs gay spent 20 years writing a book almost no one reads but hes also probably the greatest writer since shakespeare anyway he uh he gets down to the end of his life and he looks back and decides that all those years he suffered those were the best years of his life cause they made him who he was all those years he was happy you know total waste didnt learn a thing so if you sleep until youre 18 ah think of the suffering youre gonna miss i mean high school high school those are your prime suffering years you dont get better suffering than that
4167633 even after just the first day of shooting everyone went home and said he is a monster
4167634 he is a hands on guy and in relentless pursuit of perfection
4167635 i was so excited to be doing it because i had been making it for so long
4167636 we spent a lot of time on drafts of the movie over the course of eight or nine years and there were times when i thought we would never get it made there were other times when i thought this is a good idea but how do we figure it all out
4167637 the idea was there for a first act and a second act right at the beginning but not the actual articulation of it i think i stuck with it because it is the kind of film i would like to see and it has been a long time since i have made a movie for which i am the core audience
4167638 a world wide positive intention experiment will be conducted at 8 pm universal time 08 08 08 to put an end to secret agreements that have prevented the revolutionary technology and knowledge of extraterrestrial life entering mainstream society a galactic freedom day declaration has been issued by cooperating citizen organizations clearly expressing humanitys intent to put an end to secret agreements concerning extraterrestrial life
4167639 all culture is a cover for secretively monstrous behavior particularly the nuclear family
4167640 the whole world is a mess and i just want to rule it
4167641 people who sort of even know me in real life sometimes express disbelief until the people who really do know me confirm to them that its all true people who dont know me at all usually think i make all this crap up the funniest part of this to me is that there is so much that i actually dont write about that is about a hundred times crazier than the stuff i actually do write about if you all only knew thats all i have to say if yall only knew
4167642 decisions decisions just roll the dice fate is going to do with you what she will anyway
4167643 unfettered whining is a banana split for the motherfucking soul
4167644 theres no rule that says you have to be fulfilled doing a particular socially acceptable thing
4167645 its a strange thing to discover when youre an adult that youve been somewhat misadjusted to the world your entire life and didnt know it
4167646 if you can get past the occasional imbecile induced bike folly and the fact that davis seems to perpetually be in the path of some giant bipolar tornado you may come to realize that this city is a great place to live
4167647 i see a bookshelf filled with different books from different authors all acting as portals to different worlds and different times the author may give them birth but its the readers who keep them alive
4167648 some books contain the machinery required to create and sustain universes
4167649 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
4167650 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me
4167651 i found that writing for me was a thing of the hands hands need to produce art and whether its written or made it feeds the need to produce art
4167652 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
4167653 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
4167654 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
4167655 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking
4167656 why does my job exist it exists because i willed it into existence when the day goes badly i can remind myself that i have asked for this job by name and thought to create this for myself and i can only blame myself for the whole thing
4167657 dude i was a nerd from the day i was born i was reading in kindergarten i got humungous glasses that covered half of my face in second grade ive been living the nerd life ever since
4167658 people with happy families dont become spies a bad childhood is the perfect background for covert ops you dont trust anyone youre used to getting smacked around and you never get homesick
4167659 i sometimes think god is a shit and he wouldnt be worth it otherwise hes much more interesting when hes a shit
4167660 sometimes though you dont get to choose what kinda fame youre gonna get or how much itll cost ya
4167661 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
4167662 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother
4167663 when you are young passion and hope are so strong thats its almost impossible to stop loving someone after youve been kicked around by life however you start to have a dual response to handsome con men wow and arrrrrrgh it takes not will power but painful experience to make us wise
4167664 be of service go where you can help if youre an artist be of service to your art dont have it the other way around you have to put aside your dreams of being a hotshot and learn to be useful you step up everyday get a nice clean hit and youre done
4167665 oh honey you just need to meet the right man
4167666 whenever youre called on to make up your mind and youre hampered by not having any the simplest way to solve the dilemma youll find is simply by flipping a penny no not so that chance shall decide the affair as youre passively standing there moping but as soon as the penny is up in the air youll suddenly know what youre hoping
4167667 im not normal by conventional social standards and ill never be so maybe i should stop worrying and just embrace the insanity a bit
4167668 you are always dreaming every dream you could dream all the time even when youre awake a part of your brain is stirring that brew which one you choose to remember in the morning is based on wishes anxieties its a vast and fascinating place everywhere you turn a part of you
4167669 her weirdnesses have the quality of life in a trailer park during tornado season someones shih tzu just blew in through the window pfft theres a buick parked on the ceiling bah old man parsnip just got blown right into the anal cavity of a standing cow cest la vie her life is managed in clusters of riot interrupted by the occasional errant moment of calm
4167670 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really
4167671 oddly enough she can handle having a lesbian daughter much better than one who is still single at 30
4167672 i am way more afraid of forgetting how to be happy alone than i am actually ending up alone
4167673 various medical authorities swarm in and out of here predicting i have between two days and two months to live
4167674 you know marcel proust french writer total loser never had a real job unrequited love affairs gay spent 20 years writing a book almost no one reads but hes also probably the greatest writer since shakespeare anyway he uh he gets down to the end of his life and he looks back and decides that all those years he suffered those were the best years of his life cause they made him who he was all those years he was happy you know total waste didnt learn a thing so if you sleep until youre 18 ah think of the suffering youre gonna miss i mean high school high school those are your prime suffering years you dont get better suffering than that

4167682 i popped a benadryl but that didnt act fast enough my chest felt constricted and the people around me started to panic
4167683 then i pulled out my inhaler and that did the trick
4167684 its hard to run to publix in the middle of the night if youre in say dakar and have a raging headache
4167685 it was more like a high school gymnasium with nearly 200 beds in it
4167686 people were screaming and crying the man lying to my right had a black leg the young girl to my left was having severe stomach pains and was screaming in agony there were no curtains to divide the beds and they were so close i could actually touch the person next to me if i wanted
4167687 tiny little nurse came over and said i give shot now i nodded and before i knew what was going on this little girl flipped me over pulled down my pants stuck the needle in my behind and flipped me back over again
4167688 given horse pill sized medicine which i had no clue what it was when the iv was finished i was given a small piece of paper and told i could go whenever i felt better
4167689 and even if they do you generally have to pay up front and then sometimes the insurance company will reimburse some of it later

4167696 weve provided competition in a market that desperately needed competition
4167697 from a silverlight perspective this is an amazing opportunity to demonstrate whats possible with the technology this puts a stake in the ground and is saying were here this may be the single biggest online event and microsoft is empowering it
4167698 there were several drivers behind this latest release including significant client input our continued mission to improve software interfaces and ease of use and a focus on delivering technology that provides an obvious return on investment
4167699 equally important several of these new capabilities will open new markets for partners and us particularly with those enterprises seeking to instantiate best practices across their organizations

4167714 unfortunately this city commission does not understand the consequences of working against tbc texas border coalition valley interfaith nature preserves and everyone eleses efforts to stop the border wall construction all of the border cities throughout are united with tbc and are fighting on brownsvilles behalf but our commissioners unwillingness to stand united against the federal government undermines all who oppose the wall
4167715 if you read the charter about nepotism it means offering payment for services rendered my brother isnt getting paid he deserves to put in his community service just like you and everyone else
4167716 the city charter states that an elected official should refrain from conflicts of interests that result in appointing hiring or offering a service to a family member that offers compensation chris is just interpreting the sentence the way he wants to and it holds no merit because my brother is not benefitting from being placed on this advisory committee it doesnt pay there are no perks and definitely no monetary compensation
4167717 we want to test how the stones work across different seasons and weather conditions
4167718 wed hope that people will even be able to detect the difference in the air quality as a result of the stones
4167719 the cost of producing the japanese stones is around double that of conventional stones but weve got that down to around 30 per cent more

4167722 test of a first rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at
4167723 we are pleased to have rebounded from a difficult first quarter with strong sales and net income results for the second quarter
4167724 we believe we have a strong opportunity to enhance our competitive position in the market by continuing to improve profitability and efficiency per store develop a broad product selection selectively open new store within stores in established well known retail locations develop customer service programs such as our after sales warranty support programs and leverage our wholesale business to create new opportunities at the retail level
4167725 test of a first rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at
4167726 this is a further blow for jobs in the uk financial services sector which is being brought about by the credit crunch and the changing economic climate
4167727 we are spending more and more time with our communications devices but spending less on them
4167728 our devotion to watching listening and staying in touch wherever and whenever we want shows no sign of diminishing and with healthy competition overall prices offer increasing value for money
4167729 a key aspect of the debate both during the public consultation on and parliamentary debate about the code of practice for voluntary retention of data and also during the debate about the directive within the european council and the european parliament has been the impact or potential impact that retention of communications data has on individuals human rights
4167730 the implementation of the directive does not alter the balance in that debate and we consider that these measures are a proportionate interference with individuals right to privacy to ensure protection of the public
4167731 yet again the government have proved themselves unable to resist the temptation to take a power quite properly designed to combat terrorism to snoop on the lives of ordinary people in everyday circumstances
4167732 desktop conferencing has been around for ages and i have seen it all from the old bt systems to visual nexus but this finally is an accessible quality product it is easy to install and manage and i am confident it will sell well
4167733 touchline has got a reputation for quality brands like lifesize and it has got a good reputation for support
4167734 you learn to deliver quality when you deal with those people
4167735 now we want to bring a proven product to a wider mass market
4167736 the tk maxx story is quite insightful they had ips and firewalls and they were not stupid but they did not have a way of checking what was changing on their networks
4167737 our message to the channel is to educate customers that they need to think in three dimensions and look at products and solutions that can deal with each aspect of the threat landscape
4167738 we just had to tidy up the channel i said earlier this year that i wanted 12 15 new partners and i may well go over that we have actively recruited a number of data and managed services resellers
4167739 it is seen as a competitive advantage rather than a cost and i have not seen a massive impact to date the largest corporate accounts are being hit more than the mid market
4167740 the problem for many vendors in the unified collaboration market is that they have grown by acquisition
4167741 resellers will be able to get their customers installed and up and running in a day
4167742 ramesys success is built on developing strategic partnerships with specialist service providers and building long term relationships with them
4167743 intrinsic and ramesys have already laid the solid foundations for an excellent business relationship and our continued success together will see the partnership go from strength to strength
4167744 the partnership between intrinsic and ramesys is a perfect combination we are like minded companies similarly sized and both with ambitious growth plans for the future
4167745 we want to promote the idea of it services to smes
4167746 at the same time we want to offer a more professional way for the channel to manage it for clients so we are encouraging the outsourcing of it maintenance
4167747 there is a lot of talk about managed services in the us but it is still in its infancy in europe and we want to advance it
4167748 we are looking to provide an indirect model more consistent with the it channel large systems integrators are looking to spread their tentacles to the installation part of the job and traditional installers are also playing more of a system integrators role
4167749 i think having the vision and the ability to design physical infrastructures is going to be critical particularly for large enterprise customers
4167750 nimans has always stocked installation components as part of our commitment to offer resellers everything they need to complete a job from start to finish cabling is an essential component of this process it is not a case of it catching on the demand is already here
4167751 oems that build their own brand servers make up about a fifth of the worldwide server market so they are important to us
4167752 an it buyer from an sme or corporate will want virtualisation and they want as wide a range of options as possible
4167753 we are committed to working collaboratively with our partners to provide customers with a purpose built solution to address persistent data
4167754 copan systems partners are continuing to benefit from our dedication to the channel and through the enhancement of our programme we can provide greater opportunities for them to increase their profitability increase their customer base and differentiate from the competition
4167755 copan systems presents an attractive opportunity for our customers who are concerned by the sheer volume of data within their organisation its maid platform allows us to offer a credible long term solution rather than a short term band aid approach to the tough challenge of explosive data growth
4167756 the reality is that enterprises are not frustrated with tape many of its inherent challenges have been addressed through more intelligent automated tape library systems
4167757 they cannot back up all the critical corporate data they need to with tape alone because there is more data to back up than ever before there is less planned downtime during which to complete backups and application owners want more frequent backups and faster restores
4167758 in a society where you cannot even buy cassette tapes any more as they are unreliable and known for getting chewed up in machines why are businesses still using tapes to back up their data
4167759 automated online backup means there is no need to physically move the data offsite which the business is charged to have removed and to bring back
4167760 smartways service provides a repeated revenue stream for its partners which can continually buy more storage when needed
4167761 partners buy aggregated storage from us which they can then distribute to each customer this means they do not have to keep coming to us for more space all the time and they can close deals faster
4167762 there is an attachment with tape which is why it will never die
4167763 it is selling more tapes than it has in a while and therefore is investing in developments around tape
4167764 switching to online backup means that the data does not have to be physically moved however it disregards the telecommunication charge it costs companies to virtually transport the data as with anything in it it is a trade off
4167765 tape still has its place even though other technologies are becoming more prevalent
4167766 the role of tape is changing and companies are increasingly looking to take advantage of the newer disk based technologies such as virtual tape libraries vtl and de duplication
4167767 tape being dead has to be one of the most commonly heard untruths in the market there are always claims that new technologies will eliminate tape from the it market and frankly this is not the case
4167768 tapes will not go away because there is always the need for retention but 2008 is the year for de duplication
4167769 all the industrys gorillas are investing in this technology emc partnered with quantum ibm acquired diligent technologies and sepaton has an oem agreement with hp

4167804 my first response is its a comedy were really making fun of ourselves the whole movie is about actors and actors who try to do things to be taken seriously so in the context of the movie im really comfortable thats how it comes off
4167805 everybody of course is entitled to their opinion when you make a movie you have to kind of go with your gut i feel like our heart is in the right place with it
4167806 with any comedy anything you put out there some people are gonna get it some people are gonna be into it and other people wont but the movie ive screened it so many times with audiences its fun to see audiences laugh everybody doesnt take it as seriously when you get outside of it and people talk about these issues we all want to laugh at ourselves

4168023 history shows that the us and her allies were in fact the driving force behind the birth of irans nuclear program in the late 1960s and early 1970s according to declassified confidential us government documents posted on the digital national security archive in the mid 1970s the us encouraged iran to expand her non oil energy base suggested to the shah that iran needed not one but several nuclear reactors to acquire the electrical capacity that the stanford research institute had proposed and expressed interest in the us companies participating in irans nuclear energy projects
4168024 cheney and rumsfeld persuaded a hesitant president ford to offer iran a deal that would have meant at least 6 4 billion for u s corporations like westinghouse and general electric had not the shah been unceremoniously dumped three years later the offer included a reprocessing facility for a complete nuclear fuels cycle essentially the same capability that the u s and israel now insist iran cannot be allowed to acquire
4168025 iran was also willing to pay an additional 1 billion for a 20 percent stake in a private uranium enrichment facility in the united states that would supply much of the uranium to fuel the reactors
4168026 the uranium has to be enriched to more than 90 per cent and be produced in large quantities
4168027 not enriched uranium beyond 4 8 per cent and only on a limited scale as of 2006
4168028 works with its member states and multiple partners worldwide to promote safe secure and peaceful nuclear technologies
4168029 implementation of the npt safeguards agreement and relevant provisions of security council resolutions 1737 2006 1747 2007 and 1803 2008 in the islamic republic of iran
4168030 the results of the environmental samples taken at fep and pfep indicate that the plants have been operated as declared the samples showed low enriched uranium with up to 4 0 u 235 natural uranium and depleted uranium down to 0 4 u 235 particles iran declared enrichment levels in fep of up to 4 7 u 235 since march 2007 fourteen unannounced inspections have been conducted
4168031 national intelligence estimates nies are the intelligence communitys ic most authoritative written judgments on national security issues and designed to help us civilian and military leaders develop policies to protect us national security interests
4168032 ascribe high moderate or low levels of confidence to our assessments
4168033 high confidence generally indicates that our judgments are based on high quality information and or that the nature of the issue makes it possible to render a solid judgment
4168034 moderate confidence generally means that the information is credibly sourced and plausible but not of sufficient quality or corroborated sufficiently to warrant a higher level of confidence
4168035 we assess with moderate confidence tehran had not restarted its nuclear weapons program as of mid 2007
4168036 we continue to assess with moderate to high confidence that iran does not currently have a nuclear weapon
4168037 we judge with moderate confidence that the earliest possible date iran would be technically capable of producing enough heu for a weapon is late 2009 but that this is very unlikely
4168038 how does the us know iraq has weapons of mass destruction they still have the receipt
4168039 technical designs for a tba 480 high voltage block otherwise known as a
4168040 to vienna to sell them or simply give them to the iranian representatives to the international atomic energy agency iaea
4168041 instead of a mushroom cloud the iranian scientists would witness a disappointing fizzle the iranian nuclear programme would suffer a humiliating setback and tehrans goal of becoming a nuclear power would have been delayed by several years
4168042 tehran also obtained nuclear blueprints from the network of pakistani scientist abdul qadeer khan and so already had workable blueprints against which to compare the designs obtained from the cia nuclear experts say that they would thus be able to extract valuable information from the blueprints while ignoring the flaws
4168043 a religious opinion on islamic law issued by an islamic scholar in sunni islam any fatwa is non binding whereas in shia islam it could be depending on the status of the scholar
4168044 the leader of the islamic republic of iran ayatollah ali khamenei has issued the fatwa that the production stockpiling and use of nuclear weapons are forbidden under islam and that the islamic republic of iran shall never acquire these weapons president mahmoud ahmadinejad who took office just recently in his inaugural address reiterated that his government is against weapons of mass destruction and will only pursue nuclear activities in the peaceful domain it is the most absurd manifestation of irony that the single state who caused this single nuclear catastrophe in a twin attack on our earth now has assumed the role of the prime preacher in the nuclear field while ever expanding its nuclear weapons capability
4168045 recognized irans inalienable right to develop research production and use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes without discrimination and acquire equipment materials and scientific and technological information
4168046 represents the only binding commitment in a multilateral treaty to the goal of disarmament by the nuclear weapon states
4168047 the un nuclear watchdog said it will not respond to prime minister ehud olmerts remark implying that israel has nuclear weapons something the jewish state has never officially admitted independent analysts have said israel holds between 80 and 200 nuclear warheads and may be the worlds sixth largest nuclear power
4168048 the international atomic energy agency and israel a realistic agenda
4168049 as long as jewish sovereignty and israels right to equality as a state among the nations is denied the need for a credible deterrent will not end
4168050 they were an allied country and this was a commercial transaction we didnt address the question of them one day moving toward nuclear weapons
4168051 if a man is proud of his wealth he should not be praised until it is known how he employs it
4168052 failed to say a word about the victims of the attack not a single word has been uttered in condemnation of the aggression
4168053 el retiro de los contenedores diferenciados y el nuevo criterio de facturaci n por tonelada en la recolecci n de basura van de la mano el negocio de las empresas ser que haya m s basura ambas medidas tratan de perpetuar un sistema de enterramiento masivo al atentar contra el sistema de reciclado
4168054 el problema de la basura de la ciudad de buenos aires debe ser encarado acorde a su magnitud el sistema de gesti n global de los residuos debe dise arse bajo las pautas de la ley vigente
4168055 la separaci n del sistema de gesti n integral lleva al fracaso de basura cero ya que establece la prestaci n de un servicio formal el de las empresas que recolectan la basura y cobran por eso y otro a menor escala que a n no est definido de esta forma retiran los contenedores sin establecer un m todo superador para la disposici n inicial ni la recolecci n diferenciada intentando desarticular cualquier intento de gesti n integral de residuos
4168056 el objetivo de basura cero es reducir la cantidad de residuos que se env a a la provincia lo cierto es que hoy lo nico que tenemos es un acuerdo entre la ciudad y la provincia de buenos aires para abrir dos nuevos rellenos sanitarios sin ning n compromiso por parte del gobierno de la ciudad de reducir la basura que env a diariamente

4168082 there are 11 guys on the field but if we can do our job even a little bit better it helps everybody else do theirs too

4168100 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4168101 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4168102 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4168103 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4168104 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

4168161 my first response is its a comedy were really making fun of ourselves the whole movie is about actors and actors who try to do things to be taken seriously so in the context of the movie im really comfortable thats how it comes off
4168162 everybody of course is entitled to their opinion when you make a movie you have to kind of go with your gut i feel like our heart is in the right place with it
4168163 with any comedy anything you put out there some people are gonna get it some people are gonna be into it and other people wont but the movie ive screened it so many times with audiences its fun to see audiences laugh everybody doesnt take it as seriously when you get outside of it and people talk about these issues we all want to laugh at ourselves
4168164 its amazing hes a really funny actor and he doesnt get a chance to do comedies

4168179 i am convinced that honoring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion

4168219 unless we get a substantial new lead or perhaps a new witness stepping forward or someone confesses to the crime it is highly unlikely that youll see the investigation reaching a successful conclusion in the sense of a criminal prosecution that leads to a conviction
4168220 that doesnt mean theres any less determination to solve it it means we need something new to investigate because what we currently have has been investigated to destruction
4168221 there was a feeling that those responsible were going to be caught very shortly i never thought i would be sitting talking about it 10 years after the event
4168222 and as far as justice is concerned were as far back as we were 10 years ago
4168223 people rightly expect that we will take whatever measures we can properly and legitimately to bring those responsible to justice
4168224 we will continue to try to bring the perpetrators to court and to lock them up for a very long time
4168225 i fully understand their frustration because i think its probably the same as my frustration
4168226 they had an absolute right to have that crime brought to justice in the traditional sense and put through the courts and to see the people who committed that atrocity locked up and literally the key thrown away

4168235 desde la dictadura militar ya los mapuches hab an perdido mucho y la democracia les plantea a ellos volver a obtener lo que hab an perdido y eso es uno de los puntos donde no se ha cumplido y de ah parte la lucha y los encuentros que hay entre los sectores como el poder econ mico las forestales y el poder pol tico a la vez los que finalmente van reprimiendo a las comunidades hasta convertirlas en un grupo que se transforma en una organizaci n m s reducida y cerrada y que hoy el estado llama subversiva

4168243 filming live from daryls house was one of the highlights of our musical journey well be pinching ourselves for years to come given that he pretty much wrote half our songs it was about time we met daryl hall in real life
4168244 i think theyre so awesome its been really inspiring theyve been very gracious maroon is always been that way with us as well its been a really cool thing so far
4168245 its just a whole big bunch of songs and songs like gravity thats the oldest song on the record
4168246 the film hits on all sorts of different spiritual topics and i could probably write a dissertation on them all
4168247 i urge all christians to pray for hollywood for each and every performer they see and to never stop we may not be able to personally intervene when a celebrity is plunging headfirst into a downward spiral that may claim their life but we certainly know the one who can
4168248 personally i found this film offensive to my moral spirit it detracted me from the spirit of god and thats just not ok seriously
4168249 the fact is however looking at something darker wont provide the hope that we really need so where do we find a hope that we can count on hebrews 6 18 19 tells us

4168261 i i didnt think it would actually happen to us
4168262 i thought by knowing it so precisely that somehow it would just be prevented
4168263 well we now know it is a molecular disruption that is causing death
4168264 we dont know that though fine weve always believed a molecular disruption of some description was taking place but we dont know whats causing it and i tell you i dont even know how to begin to explain the kind of molecular disruption that took place after the blackout that to me was a magic show not to mention the fact the source of what you call intel that led us to tanamary street in the first place is leaving me increasingly agitated
4168265 we need to talk about that further i know but now is not the time and this is not the place
4168266 look gates im sure you and i would both settle for a simple explanation for the cause of our intelligence
4168267 sir i remember the pulse i remember the sudden and complete loss of power in the vehicle and then i dont remember a great deal my airbee landed on a roof and im told i smacked my head on a panel we fell only a few feet and we all walked away from it with just a few bumps and bruises we were the fortunate ones the crews that hit the deck were not nor were the people beneath their vehicles

4168287 the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
4168288 mr president former secretary of state colin powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
4168289 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
4168290 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
4168291 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective
4168292 governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government

4168295 we cannot dedicate we cannot consecrate we cannot hallow this ground the brave men living and dead who struggled here have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract
4168296 we cannot dedicate we can not consecrate we can not hallow this ground
4168297 they pick the most dangerous enemy they can find and its themselves
4168298 the tools of conquest do not necessarily come with bombs and explosions and fallout there are weapons that are simply thoughts attitudes prejudices to be found only in the minds of men
4168299 for the record prejudices can kill and suspicion can destroy and a thoughtless frightened search for a scapegoat has a fallout all its own for the children and the children yet unborn
4168300 a media campaign to create a wedge between the american people and their government
4168301 in the 1920s a failed austrian painter published a book in which he explained his intention to build an aryan super state in germany and take revenge on europe and eradicate the jews
4168302 the world ignored hitlers words and paid a terrible price
4168303 we must remember always that accusation is not proof and that conviction depends upon evidence and due process of law
4168304 it demands the deep analysis and the sober contemplation of every american

4168317 i have the simplest tastes i am always satisfied with the best
4168318 i want to first of all express my condolences to the families of these murdered humanitarian workers
4168319 this is obviously an outrage a terribly brutal act which i think should remind everybody of the brutality of the taliban and the danger that everybody there faces
4168320 this was a despicable senseless and cowardly attack on people who were working to improve the lives of some of the most disadvantaged people in afghanistan
4168321 i join the international community in condemning this brutal act
4168322 we are absolutely outraged by this cowardly attack against humanitarian workers people who were in a marked humanitarian vehicle
4168323 i was always a little bit nervous of early phone calls whenever jacquie was in afghanistan
4168324 i wanted people to understand how important her work was
4168325 i woke up this morning thinking that if there were enough women like jacquie in afghanistan the taliban would be laughed out of their village
4168326 she saw that there was so much need and she had so much drive to try and make the world a better place
4168327 i turned down a bid for joe ledley yesterday wednesday
4168328 we are intent on earning promotion to the premier league and that means keeping our best players none of those on long term contracts are available at any price
4168329 i will wait until the final training session and see how he is in training thats when i will make a decision on that
4168330 hes an excellent pro hes been working totally independently to anything that might be happening outside the football and any speculation has been dealt by his agent hes just been getting on with things professionally in training
4168331 if you ask any manager they always want their best players available dimitar is no different
4168332 he is a great player and is carrying himself superbly well through this and we want him to stay but if it is my personal opinion i have no preference one way or another you have to go with what is happening
4168333 hes our player he is at our club and he is a fantastic player it would be great for him to stay
4168334 it is nothing to panic about we have performed very well in recent friendlies they have been great attacking performances so it is not something that concerns me
4168335 we are aware there are only two weeks to go before the end of the window that is something we are working on constantly anyway
4168336 we work without rest to look for players and weve always known the deadline day is the august 31

4168342 fazendo uma analogia com os jogos ol mpicos pode se dizer que dmitri medvedev come ou a correr no cargo de presidente do pa s e at o dia 14 de agosto passou os primeiros 100 metros mas a meta ainda est muito longe ainda mais porque n o se sabe em que dist ncia ele corre
4168343 muito importante que tenha passado a prova da uni o de medvedev com putin porque freq entemente essas alian as desmoronam se em situa es de crise
4168344 medvedev pela primeira vez passou para primeiro plano empurrando para tr s o primeiro ministro putin
4168345 durante o conflito georgiano osseta putin demonstrou precisamente que desempenha um papel essencial
4168346 medvedev atua no campo internacional enquanto putin est presente no campo interno
4168347 logo que come ou a crise na oss tia do sul a discuss o conjunta de quest es e de tomada de decis es foi rapidamente estabelecida tornou se de novo clara que a manifesta o de estabilidade e de efic cia da dire o a quatro m os uma quest o de princ pio tanto para dmitri medvedev como para vladimir putin

4168353 given our recent acquisitions and the current roster composition we decided the most appropriate move was to option jose
4168354 we will make the determination at a later date with respect to a september callup but much of the decision is within his control
4168355 were open sufficiently for me to see this man whom we had got to know over a period of 10 days lying dead face uncovered
4168356 we have acknowledged to the martins that beyond this there was some delay in the transfer of the patient to the mortuary and steps have already been taken to ensure that this does not happen again
4168357 we dont want the collapse of georgia but the de facto situation is such that neither the south ossetians nor the abkhaz want to live in the same state with the person who has sent his troops against them
4168358 that we support any decision taken by the peoples of south ossetia and abkhazia we will not only support them but guarantee them in the caucaus and in the whole world right is on your side
4168359 two points are sacrosanct for germany the first is that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia are not called into question in future talks
4168360 any reference to the territorial integrity of georgia would simply be seen as an insult a deeply human insult
4168361 to give youth a future it is important that education be understood as a search for the integral and harmonious development of the person as the maturation of the moral conscience to discern good and act accordingly and as attention to the spiritual dimension of young people as they develop
4168362 true education must start from the truth about man the affirmation of his dignity and transcendent vocation looking at every young person in this anthropological perspective means seeking to help him develop the best of himself so that in exercising all his skills he may carry out whatever god calls him to do
4168363 i urge you therefore brothers by the mercies of god to offer your bodies as a living sacrifice holy and pleasing to god your spiritual worship do not conform yourselves to this age but be transformed by the renewal of your mind that you may discern what is the will of god what is good and pleasing so you my child be strong in the grace that is in christ jesus and what you heard from me through many witnesses entrust to faithful people who will have the ability to teach others as well
4168364 so you my child be strong in the grace that is in christ jesus and what you heard from me through many witnesses entrust to faithful people who will have the ability to teach others as well

4168405 this was a big game for us we had this one circled for a long time
4168406 a few of us felt we really needed this game to prove to ourselves we do mean business and were ready to win the gold medal
4168407 they knew what to do to take us out of our game
4168408 kobe had a lot of good dunks that was crazy
4168409 they pretty much picked us apart in 2006 the only way to change that was to be aggressive
4168410 were built to play defense we will eventually impose our will and wear them down
4168411 the defense in the second quarter turned it around for us
4168412 we played very good defense im proud of our effort
4168413 every time we go out of the hotel they are celebrating us
4168414 if we meet them again its going to be harder to beat us
4168415 i think we learned a lot my team can play better we gave them opportunities to make easy baskets

4168418 we had that in the back of our minds coach mike krzyzewski didnt have to mention it we remembered
4168419 they must have done it 45 times this time we just talked communicated on defense
4168420 we needed this game we do mean business were built to play defense the coach told us from day 1 this is the best defensive team he ever coached
4168421 no i do not think that any team in any sport is unbeatable
4168422 facebook is already a place where people are acting on their interests and ideals connecting with each other and sharing information that can lead to meaningful change
4168423 through this partnership with servicenation we can be part of an historic effort to inspire americans to act together to get more directly involved in and connected to their real life communities
4168424 there is something terrible happening there we saw burnt tanks on our way here a bomb fell just a few metres away from us near the suram pass and the shrapnel damaged the door of my car
4168425 we left on august 8 the day the war started because we didnt think our visit to georgia would be so dangerous
4168426 we went to the black sea resort of kobuleti everything was calm there but the general atmosphere was very tense what we feared most was the road of course
4168427 on the night of august 8 9 we were woken by strange noises outside the building we were renting an apartment in
4168428 the electricity went off in the whole city television broadcasting had stopped before that the neighbours in the yard said that a war has started and the russian air forces had attacked strategic targets in different cities of georgia
4168429 armenia is very concerned about the situation in south ossetia and expresses hopes that the parties will make efforts to settle the issues under dispute peacefully as soon as possible
4168430 by offering condolences only to the president of the russian federation serzh sarkisian violated a balance because condolences should have been sent to three sides russia georgia and south ossetia
4168431 each truck costs about 50 thousand dollars and if the goods are damaged ill face a huge debt leaving aside the fact it cost two thousand dollars to send it to georgia
4168432 but the most important thing is i came home safe and sound i cant believe im on home soil
4168433 the caucasus is the kind of place where when the guns start firing its hard to stop them that is the brutal reality of south ossetia
4168434 wrapped up in the dispute over russias attack on georgia is a moral argument between russia and the west that will shape the future of georgias breakaway territories
4168435 ive said all along this has got to be resolved
4168436 this has been very very difficult for the city for the state and thats obviously why we need a resolution
4168437 that guy who makes movies where he fights a lot not steven seagal the other one yeah him
4168438 get this phone with a contract extension at the top
4168439 these two boys are inseparable bridger and tyler have been best friends for years they live around the corner from each other
4168440 when she put them on myself and my daughter thought oh my goodness it is inappropriate because it is sexually suggestive
4168441 you just never know who could see that and think it was a bit too enticing for a young child to be wearing
4168442 this is part of a worrying trend of inappropriate clothing marketed at young children
4168443 our guys just dont get that shot in the nba but here theyre playing with guys you cant double team
4168444 theyre almost antsy when they get looks like that it took kobe all last summer during fiba americas qualifying just to get accustomed to that shot
4168445 hes going to bring some golds back to baltimore and im going to bring a gold back they can have our parade together
4168446 at least this ends one day 40 years 60 years whatever it ends hell would be for eternity
4168447 for god loved the world in this way he gave his one and only son so that everyone who believes in him will not perish but have eternal life
4168448 suppose a great king having many sons should express himself thus i so love my children that whosoever of them shall be dutiful unto me i will bestow principalities dukedoms or other great matters upon them should he not plainly imply a possibility at least that some of them might not prove dutiful unto him in like manner if the word world in the scripture in hand should signify the elect the distributive whosoever must needs imply that some of these elect might possibly not believe and so perish because believing and not believing and not perishing thereupon occasions the distribution here made

4168661 si alguien tiene prisa por presentarla antes y sumarse con ello a una suerte de negociaciones para obtener alg n beneficio lo estar a haciendo a t tulo personal
4168662 no queremos una iniciativa puente ni que nuestra propuesta se revuelva con las del pri y del pan
4168663 nadie podr decir en su sano juicio que no tenemos propuesta

4168666 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4168667 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4168668 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4168669 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4168670 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4168671 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4168672 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4168673 responded to the call of the indigenous women tocome to the aid of them and their children
4168674 once more the white man was being chosen over the dysfunctional black man as the protector of children
4168675 the already persecuted women will be seen as having colluded with the enemy to remove the few strands of self esteem the indigenous man had left
4168676 the last flareup was at about 8 a m thursday
4168677 it kept going for so long because of the amount of paper files
4168678 i set unbelievable standards for myself so when i play big games its not about the pressure other players put on me its about the pressure i put on myself
4168679 i want to grow as a player i want to become one of the legends of the game guys like george gregan tana umaga and jonny wilkinson were always marked men but that never stopped them from performing you just have to work harder to get to that next level
4168680 i hope to make a huge contribution this weekend its true that i havent had many opportunities to finish myself but other aspects of my game have opened it up for guys like adi jacobs and jp pietersen
4168681 the last victory against the all blacks was a historic one so you could say weve acheived a lot this year but this saturday is a huge starting point on home soil
4168682 its a very important game as a loss would see either side on the wrong side of the table
4168683 it could see us out of the running for the tri nations title
4168684 its going to be three of the toughest weeks ive ever experienced every week will be like playing a final all the analysis is well an good but its a different story when you run out onto that park you can be prepared but you still have to go out there and play to win

4168693 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4168694 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4168695 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4168696 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4168697 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4168698 creativity involves breaking out of established patterns in order to look at things in a different way
4168699 it has been suggested that the bracket of architecture and of shipbuilding was so called from its resemblance to a codpiece or a pair of breeches
4168700 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4168701 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
4168702 yes im overcompensating for my insecurities and lack of masculinity but ive got a really big dog
4168703 this will be a major blow to the chances of being named attorney general or appointed to another cabinet position assuming obama gets elected in november and chooses edwards over someone who has been directly involved in politics during the past four years
4168704 i dont know if hell ever be able to recover and return to the work volunteering job he was doing before this
4168705 john edwards needs to step down from or refuse to accept the position immediately
4168706 hes in a lot of trouble if he still needs to be elected to something
4168707 i just hope our tax dollars arent going to him somehow
4168708 when we first saw stumpy in hervey bay in 2001 we thought for sure he wouldnt survive without his tail
4168709 its a 20 000 kilometre return journey when they migrate and that is an amazing feat for a whale without a tail
4168710 thats shocking the academic debate is between some who say that junior enlisted ranks lean slightly republican and some who say its about equal but no one would point to six to one
4168711 that represents a tremendous shift from 2000 when the military vote almost certainly was decisive in florida and elsewhere and leaned heavily towards the republicans

4168724 now that the tidal surge in energy and other commodity costs is showing unmistakable signs of turning up in consumer prices at large the fed finds itself pushed further into the corner the recent report on retail sales coupled with todays report indicates that a dip in real consumer spending is now underway the fed is in the same uncomfortable position as it has been for months caught between a weak economy and elevated inflationary pressures only more so facing heightened pressures from both sides we continue to expect the fed to hold the fed funds rate at 2 0 into 2009
4168725 the energy piece of this is quite likely to moderate in coming months given the developments in crude oil and gasoline prices though part of that is seasonal the food should also slow but the timetable for this is less certain
4168726 i feel sorry for liu yan my heart is full of regrets

4168760 the largest racist organisation in sweden is the political party the sweden democrats the party was established by persons previously active in the nazi movement and who now do what they can to shed past associations and appear mainstream 124 their connection with and direct support of racist manifestos and propaganda becomes clear in the following examples a recent survey shows that six leading figures in the party who have held office during the past two years have in various ways supported the nazi movement by donating money to militant nazi groups 125 the sweden democrats received more than 164 000 votes in the 2006 parliamentary election that is 2 93 percent of the general vote which is twice as much as they received in the previous elec tion in 2002 and which furthermore qualifies them for financial support from the government 126 both the sweden democrats and the national democrats have received financial party support from the swedish state in other words the swedish state finances the activities of parties that openly proclaim racist views and in the case of the national democrats are participants in demonstrations organized in collaboration with the nazi movement 127

4168987 its definitely a trend right now people are becoming more sure of how they impact the environment the changes that are predicted are in our lifetimes not our parents so its become a little bit more real for us
4168988 theres a need and a want for this kind of lifestyle in the community but there are also many people who arent quite sure what to do about it

4169051 in talks about making cars cleaner and more fuel efficient with engineers here ive asked whether a small turbine turning at a constant rate wouldnt be an ideal way to power the generator of an electric motor driven car alas the noise high rpm and heat are still expensive problems and turbines small enough to serve such a purpose are prohibitively expensive compared to existing alternatives such as small diesels
4169052 perhaps the biggest drawback is in fuel economy even though the engine itself is relatively efficient it operates at a high rpm even while at idle
4169053 dont anybody mention the word turbine here we have no idea what caused this car to blow up spilled fuel maybe it has nothing to do with the turbine powered car visiting in town

4169073 this was the worst attack in many years and is a major escalation of hostilities
4169074 this appears to be the beginning of a new approach
4169075 to surround kabul and eliminate any foreign or government presence in the area
4169076 the taliban know that they can gain a lot from high profile attacks against the aid organizations and other noncombatants
4169077 a simple ambush like this gets the whole world talking more than any drawn out military battle with coalition forces
4169078 aid agencies have an important role in strengthening the afghan state and improving its public image but without such agencies the government becomes very weak unable to provide basic services for its people a situation that the taliban will exploit readily
4169079 i think things are going to only get worse especially with the 2009 afghan presidential elections coming up

4169134 were working on bringing down the prices and speeding up the production process
4169135 our sole goal is to safely and rapidly deliver humanitarian aid to georgia to alleviate human suffering and save lives
4169136 we will continue to support this humanitarian mission until the host nation and the u s state department determine that it is no longer needed
4169137 thank you so much for helping us in this great time of need these supplies will surely save lives
4169138 goods in this category are easily compared across suppliers and therefore switching costs from one source to another are lower
4169139 hence the increased competitiveness of us production might be expected to show up here first
4169140 due to the real world situation on the ground in georgia european command united states army europe united states air force europe and 21st tsc expeditiously planned and executed the initial humanitarian supply flight within 24 hours of the cease fire agreement to help bring relief to the georgian people
4169141 21st tsc is the lead coordinating army logistics unit that is packaging staging and transporting supplies to the air force for air movement to georgia
4169142 we are augmenting the state department disaster assistance package with dod emergency and medical supplies and equipment from germany to assist georgians humanitarian needs on the ground
4169143 further assessments of humanitarian needs are ongoing for follow on support
4169144 its a good feeling to be able to do something good for someone during a situation like this
4169145 i think it is important because you never know when you are going to be the one requiring help one day
4169146 hey everyone i just had to share something that came up today and it made me feel a bit sick to my stomach
4169147 hey lindsay what do you have to say about people commenting on your sisters implants
4169148 i was caught out of nowhere so i didnt really come up with the proper response at the time theres many other things that i felt like saying but why give it to a random guy with a camera so that he can make money all i am trying to say is that i was raised with a wonderful family surrounding me of course we have our ups and downs but all in all my mother taught us to appreciate what we have been given nor would she ever encourage or allow a 14 year old child to alter her body i am not judging people that do but i am just saying that its not something that my family finds necessary to do especially when youre not even fully developed yet it is hard enough being 14 years old and you have enough insecurities to begin with then add being in the public eye i just find it really disconcerting that people have to focus on the negative and that some people are sooooo bored with their own lives that they need to manifest lies to hurt another person in a more positive light i got some great clothes from alexander wang and i miss samantha ronson cuz shes out of town have a wonderful day everyone till next time xx ll
4169149 what does my 85 year old mother in law in biloxi mississippi have to do with my ethics
4169150 they systematically down the line all seven children said no we dont want our names there so i was left a choice do i serve the needs of my community or do i betray my family i chose to step down
4169151 these people are horribly concerned because theres a very small pool of people that serve and if we make these situations challenging by having to disclose many things that they have a hard time understanding the reason for we reduce that pool even further
4169152 the purpose of this is understandable in that when you take on a public responsibility whether its actually elected or appointed you do have to give up some of your anonymity and your privacy the question thats a hard one to judge is when does it go too far and get into peoples private lives
4169153 if youre gonna have a crooked politician youll have one and in the city of butte falls hes gonna stick out like a sore thumb
4169154 what ive heard out here is that things are different in rural oregon that they might not have the same problems that are around in salem or some of the bigger places and i think were going to take that to heart when we go revise and look at the ethics laws again in 2009
4169155 my next goal in golf is simple i wanted to play all the great courses all around the world and speak and write on the mental game

4169158 you jews should be aware you will never but never have peace with hamas yousef stated islam as the ideology that guides them will not allow them to achieve a peace agreement with the jews they believe that tradition says that the prophet mohammed fought against the jews and that therefore they must continue to fight them to the death
4169159 they hamas are blind and ignorant its true there are good and bad people everywhere but hamas supporters dont understand that they are led by a wicked and cruel group that brainwashes the children and gets them to believe that if they carry out a suicide attack theyll get to paradise he said cole went on to say the muslim turned christian says he does not think islam will survive for more than 25 years because the truth about islam will be exposed given the mass communication available in the modern age for his part yousef says he hopes to open the eyes of muslims and reveal the truth to them about islam and christianity with the goal to take them out of the darkness and the prison of islam in that way theyll have an opportunity to correct their mistakes to become better people and to bring a chance for peace in the middle east he said yousef who has taken the biblical name of joseph said he dreams of one day becoming a writer to tell his personal story and about the middle east conflicts but at the moment at least my ambitions are only to find work a place to live admits yousef who left behind properties in ramallah to find true freedom i have no money i have no apartment i was about to become one of those homeless people in the united states he confessed but people from the church are helping me im dependent on them

4169162 i feel bad for the poor horse hes probably going to die soon anyway
4169163 as long as hes being taken care of they should leave him alone
4169164 i would prefer to have him remain as stable as he is and be able to enjoy his life i like to go out and pet him its just a matter of feeding and petting him i would be totally lost at the point where he disappears from the scene
4169165 we purchase only fish that are harvested or farmed in a way that doesnt impact the environment other species or their habitats
4169166 if they cant answer the questions dont buy the fish
4169167 we tend to eat predators and they contain toxins in their flesh dioxins pcbs and mercury
4169168 pick out a few of your favorite fish that are in great shape and stick with them
4169169 the two big species of concern are shrimp and salmon
4169170 weve found that octopuses effectively have six arms and two legs
4169171 it had been thought they used four tentacles for movement and the other four for feeding and manipulating objects but observations showed that they use the rearmost two to get around over rocks and the seabed
4169172 they also use these two legs to push off when they wish to swim and then other tentacles are used to propel them
4169173 we havent tried to take her out of the tank to weigh her because shed find that quite traumatic
4169174 the real surprise was the frequency with which octopuses employed their third tentacles from the front on both sides
4169175 more than half of the octopuses studied were found to display no bias at all for either right or left sided limbs the rest were split fairly evenly between those preferring the right side and those favouring the left
4169176 an octopuss eyes are angled towards the front of its body so if it used its eyes to determine which tentacles it mobilised you would expect the choice to favour those more directly in its line of view that was precisely what we found
4169177 we identified seven octopuses that genuinely do prefer one side over the other possibly because of some weakness in the other eye
4169178 if any of those animals should fall sick we can now care for them that little bit more efficiently by delivering food and medication from the direction they prefer as with any sickly animal any measure that reduces stress however slightly can make a crucial difference
4169179 its something akin to martial law in that particular area
4169180 it got to the point where somebody was going to get seriously hurt or killed if we didnt do something
4169181 in a way i like it because they shot up my house too
4169182 and in a way i dont like it because a few minutes ago i had to walk to the store and the police stopped me and asked me what i was doing and where i was going
4169183 first such curfews have never been allowed under the laws of the united states barring riot insurrection or natural disaster
4169184 not one case has ever allowed for the imposition of searches seizures and house arrest against innocent citizens because of the high crime rate in a particular city
4169185 notwithstanding the city code and curfew order the residents of helena west helena have the right to sit under shade trees in their front yard to ride their bicycles along the streets protest this policy and drive around the city with the full protections of the first fourth and fourteenth amendments
4169186 i invite them to move in on second street and be up all night with people shooting at them
4169187 since this began its more quiet and peaceful around here
4169188 i think theyre doing a wonderful job prior to this the kids were dealing drugs right in the middle of the street stopping cars saying hey hey what you got
4169189 you couldnt walk down the streets your little kids couldnt either we were just that scared
4169190 youre not free and youre supposed to be free you cant go outside and walk the streets look the entire area is empty theres nobody out here
4169191 were grown and the mayors trying to give us a curfew
4169192 he cant stop nobody from shooting if theyre going to shoot theyre going to shoot
4169193 how do you think they get all the police in here without bad guys theres no so called good guys
4169194 glue which makes a collection of unrelated neighbors into a neighborhood
4169195 were competing with drugs for the same employees if you will people that we try to organize to demand social and economic justice are often pulled into the drag trade
4169196 if youve got a hassle if youre in the game youve got to keep your head down youre compromised
4169197 the private security are scared theyre not gonna mess with the west mob or big block two infamous gangs in hunters point so they just stay in their security booths all night and then to look proactive they start harassing people for little stuff
4169198 voices from the barrio chicano a gangs families and communities
4169199 oh my i didnt know it was going to be that much
4169200 i just feel very confident as well as the school administrators that southern high is prepared and whatever recommendations that they have i am sure principal ed dunn and the school administration will take care of it

4169202 we have some experience from the reserves but when you only have one starter coming back im a little worried at this point
4169203 eyes are on me and other guys are going to look at me as far as being a leader
4169204 after the first few times it happened it was so stretched out and so loose you could just shove it back in
4169205 have i driven over 70 miles an hour on a motorway
4169206 really make it impossible to preach the whole counsel of god
4169207 weve been in broadcasting for over 45 years so we remember what it was like under the previous regime of the so called fairness doctrine
4169208 what we had to do then would be impossible today
4169209 if someone were to assert that god has ordained marriage as only between a man and woman that would be a controversial statement today
4169210 a newspaper can print a reply or an op ed piece but with broadcasting its fixed its 24 hours that are divisible into so many minutes and if youre devoting them to x you cant devote them to y
4169211 if a broadcaster has to subsidize its opponents and the station is listener funded theyre going to lose a lot of money
4169212 crushing the immigration bill had the feeling of a sort of crusade
4169213 its not free speech we dont support it and most people on the left dont support it
4169214 the bottom line is that we need to get better at talk radio
4169215 if all these bad things happen were going to sue immediately

4169218 could help explain the incidence of some types of skin cancer in patients
4169219 very hard to relate to humans and sun induced skin cancer
4169220 moisturiser use is much greater among women however skin cancers and in particular the type of skin cancers studied in this research seem to be more common among men
4169221 the potential for alarmism is high and therefore this paper invites the highest level of scrutiny which it does not in my view sufficiently bear to warrant publication
4169222 one day i decided that when i found the right person for me i would bring her here and ask her to marry me i was straight then remember

4169246 creo que lo que hicieron fue volarlas con algunos explosivos

4169292 the tightening bias of the reserve bank of india should stay
4169293 weve also taken steps to establish a duchy presence in india linked to the princes bhumi vardaan foundation established to help the poorer farmers of the punjab
4169294 our intention is to establish duchy india as a commercial vehicle for the organic produce of farms supported by the foundation
4169295 worked for a short time but now the price is being paid
4169296 i have been to the punjab where you have seen the disasters that have taken place as a result of the over demand on irrigation because of the hybrid seeds and grains that have been produced which demand huge amounts of water
4169297 the water table has disappeared they have huge problems with water level with pesticide problems and complications are now coming home to roost
4169298 the prince is an organic farmer and its in his interest that organic farming works
4169299 there are millions of other farmers whose role is producing high quality affordable food and they need all the tools that are available of which gm is one
4169300 his lack of scientific understanding and his willingness to condemn millions of people to starvation in areas like sub saharan africa is absolutely bewildering
4169301 the reality is that without the development of science in farming we would not be able to feed a tenth of the world population which will exceed nine billion by 2050
4169302 he seems to be ranting about gm crops urbanisation globalisation and even hybrid plants he is inflating fears instead of contributing to reasoned debate
4169303 prince charles has hit the nail on the head about the damaging false solution that gm crops present gm crops will not solve the food crisis and forging ahead with an industrialised farming system will continue to fail people and the environment around the world

4169359 the decline in real estate investment trusts reits has been sharp reacting to the mortgage crisis and the associated financial meltdown however here are sectors of the real estate market that have not been affected by the mortgage crisis
4169360 such sectors like health care and multi family projects and self storage buildings are relatively less sensitive to the economic cycle in addition these sectors may have an inverse benefit from foreclosures such as rental properties and self storage
4169361 the neuberger berman real estate securities income trust fund invests in reits in defensive areas such as health care and multi family projects common stocks of reits are trading at a discount to the properties they own a reversal of premiums evident in last year
4169362 this closed end fund trades at 9 discount to its net asset value in essence a shareholder gets a portfolio of reits that trade at a discount to their real estate value at another discount the funds top holdings are ventas inc 5 7 omega healthcare investors 4 8 and nationwide health properties 4 8
4169363 since june senators obama and clinton have been working together to ensure a democratic victory this november
4169364 they are both committed to winning back the white house and to ensuring that the voices of all 35 million people who participated in this historic primary election are respected and heard in denver to honor and celebrate these voices and votes both senator obamas and senator clintons names will be placed in nomination
4169365 i know from just what im hearing that theres incredible pent up desire
4169366 and i think that people want to feel like ok its a catharsis were here we did it and then everybody get behind sen
4169367 i am convinced that honoring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion

4169369 you have hundreds of thousands of people being caught in a financial nightmare
4169370 i believe we have crossed the rubicon and established the premise that the investors will be helped the nightmare will end
4169371 a significant uptick in fighting is on balance unlikely given president medvedevs 12 august statement that hostilities are almost complete and the 13 august informal ceasefire
4169372 the chance of an incident is very low as the risk to both sides is obviously extremely high
4169373 the informal ceasefire u s russian interactions and moscows intentions all create risk the georgian russian war has already changed eurasias political and economic landscape
4169374 moscow henceforth will be very hard for the us to work with on iran or other key issues
4169375 the current crisis shows russia has gained self confidence that it is no longer willing to play the part of the inferior partner one which the united states does not have to take into account
4169376 that showed with kosovo where the russian objections were not taken into consideration at all the same applies to georgias possible nato entry which russia fiercely opposes
4169377 russia basically says you have recognized kosovo we shall recognize south ossetia and abkhazia
4169378 the perspective of georgia entering nato is weak now since the russian forces have practically destroyed the georgian army russian tanks are driving back and forth through georgia at will
4169379 its a perfect storm for ukraine at the moment the government has made it clear that it is on a collision course with russia and there are other issues as well
4169380 the idea that you get one of these flare ups in tensions that involve military conflict that would then just die down overnight was somewhat misplaced
4169381 all you can really say is that well have kind of focus on the more medium term issues and try to see through this bout of political risk
4169382 its certainly true that the longer this goes on the bigger hit russias image is going to take in the west
4169383 but at the same time there is a change of administration in washington at the end of the year and there has been a change in moscow although putins prime minister whether you like it or not we do have a more dovish president in place now whether hes pulling the strings or not

4169386 i think that the pro life position is one of the important aspects or fundamentals of the republican party
4169387 and i also feel that and im not trying to equivocate here that americans want us to work together you know tom ridge is one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro choice and i dont think that that would necessarily rule tom ridge out

4169397 march 14 mistakes they have neglected to push for disarmament
4169398 our objectives are to preserve unity and hezbollahs arms should be dealt with as part of a process that addresses the reasons why those arms exist
4169399 a lebanese style compromise with language in it to satisfy both hezbollah by underscoring the right of the lebanese and the resistance to liberate all its territories clearly a sop to hezbollah while also asserting the governments authority on issues of national defense and simply serves to help put the current unity cabinet in place
4169400 in several important ways including the non enforcement of the un resolutions not restricting hezbollah activity claiming shaba farms permitting attacks on israel hezbollah policy seems to be lebanese policy
4169401 israel isnt interested in lebanon domestic affairs and hence doesnt feel the doha agreement adds or take away from its strategic interests

4169415 treatment of solar water heaters under the expanded national renewable energy target scheme will have implications for the cost of the scheme the liquidity of the permits market and the amount of electricity generated by renewables in 2020
4169416 the clear intention of this statement is the removal of renewable energy credits from solar hot water
4169417 the effect of breaking this pre election promise would be to increase the cost of solar hot water systems by between 1000 and 1500
4169418 rheem is deeply concerned and surprised that the discussion paper on the expanded scheme should canvass options that include the elimination of solar water heaters from the scheme
4169419 any attempt to retreat on this commitment will leave manufacturers dealers and installers of water heaters with significant stranded investment in a difficult economy

4169439 we are not operating in any way which may counter israeli interests we have turned down many requests involving arms sales to georgia and the ones which have been approves have been duly scrutinized so far we have placed no limitations on the sale of protective measures
4169440 they contacted defense industry officials and arms dealers and told them that georgia had relatively large budgets and could be interested in purchasing israeli weapons
4169441 his door was always open to the israelis who came and offered his country arms systems made in israel
4169442 compared to countries in eastern europe the deals in this country were conducted fast mainly due to the defense ministers personal involvement
4169443 it was clear that too many unmistakable israeli systems in the possession of the georgian army would be like a red cloth in the face of a raging bull as far as russia is concerned
4169444 and that the interception of three of these rpvs in the past three months was an expression of this anger not everyone in israel understood the sensitive nerve israel touched when it supplied such an advanced arms system to a country whose relations with russia are highly tense
4169445 we conducted a small job for them several years ago
4169446 the israeli is the main investor in the georgian economy everyone is there directly or indirectly
4169447 the israelis should be proud of themselves for the israeli training and education received by the georgian soldiers
4169448 we are now in a fight against the great russia
4169449 its important that the entire world understands that what is happening in georgia now will affect the entire world order its not just georgias business but the entire worlds business
4169450 we need help from the un and from our friends headed by the united states and israel today georgia is in danger tomorrow all the democratic countries in the region and in the entire world will be in danger too

4169688 it is alleged that mckay acted on behalf of aj auxerre in respect of the transfer of benjani from auxerre to portsmouth in january 2006 and then on behalf of portsmouth in respect of benjanis transfer from portsmouth to manchester city in january 2008 which was the immediately subsequent completed transaction involving the player

4169696 people seem to be excited about it and mike had a cool idea with the human dynamo it was the only product of its kind out there

4169706 crisis leadership is in several respects very different from leadership under
4169707 the forum suggests that organizations with adaptable and empowered cultures are likely to adapt well to the challenges inherent in a crisis when standard operating procedures and protocols no longer make sense and the chain of command is broken or formal leadership is unable to absorb and make sense of a rapidly evolving situation the leadership capability embedded in the organizational dna is the reserve that is left to count on

4169711 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4169712 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4169713 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4169714 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4169715 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4169716 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
4169717 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
4169718 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
4169719 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
4169720 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
4169721 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
4169722 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
4169723 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
4169724 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
4169725 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
4169726 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4169727 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4169728 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4169729 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4169730 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4169731 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4169732 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4169733 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4169734 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4169735 who are open to doing something on the production side
4169736 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4169737 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4169738 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4169739 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
4169740 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
4169741 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
4169742 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
4169743 this is seminal riff rock with a metal edge that kicks you in the ass if you dont like this stuff you dont like to rock
4169744 hey the sound is big and sounds loud even with the volume down low
4169745 these are great guitar rock tunes but dont expect a folk song
4169746 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4169747 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4169748 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4169749 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4169750 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4169751 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4169752 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4169753 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4169754 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4169755 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4169756 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4169757 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4169758 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4169759 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4169760 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4169761 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4169762 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4169763 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4169764 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4169765 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4169766 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4169767 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4169768 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4169769 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4169770 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4169771 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve

4169780 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4169781 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4169782 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4169783 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4169784 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4169785 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4169786 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4169787 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4169788 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4169789 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4169790 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4169791 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4169792 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4169793 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4169794 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4169795 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4169796 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4169797 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4169798 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4169799 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4169800 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4169801 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4169802 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4169803 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4169804 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4169805 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4169806 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence

4169931 a disturbing thing with younger nurses is that because of the workload and just other nurses being too busy to do actual mentoring we are seeing high rates of nurses just saying after a couple of years i can t deal with this so they leave the profession altogether
4169932 it s a real concern because when you re looking at an aging workforce you want to have nurses that are going to be in the system to replace the nurses that are retiring
4169933 and if they re not there to replace them then whos going to get nursing care
4169934 we re definitely aware the nursing environment these days is not ideal because it s such an acute complex working arena so it does make for definite challenges

4169976 we definitely miss him williams on the field theres no doubt about that
