6290000 now let us look at the amount of land area that would be needed for these 6 668 wind turbines
6290001 to figure the spacing of the wind turbines let us multiply the rotor diameter of 77 meters by 3 which gives us 231 meters as the spacing between the wind turbines
6290002 if we multiply 231 by 385 it will give us the total area required to site one of our 1 5 mw wind turbines this comes out to 88 935 square meters or 22 acres of land for one 1 5 mw wind turbine if we now multiply the 22 acres by the 6 668 wind turbines we get 146 696 acres which is 229 21 square miles about three times the size of the metropolitan washington d c area so it appears that it will take 146 696 acres of land covered with wind turbines to have a part time generating capability equivalent to that achieved on 4 000 acres of land for the nuclear power plant which includes a lake used to provide water to the cooling towers
6290003 wind energy advocates purposely confuse the availability factor and the capacity factor in their promotional materials to try to demonstrate that a certain number of wind turbines can produce the same energy as a nuclear power plant in truth although the availability factor of the wind turbine is 100 because it is available to produce power at any time wind turbines actually produce power less than 25 of the time and that is only when the wind blows compare this to the nuclear power plant in which the availability factor and the capacity factor are the same about 95 the only time the nuclear reactor is not producing power is during maintenance periods

6290084 i have enjoyed great health at a great age because everyday since i can remember i have consumed a bottle of wine except when i have not felt well then i have consumed two bottles
6290085 wine is a living liquid containing no preservatives its life cycle comprises youth maturity old age and death when not treated with reasonable respect it will sicken and die
6290086 gentlemen in the little moment that remains to us between the crisis and the catastrophe we may as well drink a glass of champagne
6290087 writing in my sixty fourth year i can truthfully say that since i reached the age of discretion i have consistently drunk more than most people would say is good for me nor did i regret it wine has been for me a firm friend and a wise counsellor often wine has shown me matters in their true perspective and has as though by the touch of a magic wand reduced great disasters to small inconveniences wine has lit up for me the pages of literature and revealed in life romance lurking in the commonplace wine has made me bold but not foolish has induced me to say silly things but not to do them

6290089 it has become quite a common proverb that in wine there is truth

6290091 when wines were good they pleased my sense cheered my spirits improved my moral and intellectual powers besides enabling me to confer the same benefits on other people
6290092 ill never be able to afford it so i better buy it now
6290093 come come good wine is a good familiar creature if it be well used exclaim no more against it
6290094 when there is plenty of wine sorrow and worry take wing
6290095 wine is made to be drunk as women are made to be loved profit by the freshness of youth or the splendor of maturity do not await decrepitude
6290096 it sloweth age it strengtheneth youth it helpeth digestion it abandoneth melancholie it relisheth the heart it lighteneth the mind it quickenth the spirits it keepeth and preserveth the head from whirling the eyes from dazzling the tongue from lisping the mouth from snaffling the teeth from chattering and the throat from rattling it keepeth the stomach from wambling the heart from swelling the hands from shivering the sinews from shrinking the veins from crumbling the bones from aching and the marrow from soaking
6290097 i wonder what the vintners buy one half so precious as the stuff they sell
6290098 my only regret in life is that i did not drink more champagne

6290235 can claim with gratitude a good number of lobbyists as friends and supporters
6290236 mccains rhetoric about lobbyists is so disconnected from reality that the real birds of prey are the ones descending on his credibility and former maverick image
6290237 john mccain has so many lobbyists running and raising money for his campaign that job applicants apparently need to show their lobbyist disclosure forms to get in the door john mccains desperate and misleading rhetoric cant change the fact that he represents more of the same broken washington politics
6290238 having worked in washington for so long i can claim with gratitude a good number of lobbyists as friends and supporters many of whom supported my presidential campaign
6290239 i would like to say another word about lobbyists lobbying is an honorable profession i have no problem with it i have no problem with people working in order to bring the peoples interests and agenda and priorities to the attention of congress almost all of us who i know of rely on their input on various issues many supply us with policy papers with data et cetera

6290249 the agency lacks the budget the statutory authority and the scientific expertise to ensure the hundreds of nanoproducts now on the market among them baby bottle nipples infant teething rings paints waxes kitchenware and appliances are safe this problem will only worsen as more sophisticated nanotechnology based products begin to enter the consumer market
6290250 during the fall of 2007 many americans faced a hazard in their products that had been banned for 30 years lead as millions of childrens toys coated with lead paint were recalled it became clear that government oversight had failed and that the cpsc the agency primarily responsible for the oversight of these toys was stretched too thin from years of neglect underfunding and the challenges posed by an increasingly global manufacturing system
6290251 it is against this background that we need to ask the question is the cpsc adequately prepared to deal with nanotechnology which is now associated with more than 800 manufacturer identified consumer products ranging from infant pacifiers to paints to appliances to clothing
6290252 it took decades of research before lawmakers found the political will to keep lead and phthalates out of toys it could take a very long time to research and ensure that potentially dangerous nanomaterials are kept out too

6290256 personally it was really bad as a team it could have been better but it was already far better than i would have expected given the situation the problems started yesterday really only half the team came to practice that was still about twelve guys but it was not a good sign last night i could not sleep at all i was up until 3 30 trying to sleep and yes i tried reading it was really frustrating what was worse i had to wake up at 6 30 to get the bus to naha to get to the game but my alarm clock didnt go off again as it seems to do at only important times and i was lucky to wake up at 7 30 and realize i was in trouble i was supposed to be at the school by 7 40 but i really didnt want to miss the game and i got lucky that the host parents and sister were already awake so the sister gave me a ride but it was such a rush that i didnt eat breakfast just the fact that i knew that i was running on three to four hours of sleep and no food was a mental problem in itself but then there was the physical effect too either way i got there just in time and got to warm up and prepare not that we needed to warm up the weather was ridiculously hot only two thirds of the team came to the game mostly forwards were missing so i got to play eight man which would have been really good had i been in better condition i played a poor game overall at first i really wanted to overcome my hindrances and be very aggressive but then i had a late tackle that i thought should have been a yellow card but i didnt even get penalized for because the ref was an idiot i also missed a tackle off a scrum that contributed to a try those were my two biggest mistakes right at the beginning after that i guess i was useful but i could have done a lot more i got really close to scoring a try two or three times but i just couldnt beat one guy i also missed a really easy conversion kick for the team the teamwork was as messy as expected we used a couple of graduated guys for forwards because we didnt have enough and they had to hold back but they held back a lot on offense and ended up maybe doing a little less than a regular player would have however i guess people learned the individual skills well enough rucks and mauls were surprisingly strong scrums were not good but we at last won all our balls except one and lineouts were all right in the end the score was only a 20 17 loss they had three more points because of a drop goal from the first half it didnt look like a drop kick to me but like i said the ref was terrible which i admitted that i took shameful advantage of at times our tries were based mostly off surprise individual or two or three person efforts
6290257 i hear from many survivors that eventually this all consuming worry lessens and isnt a part of your daily existence some people have told me that they now go weeks even months without thinking about cancer thats hard to imagine now but i look forward to that day

6290280 users may wish to begin a private browsing session to research a medical condition or plan a surprise vacation or birthday party for a loved one
6290281 the larger challenge here is notifying users clearly about what sites theyre disclosing information to and enabling them to control that disclosure if they choose

6290435 the washington post arab israeli commentary by outside writers is overwhelmingly pro palestinian anti israeli or both

6290463 we want them to leave here and be able to present themselves in a confident manner now we dont spend time teaching those specifics on how to be confident however what we do is teach them the skills they need to feel confident
6290464 i teach it to my sisters at home now because i dont want them to get raped
6290465 or the way car alarms always go off outside when we have sex
6290466 but if you used to do all that with your family then how come ive never heard of whitenoise wrath before
6290467 thats because im actually a continuity inconsistency from an alternate reality you see when quantimar the time lord stole the eternity shoe he
6290468 you know what the point is im not whitenoise anymore im cecile
6290469 instead of trying to destroy the world i serve tofu i know some people might try to argue that theyre pretty much the same thing but
6290470 i told our members that its just another tool that we can use to get the play right not to look at it as a negative but a positive
6290471 as hard as you try as much as you hustle sometimes with just the landscape of the ballparks nowadays its hard to tell so if we can get it right you know what lets use it as a tool to get it right
6290472 echo chamber that promises hope but only delivers deceit by offering claims of something that will not come
6290473 the anthony r martin trigona congressional campaign to exterminate jew power in america
6290474 the states largest glbt advocacy group equality maine has endorsed tom allen d portland for senate allen a current u s representative is challenging sen susan collins r bangor
6290475 throughout his long career congressman allen has supported fairness and equality while opposing discrimination his voting record on lgbt issues is exceptional he has worked to eliminate discrimination in jobs housing public accommodations and financial matters and we look forward to working with him to win fully inclusive federal employment non discrimination legislation
6290476 1 it puts lives at risk by reducing the pool of potential blood donors at a time when blood is in short supply 2 it stigmatises gay and bisexual men as a threat to public health 3 it wrongly portrays male to male sex as inherently a health risk and sends out the irresponsible public health message that heterosexual sex is health risk free

6290478 what will happen is that through e learning students can log on through their laptops and watch a professors lecture and get the same content he presents to students in the classroom its not just a video feed
6290479 if you love wealth more than liberty the tranquility of servitude better than the animating contest of freedom depart from us in peace we ask not your counsel nor your arms crouch down and lick the hand that feeds you may your chains rest lightly upon you and may posterity forget that you were our countrymen
6290480 we have already stacked the reflectors sign boards etc which will be put up shortly but the accidents happening at the spot cannot be attributed to the on going work
6290481 and i went to the mall but im staying off my feet as much as possible
6290482 doug warren looked confident he had a couple of things he had to make decisions about and when he had to make decisions he made the right one which is half the battle with goalkeepers it is great they can make fantastic saves but if they can make good decisions on a regular basis it makes it look easier than it actually is
6290483 the first half we felt safe to be ahead we would have liked to have penetrated them a bit more but as far as playing the game was concerned we were in control we were in control up until the 60th minute and then we lost our way a little bit and they put us under pressure we lost a goal from our own bad play we should have just stopped the ball up the other end of the field and cleared it and we didnt we tried to be too clever in the wrong area lost the ball and then jaime moreno scored a great goal if that falls to anybody else it is not a goal it was a fantastic goal from him it was difficult after that all of a sudden theyre one goal in it youre stuck between going forward too early and back too far and that is what happened after they scored
6290484 khano smith has been over the past two or three games he has been lively he has been enthusiastic the one thing that we tend to forget is players coming from outside the usa dont understand the whole travel part of the game and mauricio castro has been just feeling his legs he is used to getting on a bus and going an hour and playing another team he is not used to time zones and flights and buses to stadiums to get to the airport and all kinds of things castro was feeling his legs a little bit but as i said khano smith has been energetic and confident and that is why were playing him
6290485 michael parkhurst has been saying he hasnt gotten a lot of sleep but he has experience behind him now he has a fantastic soccer brain and no surprise that he came through
6290486 taylor twellman just needs games he really just needs to get games under his belt to get his real sharpness he is fit he can run all day but that extra sharpness you get from playing games is what he is missing
6290487 adam cristman has been an absolute trooper he has made a huge contribution the last four or five weeks good strikers are always active anyway and the two of them are good strikers theyre both good at holding the ball up and they can both score goals may it continue
6290488 we have so many games at the present time that were counting the suspensions and the bruises and the injuries as we go along
6290489 to me that game was already gone you couldnt get it back thats a difficult situation to come in at i was just focusing on this game this was my game from the start the guys in front of me played unbelievable michael parkhurst jay heaps and chris albright and just our defending six back there played unbelievable which made it a lot easier on me
6290490 the guys that stepped in there jeff larentowicz and those guys they did a great job we won superliga without them again michael parkhurst is the best defender in the league and having him back there is a big relief
6290491 it makes it easy when the guys in front of you are doing their jobs and are doing it well i dont think i was in many positions to make gutsy decisions because the guys in front of me made it easy overall we won so thats all that really matters
6290492 fred ended up getting behind our defense and i stepped up to block the shot i think jay heaps slid and blocked it he did a great job to block the shot but it just fell to jaime moreno and its his class he really turned it on the last 25 minutes and you saw him take over the game it was just a classy finish
6290493 i think the wins will take care of themselves if we play the way we did tonight and just have solid performances i think is the goal of the team to just play well and the winning will take care of itself
6290494 yeah its awesome doug warren and i have been friends since we were 16 17 and we were on youth teams together
6290495 i felt alright obviously not 100 percent ive been out for a while but its getting there
6290496 khano smith made a great run and adam cristman was just big and physical and made a good play and fortunately i was in the right spot at the right time
6290497 i think if any team is going to tell you to take it one game at a time thats us we just have to end the season on the right note and keep getting better and getting results when the playoffs start its a whole new ball game weve got to be on a roll were playing a lot more games this year superliga was kind of a mini playoff in the middle of the season then you have a lull afterwards and we have to get back at it and take care of business in mls and make sure we go into the playoffs playing our best soccer
6290498 i dont think in the first half we executed what we came to do very well in the second half i think it got better we moved the ball around better we were disappointed in the no call on fred in the box i cant wait to look at it again but from my memory it was 100 percent a pk and thats a very crucial time to get one back and make it 1 1 we had our chances so its disappointing i felt like we could have snuck out with a tie
6290499 when you go down one its disappointing but i dont think we created a whole lot either so on that side i was disappointed we talked and reorganized the second half and i thought we had a lot of good play and some good quality chances
6290500 i couldnt see it until the last second and it came through devon mctavish s legs i went to kick it and adam cristman got it and i just couldnt get enough on it and it just went right off taylor twellman give them some credit they hustled and were in the right spot it was just bad luck on our part
6290501 we always say that when the defense drops too much on the forwards its always trouble for us in the second half when we started playing and pressing putting more pressure higher it made a big difference in the game we put in a better performance in the second half but still it wasnt good enough thats another lesson and hopefully it wont happen again
6290502 the revolution did a pretty good job keeping the ball and winning second balls we had a big gap in the middle but we sorted it out in the second half and it made a big difference it was a bad loss but now we just have to think about saturday
6290503 we never gave up we kept digging kept trying and after we scored the first goal we had some good chances to tie the game its just part of the game where you get chances and you miss them we just have to do a better job overall it wasnt a good job in the first half but we showed a different team in the second half well learn from it and it wont happen again
6290504 he told me that he was threatened with torture and that they would use a device to shock him if he didnt confess
6290505 the purchase building acts as a powerful barrier to unifying the northern and southern sections of the proposed park and achieving the full extent of the park
6290506 by removing it two parks will become one in addition its removal would allow for broad vistas of the brooklyn bridges stone piers as well as provide unencumbered views of the manhattan bridge in views north
6290507 this is necessary safety work that has been planned for years
6290508 this land was promised for parkland and thats the way it should be
6290509 we all know how the bureaucracy works a year turns into five years and then 10 years and before you know you can kiss that site goodbye
6290510 but dear gods you are too weird too irrational for the wal mart shoppers to accept
6290511 what if a web service could automatically provide the cms metadata when you go to check in a new topic
6290512 unofficial primary results showed nick carter a democratic candidate for the u s senate held a small but sufficient lead over challenger keith goodenough who conceded the race
6290513 michael phelps is going to have no problem from here on out
6290514 he has transcended himself into a position that is going to sustain him for a long time
6290515 its defined by whether he is thought of by performance or stature story if america believes his struggle to achieve eight golds has a broader good than just victories he will earn millions of dollars forever
6290516 some of the big companies like octagon are very global and they have to be careful with that
6290517 they have to be careful with that or its going to reflect on michael his brand and his worth can just keep going and going baltimore is a town that really embraces its own if its own embraces it
6290518 right now it seems like the biggest thing in the world and well be talking about this for years and years
6290519 i like michael and i wish him the best but the truth is that people move on
6290520 it will be a great opportunity to celebrate the success of the beijing games and kick off the countdown to london 2012
6290521 people just cant believe what hes been doing there is a superhuman aspect to it from that standpoint hes hard to top
6290522 it could be michael phelps teaching other celebrities to swim like olympians or i dont know what
6290523 but hes at the level where i could see people imagining stuff like that around him
6290524 as an official sponsor of the 2008 u s olympic team and a proud sponsor of phelps it is only fitting that kellogg company feature this world class athlete on its iconic boxes of kelloggs corn flakes and kelloggs frosted flakes cereals
6290525 michael embodies the values behind our frosted flakes earn your stripes tm program he knows that winning is not just about the glory that comes with gold medals but about good sportsmanship working hard and being your best
6290526 after representing my country and competing in the olympics hilton gave me another great reason to get back in the pool
6290527 by being a part of this campaign im able to help support swim education programs across the nation and give young people the chance to experience the power of the sport swimming is much more than a fun activity and great form of exercise it teaches self discipline and dedication two important qualities that one can draw on to succeed both in and out of the pool
6290528 it is possible but unlikely for the simple reason that swimming commands our attention only once every four years while tiger and lebron enjoy weekly even daily coverage during their respective seasons
6290529 the olympic games effect how sports marketing builds strong brands
6290530 swimming is really not the topic of our typical sports conversations once the olympics end so sustained visibility will be a challenge for phelps
6290531 companies that become sports sponsors whether of athletes teams or events want to associate with greatness
6290532 we love good stories and michael phelps is one of the best so he is a natural attraction for companies
6290533 for phelps to have staying power his agent needs to work overtime to place michael on the various shows letterman leno and so on while at the same time not saturating the market with phelps

6290538 their friends are quite pleased that theyre getting back together and are trying to give them space
6290539 shes the most discerning person ive ever met shell read a script 100 times shes relentless
6290540 a girl came up to me on the street and she almost smacked me
6290541 the only thing i remember is we both went down swingin and we called it a draw
6290542 it may all seem like good news but what about
6290543 jusqu aujourdhui ce qui avait t annonc publiquement ne se traduit pas dans les faits ce qui soul ve un certain nombre de questions
6290544 so you can track the lavish parties lobbyists and big companies put on for our politicians on the web site youre able to search for your member of congress and see who has been throwing parties for them and we even have a special section set up for the upcoming democratic and republican conventions
6290545 hey this is very different from most anime and is probably something that should get more support than most anime usually get
6290546 its this kind of scene so it has to be like this
6290547 type of girls all of your characters are very strong and self reliant women but at the same time many of them are put in kind of dangerous situations that are very alarming for western audiences how do you see women in your life and how do they affect the women you draw
6290548 he wasnt unaware that there could be some legal repercussions
6290549 it was just more important to him to stay true to his cause everything he does is about free speech
6290550 the united states does encourage the government of china to demonstrate respect for human rights and that includes freedom of expression
6290551 were all concerned and were hoping for his quick release
6290552 we have gathered that a number of other protesters have actually been released or quickly deported were hoping that whats going to happen here
6290553 there is always natural concerns before a project like this but i trust james and i dont think he would have embarked in something dangerous
6290554 im expecting a random phonecall telling me that hes outside our apartment and that he cant find his key
6290555 we anticipate the contractor returning to the project in the next few weeks
6290556 the renovation in time for the big celebration in november
6290557 they dont seem to understand this is a very significant event
6290558 if this was the battlefields of gettysburg it would get a lot of attention but for some reason it doesnt
6290559 there will be some kind of exiting animated feature associated with the lighting
6290560 i never expected it to be done on time let alone early its really going to make a difference regulating all the traffic that comes pouring through here one less concern for me as s driver i think thats great
6290561 we are talking about the possibility of really creating a great real world class park here on the waterfront
6290562 we have enormous activity and potential on our waterfront in new york today and we have the chance to build a great 21st century public work
6290563 this needs to not be a playground for rich people but a full park for the neighborhood
6290564 if we have a park we have the ability to maintain and protect it
6290565 hotels draw people in housing requires a private quiet neighborhood
6290566 im not in favor of housing in the park but im not willing to risk the park not being built by opposing the housing
6290567 the housing does in fact take up a much smaller footprint than anything anyone else was trying to think of
6290568 the whole way to get the city and state to pay for the park was by agreeing it would be a self sustaining park
6290569 i would like to have mr squadron tell us now before the election how he would intend to make up the revenue generated by the very limited 8 2 acres of development versus the 76 acres of open space
6290570 the public needs to understand my brother that he does this because he is autistic
6290571 hes not doing this to be an a hole or a killjoy or to inconvenience people
6290572 it is a developmental condition it is something that his mind believes he absolutely must do my mother often describes that he thinks of it as his job his mission he is compelled to do it
6290573 he gets upset and comes home and relates the incidents to my mother and to me theres a specific group of people from a moving company who have threatened him physically but people have to understand that he is absolutely not violent and not a threat to anyone
6290574 some of the bloggers say he appears angry but its really just social awkwardness
6290575 the fact is that he has so much difficulty even interacting with people that he doesnt even try anymore people perceive his look as one of anger but he is not dangerous
6290576 you have no idea what it felt like to read that
6290577 he is an incredibly vulnerable person not some monster to be hunted down he has suffered his entire life he has suffered enough
6290578 the problem is that low self esteem makes him reluctant to interact with people
6290579 if you want to say good job keep it up thats great and he may even manage a reply but dont expect to have a whole conversation with him
6290580 how far do you think my g4 will go on stock options i need cash
6290581 one of the misconceptions is there was a pot of gold out there
6290582 for every big deal you read about there are a million guys who tried to get a deal done who couldnt
6290583 they talked about the transaction what am i getting paid today
6290584 the big thing with funnyordie was we said lets build a company
6290585 there the security guard can make 100 million because everyone is given stock
6290586 but here it is a no no the deal is a cherished ritual
6290587 people in silicon valley too want their pound of flesh
6290588 the difference is they will wait five years instead of five minutes
6290589 the idea that certain channels would effectively be banned is medieval
6290590 our goal is to go in the opposite direction to so many other news organizations which are sadly cutting back on their coverage of the world
6290591 the reality is that al jazeera and al jazeera english are two different channels that cater to different audiences
6290592 after a few years its inevitable that some people move on i dont think three or four months from now well look back and say there was a morale problem
6290593 the point of the story really seems to be that the incarnate god visible and tangible to man in the holy communion alone can subdue and expel evil
6290594 and my poor wife dead to me but alive by churchs law though no wits all gone even i who am a faithful husband
6290595 most blessed of all when this now undead be made to rest as true dead
6290596 one and all we felt that the holy calm that lay like sunshine over the wasted face and form was only an earthly token and symbol of the calm that was to reign for ever
6290597 it was like a miracle the whole body crumbled into dust and passed from our sight i shall be glad as long as i live that even in that final moment of dissolution there was in the face a look of peace such as i never could have imagined might have rested there
6290598 if your hand cause you to sin if your eye cause you to sin
6290599 if youre a hacker and dont mind voiding the warranty you can probably find a way to make a mouse or keyboard work with a chumby
6290600 all we can do logically about the situation we have done
6290601 it should be the boards who make this call not the players
6290602 they know our view we are not proposing to do any more until we hear from them
6290603 we are confident that the icc has got a very clear understanding of what the views are around not just australia but a number of senior icc member nations
6290604 with the champions trophy about 20 days away shouldnt that have been the main talking point
6290605 he said i dont want you to throw anything at me then he said im not going to college i said youre going to college youve got brains but mom he replied i joined the marines
6290606 i always said my sons cannot become criminals or drug dealers but anything else ill support
6290607 ma i know you want to check me out and make sure i have all my fingers and toes but you dont know what they are doing to women and children here i cant leave my brothers

6290612 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
6290613 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
6290614 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
6290615 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
6290616 first iraq now this always throwing money at lost causes
6290617 the latest doomed coach at real has dumped my cute ass on the bench and it looks like hes going to leave it there
6290618 a sudden descent into chaos and a protracted civil war and insurgency
6290619 i thought this old codger would kick it before our first anniversary
6290620 that is the acas intelligence surely they cannot just watch someone committing a crime and do nothing because they know a crime has been committed they act
6290621 there is no need to inform me this is their job and
6290622 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
6290623 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6290624 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6290625 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6290626 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6290627 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6290628 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6290629 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6290630 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6290631 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
6290632 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
6290633 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
6290634 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
6290635 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6290636 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6290637 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6290638 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6290639 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
6290640 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6290641 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6290642 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6290643 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
6290644 a happy doodle on gods telephone pad that leaped off
6290645 i seem to have been born with a lot of phlegm
6290646 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
6290647 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
6290648 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6290649 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
6290650 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
6290651 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
6290652 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6290653 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
6290654 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
6290655 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
6290656 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
6290657 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
6290658 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
6290659 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
6290660 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
6290661 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
6290662 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
6290663 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
6290664 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
6290665 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
6290666 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
6290667 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
6290668 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
6290669 sonics revenue for 2009 is expected to be greater than 15 per cent above the 2008 figure
6290670 earnings per share growth is expected to be greater than 10 per cent depending on foreign exchange and interest rate movements and excluding any acquisitions other than those already announced
6290671 we will continue to pursue a growth path via both organic and acquisitional growth
6290672 the crowds were solid it looks like it was a win win for everybody
6290673 its a better model than weve had in the past
6290674 plus by charging it seemed we had nicer crowds and by nicer i mean well behaved
6290675 the people were there for the concerts they had an investment in it so they behaved
6290676 despite a generally tough operating environment we are pleased to have achieved a profit for the year
6290677 importantly we are in a strong financial position with cash on hand of 8 8 million at year end which gives us the balance sheet strength to pursue our growth objectives
6290678 we have achieved several important strategic goals during the year including our expansion into the alternative fuels business through the acquisition of sydney based orbital gas product
6290679 these growth initiatives will add value in future years and position the company extremely well in the current environment
6290680 these and other developments in the liquid natural gas lng market provide exciting new growth avenues for orbital in the current market environment where demand for alternative fuels technology is rapidly increasing
6290681 licensing and royalty revenue increased by 17 to 2 7 million compared to the previous financial year
6290682 despite the steady royalty volumes the contribution from this sector fell by 0 3 million due to the impact of the weakening us dollar but this was offset by increased licence fees
6290683 we have unveiled a number of new initiatives aimed at furthering the companys expansion into the alternative fuels business including the formation of orbital gas products formally boral alternative fuel systems a tier 1 supplier of lpg systems to the ford motor corporation and to the aftermarket operators
6290684 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
6290685 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
6290686 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6290687 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6290688 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6290689 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
6290690 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6290691 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6290692 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6290693 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6290694 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6290695 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6290696 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
6290697 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
6290698 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
6290699 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
6290700 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
6290701 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
6290702 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
6290703 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
6290704 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
6290705 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
6290706 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
6290707 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
6290708 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
6290709 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
6290710 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
6290711 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
6290712 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
6290713 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
6290714 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
6290715 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
6290716 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
6290717 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
6290718 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
6290719 never seal dead flies in a closed container doing so may result in a hazardous explosion
6290720 excuse me mr fly but if the election were held today would you vote for sen obama or sen mccain
6290721 i tell ya lou im voting for the one with the least flat spots
6290722 ineffective against blood sucking flies blood sucking flies work on visual cues not scent
6290723 but if you see bloody crusts on your dogs nose or ears or if you observe your animals stomping their feet up and down it is likely you are infested with blood sucking flies
6290724 well jeb ole boy youve got a heckuva good product here with this fly trap really clearsem out but you cant afford to leave yourself open for the liability if some idiot seals these dead flies up
6290725 why the exploding fly problem any dang blamed fool knows that you could be sued and lose everything if some imbecile seals up his dead flies too tightly and they explode the next morning blinding him or worse people would think the unabomber was loose again
6290726 but lawyer theres always going to be somebody wholl seal their dead flies up too tight just like there will always be people who drive over the speed limit or tear the tags off of mattresses theres no way around it
6290727 thats right jeb so you have to cover your butt by warning people not to
6290728 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6290729 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
6290730 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
6290731 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
6290732 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6290733 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6290734 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6290735 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6290736 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6290737 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6290738 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6290739 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6290740 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
6290741 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
6290742 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
6290743 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
6290744 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
6290745 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
6290746 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
6290747 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
6290748 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
6290749 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
6290750 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
6290751 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
6290752 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
6290753 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
6290754 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
6290755 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
6290756 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
6290757 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
6290758 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
6290759 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
6290760 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
6290761 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
6290762 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
6290763 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
6290764 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
6290765 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
6290766 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
6290767 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
6290768 i am more bullish than bearish i think the market has too quickly discounted geopolitical risks and was too concerned with demand destruction we should be trending back towards 120 125 a barrel
6290769 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
6290770 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
6290771 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
6290772 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
6290773 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
6290774 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
6290775 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
6290776 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
6290777 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
6290778 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
6290779 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
6290780 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
6290781 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
6290782 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
6290783 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
6290784 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
6290785 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
6290786 emil roth a great aviation enthusiast induced capt lewis a yancey the famous flyer to help us map out our course teach me the art of navigation and supervise the construction of a special plane
6290787 at first lon yancey was reluctant to undertake those tasks
6290788 for six months right up to the moment that we completed the test hop from roosevelt field long island to porto rico early last may lon stuck by us to see that everything was shipshape and perfect
6290789 during the day we were out at the bellanca factory watching the work progress on the plane then at night beginning at 7 oclock sharp lon had me sitting down at a desk drilling me in the rudiments of navigation and meteorology
6290790 lon first got down to fundamentals telling me the difference between a variation and a direction finder then he taught me how to use the bubble sextant getting my sight then by mathematical calculation getting the exact location in longitude and latitude
6290791 he gave me a special course in the use of the fine comparing watches the longines chronometers so that i would be able to calculate the time in new york over the ocean and in england simultaneously
6290792 finally when the plane was ready for us at roosevelt field my days were spent getting instruction in the use of the various instruments with which the dashboard was equipped and then at night i buckled down to the business of improving my navigation
6290793 as for the plane it was specially built for long distance hops being constructed of metal wood and fabric it is a red bellanca monoplane equipped with a pratt whitney wasp single motored 425 horsepower engine
6290794 indicate that the first stop will be in moscow a distance of 5 400 miles then we advance to tchita in siberia for a distance of another 3 285 miles
6290795 from there our next stop will be at nome alaska 3 128 miles away then we will fly another 2 231 miles to edmonton in alberta canada from that point we launch on our last leg which is a distance of 2 209 miles to roosevelt field we hope to average 145 miles an hour
6290796 our route has been mapped out so as to include other airports along the line in case we are compelled to come down unexpectedly for any emergency
6290797 on our return we will not fly over the pacific though there is no telling but what we might get whimsical and do it just to be the first flyers to make a nonstop flight over that ocean our specifications call for passage over the bering strait
6290798 our stop over at each terminal on our course will be only a matter of a few hours after a little nap we will give the ship an inspection take on fuel if necessary attend to any other matters which might arise and be off on our next stretch
6290799 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
6290800 in an era where media consolidation is occurring at an all too rapid pace its essential to look for alternative news sources that are free from corporate bias the future of our rather stupid species depends on it sites like yours have made a massive impact on me over the last year im very grateful
6290801 spiderednews is a really good resource thanks for the effort and time you put in to providing it
6290802 in an era where media consolidation is occurring at an all too rapid pace its essential to look for alternative news sources that are free from corporate bias the future of our rather stupid species depends on it sites like yours have made a massive impact on me over the last year im very grateful
6290803 spiderednews is a really good resource thanks for the effort and time you put in to providing it
6290804 in an era where media consolidation is occurring at an all too rapid pace its essential to look for alternative news sources that are free from corporate bias the future of our rather stupid species depends on it sites like yours have made a massive impact on me over the last year im very grateful
6290805 spiderednews is a really good resource thanks for the effort and time you put in to providing it
6290806 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
6290807 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
6290808 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
6290809 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
6290810 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
6290811 you always think that youre going to be with the team youre drafted by but it doesnt happen that way sometimes you move on
6290812 it was close but i knew they werent going to overrule it
6290813 but thats a championship you get a ring and its a moment you cant ever forget about as a child you dream about winning a world championship so when you do it its a dream come true
6290814 i was at my house in tampa just watching tv on a sunday
6290815 they contacted me and told me to hop on a plane
6290816 i feel real good to be back in the league
6290817 thats one of my goals to be playing outside i want to make a name for myself
6290818 the field is bigger theres more players and better athletes out here
6290819 its more of a mental thing too it takes more preparation for the outside game its more organized and there are more schemes ill have to study real hard to get the concepts and pick up on the playbook in time
6290820 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
6290821 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
6290822 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
6290823 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
6290824 we are excited to have andy as an sap ambassador
6290825 he is one of the most talented and popular players on the atp circuit and he personifies the same winning attributes such as determination passion and resourcefulness that make sap the leading provider of business software
6290826 in an era where media consolidation is occurring at an all too rapid pace its essential to look for alternative news sources that are free from corporate bias the future of our rather stupid species depends on it sites like yours have made a massive impact on me over the last year im very grateful
6290827 spiderednews is a really good resource thanks for the effort and time you put in to providing it
6290828 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
6290829 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
6290830 i dont think in the first half we executed what we came to do very well in the second half i think it got better we moved the ball around better we were disappointed in the no call on fred in the box i cant wait to look at it again but from my memory it was 100 percent a pk and thats a very crucial time to get one back and make it 1 1 we had our chances so its disappointing i felt like we could have snuck out with a tie
6290831 when you go down one its disappointing but i dont think we created a whole lot either so on that side i was disappointed we talked and reorganized the second half and i thought we had a lot of good play and some good quality chances
6290832 i couldnt see it until the last second and it came through devon mctavish s legs i went to kick it and adam cristman got it and i just couldnt get enough on it and it just went right off taylor twellman give them some credit they hustled and were in the right spot it was just bad luck on our part
6290833 we always say that when the defense drops too much on the forwards its always trouble for us in the second half when we started playing and pressing putting more pressure higher it made a big difference in the game we put in a better performance in the second half but still it wasnt good enough thats another lesson and hopefully it wont happen again
6290834 the revolution did a pretty good job keeping the ball and winning second balls we had a big gap in the middle but we sorted it out in the second half and it made a big difference it was a bad loss but now we just have to think about saturday
6290835 we never gave up we kept digging kept trying and after we scored the first goal we had some good chances to tie the game its just part of the game where you get chances and you miss them we just have to do a better job overall it wasnt a good job in the first half but we showed a different team in the second half well learn from it and it wont happen again
6290836 doug warren looked confident he had a couple of things he had to make decisions about and when he had to make decisions he made the right one which is half the battle with goalkeepers it is great they can make fantastic saves but if they can make good decisions on a regular basis it makes it look easier than it actually is
6290837 the first half we felt safe to be ahead we would have liked to have penetrated them a bit more but as far as playing the game was concerned we were in control we were in control up until the 60th minute and then we lost our way a little bit and they put us under pressure we lost a goal from our own bad play we should have just stopped the ball up the other end of the field and cleared it and we didnt we tried to be too clever in the wrong area lost the ball and then jaime moreno scored a great goal if that falls to anybody else it is not a goal it was a fantastic goal from him it was difficult after that all of a sudden theyre one goal in it youre stuck between going forward too early and back too far and that is what happened after they scored
6290838 khano smith has been over the past two or three games he has been lively he has been enthusiastic the one thing that we tend to forget is players coming from outside the usa dont understand the whole travel part of the game and mauricio castro has been just feeling his legs he is used to getting on a bus and going an hour and playing another team he is not used to time zones and flights and buses to stadiums to get to the airport and all kinds of things castro was feeling his legs a little bit but as i said khano smith has been energetic and confident and that is why were playing him
6290839 michael parkhurst has been saying he hasnt gotten a lot of sleep but he has experience behind him now he has a fantastic soccer brain and no surprise that he came through
6290840 taylor twellman just needs games he really just needs to get games under his belt to get his real sharpness he is fit he can run all day but that extra sharpness you get from playing games is what he is missing
6290841 adam cristman has been an absolute trooper he has made a huge contribution the last four or five weeks good strikers are always active anyway and the two of them are good strikers theyre both good at holding the ball up and they can both score goals may it continue
6290842 we have so many games at the present time that were counting the suspensions and the bruises and the injuries as we go along
6290843 to me that game was already gone you couldnt get it back thats a difficult situation to come in at i was just focusing on this game this was my game from the start the guys in front of me played unbelievable michael parkhurst jay heaps and chris albright and just our defending six back there played unbelievable which made it a lot easier on me
6290844 its always hard to judge your own performance right after a game but i think i did ok
6290845 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
6290846 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
6290847 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
6290848 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
6290849 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
6290850 ive spent a large part of my career at united the last nine years and ill remember that time fondly but feel im ready for a new challenge
6290851 arsenal is known for playing technical and skilful football and has a young but experienced squad im really excited about this next stage of my career hopefully playing my part in helping the club to new successes
6290852 to be able to come back in 2007 especially at the world cup and perform at i guess the biggest stage its the pinnacle of our sport and play reasonably well there i came away with a lot of confidence and took that into the super 14
6290853 but at the same time it means nothing if you dont continue on with it so it is just seeking that consistency which i guess has eluded me somewhat in the early stages of my career
6290854 with these new elvs it certainly creates a lot more opportunity at fullback in terms of counter attack and turnover ball and getting your hands on the ball as much as you can
6290855 certainly late in the halves when the bigger guys are getting fatigued there is some scope there to try to get involved and get a few mismatches
6290856 he has a significant body of work under his belt now both on field and off it
6290857 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
6290858 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
6290859 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
6290860 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
6290861 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually

6290868 gang of 10 would allow virginia georgia north carolina and south carolina to opt into leasing programs starting 50 miles off their shores the plan also would require the interior department to do an inventory of offshore resources starting in those four states

6290870 you have a richer opportunity in a place that has not been previously developed
6290871 companies are recognizing a movement afoot but im not sure this sale says much about that
6290872 servicing audiences that are too small to be profitable through traditional tv is exactly what the internet is good for
6290873 it plays to the long tail theory of the internet
6290874 there are lots and lots of small audiences and when you start aggregating those audiences its a really big number
6290875 what were finding here is the template for a business model our advertisers are going to pay attention to in terms of getting a cohesive and holistic experience
6290876 theres always going to be the risk of keeping stickiness
6290877 you have do your homework to make sure youre maintaining user intimacy and the sites viability
6290878 you always have a good chunk of folks who dont make it past the launch of the seasons but the successful ones at the end of the day is why you do it if you launch five niche sites and in six months just two take off you more than make back your money

6290882 im just a cool kid that wants to play football
6290883 i really dont pay attention i just stay focused on what i have to do
6290884 college is kind of far off im just trying to help my team win a state championship
6290885 he put on a special show at the ohio state camp
6290886 i had one contact tell me that he looks like the next guy in line behind osu freshman terrelle pryor
6290887 he just showed that kind of talent and that kind of ability to impact a game on the little bit of tape i saw i could not believe it was a freshman
6290888 hes got the size has a rocket arm is fast strong elusive cool with the ball
6290889 hes a team guy the biggest attribute he has is he wants to get better
6290890 by the time hes a senior if hes not close to being a national type player then something didnt go right hes that caliber of player
6290891 braxton miller could play in the mid american conference right now i think hes that good right now as a sophomore hes one of the best ive seen
6290892 they should look for a playmaker thats what i am
6290893 if i was picking a quarterback in ohio regardless of class it would be braxton miller thats a huge statement hes got physical tools that no one else does
6290894 a professional photographer can produce amazing shots from a crappy disposable camera but a 5 000 camera wont help a beginner make better photos
6290895 dont compare the us market for vas to the indian market
6290896 at this stage were waiting for formal identification procedures to take place before we take the matter any further he told reporters at the scene
6290897 it may have been snagged it may have been under water for a period of time and with the recent rain has just been brought to the surface he said
6290898 its a unity float its a one thats going to really entail and showcase everything that we do all the duties we have as
6290899 the acquisition of the major businesses of coles target kmart and officeworks has materially expanded wesfarmers operations scale and engagement in australian retailing
6290900 significant financial human and infrastructure resources have been committed to bring about a material repositioning and performance improvement in these businesses over the coming years
6290901 a significant amount has been achieved since we acquired the group last november
6290902 since the acquisition of coles there has been significant reductions in above store employee numbers the appointment of new management teams and development of five year plans and budgets all of which are continuing to lay the foundations for improved performance and dismantle barriers to growth results for the food and liquor business for the seven months reflect the fact that we are still in the early stages of a five year turnaround
6290903 as weve said previously the changes wont suddenly be obvious on a particular day or date but i continue to strongly believe that the results of progress made to date and the strategies being planned will deliver value to our shareholders and our customers
6290904 that working with isps to educate consumers is a more effective way of combating illegal downloading
6290905 are rational people who use terrorism primarily to develop strong affective ties with fellow terrorists
6290906 i hope this will send a message of peace to my country after 30 years of war
6290907 we re very surprised at their attitude because even before they left the country they knew they were entitled to 100 a day
6290908 of course we are proud of our athletes that goes without saying said a team spokesman who wouldnt identify himself he then hung up and didnt answer repeated calls
6290909 we are talking with legislative leaders now about the possibility of having a special session possibly at the end of september to deal with some of these issues
6290910 as i talk with people in new hampshire they are interested in this issue more than any other
6290911 they are already concerned about the high cost of heating their homes
6290912 lets close the windows on these homes before we start pouring more fuel oil out through the window
6290913 thats really the goal of it to see that these homes for our low income people in particular are protected and this can save money in the long run
6290914 i think that money should be used for the issue that it is intended
6290915 i was in bed i wasnt in massachusetts i certainly didnt do this
6290916 i had nothing to do with these homicides nope no way
6290917 i did not want the zammitti family thinking anything like that people were saying that i did it
6290918 you tell one lie and you have to tell another lie
6290919 gaining an edge is critical in a tight economy the challenge is standing out in a crowd in a positive way going too far can backfire
6290920 write a prompt thank you note and summarize why you are so well qualified for this job and how enthusiastic you are about the opportunity to go the extra mile have thank you cards with you write it in the lobby of the building after your meeting and go back to the receptionist to drop it off for delivery
6290921 bring a professional portfolio of your work dont just talk about what you have accomplished show them
6290922 if you discussed a particular issue or challenge during your interview follow up with some ideas and further thinking on to topic be careful not to be presumptuous but let them know you are still thinking about it
6290923 if you see a relevant article related to something you discussed send it as a follow up with a short note attached
6290924 know your audience and the position you are applying for if the position requires significant creativity be more creative in your response play off analogies used in your discussion if they want someone who can hit a homerun send a note with a baseball
6290925 network like crazy find everyone you know who works at the company and ask them to put in a good word with the hiring manager on your behalf
6290926 weve got to get better because you never stay the same you get better or worse
6290927 they were good last year and gave us everything we wanted last year with a backup quarterback
6290928 hes doing great wouldnt you 60 million richer hes doing wonderful
6290929 i think weve been on our heels definitely these last two preseason games
6290930 not from the scoreboard but just from the play within the games were behind and we need to pick it up
6290931 it looked like a completely different team out there against tampa bay and how they were ready and we werent they treated it like a game and we went out there treating it as a scrimmage
6290932 so we cant do anything about that we have to get better as a team without him
6290933 im not saying i went out there and every run was the best i ran hard and did the best with the carries i had but i still have room to get better
6290934 its a good time for the team to really jell together because after the third one its two more weeks and youre playing for real
6290935 i have set before you life and death blessings and curses now choose life so that you and your children may live and that you may love the lord listen to his voice and hold fast unto him
6290936 were getting fairly close to getting clearance in terms of him getting his visa meehan said i would think by the end of the next week hell get it thats the last conversation i had with a contract at the u s embassy
6290937 looked up the translation of nikita filatovs name nikita means inconquerable filat or filatov means god guard inconquerable god guard not a bad name
6290938 he fights with zero defense and welcomes punches to his face with a big smile his warrior spirit is reminiscent to that of his deceased indian warrior heroes crazy horse sitting bull and geronimo
6290939 the 5 hole cbj news and notes 8 19 08
6290940 is to help them return to full productive lives through work
6290941 employers offer pay raises not to keep up with inflation but to attract talent and reward productivity
6290942 this is the next frontier in assuring workplaces are safe
6290943 unless some kind of miracle happens i dont see it
6290944 its not just for me but for the people you drive
6290945 we feel our health benefits and sick leave benefits are competitive and we feel good about it
6290946 very often these are the jobs where people are living very close to the bone
6290947 workers are sometimes putting their jobs on the line because they have a sick child or are sick
6290948 if we live in a society where all adults are working then we need to have a workplace to accommodate that reality
6290949 theres been some concern that employees are abusing the ordinance theres been a little bit of that but not as widespread as people thought at the beginning
6290950 hes gotten bigger and stronger and his velocity has increased dramatically in the last five or sixth months neverett said
6290951 and i think what a lot of coaches like is his ability to throw three pitches for strikes
6290952 in terms of polish i think hes ahead of the curve for a pitcher just going into his senior year im thrilled for him because i know how hard hes worked
6290953 i think he saw me pitch four or five times feehan said
6290954 they want he to get bigger and stronger to maintain the velocity on my fastball
6290955 i see him as a very successful starting pitcher once he gets down there they are just converting to a division i school and wont be eligible for the ncaa regionals for the next three years
6290956 i think he saw me pitch four or five times feehan said
6290957 they want he to get bigger and stronger to maintain the velocity on my fastball
6290958 i see him as a very successful starting pitcher once he gets down there
6290959 hi ty this is phil how much did you want again
6290960 i checked those schools out but i was born to be a buckeye
6290961 weve gotten a lot of work done in the preseason and hopefully its going to turn out good for us
6290962 we had one of the best running games in the conference last year
6290963 hopefully were going to build on that and make it one of the best in the state
6290964 it worked for florida maybe it will work for havelock
6290965 i think weve got a good chance to win the conference and go pretty deep in the playoffs if we can just stay focused
6290966 i think most of us are where we need to be to do that
6290967 it gave them a sense of how its going to be during games so they wont be as nervous in their first game
6290968 they could have just as easily been 7 4 last year if not for turning it over
6290969 if you have less than two turnovers a game on offense youre going to have a chance to win every friday night
6290970 ive just got that feeling like were going to take it all this year just like i had in that state championship game last year
6290971 i want to get used any way i can whether its running whether its passing if ive got to block whatever i can do to help us win im doing
6290972 j d is not quite as fast but hes still a good runner
6290973 tyrells got a strong arm but maybe not quite as accurate as j d both of them look good running the offense were comfortable with both of them being in there
6290974 weve got good players weve just got to get some experience
6290975 after those first two games we ought to know where we stand
6290976 and thats why we scheduled the way we scheduled so early on well find out where we are
6290977 i can see us going undefeated in the regular season no doubt about that
6290978 i pinched in across the tackle the quarterback scrambled and he had no receivers to go to
6290979 youve got some guys that lead by example then youve got some guys that are verbal leaders always encouraging and motivating he does both
6290980 i dont care if were just going through a walk through drill or a game type situation hes got one speed thats wide open
6290981 he does everything we ask without any kind of hesitation and he does it as hard as he can possibly go and as fast as he can possibly go
6290982 he constantly encourages and demands that his teammates do the same
6290983 they know if theyve got a chance theyve got to go as hard as they can possibly go
6290984 he challenges them every drill every day every snap of the ball its making us a lot better on both sides of the ball
6290985 when he crosses that line on the football field hes able to flip a switch
6290986 he turns into what you want as a football player
6290987 he takes each play as a challenge its him against the world and hes planning on winning
6290988 im a whole lot faster and can get around them and im probably stronger than most of them
6290989 by being a throwing team we kind of lost aggressiveness a little bit
6290990 we have got to get a little more football attitude as far as toughness goes
6290991 i thought we could have advanced a little farther last year
6290992 we are going to try to advance to win a conference championship and advance deep in the playoffs
6290993 i dont see any reason why we cant play for a championship
6290994 hes a savvy football kid and he knows the game
6290995 he understands that he has got to be a leader and he has got a lot of responsibility on his shoulders and i think he is coming along with it
6290996 we are not going to live and die by the run but we have got to gash up inside
6290997 we have got to find kids that take pride in what they are doing and get a little down and dirty
6290998 if our defense stays ferocious they are going to be hard to score on
6290999 we have got to figure out a way to get past the third round
6291000 we still have to prove that just because people are gone we can pull it together and play as a team and do our assignments and get what we have to get done
6291001 i am expecting to see a well disciplined football team with a lot of speed to the ball a good solid offensive unit and an aggressive defense
6291002 we want to make sure we do the small things right
6291003 those were outstanding players but we did have some players behind them that are going to be able to fill in and step up to the plate
6291004 i know it is important for me to daggone be on everybody
6291005 we have got a lot of goals to accomplish and we have got some high standards
6291006 we want to control the ball and the time so weve been really working on our running game this year
6291007 we want to get to the ball a lot more
6291008 we want our athletes on the field to make plays we want to put pressure on the ball we still have some things to work out but we are getting there
6291009 tigers presence enhances any tournament but the playoffs are structured to provide compelling competition even when no 1 or no 2 of the top 10 are out
6291010 i think some people may be surprised at how resilient the game can be
6291011 too bad about the ratings but hes the most recognizable athlete in the world
6291012 if you cant swing a club until after the first of the year i dont know how he makes that one
6291013 the sport has to be ready to accept a different tiger
6291014 to prolong his career he may have to make some concessions he may have to alter his swing somewhat hes going to have to adapt significantly to his situation if he doesnt his career is going to be short lived
6291015 swing after swing his body has to withstand that one then the next one then the next tournament and the tournament after that
6291016 his knee is a lot older than he is theres very little reserve in that knee
6291017 after what he did at the u s open theyre scratching their heads in wonderment
6291018 having known him nearly 20 years he continues to ask more of himself
6291019 his wrist hurt so badly he shouldnt have played hes really worked hard and changed his body this year he worked out got stronger and hes just now starting to play well in his new body
6291020 i think hes going to be better than hes ever been
6291021 hes not going to be over this injury for another year after he comes back
6291022 theres no way to short cut it its just a long recovery
6291023 it doesnt matter if youre superhuman it doesnt change the fact
6291024 my expectation is that tiger will come back better than when he left
6291025 i know tiger woods i know how determined he is
6291026 its not a real bold prediction when i say hes going to be better when he won the u s open on one leg i mean its not like im going out on a limb or anything hell come back dont worry
6291027 a number of companies rely heavily on attracting workers outside of new hampshire and go to great lengths to present the best face of their company and the area to recruits
6291028 iugo was looking for an opportunity to bolster or expand what those companies were already doing we want to support their efforts by pairing local young professionals with their recruits
6291029 we also recognize that someone who lives say in the lakes region may know nothing about the greater nashua area
6291030 for example our ambassadors could work with st joseph hospital and a candidate from dartmouth college in hanover
6291031 iugo ambassadors could help just as much a small company as a large one if not more so
6291032 a small company doesnt have a large hr budget this is a real cost effective way to expand their recruitment and marketing efforts
6291033 our biggest concern was that companies would feel confident in turning over their candidate to us
6291034 among the questions that came up was how to pair the ambassadors with the candidate so we decided to always have two representatives instead of just one and to always have a man and woman
6291035 its a good win win win companies get assistance in finding new employees the recruits gain a unique perspective of the area from the ambassadors and may have already made a new friend in the area if they decide to move to new hampshire
6291036 this program is unique to new england i havent seen anything like it ive done a cursory look in other parts of the country and didnt see one i would love for it to become a model for other programs

6291040 i just make sure i do the little things once you do the little things all the younger guys will look up to you
6291041 there is a lot of weight on the tailbacks this year we have got to carry our weight
6291042 he is one of the leaders on this football team
6291043 i am hoping to see big things out of him from the tailback position and out of the linebacker position he is a key ballplayer
6291044 he plays good fundamentally sound football plays good disciplined ball and gets to that ball
6291045 i just do my job hit the hole and run like every down is my last because you never know
6291046 it is my last year and i have got to do my thing
6291047 state and nothing less we havent met our full capabilities yet but i think if we keep going at it we will be a championship caliber team
6291048 he would always try to get extra yards so he would always keep it in one arm were teaching him now to carry it high and tight like tiki barber
6291049 its opening up the passing game more and thats taking pressure off me
6291050 its tiring but the conditioning we do in practice prepares us for that
6291051 i want to put pain on him first before he puts it on me basically
6291052 the kids respect rod because he may be doing homework on the bus to a game because his academics are real important to him
6291053 then he can come on the football field turn the academic part down and turn the football up that is when you know you have got something special there
6291054 ive been doing it pretty much all my life since like second or third grade my mom always tells me to keep my head up and keep doing good
6291055 he is a really good football player and he is a great kid to coach
6291056 he is here every day works hard every day is a team leader and just has great character
6291057 he really works hard in the weight room worked on his speed and that is why he is a good football player and leader in the community
6291058 hes a great athlete good cover guy and also good against the run
6291059 he is also an excellent blocker and can catch the ball he is a great all around athlete and he is a very important cog in our offense and defense
6291060 i will just help them focus and lead by example
6291061 if they look at me and see me doing something wrong they are going to think it is ok and do something wrong i have got to do my best at all times
6291062 he leads by example but also he knows how to play the game and can help the younger kids get in the right spots

6291071 i thought it was time i actually saw what it was i was teaching
6291072 just seeing all of that and seeing the prettiest countryside around makes you wonder how people could possibly do something like this and what on earth possessed them
6291073 this is where hitler used to come out and make his speeches to 500 000 people
6291074 the idea is for all of these teachers to visit these sites first hand and get kind of an education for themselves
6291075 i could just imagine being in that striped uniform in january with no coat and freezing to death
6291076 i think its something to impress upon the kids now when theyre young so that when they get older they wont let anything like this happen again
6291077 they really do affect how much income youll have for your family
6291078 the key is dont raise taxes the argument is raise them only on the rich but the owner of a small business is in that category
6291079 dont make the situation worse by raising taxes in any of these areas
6291080 the higher the taxes the less there is to put into a business
6291081 we use the best technology possible to protect the environment

6291088 i think the tools are fine weve handed a stradivarius to a kid after a couple of lessons and we wonder why the violin doesnt sound so good
6291089 the organizational and cultural issues will screw us every time
6291090 the conventional wisdom is if you put another guy back there now youre weak against the run
6291091 but the way we play our safeties we really feel like theyre outside linebackers as well depending on where the ball is going
6291092 that has carried right over into the offseason and through the summer
6291093 it was a little bit of an adjustment for him because it was different than what he played before hes really taken a hold of it and hes one of the guys that understand it to the point that hes correcting other players
6291094 it was good because i had somebody who was better than me
6291095 he taught me a whole lot of stuff so it made me a better player
6291096 we will use a change of pace type of thing but it wont be on any sort of consistent basis
6291097 his arm does his work for him maurice has a pretty decent arm its not as strong as calebs probably not quite as accurate but maurice has wheels to go with that
6291098 working with him some this spring and summer he has kind of come along
6291099 hes one of the fastest kids we have on the team hes got pretty good hands with the offense we were in last year it didnt really give us a chance to bring him into the fold with a kid that can run catch and throw that gives you a lot of options
6291100 a billion here and a billion there and all of sudden its real money

6291149 at the beginning of this process we said we wanted to be as open about these negotiations as we could be and now we have reached a point where the green party caucus has to make a decision about this next tuesday and we would like some feedback from new zealanders before we do
6291150 we set out to achieve a number of things such as including transport and agriculture into the scheme earlier a fund to insulate homes to keep power bills down targets for emissions reduction and support for new innovations that officer significant carbon reduction
6291151 what really mattered about this scheme was that is was fair to new zealanders and effective at reducing greenhouse gas emissions
6291152 on some of the issues we have not been able to make progress
6291153 on the other hand it appears there will be substantial financial assistance to help people make their houses warm and dry
6291154 we are now keen to hear from new zealanders any views they have before we make our decision on tuesday

6291164 may insert is his motion petition complaint or cross complaint a request for allowance of his costs and reasonable attorney fees incurred in such action in ordering the discharge of such party the court may in its discretion award such party his costs and reasonable attorney fees from the amount in dispute which has been deposited with the court at the time of final judgment in the action the court may make such further provision for assumption of such costs and attorney fees by one or more of the adverse claimants as may appear proper
6291165 given that section 386 was amended in 1955 by adding a provision allowing fees to the interpleading party it would be incongruous for the court to allow a party to interplead specific property and cash and allow attorney fees but only for interpleaded cash believe it gives the chancellor equitable authority to allow the stakeholder to be paid for necessary expenses incurred in order to bring the matter to the courts attention
6291166 interpleader fees under the statute must be limited to efforts made in filing the interpleader defending the status of the moving party as an interpleader if such standing is challenged and in obtaining a discharge

6291168 over the course of many years with many ups and many downs stephanie was right by our side unwavering indefatigable
6291169 it was that fighting spirit that allowed stephanie to rise from modest beginnings to succeed in public service to become a one woman force for progress in our country
6291170 it wasnt enough for her just to break barriers in her own life she was also determined to bring opportunity to all those who had been overlooked and left behind and in stephanie they had a fearless friend and unyielding advocate

6291181 just as a trusted computing system will load neither programs nor data files without a validated certificate whose signature matches their contents neither will the secure internet transfer any document in any standard protocol without such a certificate accompanying it
6291182 a documents certificate its imprimatur identifies the person individual or legal entity responsible for its publication provides a signature which permits verifying its contents have not been corrupted or subsequently modified and identifies the document registry which granted the imprimatur and which on demand will validate it and confirm that it has not been revoked
6291183 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers

6291209 at the end of my senior year i got a note written to me from a dave evans a huskies fan who was the senior vice president of marketing for western international
6291210 the only thing i know about hotels is how neat it was to get dressed up get on a charter and travel to places
6291211 ive taken that way of being a quarterback in the way of managing a hotel
6291212 the quarterback needs to know enough about what every position does a quarterback knows what the tackle is doing like a gm has to know what the kitchen is doing what the housekeeping department is doing
6291213 hes proud of what he does he almost fought to have the team stay at his hotel
6291214 that joy that love that passion for the huskies it comes through thats the message he gave our guys you could just feel it
6291215 the truth is we were a mediocre team and i was a mediocre player
6291216 however we still had the husky pride even though the program was on a downturn and pretty much everybody knew it was going to be jim owens last year what i really remember and held onto we were still huskies when you played the husky team you knew you were going to get hit
6291217 i was on the sidelines a few times and i can just see what coach willingham is trying to bring back
6291218 we all know the problems the program has been though the last five six years there are a lot of things that needed to be overcome emotionally
6291219 this year is truly a pivotal year of bringing many many things together and installing per player this husky pride i really believe willingham and his coaches are bringing that back where it just becomes part of your nature part of your character
6291220 this is the second reduction in fixed rate home loan interest rates by the commonwealth bank since 11 august 2008 and reflects the recent reduction in wholesale funding costs for our fixed rate home loans the bank said
6291221 the rba has not announced any reduction in the official cash rate at this time and we cannot speculate on what they will do commonwealth said in a statement today
6291222 it is in our interest to pass on as much as we can to our customers and to remain competitive

6291226 unfortunately australia doesnt have much data coming out so we took direction from the us dollar and commodity prices
6291227 although the us economy is weaker it does seem the global markets are pricing in a loosening of monetary policy with the european central bank the reserve bank of australia and the reserve bank of new zealand
6291228 although the news is still grim for the us the rest of the world is starting to catch up
6291229 its a very striking confirmation of something that has been suspected for quite some time
6291230 the placenta is very sensitive to stress hormones in the mother these hormones were probably amplified during the time of the war
6291231 what we have here is confirmation that it really is a major factor
6291232 if it has been shown that wars can impact a babys brain development in this way then it follows that other types of stress like domestic violence severe anxiety bereavement or other types of loss could have the same effect
6291233 i have a couple of agents interested in my book and im not sure what to do any thoughts
6291234 there arent that many original ideas out there but this is one
6291235 the brick walls are there for a reason right the brick walls are not there to keep us out the brick walls are there to give us a chance to show how badly we want something because the brick walls are there to stop the people who dont want it badly enough
6291236 something in us does not believe we can survive fundamental changes in
6291237 the preference for us is to have juan in there because of the experience and so far were on track to do that
6291238 its still too early to say who will be the starter but im very confident and comfortable with where he is today
6291239 it was more of a scare than anything hes fine
6291240 juan is like a brother to me i dont even want to talk about it
6291241 ikehara still has a lot to learn but hes been doing some good things
6291242 hes a good football player very aggressive hes been getting in the mix

6291244 we had them announce their name and school they played with in college getting back in the huddle as the new guys but those guys are professional and obviously with those guys getting out there were a better team
6291245 he has a routine hes in and pretty much thats going to be it hes taking all the walkthrough stuff and backup jim sorgi s taking the regular part of practice he manning is here and involved and doing fine
6291246 weve kind of talked through that with bob sanders as well right now it looks like bobs on schedule to play a little bit this week well see how the week goes we may hold him and have some guys who get their work on the following thursday
6291247 right now hes doing the walkthrough stuff so well see what happens from there he has been more patient with this than maybe a lot of things and hes doing fine
6291248 thats got to mean a lot to him just to get out there and be mobile and see everyone
6291249 i think that definitely helps him its got to be tough for him its been a long tough month for him and just to be out there on the field has to make him feel good and hopefully get him that much closer well wait and see
6291250 i know he wants to make that next step and get back in the huddle hes doing well but like he told you guys its been tough theres no denying thats basically what it is its not something hes had to face in his career so its a new thing for him but hes handling it very well and his attitude is whats going to get him through this and it has been very good
6291251 were just going to kind of take that as it comes
6291252 neither guy is cleared to go yet so were just proceeding forward
6291253 when local employees are organized into a team there will be a tendency for talking rather than listening this talking should not be mistaken for interaction little cooperation will occur and plans often will fail because team members will not be inclined to follow team rules

6291258 xbox is a natural partner to help us reach out to youth voters

6291261 whenever theres a corrupt system then youre going to have these birds of prey descend on it to get their share of the spoils
6291262 let me just begin by saying that to save you some time im not going to comment on the vice president
6291263 i point out what my record is which is one that has not won me miss congeniality over the years
6291264 people want change in america we all know that and very legitimately so
6291265 i would not allow anyone who worked for my administration to go back to lobbying
6291266 i have and continue to question his judgment whether it be his initial reaction to the russian invasion of georgia or whether it be his failure to acknowledge that the surge has succeeded or his opposition to nuclear power among others
6291267 so i question the judgment i dont question the patriotism
6291268 it would be important to have some kind of framework for the meeting in other words there would have to be some kind of predetermined at least outcome about some aspects of the meeting for example some progress in some area that was agreed upon earlier the reagan gorbachev et cetera it would have to be something besides just a quote meeting
6291269 some people are wealthy and rich in their lives and their children and their ability to educate them others are poor if theyre billionaires
6291270 but the fact is that they are the symptom of a disease
6291271 as long as you have earmarking and pork barrel spending and
6291272 so its kind of entertaining to me to attack the lobbyists rather than the source of the problem which is the earmark theyd all be out of business most of em would be out of business if we stopped pork barrel and earmark spending
6291273 as you know i have condemned the commercials invoking obama pastor the that were done by various people

6291278 our focus at the denver super rally will be to expand the debates beyond just two parties
6291279 its an issue of central concern to many americans and extends far beyond any one candidate it is a first amendment matter of speech petition and assembly during a presidential election for both the candidates and the voters
6291280 my apology to ralph nader for not demanding that he be included in the debates
6291281 i met with sean penn and we talked at length
6291282 he was very clear that he is not currently planning to endorse any candidate in the general election but that he has serious concerns about the state of presidential debates he did support kucinich in the primaries and saw how dennis was excluded from msnbc debates

6291286 a key pillar of the u s strategy to pacify iraq is in danger of collapsing
6291287 we cannot stand them and we detained many of them recently
6291288 many of them were part of al qaida despite the fact that many of them are helping us to fight al qaida
6291289 if they disband us now i will tell you that history will show we will go bacck to zero i will not give up my weapons i will never give them up and i will carry my weapon again if it is useless to talk to the government i will be forced to carry my weapons and my pistol
6291290 what has been achieved is substantial but it is also reversible
6291291 first the sunni awakening which preceded the surge second the sadr cease fire third sectarian cleansing that left much of baghdad segregated with fewer targets to shoot or bomb these tactical gains are relative violence is now where it was in 2005 and spiking up again iraq is still incredibly dangerous and despite what the president says very far from normal and these gains are fragile awakening members frustrated at the governments refusal to integrate them into the national security forces could turn their guns back on us
6291292 you are asking us for millions more to pay off the militias and by the way i have an article here that says maliki recently told a london paper that he was concerned about half of them
6291293 why dont you ask the iraqis to pay the entire cost of that progam
6291294 to support the iraqi government in its battle with all outlaw groups thats a pretty expansive commitment
6291295 there is no iraqi government that we know of that will be in place a year from now half the government has walked out we want to normalize a government that really doesnt exist
6291296 given the fact that the maliki government doesnt represent a true coalition wont this agreement make it appear we are taking sides in the civil war especially when most iraqi parliamentarians have called for a withdrawal of troops
6291297 that over the past five years the united nations has continued to help the people of iraq and others throughout the world who suffer from violence disease and want

6291303 taha dria a shiite lawmaker from diyala who was not in the government compound during the raid said the armed forces were from iraqs emergency response unit an american trained unit similar to u s special forces
6291304 they were wearing khaki their weapons were american the humvees they used looked american they didnt have any ranks on their shoulders they didnt talk
6291305 these special forces work with the americans they are not associated with the ministry of defense they have goals and they didnt inform anyone else
6291306 both men arrested are sunni muslims and the iraqi islamic party the largest sunni party in the country immediately condemned the raids as part of a sectarian campaign by the largely shiite muslim security forces

6291430 wait until you see what ive got on the other end of this rod
6291431 i was pretty sure i was going to lose it
6291432 i was hoping i would hang on to it long enough for alyssa to see it when she did she squealed so much it took off on its last run
6291433 that sort of surprised me there i didnt think it was that big a deal
6291434 however if their needs do change well make accommodations to assist them to do their jobs or to improve the processes that affect their work particularly where safety is concerned

6291436 i predicted new orleans would come back as a stronger and better city we helped deliver 126 billion in taxpayer money
6291437 who would have thought three years after the storm the president could come and say new orleans la
6291438 i think the message here today is hope is being restored hope is coming back
6291439 im thinking hes done the best that he could but we have to deal with all the different layers that come down under him through the feds the state the local level
6291440 we will do what it takes we will stay as long as it takes to help citizens rebuild their communities and their lives
6291441 the promise is still unfulfilled as far as im concerned
6291442 let no one suffer the illusion that 126 billion has gone straight to where it is needed and where it belongs
6291443 but things are better here on the gulf coast of mississippi

6291450 okay the cars banged up but this could be much worse no one looks to be hurt
6291451 were seeing that when these ceramic flat irons are used at the highest heat settings and on a daily basis to achieve straight hair they can really take a toll on the structure of the hair and cause very noticeable problems that can be hard to repair
6291452 if you look at the sales statistics you see that people are pursuing straighter hair with more vigour
6291453 most people on tv and in films have straight hair and its a trend the public is trying to emulate
6291454 the problem starts when they do it wrong or too frequently and they cause a real mess that takes a long time to fix
6291455 if you want to join the trend fine but do it with common sense or you could wind up with massive damage
6291456 in principle we say yes we have not thought about it yet nor have we been offered in any case all projects of this type must be studied by our military experts when all is decided we will make a public announcement
6291457 but that had nothing to do with the missile shield just russia had offered to us various types of weapons to buy and the iskander question was raised among other requests however in the context we speak of we have not been asked anything of the kind
6291458 our position is of availability to the cooperation with russia in whatever can consolidate its security
6291459 must think of response measures if it finds itself trapped in a circle
6291460 buying weapons is very important various obstacles however rise from time to time often bureaucratic or regarding delays related to the production also financial problems are created at times i think we should speed up
6291461 it just comes down to the moment and i tried my best
6291462 its very nerve wracking i know i can do better
6291463 i dont know if it was so much pressure it was just expectation on myself and i didnt handle it very well
6291464 theres a big negative feedback loop and theres no way out of it
6291465 as the stock falls more and more its more likely the government steps in and more likely equity holders get wiped out
6291466 they havent offered anything and we havent asked for anything
6291467 they cant keep playing games with the accounting rules to avoid taking their losses
6291468 it could be tomorrow it could be six months from now
6291469 you know youre right im just going to give you the scoop right now
6291470 i dont honor his policies i dont honor his politics
6291471 theyll say hes young hes got a funny name hes not patriotic
6291472 let me tell you first what i wont do i wont hand over my energy policy to my vice president and not know necessarily what hes doing
6291473 my vice president will be a member of the executive branch he wont be one of these fourth branches of government where he thinks hes above the law
6291474 jesus wants his religion back and he wants it back from the orthodox the bible believing and the defenders of faith as much as from anyone else so it can be for the world again
6291475 ive been in the god business for more than thirty years never have i seen or personally experienced such anger or angst over what it means to be associated with jesus of nazareth if my fascination with jesus had started today rather than so many years ago i wonder what i would do with it how would i begin to pursue faith today

6291500 i have never suggested that sen mccain picks his positions on national security based on politics or personal ambition i have not suggested it because i believe that he genuinely wants to serve americas national interest now its time for him to acknowledge that i want to do the same
6291501 sen obama got a little testy on this issue he said i was questioning his patriotism let me be clear i am not questioning his patriotism i am questioning his judgment
6291502 the bottom line is that sen obamas words for all their eloquence and passion dont mean all that much
6291503 and then the shrill ringing of an incoming skype call halted the phantom of the opera soundtrack thatd been playing on my itunes
6291504 later that evening i gingerly opened my inbox to an apologetic e mail

6291524 please be assured that we share your love for harry potter and would certainly never do anything to hurt any of the films over the past 10 years we have nurtured and protected each film and the integrity of the books upon which they are based to the best of our ability
6291525 if i may offer a silver lining there would have been a two year gap between half blood prince and the much anticipated first part of harry potter and the deathly hallows which opens in november 2010
6291526 two thirds of the worlds goods are moved by sea

6291528 when the market is concerned about a recession they can be volatile on the downside
6291529 there are many things we do not know about the future
6291530 but one thing we do know is that business as usual will not continue for much longer will the change come because we move quickly to restructure the economy or because we fail to act and civilization begins to unravel
6291531 roughly one third of the current u s military budget or one sixth of the global military budget
6291532 the choice is ours yours and mine we can stay with business as usual and preside over an economy that continues to destroy its natural support systems until it destroys itself or we can adopt plan b and be the generation that changes direction moving the world onto a path of sustained progress
6291533 if your god is the ever present god then you can worship god anywhere you dont have to worship in the place he has appointed you dont have to assemble with his people or be so narrow in your worship moses save your self the trouble of going into the wilderness i will allow you to sacrifice to your god right here in egypt
6291534 i will let you go that ye may sacrifice to the lord your god in the wilderness only ye shall not go very far away
6291535 i dont mind if you go worship just dont go to that place where the lord commanded you to go
6291536 ex 10 11 the lord jesus christ will not lose one for whom he died every elect blood bought man woman and child shall be brought into his presence in glory therefore again moses refused pharaohs offer so finally pharaoh gives moses his best offer yet
6291537 life can only be understood backwards but it must be lived forwards
6291538 i just saw this on a map and thought id get out and see it
6291539 we get a lot of race fans here on mondays when theyre heading home

6291544 but the people on my team are bowling seriously they want to win
6291545 you always like to win even though its for fun its a great cause and all but i want to walk away with the trophy when i get old i want to have a collection of them
6291546 im in my charity mode im giving my charitable effort
6291547 i just came out to help a good cause and to watch my son bowl a couple of gutter balls
6291548 competition brings out the competitiveness it comes out no matter what you do
6291549 i know how darryl motley felt when the royals won the world series
6291550 everybody is here to give to a good cause not to bowl good but i tried the best i could
6291551 we do a lot of work but we believe in having a lot of fun also
6291552 when we close down at the end of the day everybody is ready to just have a good time
6291553 i think that it will be a political challenge to deal with

6291556 i think things have moved far enough along and our neighboring cities are making that move so that we can go for a total ban

6291558 a priest is ordained with the privilege of celebrating the churchs sacraments by nothing less than a holy order

6291593 el pueblo boliviano quiere cambios profundos en lo estructural en lo pol tico especialmente y por eso yo llego a la conclusi n que el pueblo boliviano quiere autonom as quiere una nueva constituci n pol tica del estado boliviano
6291594 ese apoyo ese acto masivo para apostar al cambio en democr cia pac ficamente
6291595 m s de dos tercios del pueblo boliviano quiere juntar la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado boliviano y los estatutos auton micos
6291596 garantizar autonom as para toda bolivia pero en el marco de la legalidad
6291597 se ha presentado una propuesta que est en un documento que es de orden p blico que recoge en primer lugar la necesidad de incorporar en una nueva cpe el tema de las autonom a fue ratificado y se alado claramente que hoy m s que nunca estamos dispuestos a extender las autonom as a los nueve departamentos de nuestro pa s
6291598 estamos de acuerdo en cuales son los temas por discutir pero no estamos de acuerdo en los contenidos y como los vamos a resolver la puerta del dialogo debe quedar abierta porque bolivia necesita esto y es un deber hacerlo
6291599 im sorry to call so late but would you please call me back i need your advice

6291602 improving sexual health is a government health priority so increasing the range of condoms available can only be good in terms of encouraging safe sex practices
6291603 condoms are already funded and always have been this decision sees a 10 percent price reduction for all condoms which frees up funds that can be used to purchase other new medicines
6291604 morally bankrupt and an insult to people with breast cancer high blood pressure and heart disease
6291605 at a time when pharmac cant find funding for sufferers of breast cancer heart disease high blood pressure and other serious problems that they can find funding to subsidise flavoured condoms
6291606 this is simply about funding sexual behaviour that shouldnt be at the cost of the taxpayer or other more life threatening medication
6291607 sigh i just want to get to the point where running 4 5 or 6 miles isnt going to feel like a total tedium
6291608 what were seeing now is a clear regrouping and also again some kind of deception campaign saying look were moving out
6291609 they are going around now and trying to grab new strategic areas in georgia
6291610 we still believe this is not all that this is just a beginning
6291611 dreaming to turn my country into chechnya into some kind of insurgency warfare field where they go around and operate with brutal force
6291612 the last thing im worried about is about my political future right now
6291613 to laugh often and much to win the respect of intelligent people and the affection of children to earn the appreciation of honest critics and endure the betrayal of false friends to appreciate beauty to find the best in others to leave the world a bit better whether by a healthy child a garden patch or a redeemed social condition to know even one life has breathed easier because you have lived this is to have succeeded
6291614 you are not limited on what kind of jobs you have
6291615 i decided i would give it away because it was given to me in hopes it would help me straighten my life out
6291616 it seemed to be the only right thing to do that for someone else

6291620 with illinois vest a dog we now have the availability to put dogs in the proper setting safe and protected
6291621 it was a milestone that never in my wildest dreams did i think it would turn into the rewarding job that it is
6291622 when we first started out we wondered where we would find a police dog and how to get started but now we have donors and police dogs
6291623 whenever we had a suspicious package we had to find the nearest police dog in that geographical area
6291624 we were able to see how beneficial the dogs were
6291625 i thought it would be a great pastime in retirement but its now a full time job
6291626 it becomes almost like a family between the donors and the dog each one has a personal story especially when donors honor someone or do it in memory of someone
6291627 the bride and groom chose to vest a police dog instead of spending money flowers at the reception the bridge made a speech and we had the dog and its handler walk into the reception
6291628 i want to make sure the animals are protected as well as the officers
6291629 if judge burnett or the state doesnt want to hear this evidence then well be happy to move on to federal court so we just keep moving
6291630 im just certain that the evidence is sound and good and when september 8th does come around im hoping that the judge will hear it and hear it all
6291631 its disturbing to me as a citizen of arkansas that hes not taking this more seriously and hes not up on it
6291632 this is 15 years the evidence is overwhelming take the time look at this give us a fair trial we will win if you give us a fair trial
6291633 it pretty much said that they didnt have enough to convict these three men or teenagers at the time and it was up to him to convince the jury to convict thats substantial information and something that the court should take very seriously
6291634 thats disturbing thats very disturbing this is important three young men have been wrongfully incarcerated for 15 years and thats disturbing that the information was there and he wasnt aware of it
6291635 he was asking this little rock attorney when is somebody going to bring up the confession when can i bring up the confession i need this to convince my fellow jurors to convict
6291636 damien is hopeful and he is strong we are both just gearing up for the next few months hes doing better than he probably has in a long time
6291637 i went cougar hunting last night i scored two 2 numbers and went home with one of them

6291639 looking at the restricted business of films till weekend and the slump that follows on weekdays a new set of movies should start releasing from monday onwards hopefully the business on weekdays would rejuvenate things and infuse life in business
6291640 for example i see a lot of people here rather kind on ranbir and bah which seems a little mystifying
6291641 but then you can not deny the fact som that an unprecedented 5 week clean run to ja came in
6291642 success of a movie not just depends upon the stars it got merit of the movie but on so many
6291643 personally i am sure dostana is going to suck bigtime
6291644 we are very fortunate to sign a player of theos caliber
6291645 he is a consummate professional both on the court and off who will provide us with additional depth in the front court while also serving as a mentor to some of our younger players

6291655 exploring going into the oil business in iraq and kazakhstan
6291656 consortium founded by turkish company ak group international potential backers include two turkish companies as well as kazakhstan
6291657 aks chief executive is aydan kodaloglu who like mr perle has been involved with the american turkish council an advocacy group in washington
6291658 serves as a board member of the american turkish council
6291659 while the atc is an association in name and in charter the reality is that it and other affiliated associations are the us government

6291663 the central asia islamization cocktail mosques madrassas heroin amp terrorism
6291664 control of central asia particularly the oil and gas wealth as well as the strategic value of the region
6291665 this started more than a decade long illegal covert operation in central asia by a small group in the us intent on furthering the oil industry and the military industrial complex using turkish operatives saudi partners and pakistani allies furthering this objective in the name of islam
6291666 this is why i have been saying repeatedly that these illegal covert operations by the turks and certain us persons dates back to 1996 and involves terrorist activities narcotics weapons smuggling and money laundering converging around the same operations and involving the same actors
6291667 and one last thing take a look at the people in the state secrets privilege gallery on my website and you will see how these individuals can be traced to the following turkey central asia pakistan and saudi arabia and the activities involving these countries
6291668 centrism is the philosophy of the american media and that essentially backs the status quo when youre a centrist and this game of objectivity that they play is really limited by parameters that youre allowed to ask questions and to investigate and in a sense then youre transmitting these assumptions and reinforcing every day that the us is really a functioning democracy not even a representative democracy and as we know of course there are oligarchic interests that buy off congress that puts the person in the whitehouse that they need

6291689 show that while china has now proven it is able to host international events to perfection it still has a long way to go before it respects even minimal international human rights standards
6291690 china is riding roughshod over its promises to allow lawful protests during the games
6291691 in china like in other countries to apply for a demonstration you have to obey the law
6291692 wipe off the equipment when you are done using it using a clean towel or paper towels not your sweaty body towel i usually use a small towel saturated in germicide from the spray bottles
6291693 inspect all of the retaining walls on the northeast connector of the pennsylvania turnpike
6291694 police are very impressed with the pairs bravery in the face of such a violent attack and without their intervention the woman could have died
6291695 the olympic final in 2004 i think damaged me psychologically
6291696 thats the hardest race ive ever done in my life i dont think ive been able to dig as deep since then it was really pretty deep
6291697 its probably something i havent been able to deal with for the last four years its been on my mind and pressured me a lot because i know how much you have to step up
6291698 ive tried to step everything up so by doing that ive probably over baked everything a little bit
6291699 this whole experience has taught me a lot more respect for what i had achieved i think i was pretty young and naive and idealistic about how i wanted things to go
6291700 thats why people cant appreciate why we get quite intense about it
6291701 its four years of my life and it hasnt always been a bundle of joy
6291702 getting so close to the world champs at poznan after paddling five times together was a bit of a pickup for us
6291703 were paddling really well together im confident about what we can do now weve had more racing
6291704 we are sick of the dunedin community and students being seen to be part of this
6291705 these groups need to understand that drunken parties which predictably lead to street violence and property damage is not acceptable its just bloody stupid
6291706 it is purely poorly organised public disorder and anyone guilty in such illegal activities should be punished to the full extent
6291707 how would christchurch students feel if we went up to their city burned cars couches and caused violence on their city streets
6291708 we would rightly never be allowed back yet somehow they believe its alright to do in dunedin
6291709 i expected it to be more high pointed than that but it was the first game of the day and i think i was a bit nervous
6291710 now ive gained my confidence im warmed up so hopefully ill do better in the next game which is bit tougher than this one
6291711 fitness is the main key for this game and confidence too if they kick once i have to kick twice
6291712 our modelling is from a conservative basis and errs in new zealands favour but it still confirms with new zealands current tax regime that leaving the money in australia would provide a better financial return
6291713 we welcome the closer alignment that makes it easier for new zealanders to re claim their retirement savings if they choose to however the only advantage of moving money from australia back to nz is a desire to manage all your retirement assets in one place
6291714 alignment of the tax rates within the pie regime or having a preferred tax rate as mercer has called for is critical to supporting new zealanders manage their finances save for their future and to encourage them to repatriate their capital back to new zealand
6291715 standardising the tax rate at 17 percent which is a weighted average of the new 12
6291716 if further tax changes are not made new zealand risks suffering from net migration of both capital and people to australia
6291717 it usually starts out with one of the kids and then we get a dad and mom weve got a grandfather out here racing its a lot of fun
6291718 every week i look forward to doing that riding more than anything i think
6291719 we have four horses five llamas a small herd of sheep three peacocks 13 dogs nine cats clarabelle and her calf guinea hens geese chickens and turkeys a pen of rabbits and about 150 goats maybe more ive lived here since i was a baby
6291720 this guy is the runt of a set of triplets
6291721 this is my career not my husbands although he helps me with big projects such as fencing and big tractor work when hes in town
6291722 our dream was to have a place where our children could have animals and enjoy the wildlife as we have added gardens pastures paddocks and pens the animals came at first we took baby animals into school then we started selling our products at farmers markets we found a real need for people to buy more of their food from local farmers
6291723 chickens are raised for meat or eggs we get eight to ten dozen a day usually lamb for meat and sheep for wool
6291724 the goats have turned out to be my passion our blood lines for them are the best we can produce
6291725 we cross breed using artificial insemination with the best semen we can buy these boers are our meat goats the saanens are swiss dairy goats the nigerian dwarf goats are dairy goats too and their milk has a very high butterfat we raise the angoras for their fiber
6291726 we sell our soap as a fundraiser so we can put up a creamery where we can make aged raw milk goat cheese
6291727 some people refer to goats as nanny and billy i think thats insulting these animals are ewes and bucks and kids goats are smart ours all have names and will come when you call them
6291728 last summer a customer stopped by the farmers market and bought goat meat for the first time the next week they returned and complained we thought it would be gamey they said it was much too tender and it tasted like veal
6291729 they live on organic pasture and they want it to be waist high too they eat clover blackberry leaves alfalfa sunflowers why wouldnt their meat be good and flavorful
6291730 we harvest goats from four months and up different people want them at different ages some want them young and still on mothers milk some want an older male
6291731 after meat animals are slaughtered butchered and packaged the hides are tanned and returned to the farm
6291732 but my strongest market and most of my sales are to fairly well to do suburban wasps in their 40s and 50s
6291733 my mother used to buy cakes from guenthers bakery in braddock one was rainbow cake which consisted of different layers such as banana cherry yellow and chocolate with a delicious icing the other cake was called pineapple fondant cake it was a moist yellow cake covered with a marshmallow icing and a light fondant glaze topped with a pineapple ring both were fantastic cakes i was hoping to find the recipes
6291734 years ago i found a recipe on the back of a heinz ketchup label for gingered meatballs it called for ketchup ginger ale and ground ginger i cant find the recipe does a reader have that old ketchup label
6291735 theyre all competitive so theyre telling me theyre going to have the highest score tonight and everything and its just awesome
6291736 i just know we had to try to do something and i think the players and the staff all felt the same way
6291737 it just goes to show what kind a person coach rodriguez is i mean he came up with this all on his own and the staff theyve been there for me and my family since day one so it feels amazing to have their support
6291738 today is just a day where when coach told us this was going to happen we sleep a little bit better
6291739 capretto is what we called goats and i grew up with them
6291740 i helped my grandmother milk them and she would make ricotta and fresh cheese from the milk
6291741 for me capretto is one of the most delicious meats i love eating it and i love cooking it as a professional chef i need to butcher it so the meat is evident and not entangled and attached to the bones thats to facilitate it for the guests but the bones are where it is the sweetest capretto has no excess fat but it has a lot of cartilage which when cooked makes the meat finger sticking good it is a light meat and as far as texture and mouthfeel are concerned i would consider it almost a white meat
6291742 there is no crime in using caprettos baby lamb rabbits and veal as long as we use every part of the animal
6291743 my dad is here every day im still in college but we are so busy i can take only one class a semester
6291744 we go through about 70 to 80 goats a week
6291745 all the meat is fresh and never more than a week old our goat is locally raised and hormone and steroid free some of the animals are slaughtered in the town of 84 others in sarver whichever is closest for the farmers when demand for animals is high we will buy at the pennsylvania meat auction
6291746 when a customer chooses a cut we pull a carcass then a butcher bones it out and trims it to the thickness or weight to order well even offer advice on how to cook it
6291747 most of our market is international here in oakland one of our early clients was the italian club in the neighborhood
6291748 but now we sell to just about everybody from every background
6291749 its for our safety and security and needless to say its for
6291750 we just want to be safe and throw a broad net
6291751 the idea is if you bring them out of that context over to the u s and you mix them in it shows them that theyre all human beings
6291752 we are the largest overseas provider to the international fund for irelands wider horizons program by a mile
6291753 one of the ways it happens in pittsburgh is getting these kids here now so that when they go back its with new friends to live together and work together
6291754 i like the sales aspect at home im trying to be a bit more hands on here
6291755 its interesting to go out there build up a rapport
6291756 the engine is from germany the body parts are english and bits and pieces are from france
6291757 we have a swiss intern in honolulu and an irish intern in pittsburgh
6291758 even my sisters wouldnt have any friends from the other religion thered be a big stink over that
6291759 i appreciate these kids not only for their work but i feel like im giving back
6291760 the market is tremendous its like a gold rush at the moment there are lots of projects going around and the question is whos going to be first whos going to bring the technology to market and how fast and how much
6291761 speed is for us very important we already have sold products we dont have any alternative production we need to have that plant ready by lets say autumn of next year to really support the world market with the mirrors
6291762 the best values from trusted sellers become better and better
6291763 i have no control i have to comply with anything they choose to do and i have no voice in the matter
6291764 i would be very surprised if shareholders did not raise questions about it
6291765 its a very expensive perk when you figure out the flying costs
6291766 certainly companies are not adding this type of retirement benefit and where they have it they are trying to get out from under it
6291767 perhaps there is a mentality that you cant beat city hall
6291768 im not a crybaby about what goes on in the world
6291769 people like my mom you expect them to be upset people who are doing a lot of saving now versus people who are done saving are two very different groups
6291770 i shop at the 99 cent stores there are ways of saving money
6291771 they grew up with the mentality that you make the best of what is handed to you they dont worry they wont make it to rome or paris this year they will settle for a car trip
6291772 the feds rate cuts geared to aiding ailing homeowners with adjustable rate mortgages have come at the expense of savers and retirees dependent on fixed income
6291773 for the past 12 months there has been a double whammy for savers as interest rates have fallen and inflation has increased
6291774 i was outraged these companies make their decisions and their bets and they should be responsible for that they should not be bailed out on the backs of the taxpayers
6291775 for me i have to use county health care because we dont have any
6291776 every time i go to the doctor thats 65 out of my pocket and 65 if i have to go four times in a month i mean come on
6291777 hopefully with us taking a stand that we are today hopefully it gets a little better
6291778 everybody wants christmas to be a little better in december
6291779 some of the airlines you wouldnt even want to eat their food
6291780 you dont even want to sit in some of the airline seats and its not their fault not the fault of the workers its the fault of the people who run it
6291781 the airlines are not engaged and not showing any respect to these workers
6291782 theres only one thing to do is to get the respect and attention we need to get this contract resolved and thats to strike
6291783 this is a dispute between airline contracted workers and their employers any disruption of passenger service will be punishing to those representing every side of this issue
6291784 we were therefore buried with him through baptism into death in order that just as christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the father we too may live a new life
6291785 in about the time it takes to upload the photos
6291786 writing books is the closest men ever come to childbearing
6291787 recently we discovered that grapefruit and these other fruit juices substantially decrease the oral absorption of certain drugs undergoing intestinal uptake transport
6291788 the concern is loss of benefit of medications essential for the treatment of serious medical conditions
6291789 tak diragukan kalau kampanye untuk mendiskreditkan obama mendatangkan keuntungan untuk mccain saat ini
6291790 heres the new taste sensation your tongue might be able to taste calcium the capability to taste calcium has now been discovered in mice with these rodents and humans sharing many of the same genes the new finding suggests that people might also have such a taste the four tastes we are most familiar with are sweet sour salty and bitter recently scientists have discovered tongue molecules called receptors that detect a fifth distinct taste umami or savory
6291791 so how might the lessons of that fight apply to john mccain and this election how could progressive allies help bat down phony conventional wisdom
6291792 callers did not think they were bound by the do not call list and now they are
6291793 i think the city commission needs to get engaged in this issue
6291794 he turner says hes not required to put it in his ethics statements but theres nothing to prevent him from putting it in his ethics statements
6291795 why not disclose what kind of toilet paper he uses where do you stop
6291796 then all theyve got to do is form a subsidiary and you can conceal anything
6291797 i hope the local democrats are doing more research than just reading the pot smokers magazine
6291798 in the last 14 months the ddn has run 9 articles based on misrepresentation and innuendo attacking my business even though i meet the highest standards for public disclosure and accountability its shameful
6291799 and because mrs turners business is that of communications and her web site is so complete in listing clients and core competencies i find it interesting that this subsidiary is never mentioned
6291800 it seems to represent at best a very serious error in judgment and quite possibly more than that
6291801 lane is a minor who admitted to sergeant trego that he caused both fires in question in his own deposition lane indicated that although he did cause the fire he did not know if the fire was caused intentionally or negligently
6291802 there is still a lot of room for improvement for the final
6291803 i know exactly what ive done wrong so i dont think its going to be something thats going to be hard to change for finals

6291814 in joining the army my son was following in his fathers footsteps before he was born i had served in vietnam as military officers we shared an ironic kinship of sorts each of us demonstrating a peculiar knack for picking the wrong war at the wrong time
6291815 to be fair responsibility for the wars continuation now rests no less with the democrats who control congress than with the president and his party after my sons death my states senators edward m kennedy and john f kerry telephoned to express their condolences stephen f lynch our congressman attended my sons wake kerry was present for the funeral mass my family and i greatly appreciated such gestures but when i suggested to each of them the necessity of ending the war i got the brushoff
6291816 to whom do kennedy kerry and lynch listen we know the answer to the same people who have the ear of george w bush and karl rove namely wealthy individuals and institutions

6291823 there can be no business as usual with russia under present circumstances and the future of our relations will depend on the concrete actions russia will take to honor the words of president medvedev to abide by the six point peace plan which is not happening at the moment which is not happening as we speak he signed together with the president of georgia and which was brokered by the european union presidency france
6291824 it seems like nato is trying to make a victim of an aggressor and whitewash a criminal regime it is trying to save a collapsing regime and is taking a path to the rearmament of the current leaders in georgia
6291825 this is a system that is defensive and is not aimed at anyone it is nonetheless a system that establishes firmly again and reaffirms the strategic cooperation relationship and friendship between poland and the united states
6291826 for all of his talk about following osama bin laden to the gates of hell senator mccain refused to join my call to take out bin laden across the afghan border instead he spent years backing a dictator in pakistan who failed to serve the interests of his own people
6291827 we need to start drilling offshore at advanced oil rigs like this one
6291828 the theory of this data collection is track everyone just in case
6291829 they dont have teeth they dont have money and they dont have a political drive or willpower behind us and this is whats killing mexico and its whats killing mexican journalism is that you create a sense of institutions that end up being like ghost like institutions that dont actually get to the core of changing the problem and this is why we are coming together as an international community to try and work with mexican journalists to try and work with local organizations to change this

6291833 now about 20 to 25 women remain tethered to the bracelets black electronic monitoring devices that dig into the skin of their right ankles leaving dark bruises and painful cuts some women try without success to protect their flesh with makeshift bandages fashioned from bandanas and shorn socks
6291834 and the women who happily embraced hard work are forced to subsist on donations from st bridgets and the local food pantry while they await court dates
6291835 last week the iowa labor commissioners office said an investigation had uncovered 57 cases of child labor law violations at the facility at agriprocessors which has also been cited for numerous safety and health violations the claims have prompted debates among rabbis about kosher laws protections for food workers and how orthodox oversight officials should involve themselves

6291837 if police officers no longer see themselves as engaged in protecting their communities from criminals and instead as domestic intelligence agents working on behalf of the cia they will be encouraged to collect more information it turns police officers into spies on behalf of the federal government
6291838 my friends we have reached a crisis the first probably serious crisis internationally since the end of the cold war this is an act of aggression
6291839 with its actions in recent days russia has damaged its credibility and its relations with the nations of the free world bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the twenty first century
6291840 today we start a new chapter of paraguayan history whose authorities will be relentless against the thieves in their communities
6291841 all the oil paraguay needs in this century venezuela has and venezuela guarantees to supply paraguay right to the last drop for the development of paraguays people industry and agriculture
6291842 just give me 6 yards and catch it make the plays that are there not the wow play every time
6291843 when you start pressing you start making more mistakes the mistakes that are routine then they end up becoming a problem
6291844 im not in the business of impressing people im just a person whos going to keep striving till i get it right im going to be extra hard on myself
6291845 no one is coming in and scoring 18 touchdowns we dont have the offense to do that anyway a lot of guys in college they havent seen the complex coverages they see in this league
6291846 you can be a great talent in college but this game is a whole different aspect there are linebackers covering you defensive ends dropping out safeties constantly rolling you got to have that intelligence to be able to learn and do less thinking as youre route running
6291847 he has a lot of pride and he puts too much pressure on himself
6291848 if he learns to relax and just play he knows the play but he talks himself out of it so theres always doubt when he knows it he plays real fast and you see the skill when hes not sure he looks like a rookie
6291849 i try to stay away from prepping him so much
6291850 you got to learn a lot on the fly the more things he goes through the more hes starting to open up now and come talk to me about different things hes seeing and how hes adjusting
6291851 he gets so down that he ends up frustrating himself
6291852 when i arrived in estonia last week a former soviet republic that lies just south of finland everyone had an opinion on barack obamas speech in berlin
6291853 president bush is committed to a strong pakistan that continues its efforts to strengthen democracy and fight terror president bush appreciates president musharrafs efforts in the democratic transition of pakistan as well as his commitment to fighting al qaeda and extremist groups
6291854 i see that the biggest hurdle in the way of democracy has been removed and i am sure we can get on with solving all the issues of our country the pakistan peoples party is wants to have an independent judiciary and is firm behind that stance and im sure well move forward with that issue as well
6291855 musharrafs quitting was in the air for a long time he has met the fate of all dictators he ruled pakistan for over eight years and i can say that he has not been particularly friendly towards india during this period many of the problems in our bilateral relationship were entirely because of him so his quitting should generally be regarded a good news for india and south asia
6291856 if anyone thinks that they can kill our citizens and escape unpunished we will never allow this if anyone tries this again we will come out with a crushing response and we have all the resources at our disposal for such a response economic political and military

6291858 the indigenous groups have occupied the corral quemado bridge closed the marginal motorway and threatened to shut off the oil and gas pipelines in camisea and the peruvian state cant allow this to happen
6291859 we conserve the environment we are not ignorant we are prepared we know that foreigners want to buy our amazon lands because they know they are the worlds lungs we will not allow this we will die fighting for our rights

6291863 they are being overseen by child psychologists they are being given the best of care
6291864 as a citizen i dont want psychologists your profession is based on a principle of do no harm your job is to help people to serve the public and help distressed people if we have you here that violates your professional ethics of do no harm and its a loss for all of us because we can no longer count on your profession to uphold the highest ethical standards
6291865 other evils there are that may come yet it is not our part to master all the tides of the world but to do what is in us for the succor of those years wherein we are set uprooting the evil in the fields that we know so that those who live after may have clean earth to till what weather they shall have is not ours to rule

6291877 the moon she hangs like a cruel portrait soft winds whisper the bidding of trees as this tragedy starts with a shattered glass heart and the midnightmare trampling of dreams but on no tears please fear and pain may accompany death but it is desire that shepherds its certainty as we shall see
6291878 come back to me i was born in love with thee so why should fate stand inbetween
6291879 he just locks down and cant get the words out
6291880 for such a fine speaker its really quite remarkable that hes had issues
6291881 it wasnt hypothetical they wanted to know what our states conservative base would do how our convention delegation would react and if our state party bylaws would make it difficult to put a non republican on the ballot
6291882 i jokingly asked if this meant they were thinking about mitt romney or mike huckabee for the ticket but it was obvious where they were going it was lieberman
6291883 when i started as a carer i knew it was a hard job but i had no idea that at the end of it i would feel this upset now im absolutely terrified of getting old
6291884 the unending expansion of nato against the backdrop of sweet talk about partnership
6291885 disillusionment means that there are no more false judgments in life to be undeceived by disillusionment may leave us cynical and unkindly severe in our judgments of others but the disillusionment which comes from god brings us to the place where we see men and women as they really are and yet there is no cynicism we have no stinging bitter things to say many of the cruel things in life spring form the fact that we suffer from illusions we are not true to one another as facts we are only true to our ideas of one another everything is either delightful and fine or mean and dastardly according to our idea the refusal to be disillusioned is the cause of much of the suffering in human life
6291886 why in the world do we have these strange false ideas
6291887 we spoke for just a few minutes it was like meeting a complete stranger
6291888 i give him six tasks a day including reading the bible and education
6291889 and hes doing it i just want to show them who i am
6291890 im the witness of jesus not just an instructor so i have to encourage them how how we can change in christ
6291891 theres always a fear that you wont get picked you wont have much support if a coach doesnt like you
6291892 if he was short tempered before a combination of added sex and attention could be making him way more relaxed even downright giddy
6291893 if your guy is suddenly going around all happy and whistling then you need to find out why
6291894 how dare you be happy and it not have to do with me nigga who is you fuckin
6291895 my statement is that despite everything that is gone on that i am standing with todd and shonnah and their family and i will continue to be an associate and family friend and pray for them during this season todd and shonnah and fresh fire have impacted my life greatly and mentored me as a daughter during tough times family stick together and does not run
6291896 we were more looking for a statement with your own personal comments because your personal moral and spiritual integrity is on the line as well as todds because you have supported todd and lakeland it is not just todds personal marriage sexual issues at stake but what went on at lakeland as well before this personal stuff came out eg the numerous lies for instance do you support lies how can you continue to support lies
6291897 nothing but honesty do you truly in your heart of hearts before god honestly think this kira truly
6291898 thats okay go ahead i will go out there with you
6291899 that is what you said yesterday and here you are
6291900 above all i owe an enormous debt of gratitude to clinton
6291901 on the one hand the crude inventory buildup was quite strong but the gasoline draw was also very prominent
6291902 before that meeting were going to get quite a few statements from opec officials expressing opinions in the end i dont expect a production cut but they may push for greater adherence to output quotas
6291903 i think they find health care a sort of squishy bleeding heart kind of issue that doesnt interest them very much
6291904 conservatives are not comfortable talking about this issue and they are trying to survive it
6291905 democrats are trying to win it and as a result conservatives are always negotiating the terms of surrender
6291906 the governments responsibility to make sure that everyone in the united states has adequate health care
6291907 we have become so accustomed to employer provided medical care that we regard it as part of the natural order
6291908 yet it is thoroughly illogical why single out medical care food is more essential to life than medical care why not exempt the cost of food from taxes if provided by the employer
6291909 the problem with large buyers is that they inhibit entrepreneurialism
6291910 that is why we dont have our employers buy our cars or our houses or our clothes
6291911 mandates certainly make health care more comprehensive but they also make it more expensive
6291912 and we know it drives some people out of the market
6291913 guaranteed eligibility no american will be turned away from any insurance plan because of illness or pre existing conditions
6291914 would have to issue every applicant a policy and charge fair and stable premiums that will not depend upon health status
6291915 rather than make people expansive fear makes people contract to hold on to what they have
6291916 heres how i think we should get there i think we need to create a public plan that is superior to any private insurance plan include it in a package that can pass congress as newt gingrich used to say about medicare he wanted it to wither on the vine i want private insurance to wither on the vine
6291917 you need to have an enemy in any battle and there are two enemies i would like to have
6291918 i really dont think we can mandate our way or regulate our way into getting private insurance to operate in a public spirited way
6291919 thats why i didnt jam barack obama on this subject because this subject would tear up the election of 2008
6291920 wed never come out of this alive if we tried to use the presidential election as a forum to determine single payer health care
6291921 youve got to keep your eyes on the prize the first thing is to get one of our people in there that we can come in and talk to him
6291922 i happen to be a proponent of a single payer universal health care plan
6291923 as all of you know we may not get there immediately because first weve got to take back the white house and weve got to take back the senate and weve got to take back the house
6291924 for every eight dollars that people spend in medicare they pay for only one id be very satisfied with that and medicare gives you access to almost any provider its a great system except for young people and my children and grandchildren who are paying the bill what kind of great system is that its an intragenerational shell game
6291925 they do it through rationing care to the sick thats an unacceptable way to control costs
6291926 we do it elsewhere in the economy by letting consumers run loose in the system
6291927 the maytag sitting in your kitchen i think you know more about than the health care outcomes at your local hospital
6291928 i dont think thats because health care is deep dark and mysterious but simply because of the mysterious way weve organized it
6291929 we encourage individuals to think about what they need and then go shopping for it and the internet is obviously a powerful place to do that
6291930 if you are morbidly obese an insurer doesnt have an incentive to permit you to have bariatric surgery because five years from now when youre slim and trim youre likely to be on somebody elses insurance policy
6291931 in a consumer driven market you can have these long term policies because the consumer framework is different
6291932 what we need is a market for sick people in normal markets entrepreneurs go after unmet needs thats how entrepreneurs make money but in health care weve made it very difficult for people to make a profit by meeting the needs of sick people
6291933 the best way to waste your life is by taking notes the easiest way to avoid living is to just watch look for the details report dont participate
6291934 laundry is the only thing that should be separated by color
6291935 f or this reason a man shall leave his father and mother
6291936 what therefore god has joined together let no man separate
6291937 it is not good for the man to be alone i will make him a helper suitable for him
6291938 this is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh because she was taken out of man
6291939 the court finds that domestic abuse has occurred between the parties
6291940 excuse me miss would you please open your mouth wide for me
6291941 lets see how wide we can open our mouths for science
6291942 what will you see when you walk in score board naked women
6291943 this strip club offers the usual smorgasbord of lap dances catwalk routines and maybe some private sessions just bring money lots of it if the girls find out you dont have any green its funny how their interest wanes
6291944 regardless of whatever happens with baseball this property was purchased at a great price and we are getting an adult business offline
6291945 and it benefits the city so we cant be too upset
6291946 i have nothing to compare it to i dont have anything else im still a 20 year old who likes to hang out with my friends but i have had great opportunities
6291947 when i was a kid i wasnt playing so much with barbie dolls but the fake blood
6291948 she reminds me of a turtle in those old looney tunes cartoons she doesnt like to talk to people
6291949 actually very funny on saturday night live and she has truly great pipes
6291950 hasnt shown any real talent beyond the mesmerizing one that pays the bills
6291951 brady can pick up the dinner check but if the couple ever buys an island that check will be written from the supermodel inc account
6291952 if he wants to limp into new york club butter with ms bundchen or roll around in a vat of margarine with her thats his decision and hes beyond second guessing
6291953 do not blame caesar blame the people of rome who have

6291957 ste partido es clave al buen rumbo que pueda tomar el equipo es muy temprano en el torneo para decir que tenemos algo asegurado sabemos que las distancias se alarga o acortan en base a tu rendimiento y el equipo tiene buen funcionamiento
6291958 pues es un rival que es bien dirigido que no te regala nada la ventaja es que estamos en casa tenemos que proponer que arriesgar y con el empuje de la gente tratar el ganar el partido
6291959 ya son duelos tit nicos los dos son grandes t cnicos claro uno con mas experiencia que otro pero ra l arias tambi n tiene su historia sus logros a sabido edificar instituciones y seguramente va a ser un duelo t ctico muy interesante
6291960 hoy por lo menos vamos a descansar un poco m s lo bueno es que estamos embalados sabemos manejar bien los tiempos todo eso nos ayuda para dosificar durante el partido ahora tigres va a venir ansioso despu s de 15 d as de descanso y esperemos que el triunfo sea de nosotros
6291961 hoy la gente esta contenta y nosotros tambi n afortunadamente el torneo pasado se consiguieron importantes resultados como visitantes es por eso que hay que trabajar para que no regresen esos resultados
6291962 es muy reconfortante la verdad es algo que me emoci n me ilusiona hasta se me en china la piel por que nos a costado mucho trabajo
6291963 llevamos dos medallas la verdad no se que sientan los chinos o lo estadounidenses que les caen medallas a racimos la verdad me emocione much simo espero que en pr ximas olimpiadas tengamos mucho mejor presencia en el medallero
6291964 ano ba talaga sabihin na lang nila kung scrap di scrap at least matatahimik na ang kalooban ng mga kababayan natin
6291965 dapat talaga i scrap na lang ang moa na hindi naman katanggap tanggap at magsimula ulit ng panibagong peace negotiations
6291966 malungkot sabihin pero yong posisyon namin na vindicate dahil lumalabas na under the milf gun ang gobyerno nang pumayag sa kasunduang ito
6291967 it goes without saying when they say there will be further review it indicates flaws that had been observed in the moa will be reviewed in light of things that came out in light of the petition of sc supreme court
6291968 se dio la oportunidad lamentablemente ante la desgracia de un compa ero pero ah est uno presente y gracias a dios se han dado las cosas
6291969 antes del partido me brind su total apoyo como lo ha hecho desde que nos conocimos zerme o es una buena persona con gran experiencia en el futbol mexicano me dijo que estuviera tranquilo que siguiera trabajando y haciendo lo que s hacer
6291970 le n tiene su historia en esta divisi n y en el m ximo circuito me sorprendi la calidad de los jugadores a la delantera estoy tranquilo porque nosotros venimos bien y haciendo bien las cosas el marcador fue parejo
6291971 ellos no hab an ganado y vienen de hacerlo van a venir a seguir sumando puntos pero aqu en casa tenemos que seguir con el car cter de imbatibles y ojal as sea
6291972 quiero mandar un abrazo a todos los familiares de las v ctimas
6291973 ha sido un d a muy doloroso por el fatal accidente y quiero mandar un abrazo a todos los familiares de las v ctimas
6291974 nuestro equipo ha sido superior en la segunda parte pero dinamarca ha sido mejor en la primera
6291975 hemos salido lentos parsimoniosos y en la segunda parte hemos sido mejores ante una buena selecci n danesa
6291976 hay que ser coherente en el primer tiempo hemos podido salir perdiendo
6291977 examine study or inquire into systematically search or examine into the particulars of examine in detail
6291978 dont love the worlds ways dont love the worlds goods love of the world squeezes out love for the father practically everything that goes on in the world wanting your own way wanting everything for yourself wanting to appear important has nothing to do with the father it just isolates you from him the world and all its wanting wanting wanting is on the way out but whoever does what god wants is set for eternity
6291979 i stand in faith believing you for something even though it lacks sound practical judgment
6291980 faith means being sure of the things we for and knowing that something is real even if we do not see it
6291981 beloved now we are children of god and it has not yet been revealed what we shall be but we know that when he is revealed we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is and everyone who has this hope in him purifies himself just as he is pure
6291982 im really really trying but thats the problem with junk its not a habit its religion i worship it
6291983 and always doing it that way is what got you here in the trouble you are in
6291984 but agreement with god means that we are leaving it up to him that even if it doesnt make initial sense to us even if it goes against what weve been poorly or inaccurately taught even if it bucks the system even if its just down right radical or even if it goes totally against what we would want we are going to follow him anyway because he knows whats best
6291985 nossa uni o que nos d o poder de ser

6291989 can you imagine two old ladies in their 70s being re educated through labor
6291990 i feel very sad and angry because were only asking for the basic right of living and its been six years but nobody will do anything to help
6291991 in order to ensure smooth traffic flow a nice environment and good social order we will invite these participants to hold their demonstrations in designated places
6291992 for chinese petitioners if their protest applications were approved it would lead to a chain reaction of others seeking to voice their problems as well
6291993 when you have guests coming over for dinner you clean up the house and tell the children not to argue
6291994 im glad to hear that over 70 protest issues have been solved through consultation dialogue
6291995 given this moment when the international spotlight is shining on china when so much of the international media are in beijing its unfathomable why the authorities are intensifying social control
6291996 the truth is theyre sending a clear and disturbing message one theyre not even trying to hide which is were not even interested in hearing dissenting voices
6291997 the biggest question is at tight end right now whether we can get by with what weve got or whether we need to throw andrew parker into the mix
6291998 it wouldnt surprise me if we end up with a few on the trip such as parker possibly kenny okoro has done some good things on the corner terence davis is done some good things at receiver
6291999 but obviously if we can get by we dont want to play them
6292000 im not a big sunday guy we can and we thought that would be the best to just keep a game week schedule but i dont know how much we need to go on sunday
6292001 id rather have the kids having a chance to go to church and relax and get their feet up under them a little bit
6292002 i think the best thing we can do is make sure our guys are fresh and ready to go physically when we go to baylor
6292003 the guy came out and made this the best olympics of my lifetime
6292004 i think anyone would tell you that they would rather stay at the same position whether is on the right side or the left side
6292005 the longer you stay on one side the more comfortable you get and the better you get but i have proven i can play either side and really im fine with whatever they want me to do
6292006 you could kind of understand it this time because otahs a rookie and hes better suited for the right side
6292007 it was a little learning process early in camp but the last 10 days or so ive felt really really comfortable there
6292008 i feel like im kind of picking up where i left off on the right side
6292009 when youre lining up and almost man for man youre all bigger than the guys across from you just simple math tells you thats going to be advantageous
6292010 i definitely like looking down across the line and seeing all that size i know jake has spoken about that a few times too and hes excited
6292011 a year ago i never would have thought i would be in this situation
6292012 but its not something im disgruntled about or anything it didnt work out and i think we had different ideas about the parameters of the contract well see how it goes everyone gets along and likes each other its just that it didnt happen
6292013 ive never been a look down the road type of guy especially in my case because ive been moving back and forth so i dont have time to look down the road but being on the left side if i have a great year that is the spot on the o line that is most touted so well see what happens ive been lucky enough to stay healthy and as long as im healthy the sky is the limit
6292014 he was getting a lot of pressure from a lot of schools
6292015 everybody was saying that they wanted a commitment to this and to that florida state had mentioned it to him he wasnt comfortable with that coming from everybody
6292016 he still ended up going to africa the last two weeks this summer anyway
6292017 hes very committed to his beliefs and his family hes a rare kid
6292018 he helped take us to the state championship game we ran behind him
6292019 last year my spread at west resembled the single wing it looked like it was in the 50s
6292020 i knew football was always a part of my life i never thought about coaching until after i left wake and realized how important coaching was to the game
6292021 i didnt realize how important the xs and os were until i played pro ball
6292022 these kids arent getting anything out of playing other than the love of the game
6292023 were going to go out there and dig it out
6292024 theres a lot of excitement for me and a lot of time thats come up to this moment and a lot of work ive put in it feels like i havent played a game since high school
6292025 weve had some small changes in the defensive calls here and there
6292026 it really hasnt changed a whole lot theyre still just trying to keep us simple
6292027 they wanted to keep it real simple just so we could go and fly around and not have to think when were out there when we think thats not good for any defense
6292028 for me personally im going to keep doing what ive been doing
6292029 we cant really focus on what the press is saying about us nationally were getting more recognition but thats because of butch davis i think
6292030 were the ones who have to perform on the field and back up what everyones saying its good to get some credit but itll be even better at the end of the year when we back that credit up thats the main thing we focus on right now not thinking weve arrived because were getting some credit but that this is something to back up now
6292031 i have some minor pains here and there but overall my ankle is fine
6292032 ive been looking forward to playing football again since the spring its going to be a lot of fun to be able to play again
6292033 while glennon is an exceptional talent hes just not ready to handle some of the situations
6292034 things have to happen fast and youre in a two minute offense youre in a four minute offense a lot of things that win games for you at the end of games
6292035 a lot of it had to do with the experience factor and the college game moves an awful lot faster than the high school game did getting signals knowing what the clocks doing all of those kind of things that come with experience which hes got everything else he just needs some time to soak
6292036 creo que esta faceta es la que el equipo se propuso y la que queremos mantener queremos hacer un buen torneo no s lo el principio y estamos trabajando para seguir por este mismo camino y ojal que se pueda mantener
6292037 ser un partido que se nos puede complicar el cual hay que trabajarlo bien y estar tranquilos seguir haciendo lo que venimos haciendo trabajar este duelo y ser muy inteligente
6292038 its definitely something i think about its one of those things you dont want to get too ahead of yourself because we always take things one game at a time but its something i cant help thinking about
6292039 it would just be awesome to do that to play in every single national championship game it would be a tremendous honor to leave here with i do think about it a lot
6292040 the thing i will never forgot was when jason hunter picked up that fumble and when he got in the end zone jeremy wiggins grabbed him and basically tackled him pretty much that was one of the funniest things ive ever seen
6292041 just like last years first round game against james madison we could have lost that game and it would have been over a lot has to happen this year for us to get another chance
6292042 just in talking to the coaches and things i think my role will increase as far as maybe catching more balls and being involved in the offense a little more
6292043 from a personal standpoint i am a senior and this is my time not being arrogant about it but i feel like i can make plays when the ball is in my hands
6292044 when he came here as a freshman i was really impressed with how hard he worked that hasnt changed and you couple that with his athletic ability hes made a lot of clutch plays for us over the years and were looking forward to his senior season
6292045 after not winning the all around it hit me pretty hard not that i got the silver but just all my emotions came out i was training to win gold im just proud of myself that i kept my head up
6292046 im not sure where all of the deductions came from
6292047 hes in the 85 percent range you can live with that in field goal range and hes 100 percent with extra points
6292048 for the first time im not going to say im pleased but im encouraged by our specialists and their work
6292049 it was a hard decision where you want to be for the next four years
6292050 me and my family did a lot of talking and praying about it and ecu just felt right
6292051 they have got a great football program and as far as academics from my sister monique hines graduating from there i know a little more about that the area is nice the school is nice and they have great coaches what it came down to it just felt right
6292052 if you compare him to maybe your average high school player he is fast
6292053 but as a kid thats going to college he still pretty quick but he is not a blazer
6292054 but he has other tools to go with it he is a little bit of a glider
6292055 he can make you miss without making some big huge move he has the ability to make kids bounce off of him kind of
6292056 what i got from them when they first offered me was running back
6292057 but once they got my defensive tape too they were battling back and forth between offense and defense so i really dont know what will happen
6292058 if i had my choice i would want to play running back but if they put me on defense thats fine
6292059 never doubt that a small group of thoughtful committed citizens can change the world indeed it is the only thing that ever has
6292060 whatever you do to the least of these you do unto me
6292061 poverty rate would be in the range of 1 to 3 percent
6292062 the average home owned by the poor is a three bedroom one and a half bath home with a garage
6292063 the average consumption of protein vitamins and minerals is virtually the same for poor and middle class children and in most cases is well above recommended norms poor children actually consume more meat than do higher income children and have average protein intakes that are 100 percent above recommended levels
6292064 adolescents from needy families are twice as likely to be overweight
6292065 real hunger in america is found predominantly among people with behavioral or emotional problems such as drug addicts and the dysfunctional homeless
6292066 t he most fundamental cause of poverty most of the poor do not work full time and indeed do not work at all in 2005 among poor adults aged 18 64 56 percent did not work at all during the year 30 percent worked part time and only 14 percent worked full time with only one in seven of the poor working full time the very concept of the working poor is nearly an oxymoron
6292067 nearly 85 percent as much as median family income and 2 4 times the poverty threshold for a family of four
6292068 among families with children who are poor more than 60 percent are in single parent households most of which are female headed households
6292069 the poverty rate for those households where the primary wage earner had finished high school was married had no more than two children and worked full time was trivially small 1 percent

6292079 im probably the ultimate team player ill sacrifice whatever for the success of the team kobe is a great great great player its not hard for me and kobe to get along because of my game and his game
6292080 when you have an offensive line like ours its hard not to run the football
6292081 when you have a running back like christian smith a division i tackle david collins and a guard jeff smith who is as good its hard not to run when its first and 10 when its third and 3
6292082 stats are all good and everything but our offense we have to run the ball a little bit and stay balanced because we have such a good offensive line
6292083 stats are good but you dont need them because college coaches will know what you can do when you do throw the ball we threw for about 2 000 yards last year and had a balanced offense so thats good
6292084 whatever gets it done to win and thats my main thing just to turn the program around and win games if we have a successful season i really dont care what i do personally
6292085 i think he feels like he gets slighted quite a bit
6292086 he is not all about that though he wants to win
6292087 thats what you need in a quarterback the colleges that sat down and talked to him realized his leadership and knowledge of the game
6292088 the main thing i focused on in the offseason was to become more of a runner and dual threat quarterback just because it puts so much more pressure on a defense to focus on the deep threat and the running threat
6292089 we roll out of the pocket a lot and i am looking to run a little more when i see a little crease and we have some designed runs for me as well as just dropping back
6292090 we are real excited and we have been preparing real hard for rocky mount
6292091 for me i just want to limit my turnovers and keep the ball and the chains moving if i can do that the wins will take care of themselves

6292216 i welcome the investigation there is huge public outrage and concern at how this happened and it is important that an external examination takes place
6292217 there was a lack of consultation on such a significant decision by council which i consider to be a potential breach of the councils policy on determining significance
6292218 most major spending decisions should be made in the context of the ltccp or annual plan so decisions involving unidentified and unbudgeted expenditure should receive at least as much scrutiny as they would have received if they had been included in the ltccp or annual plan
6292219 the legal opinion that we received as councillors highlighted the ability of council to act urgently if it was the most practical method to prevent lost opportunity
6292220 i do not believe that any policy of council would give a clear mandate for such significant expenditure of the ratepayers dollar without the need for consultation as such i voted against accepting the legal opinion that was provided and contacted the office of the auditor general i welcome their investigation into the decision making process by council

6292297 in the 2001 recession those that cut the budgets lost market share and they are trying not to lose that market share so they are watching what their competitors are doing and so they are holding back and maybe if a competitor cuts budget theyll cut their budget a little bit and then they wont so everything is very last minute

6292329 its hard to argue with a 17 year nfl veteran
6292330 pretty much what he says goes he has nfl teams calling off the hook to want him to come and help out and coach so you know id probably go out on a limb and say hes the best quarterbacks coach there is theres no doubt in my mind from what ive been around
6292331 you cant coach everything otherwise you end up paralyzing people

6292345 very early on in the agreement we ran into a situation where we had to get a backup of some data very quickly
6292346 we gave them a call and id say within minutes the file was e mailed to us
6292347 you cant depend on staff to send the data over every night
6292348 you need a system that can do it automatically and thats what storagepipe does for us every night it takes the changes in our database over to their system backs it up and leaves us with nothing to worry about

6292459 i started to wonder whether the ad could be politically fatal for the organization
6292460 nevertheless i have this against you you tolerate that woman jezebel who calls herself a prophetess by her teaching she misleads my servants into sexual immorality and the eating of food sacrificed to idols
6292461 what jezebel didnt she die back in second kings how can jezebel be threatening the church in asia
6292462 jezebel wrote letters in ahabs name and sealed them with his seal and sent them to the elders and nobles of the city
6292463 proclaim a day of fasting and seat naboth in a prominent place among the people but seat two scoundrels opposite him and have them testify that he has cursed both god and the king then take him out and stone him to death

6292471 we heard last year and he had to finish the year with his injury unfortunately hes not going to be able to start the season with us but i think its a good thing that they were able to find what was going on with his foot
6292472 they tried different things our medical staff with ryan decided the only way for him to get better this year and the future was to have that operation we support that hell be ready in november or december somewhere around there
6292473 yes were going to miss him but in the meantime we faced so many injuries last year that this is not something brand new for us it gives a good opportunity to different players to show what they are capable of doing
6292474 they were important parts of our team thats for sure on the other hand we got a guy like matt cooke i like his intensity and hes a hard guy to play against
6292475 we got satan and fedotenko and they will give us a chance to keep on going where were trying to go its a fresh start for those guys its a great opportunity to play with our team and were excited about having those guys in our lineup
6292476 its going to be a good challenge though because when you look at the last two years the team that won the stanley cup or been a part of the finals didnt have such a great year itll be a challenge for us to prove we are able to have a good season this year

6292523 o culpado pela nossa derrota foi o inter que jogou melhor e soube construir um resultado favor vel eles foram superiores
6292524 quando n s fizemos 1 a 0 percebemos que eles se descontrolaram um pouco roubamos a bola no campo de defesa deles algumas vezes e tivemos duas chances para matar o jogo se fiz ssemos 2 a 0 ali o time deles s desestabilizaria como n o fizemos eles cresceram e dois gols deles foram marcados em um lance que n s conhec amos com o ndio entrando no segundo pau foi um erro mas acontece e o inter teve m ritos por saber aproveitar
6292525 se voc pegar os jogos desta rodada vai ver que s o fluminense venceu fora de casa hoje em dia voc n o tem no futebol brasileiro aquele time que vai ganhar todas dentro ou fora de casa voc precisa trabalhar para ser eficiente mas isso complicado o gr mio tem essa vantagem porque venceu alguns jogos fora mas os outros times se alternam muito
6292526 e em um lance que n s treinamos tanto sofremos o empate assim fica dif cil sempre acontece isso era um lance que avisamos antes

6292532 i happen to be a redeemer i think people can be made better and right if thats a fault so be it
6292533 melhor do que eu ter marcado os gols foi o fluminense vencer e assim nos dar confian a para o restante do brasileiro o tricolor tem uma equipe forte foi um baque muito grande a derrota na final da libertadores mas acredito que o time est voltando a ser o que era
6292534 nem vou me incomodar em torcer contra eles se n o sairmos nessa rodada isso pode acontecer na pr xima vamos continuar com esse esp rito e tentar o t tulo do segundo turno

6292561 hush and listen is a blog that ive been reading for quite some time now the author is passionate deep and poetic i love poetry so im drawn to his lugubrious yet beautiful prose his written imagery juxtaposed with intriguing visuals captivate me
6292562 nicely written nicely designed blog with lots of fantastic pictures which provoke your mind
6292563 what makes hush and listen so different is the level to which khalel the author appears to take his passion for writing into something far greater his words are terribly striking and any gay man is sure to be able to relate to at least one but more likely many of his pieces which he faithfully posts this is a definite must read for any gay man or for any poetic soul for that matter
6292564 hush and listen is a very unique blog the creator and author uses his creative mind and imaginative skills to write some very deep essays poems and words to read his talented imagery and photos that he uses not only excite my imagination but takes it to a whole new level when i add his words into the picture
6292565 its terrific the page is a treat to the eyes and hes khalel an expressive and poetic wordsmith definitely a blog worth getting to know
6292566 i am mesmerized i can hardly breathe while reading i have just been on the first page wait till i get on with the archive reading this blog makes me high
6292567 a very rivetting blogsite definitely a must visit website khalel the author is also in my contacts he also has a multiply site that is as equally as thought provoking and emotion weilding blogsite one of the best gay blogs i have ever seen

6292591 dance shows always do well but it has to be adapted for trends working on tv
6292592 its quite a positive show theres not a lot meanness that may exist in other reality programming
6292593 for a lot of people it reminds them of the time when tv wasnt so hostile
6292594 our show was really more about watching the creativity happen and contestants learning the choreography in a different sub genre each week
6292595 dancers are dramatic and emotional and i think its really compelling to watch
6292596 what these shows have replaced is what we no longer have a large support for the arts
6292597 the government no longer supports the arts theyre not fed like they were
6292598 weve seen a big increase in interest since the shows went on air
6292599 weve done a lot of ballroom classes and choreographed dances for weddings dance is on the brain
6292600 of course some of these shows are not for the dance purist
6292601 but it has such a domino effect on dance and getting people to think about dance its really just fantastic
6292602 people know the difference they see how hard these dancers work and realize that its a skill
6292603 at the same time it may inspire them to learn something new

6292621 alans been very consistent and his ability to pitch nearly every day has been invaluable in times when our bullpen has been overworked as a group but we wont make those types of contractual decisions until after the season
6292622 granted theyve changed gears in the direction theyre going but i think i can still help them on the field and off the field i havent had the greatest season but im healthy and my arm is still good and over the course of my career if ive had a bad year dont bet against me the next season
6292623 that was a good spot for me to come into and have success
6292624 the biggest thing was location i threw almost every pitch right where i wanted to it was a real good feeling

6292700 the housing outlook is uncertain in australia with the latest hia forecast predicting a further decline from 154 180 commencements during fy2007 08 to a forecast 145 340 during fy2008 09 a 5 7 decline falls are also expected in the new zealand housing sector
6292701 given the lower earnings and after considering the higher capital requirements for fy2008 09
6292702 the result of 11 6 million reflects the continuing difficult trading conditions in both australia and new zealand where housing activity has not improved over the prior year
6292703 sales volumes in australia were affected by the general economic environment particularly in the housing sector in nsw increased competitive activity and changes that are occurring in the corporate retail sector
6292704 in an increasingly competitive market in australia net prices have remained at last years level without price improvement productivity initiatives were not sufficient to fully offset general inflationary cost pressures
6292705 given the changes that are occurring in the marketplace and the uncertain economic environment in which we are operating including no anticipated improvement in the housing sector it is too early to take a view on how the 2008 09 year will progress
6292706 the economic environment is uncertain and a changing competitive dynamic in the paint sector in australia will be further compounded by the introduction of imported paint by a major corporate retailer
6292707 whilst we believe these changes will initially result in some lost sales we anticipate this shortfall will be recovered progressively through the launch of the new colour system and interior offer and promotion of our other key brands
6292708 the paint industry is faced with substantial increases in input costs driven by higher oil and packaging costs
6292709 to offset these increases we have significant activity underway to further reduce costs within the business focusing on manufacturing and distribution and a cost restructuring program across all other aspects of the business
6292710 for these cost initiatives we are targeting 8 to 10 million savings we also have specific sales programs to underpin the initiatives for interior industrial major projects and textures and our own store network given the changes that are occurring in the marketplace and the uncertain economic environment in which we are operating including no anticipated improvement in the housing sector it is too early to take a view on how the fy2008 09 year will progress however the market initiatives and the continued cost reduction focus will better position the business for when the market conditions improve
6292711 a continuation of the current market conditions would again impact our revenues and profitability in 2009
6292712 our faith in our business is resolute and we are in no doubt that it will withstand the challenges of our operating environment without compromising our future success the core of our business is very robust it is backed by a strong balance sheet and a great team of people
6292713 perpetual is in an excellent position to take advantage of growth opportunities as they arise in the market
6292714 our environment has a defining influence on the performance of our business and we were clearly not immune to these market forces in 2008
6292715 as fellow shareholders we are disappointed this years results have not been consistent with previous results which delivered total returns for our shareholders in excess of 30 per cent per annum in the decade up to 2007
6292716 our lawyers think that we don t have to wait two years
6292717 by the end of this week we will have nailed down all of the things we have to do to replace ap
6292718 is 59 actor steve guttenberg is 50 talk show host
6292719 that the ltte is not the sole representatives of the tamils and they should be held responsible for the destruction unleashed during the last 25 years
6292720 first of all i must say that i am not constantly in touch with the ltte hierarchy but i have some connections with the lttes political wing i do not have any thing to do with the lttes fighting cadres
6292721 yes the ltte is responsible but before that all politicians and section of people were responsible for fuelling the present unrest
6292722 i am not a sympathiser of the ltte or any political party i am only committed to the gospel values i act only according to the teachings and directives given by the church i am not for separation or war so how can one tag me as a ltte sympathiser
6292723 prabhakaran has never asked me to support him and he knows what kind of a man i am
6292724 bishop i know that you dont support us and we do not expect that from you but we expect you to talk about sufferings of the people he cannot get my support
6292725 when there is a reasonable stand taken by the ltte on human grounds i stand up for that that does not mean that i am supporting the ltte even the ltte does not ask me to support them
6292726 that hairline difference between nuance and what appears to be flip flopping is hurting him with liberal voters
6292727 conservatives were supposed to be the bigger problem for mccain
6292728 obama still has work to do on his base at this point mccain seems to be doing a better job with his
6292729 there were no wild swings there isnt one group that is radically different than last month or even two months ago it was just a steady decline for obama across the board

6292732 and she could make the most beautiful arrangements out of nothing it was incredible
6292733 she knew exactly where he was during the entire war when most people had no idea where their loved ones were
6292734 both she and her mother just loved flowers and garden clubs were really big back then
6292735 especially historical books and books about former first ladies she loved those
6292736 she always said that if she hadnt met dad she would have been a career woman

6292750 is the glass half empty half full or twice the size it needs to be
6292751 as everybody wants to do i want to live my life fully people might have different views in this regard but this is my nature that i get more satisfied when i do small things for my society
6292752 i would be much more willing to join a fraternity if the housing conditions were better
6292753 at their current state they can hardly be considered decent
6292754 the difference between n c states houses and the university of south carolinas is that n c state is working with existing houses versus usc who built them all at once
6292755 volunteers have to go through one training session before they are going out and registering
6292756 we are teaching them ways to convey the message in a non partisan fashion if there are people that we feel like arent capable of sidelining their own political views they will not participate
6292757 the profrssors role will be communicating with their peers because we feel like that is a better approach than a student just asking to barge into their classroom
6292758 we always see an increase in alcohol issues at the beginning of the semester a lot of that has to do with our incoming freshman class being away from home for the first time being on their own and being able to obtain alcohol without parental oversight
6292759 when kids are away from home for the first time they want to experience college and alcohol is usually involved
6292760 also campus police is probably more aware of alcohol issues because it is the beginning of the semester
6292761 some students come to campus believing they have to drink to fit in with the college lifestyle
6292762 if we discover a desire within us that nothing in this world can satisfy also we should begin to wonder if perhaps we were created for another world
6292763 deep down inside you long for a cold hearted republican to lower taxes brutalize criminals and rule you like a king
6292764 the nine most terrifying words in the english language are im from the government and im here to help
6292765 what we got is not really a baby but perhaps a toddler
6292766 either theyre not happening or theyre happening invisibly is our galaxy really more unusual than other galaxies
6292767 we got together with glennon and talked about it and hes fine with it
6292768 the third scrimmage is a lot of game ending situations where things have to happen fast
6292769 a lot of it has to do with experience and the college game moves a lot faster than the high school game does
6292770 but with a spotty offensive line and wide receiver donald bowens out for the season wilsons the most logical choice because he can escape
6292771 i really like russell hes got a great arm and sounds like hes been really impressive
6292772 we believe that our curriculum is very good and that we just need to give our students more opportunities to focus on the concepts were teaching
6292773 we will concentrate on seeing our students continuing to achieve more proficiency academically
6292774 the biggest challenge to the challenge is bringing the funding
6292775 we have the technology and we have the people there at n c state that can do it
6292776 they wanted students who knew other students to get together people to work on the project
6292777 i didnt actually know about it until they approached me that summer
6292778 one conversation led to another and we found out that we were both in love with space
6292779 you have to use materials that can survive in those conditions
6292780 for example silicone works great in heat but shatters in the cold you have to have it operate on solar power and batteries because batteries dont work well in the cold and you have a fixed amount of power
6292781 were looking at multiple designs right now and then well select the one that will end up working the best
6292782 the one the graduate students are working on is a little bit more mature theyve already focused in on a particular design
6292783 the ultimate rover might act be a combination of what gordons working on and what the graduate students are working on and what the undergraduate students are working on were going to learn from each of the prototypes and from that decide what goes in to the final version its not like theres a winner
6292784 only one of two of the teams have major funding the rest of us havent found a major sponsor yet
6292785 this is a perfect project to teach the process of engineering design because in engineering design you end up using a combination of learning all the scientific and engineering principles along with trying to use what youve learned in the classroom to create something new
6292786 im pretty sure thats illegal if they actually are corrective lenses

6292788 orang mukmin adalah saudara orang mukmin yang lain maka tidak halal bagi seorang mukmin menjual barang yang sudah dibeli saudaranya dan tidak halal pula meminang wanita yang sudah dipinang saudaranya sehingga saudaranya itu meninggalkannya
6292789 apabila salah seorang di antara kalian meminang seorang wanita maka apabila ia mampu hendaknya ia melihat kepada apa yang mendorongnya untuk menikahinya
6292790 maka aku meminang seorang budak wanita dan aku bersembunyi untuk bisa melihat apa yang mendorong aku untuk menikahinya lalu aku menikahinya
6292791 seorang perempuan datang kepada nabi shallallahu alaihiwa sallam untuk menyerahkan dirinya dia berkata
6292792 wahai rasulullah kawinkanlah saya dengannya jika engkau tidak berhajat padanya
6292793 tidak sah suatu pernikahan tanpa seorang wali dan dua orang saksi yang adil
6292794 sesungguhnya malaikat tidak masuk suatu rumah yang di dalamnya ada gambar
6292795 rasulullah shallallahualaihi wa sallam telah menikahi shafiyah dengan maskawin pembebasannya sebagai tawanan perang khaibar dan mengadakan walimah selama tiga hari
6292796 jangan bersahabat kecuali dengan seorang mukmin dan jangan makan makananmu kecuali seorang yang bertaqwa
6292797 wahai aisyah mengapa kalian tidak menyuguhkan hiburan karena kaum anshar senang pada hiburan
6292798 mudah mudahan allah memberimu berkah mudah mudahahan allah mencurahkan keberkahan kepadamu dan mudah mudahan dia mempersatukan kalian berdua dalam kebajikan
6292799 mudah mudahan allah memberi kalian berkah dan melimpahkan atas kalian keberkahan

6292801 given the relative sizes of the two countries surely the uk team should be disappointed with anything less than three times the number of medals that australia has
6292802 i represent an organization that protects your rights you could have said what you wanted
6292803 i figured if people didnt know my stance already a two minute speech wouldnt help
6292804 your audience is not important you need to speak up regardless
6292805 i feel more confident and i know that if i throw the ball over the plate and i keep it down i got guys behind me that will make the plays
6292806 like so many innings it just snowballs nothing you can do about it
6292807 you cheated on me its just one example of how self centered you are we are through
6292808 weve always known it was just a matter of time until this wasnt going to work anymore sorry darlin but the time has come

6292813 hey im danny i see you like cycling i like to ride as well
6292814 there were difficult moments but the players were able to dig deep as they did at the end of the match
6292815 that was a positive we scored three goals but conceded two
6292816 thats part of the game if you want to push forward open the game a bit more play more freely you give chances to your opponents
6292817 we have to be at the top this has to be it
6292818 i viewed it simply as an opportunity to continue positive dialogue
6292819 show support for a continuing emphasis on faith issues and pray in a forum where faith isnt thought to be emphasized
6292820 it wouldnt be wise for me to pick a side when both sides are right in some areas and both sides are wrong in some areas
6292821 if my praying at the dnc was perceived as showing favoritism and incorrectly labeling me as endorsing one candidate over the other then i need to have pause
6292822 there are other beautiful places to live flag isnt the only one and water is nice
6292823 theyre not too bad the real thing you want to look out for is poison oak that stuffs nasty
6292824 durante los ltimos meses hemos trabajado de cerca con neversoft y activision harmonix y konami para asegurar que las guitarras y bater as del playstation 3 funcionar n a un nivel b sico de compatibilidad de juego

6292832 we are encouraged by some of the results from the rc drill program at lugazi the lugazi belt has shown no historical gold exploration and the company has been at the forefront in discovering potential new zones of gold anomalism on surface due to the scarcity of any rock outcrops on the project and with no direct means to identify sources of the gold in soil anomalies the rc program was designed to investigate the distribution of anomalous gold in the upper 50m and to profile any anomalous gold patterns in this upper weathered zone we feel that the mineralised intersections may point to supergene gold but that a primary source for this gold requires investigation through a second phase of deeper holes we are also encouraged by the results of our regional geochemical program which have uncovered potential new gold targets on other parts of the lugazi belt the company will continue to explore these anomalies in more detail
6292833 sas is doing everything possible to help passengers and next of kin and to assist spanish authorities
6292834 the government is overwhelmed very affected as are all spanish citizens by this tragedy
6292835 i am really pleased with tonights display and with the result

6292837 edward it doesnt matter not anymore this is what matters now us were together and i love you
6292838 we wanted to win the match and worked a lot to clinch the win
6292839 of course a draw with one of the worlds best football teams is a positive result but theres no reason for euphoria
6292840 its only a draw we still need towork hard to achieve somethingserious
6292841 as original iphone owners we did our 3g reception homework before waiting in line on launch day for 8 hours to buy the sleek new awesome iphone 3g and we could not wait to experience the
6292842 the iphone 3g a really cool gadget decent music player internet and email appliance but if you rely on your mobile as a telephone i wouldnt recommend it
6292843 cell phones are not what they used to be you have to be in the line of sight of the cell tower
6292844 so im lucky to be even getting 1 bar while i sit in my office
6292845 it all depends on whats between your office and the tower

6292847 a soldier is expected to uphold standards maintain a professional appearance and demeanor to follow the rules and guidelines perform expected tasks and ensure that the machine so to speak operates as smoothly as possible
6292848 these guys have got composure and character the one thing weve learned this summer is that regardless of what the score is were just going to keep grinding it out we can always find a way to win
6292849 im not saying every day is a wonderful day but when im here and im in the gym with the guys im doing fine but the rest of it well im ok
6292850 hes been there every battle weve had the last four years and now hes there to get our back again to report corrections and clarifications contact reader editor
6292851 while the secretary of state certifies sufficient progress on human rights in colombia multiple sources report that unlawful killings by the colombian army are continuing despite efforts by the minister of defense to stop it
6292852 after providing billions of dollars in training and equipment to the colombian army we should expect better including vigorous investigations and prosecutions of these crimes
6292853 now we can see that the military has a human rights concept different than before in its relation to society and individual citizens because they know perfectly well that their legitimacy depends on support from the people
6292854 at the end of the day colombia has made enormous strides under the uribe administration to address this crucial human rights issue
6292855 we applaud the progress while acknowledging that the situation is not yet perfect
6292856 its like a work of theater where soldiers play roles to learn what they have to do in given situations
6292857 we still have problems you take a professional soldier who has 10 12 or 14 years in the jungle and suddenly you ask him to work in a different way its a big effort and sometimes impossible
6292858 but the process continues and the story today is different from that of a few years ago
6292859 i am happy with the draw because the reaction of the team in the last minute was good that is important
6292860 in the first half we played good football with good style and created a lot of chances to score the team played together
6292861 the only thing i didnt like in the first half was when the czechs counter attacked we suffered a lot
6292862 hear and determine any or all of the issues in an action
6292863 periods of short term underperformance may be one of the few certainties that investors can count on
6292864 if atom is as good as you guys say it is isnt it in danger of cannibalizing
6292865 if you buy a 10 000 car and you expect it to behave like a bmw its not
6292866 they are a bit bulkier than a smart phone but they are not quite a low end laptop the question is how are they going to be perceived by consumers lots of these tweeners have been tried before history is littered with them
6292867 it was beautiful to be back a bit less to be 2 0 down
6292868 there was a little lack of attention in part because while they might not be a great team they have great physical and athletic qualities and they showed them
6292869 then we started to speed things up especially in the second half we fixed the result which is always important
6292870 we went after the win until the end passing the ball around quickly
6292871 it wasnt easy against such a physical side they were very tall they only conceded us the flanks
6292872 not only was it old and historic it was decorated in a high victorian motif with stenciling gold leafing three small murals floral designs and much more
6292873 it would be very valuable its like an old rolls royce however like many antiques if it went for sale it would depend on how much someone would pay for it
6292874 americans may be less gloomy because theyre seeing gas prices fall below us 4 in many places giving them some hope the economy may be back on track said susan pinkus the los angeles times polling director
6292875 we were just notified that natural gas prices in our area will go up said heidi artise 48 an independent voter whose husband has found only occasional jobs as a maintenance worker over the past year
6292876 i dont see many future prospects for me and my family said artise who lives in the town of north east pennsylvania on lake erie
6292877 very badly dropped 6 percentage points to 44 per cent
6292878 kita mahu tahu bagaimana nama 26 orang tersebut dikeluarkan daripada daftar pemilih tanpa rang daftar dipamerkan
6292879 saya ingin bertanya bilakah spr menjalankan proses ini mempamerkan rang daftar pemilih nama 26 pengundi tersebut masih ada dalam daftar pemilih pilihanraya umum 8 mac lalu
6292880 tidak guna parti politik mematuhi semua peraturan pilihanraya tetapi dalam bahagian yang paling penting iaitu senarai pendaftar pemilih ia tidak dipatuhi
6292881 isunya nama yang hilang itu telah menimbulkan keraguan kepada kita
6292882 saya lihat tadi keadaan tren yang digunakan untuk penumpang setiap pagi untuk pergi kerja mereka sentiasa berebut rebut bila tren tiba dari segi itu ialah nampaknya macam tak ada sistem
6292883 i thought at the time and nothing has happened that proves me wrong that he was the right man for the job at the right time
6292884 we wanted to have some continuity some stability we wanted an experienced guy at the helm
6292885 and we felt that working with these young people would be something that he would relish
6292886 i dont say that just because we won but i felt like he kind of gave us the reins to be our own men if you did something that wasnt kosher he let us know
6292887 he was a great guy we were all minor league guys and he worked well with all of us
6292888 the cups always half full with him it was great having a coach like that thats always positive
6292889 im not doing this to become a major league manager
6292890 im doing it because i love baseball and i love working with very talented young players and putting them together in a winning cause
6292891 you do not have because you do not ask god for we brought nothing into the world and we can take nothing out of it but if we have food and clothing we will be content with that
6292892 i think he wants to make sure he gets it checked out and make sure everything is all right with it
6292893 when hes been able to practice and move around hes looked awfully good to me
6292894 i think we have a number of guys that are in that category who have some soreness and my concern will be if it lingers
6292895 hopefully it wont linger and hopefully in the next week to 10 days hes going to be all right and ready to get going
6292896 obviously this injury is one of those things you have to kind of handle daily
6292897 i continue to monitor it because ideally i want to be at full strength come the opener
6292898 early in the game they made a lot of tough shots
6292899 we were doing what we were supposed to be doing and they made tough shots but sooner or later well impose our will i dont know if you can keep up with us for 40 minutes
6292900 theyve been the most difficult team for us to defend
6292901 theyre a force to be reckoned with they caused us a lot of problems
6292902 in the third quarter we said the first three or four minutes we need to pick it up a little bit defensively and make the extra pass offensively
6292903 can ya spare a quarter for an old altar boy father
6292904 theres some past there definitely some bad blood with players and coaches who have played before
6292905 it was a tough game the last time and were hoping for a really good game this time
6292906 its to everyone out there that you have to work hard
6292907 a 9 year old british girl was given methadone at her local pharmacy instead of her prescribed antibiotics which were intended to treat an ear infection
6292908 nearly three quarters of previously uninsured massachusetts residents now have medical coverage under the states landmark campaign to extend health insurance to virtually all bay staters according to a report released yesterday by governor deval patricks administration since the programs launch in june 2006 439 000 more people have enrolled in health insurance and nearly half of them signed up for private insurance not funded by taxpayers says the report from the division of health care finance and policy before 2006 studies had estimated that about 600 000 massachusetts residents lacked health insurance the dramatic expansion has spurred a substantial drop in patients seeking routine care in hospital emergency rooms where treatment is much more expensive
6292909 embryonic stem cells can be used to grow vats of red blood cells which could lead to the creation of farms that could provide limitless sources of blood u s researchers reported on tuesday the team at massachusetts based advanced cell technology hopes the finding might help save the struggling company which is desperately seeking investors to keep it afloat i think its really a big break for us said dr robert lanza scientific director of the company one of a few commercial ventures trying to make a business out of the emerging stem cell field stem cells are the bodys master cells replenishing various cells and tissues as they die stem cells taken from days old embryos are especially powerful with the ability to produce any cell type
6292910 there really is nothing spec about alms and in some ways it is actually easier for us not to have a spec tire
6292911 our series encourages technology and with multiple manufacturers they are always looking for ways to be more efficient and have better economy from the tires
6292912 this is part of our mission as a series and without tire competition we just could not do it
6292913 here all the cars are different everything from audi v 12 turbo diesel to a front engined corvette to an acura prototype and porsche 911s so they all have different needs in terms of tires
6292914 from our standpoint racing with the top manufacturers and premier teams gives us a tremendous opportunity to learn and to gain insight into performance especially at the extremes we can take that and feed back into our development process not only for race tire but also for production tires
6292915 when you are in open competition in a series like alms we cant back off
6292916 the development process is demanding but rewarding and it pushes things much more aggressively than a series where everyone is running the same tire
6292917 we are a little different from a lot of the other tire companies because our motorsports division operates as a business and hopefully a profit centre so we are not an extension of the marketing department and we dont have huge budgets supporting us to give tires away
6292918 the struggling companies are getting an even tougher road in the near future the question also is do they really have the resources the cash here
6292919 i think the city commission needs to get engaged in this issue
6292920 it was very close and i still cant believe i won it
6292921 the crowd helped me very much and i am very excited to be in the quarter finals
6292922 these kinds of matches for the last year or so i was losing them
6292923 at some point it makes a difference because you have confidence from these kind of matches and you build up from there
6292924 i lost my rhythm a little bit on my serve because of the wind in the first set
6292925 i couldnt find it in the second as well but still i was fighting to the end and im pleased with this win
6292926 i am so happy with my level of play today
6292927 i always play well here in new haven and i am hoping to play my best
6292928 i was serving and volleying and then i tried to stay back and wear him down it worked
6292929 i was hitting everything for a winner and everything was going 100 per cent my way
6292930 when the match kind of got tight in a couple of points i started to panic maybe a little bit
6292931 we felt like warriors out there the pressure of playing china made it pretty intense
6292932 ever since the ball dropped in athens weve wanted to repeat as olympic champions
6292933 when the ball goes too high you cant see it too easy
6292934 but its ok because if it is raining for us it is raining for them
6292935 weve been able to resolve all the outstanding issues between us there was a very long meeting three hours of questions came from the floor as the community wanted to satisfy themselves that this was a good deal and protected their land rights
6292936 every time we tried to speak to ministers in canberra about allowing people from timor to come we had a blunt answer no they didnt want to do it simple as that
6292937 weve got a different government now different ideas and a sympathetic ear
6292938 die zahlen best tigen uns darin dass ein einschneidender umbruch auf dem markt geschieht

6292940 he worked for years on this science fiction game going into space fighting on other planets and hes going to go to into space himself it makes sense that with him going into space we should tie this in
6292941 it was a partnership there were things they wanted to handle internally and things they needed our support with
6292942 predominantly we want to tap into existing ncsoft customers inactive customers users in other campaigns we sent targeted e mails to those targeted groups
6292943 we changed the messaging for different user segments with different subjects e mails different calls to action
6292944 they are extraordinarily powerful as a way to monetize more pageviews and allow larger marketers to put more meaningful dollars to work
6292945 the point is not necessarily the full total values of deals
6292946 whats more interesting are the small mid level deals for me the more interesting activity is on the venture capital side where innovation is happening
6292947 surprisingly pure search advertising plays are limited while more entrepreneurial investment is going into emerging categories such as social media video and behavioral
6292948 i havent driven for two years weve just returned from another country
6292949 i got my b200 and i was having problems switching lanes my husband told me to take a course to gain confidence when im checking my blind spots my husband goes red
6292950 nobody pushes the brake hard enough you need to keep pushing that brake pedal all the way down until the car is stopped
6292951 its a lot of money for two people i thought id let aeran take it first and tell me how it is
6292952 i never knew about braking so hard that was the hardest part
6292953 this is the only way for me to test drive all these mercedes cars
6292954 you cant do that at the dealership theyd kick you out
6292955 am i doing this for my clients or for my own ego

6292960 apa yang diungkapkan korban munir mengakibatkan terdakwa muchdi yang merupakan danjen kopassus tidak suka karena akibatnya terdakwa diberhentikan dari jabatannya sebagai danjen kopassus yang baru dijabatnya selama 52 hari hal ini menjadi pukulan berat sehingga terdakwa sakit hati dan dendam pada korban dengan diangkatnya terdakwa sebagai deputi v bin tahun 2003 dengan kewenangan jabatan tersebut memberi peluang kepada terdakwa untuk menghentikan kegiatan munir yang telah merugikan terdakwa
6292961 we have a once in a generation chance to bring meaningful and lasting change to our country by electing barack obama president and sending a stronger democratic majority to the senate
6292962 we need a stronger majority in the senate to enact obamas broad sweeping agenda and our outstanding group of candidates is ready to deliver it
6292963 la descalificaci n que jorge 40 hace de las afirmaciones de rafael garc a es clara y contundente
6292964 garc a admiti que no se bas en percepciones directas de sus sentidos sino en comentarios de terceros en suposiciones y deducciones personales en las que crey o se imagin algunas de las fuentes que mencion categ ricamente desmintieron sus aseveraciones
6292965 son circunstancias que por s solas no tipifican el delito de concierto para delinquir agravado ni ninguna otra conducta il cita

6292968 as como no nos gusta que los equipos veten rbitros tampoco vamos a estar de acuerdo con que los jueces determinen vetar a los equipos
6292969 porque la cuesti n era tramitarlo el proyecto r pidamente
6292970 tal proyecto de reforma constitucional es innecesario y es totalmente inconveniente para el pa s pues el concurso de m ritos ha garantizado una judicatura independiente e imparcial
6292971 es un retroceso y atenta contra la sana competencia de miles de aspirantes para ingresar y ascender en la administraci n de justicia
6292972 es un reconocimiento de muchos servidores p blicos del pa s que han cumplido con la funci n p blica se han mantenido porque han demostrado que son buenos profesionales
6292973 nothing else good that was going on could receive any attention because of that issue
6292974 some investors have not been happy with the way that diller has managed the company and so they might be more open to looking at the pieces hes no longer associated with
6292975 muchos piensan que como no estudian para el college lo mismo pasa con el sat pero est n bien equivocados hay estudiantes en estados unidos que se preparan desde segundo a o de escuela superior entonces ah se ve la diferencia en los resultados
6292976 nos damos cuenta de que los estudiantes dejan todo para ltima hora toman los ex menes muy tarde a veces no saben ni cu l tienen que tomar
6292977 se les ofrecen cuatro ex menes durante el curso si la mejor a no existe tiene la opci n de repetirlo gratis
6292978 i try to make people understand that in beijing im going to be racing against some of the top walkers in the world said dow days being journeying to china
6292979 ive been racing for a long time and have experience but i didnt start competing until after i had my children
6292980 the competition in the czech republic spain and france is pretty much going to be same in beijing said dow before leaving for china
6292981 i realize that my best time may not be good enough for medal contention and im ok with that i just want to compete finish the race and be respectable
6292982 ever since i was a kid i always wanted to represent the united states in the olympics
6292983 i hate cameras theyre just so much more sure than i am about everything
6292984 haha i like that post i am a chair but a funky and comfortable one i am sure
6292985 i would have to save the book of revelation because if our society ever does ban literature and or the bible thats the time when we will need to
6292986 i think that everything you said was great blake scharzenbach is a poet and his words helped me through my crazy early teen years in fact i have never stopped
6292987 im feeling good up there but its not something you want to talk too much about it
6292988 i talked to him the other day hes doing great wouldnt you 60 million richer
6292989 hes a tremendous player hes going to be a tremendous player no matter what uniform he puts on
6292990 its a story for you guys the media to sit back and hate on him and wish that he does terrible because he didnt sign here but all in all hes a friend of ours we wish him the best business is business sometimes you can sign a guy sometimes you cant you dont worry about things you cant control
6292991 the fewer preseason games you have the fewer opportunities you have for the younger players
6292992 if you have young players on your roster and you dont have preseason games then i dont know where you get them experience
6292993 i think it makes it a lot harder for them to make the team if you want to develop young players you have to have some type of opportunity and time to develop them
6292994 would you be in favor of partnering with a minor league team
6292995 as far as trying to conquer the world and save the sport i will leave that to someone else
6292996 it cant happen especially in the middle of a pennant race
6292997 i cant make it any more plain simple obvious black and white
6292998 i cant have aki iwamura run like he is and carlos pena and cliff floyd who has two bad knees etc and permit what upton did i cant permit it
6292999 he just needs to be prepared to do what hes doing were not going to stop him there will be a point when if it gets too deep into the season well reevaluate it
6293000 im preparing the same way i do every day ready to make all of my starts
6293001 what weve got in bradenton is a lot of new players
6293002 youve got to be excited about whats happening there not only for what it will mean to our lower level teams but also what it could mean in the future
6293003 it was just the expectations that were thrown on me being the ace being the one who faces the other teams ace people expected a lot of me and i dont think thats easy on a young pitcher but when youve got nagging injuries and things come up its kind of hard all i told myself was to finish the season strong
6293004 turn left by that old jeep that used to be out in front of fred jacobs farm
6293005 go find out whos fucking things up in personnel receiving and initial training dispensation depot 12
6293006 cthulhus visiting on thursday so we really need all the white oak garlic shavings and clorox bleach you can find right goddamn now
6293007 we want whats the best for caylee we want caylee found
6293008 its not about getting casey out to make sure she feels better
6293009 its all about the interest of finding caylee hopefully she will get us some information
6293010 he likes to sun in between the window and window pane
6293011 hes getting too big and would struggle now he put a hole in the screen not on purpose he was just trying to move his body and he fell out
6293012 i was out for about four hours and when i came home i couldnt find him anywhere
6293013 sometimes he hides but not usually for an entire day hes big so i usually find him anyway plus when i call him to eat hell come cause he loves to eat
6293014 they can take a fall there was no sign of any trauma around that area
6293015 it was hot for a while and i thought he could be ok but it could be an animal got him or someone picked him up
6293016 its a lot of work to raise an iguana to make him tame around other people
6293017 hes a free roaming iguana i didnt make him stay in the tank except to feed and go to the bathroom
6293018 im getting to feel like im not going to see him again
6293019 i did go to pet store but then i changed my mind
6293020 its kind of an unusual situation that its been sitting in court this long without the court taking action one way or another
6293021 weve put it out at this point to either resolve it or we will take necessary action
6293022 this particular property has an 11 year history with the conservation commission
6293023 theyre treating one of our taxpayers a little bit differently than everybody else
6293024 weve written to mr brumber weve met with mr brumber and his attorney and i think when the written complaint came in it gave the town a record of a complaint that we were able to act on
6293025 your vagina is just like this rose except it smells like putrid fish and is slimy to the touch
6293026 we always pride ourselves on our defense but especially stopping the run be it the defensive line or the front seven
6293027 that is a goal of ours like it is every year but that all starts up front its taking control of the line of scrimmage thats no 1 on our list
6293028 if a team can run the ball on you they can basically do what they want we try to take at least one thing run or pass from them and if i had to guess we like to take away the run game the run game is all about our front seven how well we can play fundamentally how tough we can be well see what were made of this year
6293029 ultimately defense gets judged by the amount of points that are scored against them you might have one stat that may be on a league wide basis a little higher than another but the real bottom line is scoring defense as the real bottom line on offense is scoring offense so sometimes those numbers are a little bit misleading
6293030 im not saying that they may or may not be that significant relative to the overall performance of the unit sometimes some of those numbers are a little bit circumstantial and sometimes they are not if you are giving up a lot of yards per carry in a running situation that is not good
6293031 he called over and checked on me and i thought that was pretty classy of a guy like him
6293032 our careers have kind of paralleled each other in that weve played the position of safety
6293033 hes going into his 15th year im going into my 16th
6293034 im from san diego so i see a lot of what went on when rodney was there and i always loved the way he played when someone plays like that who you respect so much when something like that knee injury happens you do those kind of things its great to be playing with him now
6293035 no question hes one of the greatest safeties to ever play this game
6293036 he plays the game the right way he doesnt find an excuse
6293037 hes a warrior a proven warrior hes a guy who plays hurt a guy whos had a number of things happen to him and continues to go out and fight hes just a guy i have a lot of respect for
6293038 rodney is always one of the guys at the top of his craft in our profession and specifically what we do
6293039 so ive studied him so i think there are a lot of similarities
6293040 hes been through this before i just wanted confirmation im not the only dunce that this is a tough system to pick up
6293041 when you play this long you feel you should be able to pick something up right away
6293042 i dont think the cause of these sad tragic deaths was yours
6293043 personally i have a hard time calling that true justice
6293044 if ellreese daniels had not been on that fire line my son would have probably lived
6293045 what mr daniels did up there that day was not the sole cause of those firefighter deaths
6293046 the person who keeps getting blamed for everything is ellreese daniels
6293047 wind and fire killed the four people on the rocks
6293048 weve been really pleased with the response and are expecting a great turnout
6293049 weve pre sold 215 tickets have some great sponsorships and have a lot of great packages to auction off and as raffle items
6293050 as an organization we depend on grassroots fundraising and this is one of the biggest of the year its a good time for all and a good place to learn a little about what were all about
6293051 there will be a separate room for the greenwig kids with raffles games and their own auction
6293052 for every dollar raised here that can be leveraged seven to 10 times as much before it hits the ground
6293053 many thousands of dedicated civil servants that are dedicated to making this nation a better place to live who serve their nation admirably and with dedication
6293054 has mutated into a no accountability zone where employment is treated as an entitlement good performance as an option and accountability as someone elses problem
6293055 generally positive rhetoric tinged with the old reagan attacks on lazy feds mccains comments are standard fed bashing
6293056 obama is concerned by the rising number of government contractors that are often unaccountable and frequently less efficient than government workers
6293057 reduce our nations increasing dependence on private contractors in sensitive or inherently governmental functions
6293058 eliminate the bush administrations ideological bias towards outsourcing of government services
6293059 labor leaders looking to swell the ranks of federal government unions
6293060 whereas mccain has the assumption that the private sector would do things better i dont think thats true
6293061 throughout the course of the day and into this evening congresswoman tubbs jones medical condition declined
6293062 over the course of many years with many ups and many downs stephanie was right by our side unwavering indefatigable
6293063 it was that fighting spirit that allowed stephanie to rise from modest beginnings to succeed in public service to become a one woman force for progress in our country
6293064 it wasnt enough for her just to break barriers in her own life she was also determined to bring opportunity to all those who had been overlooked and left behind and in stephanie they had a fearless friend and unyielding advocate
6293065 she worked so hard and gave everything she could im devastated wherever wed go wed speak of each other as brother and sister its an incalculable loss
6293066 punched a clock day in and day out one as a skycap the other as a factory worker
6293067 cant do it pal you need to press the reset button
6293068 oh holy crap i do not have my license at the moment
6293069 what is taking the car on the other side of the raod so long to come
6293070 one of the concerns is the ward 4 voting location which is in fact in ward 5 and is not ada compliant
6293071 in november in the ice and snow its just not a good fit
6293072 you think of the high school field house or the middle school gym that could cut down on some of the other problems
6293073 it never really made sense to me how we kind of had polling locations across the city
6293074 in ward 5 one precinct votes at liberty hill apartments and the other precinct is immediately next door at the masonic hall its silly in my opinion
6293075 maybe things have changed since then but i dont expect them to
6293076 there are a lot of buses that come in to pick up the kids
6293077 the conditions obviously make it difficult for everyone and i guess you are not going to be running personal bests
6293078 you have to work with whatever situation arises but things get a bit slower you spend so long warming up and then spend ages standing around in the rain
6293079 throughout the course of the day and into this evening congresswoman tubbs jones
6293080 u s rep stephanie tubbs jones family and officials at huron hospital have announced that the five term congresswoman has died she was 58
6293081 i think it obviously took him a couple years just to get adapted but i think hes made it his personal thing to make sure he displays his talent consistently
6293082 thats what i really focused on just knowing that when my number is called i can answer
6293083 thats what ive tried to focus on and i feel pretty confident with that right now
6293084 the coaches have done a great job preparing us and giving us an opportunity to learn how to recognize that type of a blitz it just shows the development in our offense
6293085 hes in a position where hes making those decisions tough and thats what we ask of all those guys
6293086 compete hard give us everything they have and make those decisions at the end tough
6293087 hes a tall target so the quarterbacks dont have any trouble finding him
6293088 hes got kind of sneaky speed hes a long stride guy and he can chew up some ground pretty quick on you
6293089 i feel really comfortable in terms knowing the offense and knowing whats expected of me
6293090 so now i feel like i can get out there and play and do what i know im capable of
6293091 i think if you ask people what their favorite counting crows record is a lot of them would probably say august and everything after i was wondering if that was yours as well or if not what would be
6293092 wow when i was really in the middle of that happening that was really thats creepy or thats powerful
6293093 in 2006 i went to my first nearfest i had an amazing time it made me feel like i was in a music camp for the weekend i got to hear bands ive known and ones i didnt know
6293094 when i first came here 28 years ago there were cool places you still had the stanley graffiti the syria mosque the decade and the sound in those venues was good in todays environment theres less places for bands to play that fit that quality of sound and venue size although we do have the rex mr smalls club cafe and the theater in homestead
6293095 theyre used to doing country and western and they do a dinner and show type of thing which wasnt what i had in mind at all
6293096 the seating is semi in the round with no seat more than 60 feet from the stage there wont be any food or drinks in the venue those will be in a big tent outside the exit doors
6293097 there are maybe 200 people around here who might go see carl palmer or allan holdsworth or the flower kings and i needed to try to attract interest from the music scene here
6293098 around the time i talked to them they had lost their bass player so it was a missed opportunity
6293099 therell be people coming from all over who go to the other festivals but to build something in pittsburgh you need to have some type of base if can build a base of 300 400 people from the area thats enough to draw from
6293100 ive also seen people bringing their college age and high school age kids to these shows lately and thats where the future lies
6293101 it is challenging to mitigate xss in a way that balances the needs of compatibility security and performance
6293102 if you deploy a security feature already knowing how to work around it i think its more security theater than anything else
6293103 david and i were elated with the cast we helped put together for the story of the florida presidential voting uproar
6293104 about that time i felt i had to head in another direction and became interested in casting casting directors are hired to facilitate the best actors available for a certain film
6293105 we then work with the movie director regarding money offers for the actors in hopes of coming up with the perfect cast
6293106 it was so wonderful to see a lot of old friends again
6293107 richard was always been that way just never comfortable talking about himself
6293108 honesty and integrity are two things you learn from golf like when you have to call your own fouls
6293109 so we use golf as a foundation for things the kids can learn about life
6293110 these grants continue our associations initiative to support multiple golf programs as well as adding to the enjoyment of the game that otherwise may not have been possible for so many
6293111 when the ball goes too high you cant see it too easy
6293112 but its ok because if it is raining for us it is raining for them
6293113 we met dale when we played at james simons gist street loft in uptown we went through hundreds of photographs and found the ones that dale thought were the most profound its a polish band called spielman kapelye and buddy boltons band from new orleans and both are pictures from 1905
6293114 bechet was arrested and expelled from most of the major countries of europe while brandwein was known to drive around the mountains in the catskills playing his clarinet drunk out of his mind
6293115 theres a story about him in an uncle sam costume made of red white and blue lights where he was sweating so badly he nearly electrocuted himself
6293116 after the second bar mitzvah tom and i got together to work on some music and then the romantic thing happened too
6293117 you can find it in calypso music a realm they explore in venezuela by jewish creole composer lionel belasco often referred to as the scott joplin of calypso on the first part of each measure theres a hesitancy a limping that rhythm exists in the habanera and throughout the whole caribbean culture also in new orleans music and greek and turkish music
6293118 its about looking around you what is part of my culture but what can we learn from others
6293119 in african american music you mostly hear rap and hip hop but there are many other things
6293120 we just want to remind people of the beauty of that and we picked these styles because we felt some sort of closeness to them
6293121 i dont like the idea of a compartmentalized society where certain things have to be the exclusive property of certain ethnic groups
6293122 little dark baby little jew baby little outcast america is seeking the stars
6293123 people are being driven apart from one another but we use our music to say that there is a greater whole of humanity common thread between all these groups of people and the music can help show this oneness
6293124 were not black and were not jewish but theres no reason why you have to be either of those things to play this music or even to appreciate it on a deep level

6293126 this is my third summer as a co coordinator with thelma patterson
6293127 i had been doing a mentoring program without funds when some people came to me and wanted to do the program on a larger scale we got funding from the phoenix project good samaritan hospital citywide and the city of dayton and started recruiting students who live in that area
6293128 and attendance is an absolute just like with a job if youre late or absent a lot youll be fired we also spent a lot of time working on attitude and the correct way to speak with people essentially they were being paid to better themselves and we really tried to open their eyes
6293129 to teach the kids nutrition and how to work for survival
6293130 theyre required to do it all seeding weeding and harvesting theres a sense of empowerment in that
6293131 we want the kids to be able to compete in the world and they have to work last year more than 100 children applied for just 25 slots we do interviews with them and their parents and they have to sign a contract
6293132 in this program we take them from where they are to the next level we gave them homework and went to the library on tuesdays where they worked on an improved reading program that stressed comprehension
6293133 i just want to see more opportunities for young people to do the right thing

6293150 and to use it here of all places how the hell are we suppose to rest in peace with a child running around here
6293151 this boy i sense inner turmoil the like i havent sense since fredrick ang here why am i sensing this
6293152 master ang is my teacher he taught me the bear blade style from the beginning master law taught me that bear blade users also use magic i am still thinking if i should even mess with magic such power could corrupt my very soul
6293153 looking for your blade cubby it is experiencing all the cuts that we have dealt to you in fact i feel another lesson for you is needed
6293154 not screaming in pain anymore you must be near death if you dont feel pain youre no fun anymore cubby
6293155 you look so much like maria that face of yours must really hurt ben
6293156 why am i always being compared to maria im my own person
6293157 you are still willing to fight when you were on the verge of death this is interesting to me most of the young cubs that are sent here accept death with no resistance like this you were willing to die just a moment ago to go to one named maria but as soon as you heard this ashley you went on the attack
6293158 you have your own enemy to defeat but for the sanity of your comrades and for the love of your loved ones stay put and get some damn sleep a warrior needs his sleep

6293160 i just wish we had a genuine redneck running for president it would be wonderful to have just one presidential candidate who didnt try to play both ends against the middle who would come out and say what they really mean a redneck wouldnt take any lip off little tin dictators like hugo chavez and would stand toe to toe with the likes of putin and ahmadimijad and hunt down al queda to the last man whatever it took a redneck would put america first and not be concerned what the rest of the world thought about it a redneck would protect our gun rights and see that laws were passed to make sure child molesters get what they deserve hed build up our military in manpower and technology because he realizes that a strong america is safer america a redneck would protect the constitution and have the guts to stand up to the people who want to take god out of public life in america a redneck would wear an american flag pin and hold his hand over his heart when the national anthem was played or the pledge of allegiance was recited he would drill in anwr off the coast and everywhere else we need to drill to end our dependence on foreign oil a redneck would make sure that if someone fathers a child that he is forced to support it and respect family values and a note to the cherry pickers lest you start accusing me of being a male chauvinist pig you can insert she for every place ive said he there are plenty of redneck ladies out there too what do you think

6293168 andrew is a terrific free kicker also in corners this is not the first one he scored
6293169 i think there was some luck but it was not surprising he scored because he practises a lot it was not by accident
6293170 we had them on their heels and unfortunately we kind of let them off
6293171 before i didnt like what i saw they play only by long ball long ball now they put the ball down and try thats beautiful to see football in a country like canada improve like that
6293172 teams go on the road to get a result and i think thats what jamaica did
6293173 they came here with a plan which was to get everybody back in behind the ball
6293174 we just wanted to go out there and make jamaicans proud also and make ourselves proud
6293175 its a better start than we had the last two times
6293176 and i think its the same start as we had in 86 when we qualified thats what we told the players after and i think if we play five more games like that well have a chance in every single game
6293177 im going to take my coat off here i dont want to look too stiff

6293180 its really a chance for me to grow in a new direction and do something a little different
6293181 i thought i had been improving every day but we saw a lot of coverages and a lot of blitz from the defense im disappointed that i struggled a little bit but at the same time its a good thing ill be able to learn and watch the film
6293182 whoever plays that position is going to be a leader for us
6293183 the kids are going to believe in him have we made that decision yet no are we in the process of trying to find out and make that decision yes we want to make sure the whole team feels comfortable with that guy hes going to have to be comfortable with everyone else around him as well were getting closer and closer as we go its going to be a guy whos ready to take on the load of coach kill he is a very very energetic guy he does a great job with our quarterbacks youve got to be tough mentally hopefully one of those guys really emerges in the next week and we can name a starter
6293184 he looks the part 6 3 and 215 lbs he can run and he can throw hes just got to continue with confidence to get him to where he needs to be a lot of it is just knowing the offense learning the new offense adapting to it and just adapting to the whole scheme of things hes a very tough tough kid he can run he can pass hes tough and hes a high character kid
6293185 right now weve got four or five starters competing for the job
6293186 to be honest i dont know whos going to be starting in two weeks theyre doing a great job controlling the offense its up in the air right now
6293187 being a young guy its surprising spring ball was good with him he was the starter for spring wed be happy with him but any one of those guys would be a great leader
6293188 the guys are coming along awful quick were improving every day
6293189 weve just got to get into that game mode if we keep working hard and listening to what these coaches have to say well be ready
6293190 i think were going to keep improving and i think were going to have a great shot up at minnesota

6293227 for the first time in the twentieth century an anti colonial liberation movement had not only discarded its own considerable achievements but had made an agreement to cooperate with a military occupation before the occupation had ended the palestinian side had no legal consultants to help it conclude a binding international agreement that its tiny handful of secret negotiators were untrained poorly educated and unmandated guerrilla leaders who ignored palestine national council resolutions as they set about dismantling the whole structure of palestinian resistance without a decent map

6293280 i have recently purchased alarm clock pro and love the program
6293281 alarm clock pro our product rocks we use it to catch satellite feed for the shows that we air
6293282 very useful and does more than just wake me up highly recommended
6293283 finally no more radio commercials in the morning wakes me up to my itunes without any problems
6293284 great app if you have a need for such things this one appears to be among the best out there
6293285 ive tried just about every alarm clock application on the mac and this one is about the best there is
6293286 looks like a much better alternative to the basic settings i use in the energy saver preference pane
6293287 i was very taken with the look and feel of awaken but it fails to wake from sleep on my mbp and therefore doesnt wake me from sleep which is a bad thing i just downloaded alarm clock pro and it woke from sleep just as one would expect
6293288 fantastic app wakes me up when i need to be woken up in hotels all over the place
6293289 when i fall asleep i leave the planet and it takes a powerful alarm to wake me up this app is it using it on my ibook g3 it creates as much volume as my desktop i would also add text telling me why i had to get up and what had to be done that day the spoken text would help me organize my day while i was still in bed half asleep
6293290 all the things you can do with alarm clock pro is simply amazing great app
6293291 the best of all the clock app available out there it has all the features that i currently have to get from several separate apps
6293292 didnt know i needed this now am not sure how i lived without it
6293293 this is a great product with features that should have been built into the mac os
6293294 having alarms on your computer is indispensable and this app does a great job of making it all easier
6293295 i started using alarm clock pro about four days ago and i love it i actually downloaded four different clocks and after using yours threw all the others away great job
6293296 alarm clock pro rocks ive only tried the shareware version so far but having my chime back is a godsend
6293297 alarm clock pro looks like a great piece of software keep up the great work
6293298 alarm clock pro is great software im happy to have it
6293299 alarm clock pro is by far the best alarm clock program that i have tried and i have tried most of the alarm clock programs on versiontracker and macupdate
6293300 i have been using alarm clock pro for quite a while now amp just love it it is one of the most useful applications i have and use it every day
6293301 thank you for latest update to alarm clock pro i suggested it to everybody before and i will keep it up now
6293302 im extremely impressed with your product named alarm clock pro
6293303 alarm clock pro deserves to be a bundle product in macintosh computers
6293304 the alarm clock pro sounds excellent for what i need
6293305 alarm clock pro is truly a wonderful app i feel like i can automate anything
6293306 you have to love a fully featured alarm program that has a background daemon so i dont have to have a program running up front its the only program i tried that can actually wake me up in the morning and i have tried them all
6293307 alarm clock pro combines all i need into one easy and fun to use package
6293308 ive enjoyed using alarm clock pro its reliable robust and reasonably priced
6293309 alarm clock pro does what i need it to i have different itunes playlists scheduled to play on different days and times they go off and it works flawlessly it is worth the shareware fee
6293310 this is one of the few shareware apps ive paid for very cool stuff worth every penny
6293311 a must have utility for those of us usually late for the meeting features a plenty and the only alarm scheduler that can wake up your mac from sleep
6293312 it does what it says on the tin simply and effectively
6293313 things that this alarm program does are beyond your regular clock
6293314 alarm clock pro is a terrific little program that works beautifully
6293315 alarm clock pro serves a useful purpose for those who might need it
6293316 the to do list feature in this product is a beautiful example of thinking about an old problem in a new way
6293317 im pleased to say that this is a great application its extremely flexible and the address book importing and snooze features are both wonderful additions in alarm clock pro
6293318 i have been using alarm clock pro since its inception great simple program that does what it says updates make it better and better love being able to record you own messages
6293319 the best alarm clock for the mac period the feature set puts it in a class of its own without any visible competition
6293320 whoa the author previously said it was impossible to wake the computer with this thing but somehow he found a way excellent to me this feature alone beats all the other alarm clocks to a pulp
6293321 alarm clock pro 6 2 1 was exactly what i had been looking for very pleased with the stability and features the integration with itunes and sleep wake up has performed flawlessly which in and of itself is worth the
6293322 this is a very clever program i love being able to set my favorite music as an alarm via itunes its easy to figure out how to use the program too and i like the various clock designs and choice of sounds including the aforementioned music
6293323 very nice stable clean app im using it in os x and use it primarily to tell me when the pizza should be taken out of the oven i cant hear the ding from downstairs
6293324 the only thing im asking is for anyone with any type of information to just please come forward
6293325 even if they see or hear just a small thing a small thing could lead to something big i just want my son back
6293326 right now were doing an intensive grid search of the downtown area
6293327 is on a strict weight loss program because of diabetes and heart failure
6293328 i need him to have at least 30 minutes a day of sustained aerobic exercise the best exercise he can do is sustained walking allowing for both arm and leg exercise
6293329 the exercise in question will require him to either go to a local park with a track or to go to a fitness center such as a health club
6293330 for the city to yield to a request from an organization that not only aided and abetted gangersterism in boston during the 80s but also has a notorious history of acting as a rogue government under the leadership of j edgar hoover is outrageous
6293331 the fbi contacted our intelligence unit to say we might want to check it out and so we called city hall
6293332 my sense is there were some conversations and it was taken down to verify what it was when they realized it was ok they put it back up
6293333 over the last 18 hours new information came to light in this case
6293334 we alerted the court to that and asked that the defendants bail be reduced to personal bail or no bail
6293335 this report supports our contention hes unable to report to work
6293336 when i heard barack obama and then read his books i thought heres somebody who honestly believes in change and believes the way we have been doing things doesnt have to be the way we keep doing them i was excited that finally someone in a leadership position believes things can be different in a way that matters to me so i made my first contribution in may of 2007
6293337 one time i set a goal to have a certain amount by midnight before one of the primaries i sent out a fundraising email and met my goal
6293338 we didnt really know each other before but then he donated a bit and we started to talk more and he got more excited and involved and even became an obama delegate to the county convention

6293361 the publicity around celebrities like paris hilton and britney spears and their small pedigree pets has fuelled the demand for handbag dogs
6293362 a pet should never be seen as an accessory and people should not be guided by fashion trends when purchasing a pet
6293363 its important that you understand the physical and mental needs of a particular breed such as how much exercise it needs when you purchase it and that your lifestyle enables you to accommodate this
6293364 generally speaking the cost of looking after a pedigree animal is more expensive than for a cross breed indeed the most frequent claim for a small pedigree dog is for cardiac disease which can run into thousands of pounds
6293365 i definitely lost my partner the best partner ive ever had

6293372 we can basically draw kids from all over the area so if we can get it going who knows
6293373 part of the challenge for me is to be a leader
6293374 we have six seniors and three juniors at practice but after that its almost like a whole bunch of sophomores
6293375 we need to step up those of us that have been there before need to lead by example we have a lot of really talented players but that doesnt make us a really good team
6293376 with dsa we try to play in as many tournaments as we can
6293377 we travel anywhere there is a good game and i mean anywhere we are trying to be seen by as many college coaches as possible
6293378 wittenberg recently contacted me i also like north carolina bowling green urbana kalamazoo college and tiffin im enjoying the recruiting process so a decision isnt going to happen anytime soon
6293379 ive been working on their conditioning all of this week
6293380 i just run them some and then we do a lot of ball work i love it and they actually pay me to do it
6293381 but the kids will improve and maybe around tournament time well be able to surprise some people if we put in the time we are going to see results because the skill level is there
6293382 morgan stallard is a good place to start when you are re tooling your team her footwork is just amazing shes had some serious coaching morgan also plays varsity basketball and run track shes such a natural athlete
6293383 while still early days we are seeing the inevitable transition of small businesses moving to online software and the word of mouth effect beginning to kick in
6293384 to be able to come back in 2007 and especially at the world cup and perform at i guess the biggest stage its the pinnacle of our sport and play reasonably well there i came away with a lot of confidence and took that into the super 14
6293385 but at the same time it means nothing if you dont continue on with it so it is just seeking that consistency which i guess has eluded me somewhat in the early stages of my career
6293386 with these new elvs it certainly creates a lot more opportunity at full back in terms of counter attack and turn over ball and getting your hands on the ball as much as you can
6293387 certainly late in the halves when the bigger guys are getting fatigued there is some scope there to try to get involved and get a few mismatches
6293388 im sorry if i did something that hurt your feeling i never meant it
6293389 no habilita recursos suficientes para recuperar los restos de las v ctimas

6293392 after 24 years in the investment business i have decided to retire from managing outside capital
6293393 at which time the fund assets will be fully liquidated
6293394 a snap back in the prices later in the year
6293395 also a fantastic vehicle for promoting south australia around the globe
6293396 this could be one of the most important decisions this council could make
6293397 what we have proposed has been to allow us to continue to provide services we have been providing to the citizens
6293398 we have decided to do this rather than wait until we are destitute
6293399 only puts more burden on people who cant afford it
6293400 i feel like i let the guys down thats soccer sometimes
6293401 i felt it was probably my only mistake of the game unfortunately thats my position when you make a mistake it often costs you it cost us dearly
6293402 jamaicas deon burton had a pretty good hold of my sleeve
6293403 these things happen in the end ultimately its my responsibility to keep the ball out
6293404 i think its come a long way i think now you have a team here on the field that can dictate play
6293405 you saw that for long stretches tonight where the guys kept possession and tried to break jamaica down
6293406 raised the bar for eligibility so we could recognize only the best entities when it comes to financial reporting
6293407 are doing the best job they can to account for the tax dollars they receive and spend
6293408 these things dont happen just because somebody is sitting in a chair
6293409 i know people get tired of us calling about little things but this is why we do it
6293410 continued commitment and dedication to agriculture and the citizens of miami county
6293411 it used to be the term stay at home mother was an oxymoron because you had to get out of the house for your sanity
6293412 if youre a stay at home mother youd better have a darned good reason to go somewhere you wonder where can i stop by on my way home from another errand
6293413 we just dont have as much money as we used to
6293414 i was famous for running here and there to get ingredients
6293415 if i was missing something id run out and get it i dont do that anymore i sit down and plan meals two weeks ahead then buy everything at once
6293416 ive always wanted to be a stay at home mom
6293417 if your supposition is that the prospects arent good anyway
6293418 i know tons and tons of mothers who choose to stay home whatever the economic difficulties
6293419 we are not staying home with our children by default
6293420 stay at home moms are very good at being frugal
6293421 often theyre the ones in charge of household finances but when youre worried that the one paycheck wont come its that much more frightening
6293422 there are times when i think if i were back at work i could afford this or that
6293423 but i dont think it would pan out in the end
6293424 we had a date night for a while once a week but it petered out
6293425 maybe it was my birthday in may last year not this year
6293426 to find a job that pays something decent i would still have to drive an hour each way at 4 30 a gallon
6293427 i go to five places in one day with three kids its horrible
6293428 how can we justify eating out when we could go to a store and buy enough for a couple days worth of meals
6293429 theres just no time to regroup none left for ourselves
6293430 im trying to work out a baby sitting swap arrangement with friends
6293431 its way too early to talk about this being a viable product category
6293432 im not sure how much of a market there is for them particularly with subnotebooks like macbook air with larger keyboards and displays getting thinner and lighter and you can get some real work done on say an iphone or a nokia e series smart phone
6293433 the eee pc has successfully explored user segments that have been ignored by other notebook vendors
6293434 for example a lot of kids use their parents notebooks but they are just too heavy to carry to school but at two pounds kids can easily put ultraportables in their backpacks
6293435 netbooks are for communicating with e mail and im browsing and things like media streaming very basic things
6293436 but theyre not just about the internet we use the term mini notebook
6293437 i wish that i hadnt as soon as i did it its not something i would ask forgiveness for but i did it i was freaked i was gone
6293438 intraday resistance in rallies is at 4460 4482 and 4519 points in an optimistic scenario crucial support is at 4375 4390 points a decisive breach of it would turn the odds in the favour of bears currently the indices are oscillating in a narrow range with some stock specific moves range expansion is likely in the coming days
6293439 are you tired of that same old leadership in d c
6293440 its time to win the hearts of the world back
6293441 each one of those small steps makes a difference to the bigger goal
6293442 its like an elevator that has left the ground floor but too many people are still doing ground floor stuff theres a whole world of opportunity to do original japan related sites and its nice to see some are taking it to the next level
6293443 thanks to everyday americans who chose to make a difference millions of lives have been saved in the worlds poorest countries
6293444 we want to remind them that the public is out there eager for them to say more about this
6293445 as long as i assume that the world is something i discover by turning
6293446 women were made for bearing children and enriching the world through the family
6293447 the poor clares are hugely important to galway i think after the doctors the psychiatrists the alcoholic counselors and everyone else has had their say people end up at the door here and seeking their prayer and consolation
6293448 as well as one of the most successful debut single to be release in the country 13 the success of utadas singles eventually lead the album
6293449 addicted to you the first single from the album breaking the one million mark in its first week and reaching 1 on the oricon singles chart for two consecutive weeks a personal first and eventually netting sales of 1 784 000 copies remaining utadas most successful single of all time

6293472 he estimated that there was at least an error rate of 4 1 in the social security databases which would result in discrepancies which could block citizens or lawful residents from working

6293489 its a little bit of a surprise how strong some of the numbers were in july
6293490 weve been waiting for some moderation but especially with some of the meat prices and how much has come through relatively recently at the retail level leads me to believe the overall number may be a little bit higher for the year
6293491 we havent seen those prices reflected in the finished products yet

6293519 its been a story of exclusion ever since he was born
6293520 when he was eight months old the doctors told us we should just put him away hed be a vegetable all his life that sort of thing well those doctors are not alive any more but i would like them to be able to see rick now
6293521 because he couldnt talk they thought he wouldnt be able to understand but that wasnt true
6293522 thats why we wanted to get him into public school
6293523 rick just cracked up they knew then that he could communicate
6293524 rick told us he just didnt feel handicapped when we were competing
6293525 what i mean when i say i feel like i am not handicapped when competing is that i am just like the other athletes and i think most of the athletes feel the same way in the beginning nobody would come up to me however after a few races some athletes came around and they began to talk to me during the early days one runner pete wisnewski had a bet with me at every race on who would beat who the loser had to hang the winners number in his bedroom until the next race now many athletes will come up to me before the race or triathlon to wish me luck
6293526 nobody wanted rick in a road race everybody looked at us nobody talked to us nobody wanted to have anything to do with us but you cant really blame them people often are not educated and theyd never seen anyone like us as time went on though they could see he was a person he has a great sense of humor for instance that made a big difference
6293527 and i hadnt been on a bike since i was six years old
6293528 we chuckle to think about that as my fathers day present from rick
6293529 rick is the one who inspires and motivates me the way he just loves sports and competing
6293530 dad is one of my role models once he sets out to do something dad sticks to it whatever it is until it is done for example once we decided to really get into triathlons dad worked out up to five hours a day five times a week even when he was working
6293531 some people have turned out some in good shape some really out of shape and they say we want to thank you because were here because of you
6293532 whenever we are passed usually on the bike the athlete will say
6293533 if not for you we would not be out here doing this
6293534 people just need to be educated rick is helping many other families coping with disabilities in their struggle to be included
6293535 in restaurants and its only older people mostly theyll see ricks food being pushed out of his mouth and theyll leave or change their table but i have to say that kind of intolerance is gradually being defeated
6293536 on the day of the marathon from hopkinton to boston people all over the course were wishing me luck and they had signs up which read
6293537 it would be a historic mistake and would continue the poverty in the affected regions
6293538 both teams played well and although i feel my partner and i performed well in all our olympic matches we delivered our best match today
6293539 no matter who won the game we provided a wonderful show for our audience
6293540 the documentation centre is closed from august 1 to august 31
6293541 the councils policy is to encourage staff to take their holidays in july and august
6293542 its dead 75 per cent of our customers are away and they are all on holiday
6293543 from a business point of view it makes life harder because there just arent as many people passing
6293544 when its busy we are with the customers when its quiet we have a chance to organize stuff
6293545 good because it allows you to plan ahead but its not so good because some people will still want a haircut and you dont know when theyll come in so you have to stay open all the time and wait
6293546 if big things happen we react we have even held emergency summits if its been really urgent
6293547 eat drink and be merry for in september we start again
6293548 they did discover the bodies of two deceased children inside of a car infront of the house
6293549 its early on we want to make sure that we are not overlooking anything and thats why we are treating it as a death investigation
6293550 its a real a shocker theres no indication that anything like this would be happening
6293551 id never knowingly vote for a gun ban candidate unless he was
6293552 our main goal is our children we give 100 percent for our children were just trying to find a fair and equitable settlement
6293553 our teachers have always been professional and theyve been so during negotiations
6293554 we believe our efforts and their efforts will be to step up and serve our kids we believe there will be no effect on our kids
6293555 i remember walking up the block to see fdr who was riding in a touring car with gov james m cox
6293556 they were very bright women and very good at discussion it was a resource for women at that time they needed some diversion from taking care of the home and children they are the women who today would be heads of companies
6293557 donna brinkman donna townsend and me donna gibson are all going to have an exhibit of our paintings in september its going to be the three donnas exhibit
6293558 presented by shepard fairey evolutionary media group moveon org and upper playground the manifest hope gallery celebrates the pivotal role that art and music play in creating cultural momentum and shines a spotlight on artists across the nation who use their voices to amplify and motivate the grass roots movement surrounding the barack obama campaign
6293559 senator barack obama is a champion for arts and culture who is the first presidential candidate to have developed a policy regarding support of the arts prior to entering office he believes that the arts should be a central part of effective teaching and learning the manifest hope gallery is a powerful and unique show of support for this unique candidate
6293560 i looked back at my life and realized that i had not had fun
6293561 so i made up my mind that i was going to do what makes me happy which is make music
6293562 we wanted to keep the prices low because the economy is bad and for independent performers there isnt a lot of money to spare
6293563 we never looked at this conference as a money making venture we just want to be able to break even after expenses to hopefully raise some money to help our causes
6293564 things have always been harder for women performers and songwriters and indiegrrl is set up largely as a result of that
6293565 still the old model for the music business is clearly outdated
6293566 so really all the workshops are designed to help anybody this isnt a showcase to foster the starving artist mentality this is to try and help great indie artists from getting lost in the shuffle
6293567 the days of playing rock star are over this is to help show people that it is possible to make a living making music without having to sell your soul
6293568 so i found my place in the folk and americana community where individuality is welcomed
6293569 if music doesnt swing like a monkey then its just not real music
6293570 things may slow me down but i am not one to give up on anything
6293571 the main thing for me and i feel this should apply to everybody is to enjoy what you are doing
6293572 we wanted to do a community recognition program spotlighting folks in the city or the township who have done something special
6293573 in future years well try to heighten this with annual planning of awards
6293574 the boys and girls committee is his true love as far as helping the community
6293575 im one of the fortunate ones because i grew up here so i got to give back to the people who gave to me a lot of things dont get done unless volunteers do them
6293576 i was a volunteer for 2 years so i really got to see that side
6293577 its an amazing feeling to be able to give back to your community volunteerism is what runs things
6293578 theyre not instant gratification it takes years to see the fruits of their work and these people have been very diligent over the years in trying to see these projects through
6293579 the vision we had in 2000 and still have now is to preseve the beautiful rural character of our township these people work hard for that vision
6293580 it takes too much work and too much make up to be famous im too add for that
6293581 we were more like boot camp for all these famous musicians who were tired of being famous we all went out every night and just had fun we did what we always did rock the house with a little southern soul it was about the music so it was a natural thing
6293582 i have pipes like leather and i love the spontaneity of singing of being carried away by the song so i embrace songwriters i know how difficult it is to mold human emotion into song form
6293583 my job is to sing the songs make the records do the work
6293584 and i feel privileged to have that job all the rest of my life came with the territory
6293585 i was a tough girl who looked and sounded a whole lot older than what i was generally a recipe for trouble
6293586 but i loved every second it was great the right people took me across the stage lights i was a baby blues singer and tina was like a big sister i never wanted to be tina i wanted to be an ette like the raylettes or the ronettes
6293587 and thats what i ended up being a bram lett
6293588 i didnt even know i was rich until i wasnt
6293589 the difference between ike and tina and delaney and me is that i would beat the hell out of delaney once he hit me i am not a victim
6293590 and you know when i finally decided to leave i went to tina who took me in gave me money kneeled with me and prayed and gave me the faith to go out and rebuild my life on my terms
6293591 one of them came up all excited and said you sounded amazing you should be a singer
6293592 i just laughed and said well ill give that some thought honey it didnt insult me why should it she liked what i had to offer what more can a singer want
6293593 they found everything from cloth that people put down the toilet to tricycles
6293594 weve had complaints for many years of odors and things and it makes sense to do the right thing and make this all one plant
6293595 thats one of the reasons we hadnt done this earlier
6293596 we had this project on the books for quite some time
6293597 shes become an adjective friends will go shopping with each other and say its so madonna thats what you want in fashion
6293598 i dont love all her looks but can appreciate them all
6293599 shes always operated from a position thats a good hybrid of contemporary pop culture the psyche of the nation but also an artistic slant and art always pushes the envelope
6293600 its something we would all like to be using a lot more but its really just starting
6293601 i felt like maybe i could talk to both sides
6293602 certainly in a museum youd like to be on the forefront of new activity and computer imaging would be at the forefront of what to do
6293603 now i come along as a copyist i cant do the original in one motion because im not van gogh
6293604 so i strike the brush multiple times to mimic the art
6293605 i guess the easiest way to think about it is youre a detective at a murder scene you got to collect a lot of evidence but you dont really know which piece of evidence is the one that cracks it open for you
6293606 thats the job so to speak of the conservators of the museum
6293607 they try to add a whole bunch of other evidence and try to make a decision about authentication
6293608 were trying to understand the kind of creative process that the artist engaged in
6293609 were in the early days of what im expecting to be an important area for researchers
6293610 i know there is a deep hunger for this film
6293611 there are vast differences among muslims on how to deal with homosexuality
6293612 for the most part they choose to ignore it as long as it is kept private
6293613 im sure god has a reason for all that has happened to me
6293614 why cant we be together and at the same time live with god
6293615 the biggest struggle was to establish relationships of trust with each of the people in the film

6293624 theres a huge social element to the game weve had this huge massive community grow out of the experience
6293625 the community is really a big factor that draws people into the game and keeps them in the game as well
6293626 its a social experience its not just an entertainment experience
6293627 its real time interaction with other people and youre not just sitting there fighting against some boss enemy that doesnt have a brain behind it

6293658 i have evidence proving that the government is backing the jewish lobby in the us and some parties inside israel
6293659 therefore there is no reason why malaysia should review its current stand
6293660 they are a bid by the government to stumble my bid to lead the country
6293661 these accusations are nothing but propaganda to tarnish the opponents reputation
6293662 but this does not mean i would engage in a war against the us
6293663 claiming that there is islam hadhari means that there is a bad islam
6293664 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
6293665 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
6293666 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
6293667 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
6293668 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
6293669 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
6293670 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
6293671 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
6293672 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
6293673 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
6293674 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
6293675 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
6293676 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
6293677 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
6293678 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
6293679 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
6293680 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
6293681 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
6293682 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
6293683 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
6293684 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
6293685 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
6293686 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
6293687 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
6293688 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
6293689 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
6293690 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
6293691 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
6293692 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
6293693 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
6293694 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
6293695 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
6293696 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
6293697 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
6293698 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
6293699 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
6293700 well give you ukraine and georgia and all you have to do is sign a non intervention treaty with us that states russia will not interfere with the israeli u s attack on iran
6293701 in part we are making them responsible for a previous owners irresponsibility which led to calls for service and unfortunately a fatality
6293702 so i dont want us to come down so hard on a new use because of what happened in the past
6293703 thats one way to keep from talking you talk while youre eating chicken wings youll choke i guarantee it
6293704 i grew up watching richard pryor and eddie murphy and all those other guys
6293705 i found out that winston salem didnt have any comedy clubs going on and it made me want to bring comedy here i like to laugh and i thought we could bring comedy here and make it free
6293706 thats how we put it restaurant first entertainment second we have a few people who come here every week because of the comedy and other people come here based on the eating
6293707 if youre funny they laugh its as simple as that
6293708 if youre not funny theyre not going to give you a sympathy laugh theyre going to let you know youre not funny youre going to hear crickets you know
6293709 this is one of the toughest crowds to come perform in front of theyre honest people if youre funny youll know because youve got everybodys attention
6293710 its pretty entertaining most of the stuff is original and it makes you think and its fun
6293711 he asked me what he could do to get up on the stage
6293712 i told him i needed a host hes been here now about 10 months
6293713 to make a living and be funny at the same time
6293714 i want to go all over the country probably up and down the east coast mostly due to travel time
6293715 but i hope to get out to the west coast too
6293716 jay jay is getting his big break on the comedy scene he got his break from being up here
6293717 you get out there and you get on stage thats where you really get to hone your stuff
6293718 you play wherever you can when you start out one of my first years of doing comedy i played a gas station im not even joking
6293719 i started out as an actor but i didnt like working with people
6293720 i started doing stand up comedy because if im going to suck im going to suck on my own
6293721 an older wiser comic than i told me once that it gets better but it never gets easier
6293722 it just gets better somehow you just get to know how to make them laugh
6293723 you know how rough it can be if youre on stage
6293724 i really cheer for them its not a competition were all here to make you laugh
6293725 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
6293726 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
6293727 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
6293728 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
6293729 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
6293730 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
6293731 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
6293732 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
6293733 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
6293734 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
6293735 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
6293736 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
6293737 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
6293738 i thought it was just a television show its not real not like star wars
6293739 zero point is determined by placing the thermometer in a mixture of ice water and ammonium chloride a salt this is a type of frigorific mixture the mixture automatically stabilizes its temperature at 0 f he then put an alcohol or mercury thermometer into the mixture and let the liquid in the thermometer descend to its lowest point
6293740 dwo slices of damado on my hoddog please no kedchup
6293741 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
6293742 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
6293743 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
6293744 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
6293745 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
6293746 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
6293747 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
6293748 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
6293749 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
6293750 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
6293751 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
6293752 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
6293753 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
6293754 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
6293755 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
6293756 expects 22 of the 25 true freshmen and newcomers to play this season
6293757 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
6293758 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
6293759 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
6293760 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
6293761 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
6293762 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
6293763 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
6293764 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
6293765 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
6293766 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
6293767 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
6293768 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
6293769 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
6293770 who are open to doing something on the production side
6293771 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
6293772 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
6293773 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
6293774 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
6293775 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
6293776 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
6293777 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
6293778 ya allah peluruku tinggal satu semoga tembakan kali ini tidak meleset lagi
6293779 over the years jamaica is very strong and i think everyone is just working very hard
6293780 i dont care about the majority of nyu students being apathetic towards sports
6293781 but the skills that ive got i should beat him every day right
6293782 its 4 1 but two of those have been in ireland
6293783 i think it was 10 9 in a four nations semi final and 23 20 in the
6293784 but i gave away 14 points too didnt want to do that in this one
6293785 so the tactics were perfect tie in the fella close him down and he played straight into my hands soon as the bell went he came straight at me it was perfect because im pretty strong in the zone
6293786 if anyone steps in and trades with me theres probably only going to be one winner
6293787 last time he fought degale he boxed him and degale was expecting a fight but darren boxed him hes well capable of doing both
6293788 i had no life so i started to question what i was doing because all my eggs were in one basket
6293789 i was in with secondary school children some who hadnt even done transition year so they were only fifteen and i had to wear the uniform ive only one picture that my mom took and i wouldnt let her take it anywhere
6293790 after being in hospital and not thinking that i would see properly again this is childs play
6293791 and he was the perfect guy my supposed nemesis but i didnt fear him
6293792 because it was redemption the world championship was a low point for me and probably for irish boxing at the time we underperformed and everyone was writing us off writing off the high performance
6293793 hell boy you aint known hell til you been through what i been through

6293795 we did i think a good job with the wii last year but were doing a great job this year because this is where the casual audience is the mass audience is here its a great control system but youve got to learn to use it
6293796 i think the biggest learning we had this year is that you port your controls up as opposed to down
6293797 we lived where somehow l2 means hit someone on the head
6293798 im really proud of how it looks it does not look like a wii game to me theres no excuse to not having the wii version looking great

6293810 dan janganlah kamu mendekati zina sesungguhnya zina itu adalah suatu perbuatan yang keji dan suatu jalan yang buruk
6293811 tercatat atas anak adam nasibnya dari perzinaan dan dia pasti mengalaminya kedua mata zinanya melihat kedua telinga zinanya mendengar lidah zinanya bicara tangan zinanya memaksa memegang dengan keras kaki zinanya dengan melangkah berjalan dan hati yang berhasrat dan berharap semua itu dibenarkan direalisir oleh kelamin atau digagalkannya

6293914 diriwayatkan oleh al bazzar dan ad daruquthni dalam kitab al afrad dari hadits ali dengan sanad yang dhatif

6293918 beriddahlah enkau di rumah ibnu ummi maktum karena dia seorang tuna netra engkau dapat melepas pakaianmu sedangkan dia tidak melihatmu
6293919 adalah rasulullah saw melindungiku dengan selendangnya ketika aku melihat orang orang habsyi sedang bernain main tontonan olah raga dalam masjid

6293921 nabhan itu majhul ia tidak dikenal melainkan melalui riwayat az zuhri terhadap hadits ini sedangkan hadits fatimah itu sahih maka berhujjah dengannya adalah suatu keharusan
6293922 aku bertanya kepada abi abdillah hadits nabhan ini tampaknya khusus untuk istri istri nabi sedangkan hadits fatimah untuk semua manusia beliau menjawab benar 5 kalaupun hadits hadits ini dianggap bertentangan maka mendahulukan hadits yang sahih itu lebih utama daripada mengambil hadits mufrad diriwayatkan oleh perseorangan yang dalam isnadnya terdapat pembicaraan

6293925 semua peristiwa perzinaan itu bermula dari memandang dan api yang besar itu berasal dari percikan api yang kecil

6294023 with lots and lots of nasty f ing wee scotsmen
6294024 yet sandy was an even better film maker and should have done more
6294025 he was head and shoulders over all of us at ealing
6294026 speech involves rationalising our feelings and impulses something film directors of the silent period discovered they could catch at first hand
6294027 they found that the camera can uniquely photograph thought actions and images speak faster and more to the senses than speech does
6294028 the mackendricks are a sept or branch of the clan henderson
6294029 this taught me something that i have used ever since which is how to take professional actors trained actors and put them up against the amateur
6294030 the result is that they feed off each other the professional actor gives the scene its pace and the amateur keeps the professional actor honest
6294031 they were high powered actors and actresses by the time we left
6294032 this is the night mail crossing the border bringing the cheque and the postal order

6294034 dawn freshens the climb is done down towards glasgow she descends towards the steam tugs yelping down the glade of cranes towards the fields of apparatus the furnaces set on the dark plain like gigantic chessmen all scotland waits for her in the dark glens beside the pale green sea lochs men long for news
6294035 epas about face means that some permit programs do not comply
6294036 i think it is fair to say that the d c circuit has repudiated the vast bulk of the bush administrations clean air regulatory reforms which were the administrations most notable and significant if not always wise environmental policy initiatives
6294037 was giving business a bit of a break was saying to states you cant do more
6294038 one of the ways states experiment is not only being more protective but being more protective more cheaply they win if they figure out a way to make environmental controls less costly
6294039 the idea was to make this information accessible to public and to state governments
6294040 even though the epa admitted that existing monitoring wasnt good enough that was just outrageous and defied the plain language
6294041 we cant have strong enforcement of our clean air laws unless we know what polluters are putting into the air
6294042 i strongly align myself with the majoritys quotation from justice frankfurter about the best tool of statutory interpretation 1 read the statute 2 read the statute 3 read the statute

6294053 based on what i have heard from the elections commissioner i think that he and his team are taking a lot of steps to ensure that outcome
6294054 united states is strictly neutral in every election around the world and we are certainly not working with any particular party our interest is in assuring a free and fair election and one that is free of violence
6294055 of course its a daunting number but youve got to start one step at a time
6294056 one said that because of our past records of not paying invoices they will not deliver our textbooks for this year until we pay for next year as well
6294057 our feeling is that vendors cannot hold us hostage we are the 15th largest district still in this nation
6294058 our labor costs are about 90 percent of our budget whats been spiraling out of control is benefits
6294059 theyre on the back end and getting all the blame
6294060 its not my intent to pass any judgment on the previous work of those involved with the instruction of our students
6294061 however i would suggest based upon student outcomes that there is additional work to be done
6294062 saginaw school district high school principals present plans to boots test scores
6294063 when i discovered i was going to have a blind child i knew which one i wanted for my kid

6294066 students in detroit public schools will begin classes with only 60 percent of the textbooks they need
6294067 students in brighton will have to pay to play sports and a program to identify students with learning disabilities was cut as the school board attempts to correct a 2 million overspending crisis for the 2008 2009 budget
6294068 the treasurer of the saginaw board of education thinks elementary and middle school teachers should share the blame for the poor performance of high school students
6294069 students showed slight increases in reading writing and science scores in the second year of the michigan merit exam which includes the act but more than half failed the mathematics section
6294070 a phone survey commissioned by detroit renaissance shows that michiganders support sweeping reform to improve the state including reforming benefits for state employees and public school teachers

6294086 but 2004 is the ancient regime compared to this year the blackberry existed then but its gone through about three generations of new technology since four years ago it was the new new thing now everyone in the media has one and everyone is getting these e mails
6294087 in an election of this magnitude it is imperative that journalists across the country are provided with the information about barack obamas thin record that is necessary to report the news in a balanced way
6294088 sometimes it takes a lot of e mails phone calls and knocks on the door to ensure readers are informed of barack obamas inexperience and lack of energy solutions john mccain and republicans across the country are committed to ensuring that everyone has access to our side of the story
6294089 pennsylvania families dont want another four years of failed bush policies and we will continue to draw attention to that fact

6294097 thanks to everyday americans who chose to make a difference millions of lives have been saved in the worlds poorest countries
6294098 we want to remind them that the public is out there eager for them to say more about this
6294099 nothing else good that was going on could receive any attention because of that issue
6294100 some investors have not been happy with the way that diller has managed the company and so they might be more open to looking at the pieces hes no longer associated with
6294101 you wanna cop some jordans i got the better kind
6294102 the plan is not neutral if it impacts on kimmets lock a boat ramp into the lehigh river
6294103 the plan is not neutral if it impacts on coca cola park
6294104 the plan is not neutral if it creates an odor
6294105 being a leader of a neighborhood which admittedly has not met much this year i think the mayor should not take it for granted that we have lost heart to fight the big fight
6294106 trust me mayor we will fight hard to undo decisions that potentially impact negatively on the east side
6294107 also i find it interesting that the developer of the hanover acres reconstruction now known as overlook terrace seeks to use leftover lehigh county money from a state grant to rehabilitate 20 homes on the east side for residents who have mental problems and who suffer drug abuse
6294108 our neighborhood will need to meet about all these issues if we were considered lately to be sleeping were now awake
6294109 what siobhan bennett refers to is this she doesnt want to treat oil and gas companies as manufacturers they are treated as manufacturers under the law and they are manufacturers they get the same deduction that every other manufacturer gets
6294110 i think it would be unwise to raise taxes on american energy production what i think we should do is take the federal royalty revenues that we will collect off of alaska and the outer coastal shelf and invest those into eighteen different alternative renewable areas
6294111 just yesterday you know i was at a demonstration of some of this renewable research hydrogen infrastructure for shuttle buses plug in hybrids
6294112 i support extending these credits in a number of areas for appliances for hybrids i also want to put money into the plug in hybrid technology
6294113 i voted to increase the cafe standards you have to deal with this on the demand side and the supply side and ive always said that i like wind solar geothermal nuclear clean coal i like it all but not one of those sources by themselves will be the solution we need diversification
6294114 one subtitle of the energy act that i supported contains all kinds of tax incentives tax credits i cosponsored this bill tax credits for new plug in hybrid vehicles extends the credit for alternative fuel vehicles tax credits for costs associated with installing alternative fueling through the end of 2014
6294115 plug in hybrids were leading that here in the lehigh valley we have a lithium ion battery sitting over here at international battery ive been in there theyve designed a battery that can take a charge for 250 miles
6294116 theres also incentives for businesses and homeowners to improve their efficiency credits for energy efficient appliances i voted for these in the past
6294117 they always refer to the energy policy act of 2005 barack obama and i voted for it john mccain voted against it
6294118 i remember i had a guy who called me and said
6294119 we disagree with siobhan bennett on how we fund alternative renewables
6294120 many of these jobs in the production sector for gas oil and coal are high paying jobs many are in organized labor others are not these are good jobs that people want
6294121 i am not going to outsource our energy industry to state run companies like aramco the iranian company the venezuelan company i dont know why she wants to incent them to do work and punish american workers and american businesses
6294122 i tried once but i couldnt get there because it conflicted with an iraq visit i tried
6294123 you know i voted for the conservation bill the energy bill that passed at the end of 2007 it imposed the cafe standards and also some alternative fuels it also incented the use of compact fluorescent light bulbs and all kinds of efficiencies
6294124 look republicans are accused of being completely focused on supply and production
6294125 you talk about the outer coastal shelf look if we increase production in this country in all likelihood it will put a downward pressure on price because youre increasing supply now that said i completely understand that if we increase our output here and opec reduces theirs there may not be a price change because oil is a globally traded commodity
6294126 but that is not a reason for us not to do anything or
6294127 now i believe that if you drill and get natural gas we can affect the price of natural gas the price of natural gas is set on a regional basis not a global basis
6294128 we pay in the united states some of the highest prices for natural gas in the world among the developed nations a lot of other countries go off shore for natural gas the scandanavian countries the british they do this they drill off shore they dont have these prohibitions like we do canadians dont we pay more than they do that price is set regionally boone pickens out there talking about compressed natural gas for cars but you have to go get the gas the natural gas we can affect prices of natural gas which is a big issue not just for american consumers but for american manufacturers i agree with boone pickens on this point i think we use too much natural gas to generate electricity he thinks we can replace it with wind
6294129 i like wind and nuclear and i like clean coal theyre all part of the solution
6294130 the truth is that we have a nuclear power plant at the gates of the 15th congressional district and that is the limerick plant
6294131 the only nuclear application im aware of that would service this area would be one that ppl was considering
6294132 yeah and if you were to site another reactor it would be sited there
6294133 i think people are learning to actually aspire to be objectified its like the highest form of flattery for teenage girls
6294134 i just feel like sexism is alive and well and misogyny

6294142 this is the second reduction in fixed rate home loan interest rates by the commonwealth bank since 11 august 2008 and reflects the recent reduction in wholesale funding costs for our fixed rate home loans the bank said
6294143 the rba has not announced any reduction in the official cash rate at this time and we cannot speculate on what they will do commonwealth said in a statement today
6294144 it is in our interest to pass on as much as we can to our customers and to remain competitive
6294145 we currently have the lowest standard variable rate of all the major banks and st george
6294146 we will review our full costs of funding at the time of any announcement by the rba taking into account any reduction in the official cash rate and do our best to pass on as much as we can to our customers
6294147 gary millers kennedy vs the machine was one of the most important things to happen in the blogosphere in the last two years
6294148 gary ive continued to enjoy reading kvm throughout the campaign youd make a great reporter and please dont take that as an insult
6294149 gary fifteen years later and youre still to the rescue more acute and heroic than ever
6294150 gary miller who started kvm and is as good a blogger as exists has not wavered in his criticism of zogbys methodology
6294151 despite the fact that you have taken a few petty and gratuitous shots at me i want to quote your web site great point on the federalist papers
6294152 smart folks are already following kennedy vs the machine for news of that us senate race
6294153 new local blogs for candidates have cropped up drawing national sized audiences like kennedy vs the machine
6294154 minnesotas conservative blog community spawned kennedy vs the machine which pushes senate candidate mark kennedy by bashing state and national democrats
6294155 from national issues to state issues to fun facts that help to personalize public figures kvm informs and educates in an insightful and often amusing way
6294156 miller as you can tell by the name of his blog is a party sycophant
6294157 gary thanks for choosing me and inviting other rational conservatives to do the same
6294158 unfortunately australia doesnt have much data coming out so we took direction from the us dollar and commodity prices
6294159 although the us economy is weaker it does seem the global markets are pricing in a loosening of monetary policy with the european central bank the reserve bank of australia and the reserve bank of new zealand
6294160 although the news is still grim for the us the rest of the world is starting to catch up
6294161 as you would expect we have been in communication with the companies for months to receive updates and weve been communicating with their regulator and the federal reserve
6294162 we continue to be concerned about what dilution would be required to stabilize fannie and freddie and what that would leave over for existing shareholders
6294163 you cant grab your food you cant grab your tv grab what you can and go
6294164 i had no idea what it looked like out there until today
6294165 it pretty much came up to my ears and chin
6294166 i saw this little kid coming toward me so i grabbed him and swam him back to the shore line and went back for the other two guys
6294167 theyre probably areas of the state that found the rains very beneficial
6294168 lasers have no place in childrens toys because of the significant safety risks ms gago said
6294169 they liked santoss result and 300 million buyback while financials continue their weak trend despite wall street overnight
6294170 i dont think you understand i didnt come to rescue rambo from you i came here to rescue you from him
6294171 oh baby it is all about the crab cones and the lychee mojitos lovely helpful staff and what a fabulous seafood menu
6294172 im also proud to be here with these three great americans your two senators and a great governor sonny perdue
6294173 the reality here is who the hell wants a new prison
6294174 after last nights disappointing sushi experience i wanted something to make up for it
6294175 thers pineapple shrimp lemon shrimp coconut shrimp pepper shrimp shrimp soup shrimp stew
6294176 and also i will sell mylar balloons and bubble tea duh
6294177 we did a google corporate event with parties that cook and they went above and beyond our expectations
6294178 one of the best burgers and definitely the best fries in the city
6294179 matt and lucy damon had a baby girl named gia zavala on wednesday aug 20th everyones doing great
6294180 now theres that look in your eyes like black holes in the sky
6294181 one of these days im going to cut you into little pieces
6294182 the first place i made it with the pixies was in holland
6294183 all i have to say ask for tina the space is beautiful i loved
6294184 hey if i have an extra 43 laying around that i dont know what to do with like that ever happens ill come back sometime
6294185 umm yeah she is pretty immediately followed by and she is reeeeallly niiiice
6294186 i dont know how to say but it is really good
6294187 we came here the day after a napa outing and i thought it was a pretty nice experience
6294188 if i could make my salads this good i would eat more salad
6294189 jewelry is the hardest thing to buy for a woman
6294190 i wish i was buffalo exchange but all the clothes people bring to me suck i just try to make do you can feel great shopping here though youll easily find the best items in the store whether or not theyre worth your time no guarantee
6294191 probably the most under recognized blog in the jblogsphere as far as i am concerned
6294192 no im not dating amanda beard ill say that i think she has a boyfriend
6294193 part of my life is kept to myself im able to relax and be with my friends those pretty much are the only people who really know the answer to that question
6294194 eww thats nasty i have never ever hooked up with michael phelps
6294195 i dont know the answer im sorry is there anything else i can help you with
6294196 we dont have an individual to whom you can write we have a dept
6294197 its a very striking confirmation of something that has been suspected for quite some time
6294198 the placenta is very sensitive to stress hormones in the mother these hormones were probably amplified during the time of the war
6294199 what we have here is confirmation that it really is a major factor
6294200 if it has been shown that wars can impact a babys brain development in this way then it follows that other types of stress like domestic violence severe anxiety bereavement or other types of loss could have the same effect
6294201 theres an important message here and we need to ensure it is translated into preventative work in pregnant women to reduce the risk
6294202 barack obama is no different only its your money he wants to spend
6294203 positive bio spots that theyve been running the balance of the summer dont appear to be making any significant connection with undecided voters
6294204 when the senate investigated the senator in charge never even called reed to testify and that senator john mccain
6294205 and whos now raising money for mccains campaign ralph reed
6294206 because of john mccain corruption was exposed and people like jack abramoff went to jail
6294207 what the obama people are doing is they apparently have developed individual targeted strategies for states and media markets within states
6294208 they will be speaking very directly to different groups of voters within those battlegrounds
6294209 we thank the lord for allowing us to be able to go back to visit our friends
6294210 he shared the example of the man that had been born blind so that gods work could become known through him
6294211 sometimes we cant see exactly why some things happen but we can rest in the fact that god wants to make himself known to others through our lives and the things that happen to us
6294212 each time we have left the abau people we did not know if we would see them again
6294213 as we were saying our goodbyes this time we were able to say to our friends if we do not see you again on earth we know that we will see you in heaven
6294214 even though the toll is so high you should be proud of what you are doing the work that youre doing here is indispensable
6294215 were going to make sure that the means are put in place to ensure that this doesnt happen again
6294216 we were able to meet many new mozambican pastors as well as deepen relationships with those that we already know
6294217 this conference really helped in the relationship aspect of our fields national church focus
6294218 this is very exciting for us as it will be our first work that has gotten to this point please be praying for the lolo people for prepared hearts and minds to receive the teaching of gods word in their language
6294219 from what we understand of this group it is a good candidate for us to work with in the future
6294220 pray that we will be known as individuals families and teams that love the lord jesus and his church as he does
6294221 our purpose for the expedition was mainly exposure to the culture research of potential mission work locations and logistics answering unanswered questions about ntms uniqueness in the country and lastly but most importantly confirmation of this being where the lord is truly leading us for career missionary service
6294222 being told this and seeing for yourself are two different things
6294223 was because of their heart for the gospel heart for the people of cambodia and a conviction that the lord is going to use them to reach the unreached peoples of cambodia no matter the circumstances standing in the way
6294224 do they have any blacks in idaho they dont have many
6294225 i sent it to about 60 parents and they were offended
6294226 the issue for me isnt whether or not the students should be disciplined
6294227 what im looking for is equity and fairness in meting out discipline
6294228 we would have no abandoned children split families or people who lie to each other
6294229 we would have lower taxes there would be no need for police because there would be no crime we wouldnt need most social services we would pay only 10 percent of the taxes we pay now
6294230 the one thing they need is better examples in their lives
6294231 they also need more help and the ymca has done that
6294232 it gave me a purpose in life and it is what would make me feel successful happy and worthwhile it gave me a moral guide and provided the anchor in my life i knew what was right i may not have always done the right thing but at least i had a guide
6294233 mr cohen you were dishonest when you stood up and called your organization a citizens watchdog organization
6294234 you are a business entity and you will be exposed someday you will get your due
6294235 it shows the court has reserved judgment on the fees
6294236 the fact that chief deputy attorney general hughes had to wave her finger in my face after the hearing shows our argument has credibility
6294237 it is very costly to litigate a case against multi national corporations
6294238 we do not check on campaign contributions before we assign attorneys it is not a condition of their work we have never had an allegation of anybody contributing for any special favors
6294239 we gotta outblock them we gotta outtackle them weve got to outhit them and hustle
6294240 its real simple stay within the legal limits of the game its mountaineers pride nothing cheap from the heart straining leave no doubt tonight they shouldnt have played the old gold and blue not this night
6294241 every time the battle was right on the cusp and no one knew victory or defeat the dog soldier would dismount drive a stake into the ground attached to the stake was a rope at the other end of that rope was his leg he fought tomahawk and knife until the bitter end the whole tribe was depending on him
6294242 let me tell you old no 35 owen schmitt no 5 pat white no 53 marc magro no 7 noel devine no 96 keilen dykes no 83 tito gonzales i can go on and on and on they became the dog soldiers that night in glendale ariz
6294243 they see the film and this and that but as ive said this isnt the charge of the light brigade we do have some bullets in our guns i think its going to be very interesting
6294244 i learned growing up on the banks of the beautiful ohio river that it was about effort
6294245 i learned from the ohio valley you better respect all and fear none villanova can beat the mountaineers but when auburn or whomever supposedly these great teams come to town we wont be shaking in our boots i can promise you there will be some dog soldiers getting ready to storm the wall and take the hill because thats the way its done in the great state of west virginia
6294246 its hard to be good in your daily walk in your daily life its hard to be a good student its hard to be a good football player its hard to be a good young man
6294247 we have the best darn leaders in football in morgantown today
6294248 before the fiesta bowl 125 young men bought into a plan eight days and seven nights with your mountaineers one young man busted curfew he was sent home the following morning if it was my son id have sent him home the following morning thats just how it is
6294249 dont worry about the 13th game and what city its going to be in worry about the first game and stop and smell the roses along the way were too fast anymore we need to savor each and every opportunity each and every outing your mountaineers play this year beginning the 30th of august at fifteen hundred and thirty hours you must stop and savor the moment and enjoy it if you do that youll have a wonderful fall youll be content youll be at peace and you wont worry about the next game
6294250 fundamental premise from the day we announced is more true today
6294251 the environment being what it is lays bare that it is the right thing
6294252 our shareholders can now decide do they like the long term profits of lendingtree do they recognize the potential of hsn the distinction between the companies are clear the stories are clear
6294253 what would an iac shareholder want for interval as part of a broader iac its unanswerable its like solving a rubics cube
6294254 maybe interval doesnt change how it operates maybe ticketmaster uses its currency for acquisitions
6294255 i dont think that substantially we felt constrained before i dont think its we now have cash and we didnt before
6294256 i think whats changed clearly is the discipline and focus with which that capital will be deployed
6294257 when that worked it worked brilliantly well ticketmaster was a phenomenal acquisition it was bought before it sold a single ticket online
6294258 we thought that would evolve into an online business but it hasnt so we sold it
6294259 theyve gone through one two three rounds of financing and theyve had some success and theres this kind of built in expectation of okay i raised money at a 20 million pre money valuation and i had 1 million uniques and then ive got 3 million uniques and ive launched this revenue model and ive got a little early traction and im raising more money and it has to be an up round so its 40 million pre money and all the sudden ive got 5 million uniques it has to be an up round at 75 million
6294260 i understand why a vc or a private equity player would say iook if youre going to take me out i need to get a return but for the buyer
6294261 we think we can improve the monetization of the site we think we can sell more display advertising drive more traffic
6294262 we had an idea a guy who was in our hr department ceo johnny taylor like any idea it may work or may not work but our odds of making htis work are much better than anybody elses
6294263 i always wanted you to admire my fasting looking at kafka
6294264 to see her in sunlight was to see marxism die
6294265 weve never had a business suddenly come and say youll benefit if you organize the sale
6294266 you can buy the 45 foot oval bar with wood paneling and brass railings
6294267 we were thinking who are the experts in recycling who could do it and put the money back in the community
6294268 a lot of local companies dont see the advantage and significance of contributing to the community to donate surplus or donate furnishings when they are refurbishing or closing
6294269 my markers arent quite in the right position can you fix them
6294270 i think other profs markers are wrong i dont know if they should be further east but definitely they need to be by a river one of the big ones
6294271 can you please send me the latitude and longitude of the correct position
6294272 this decrease occurred because new added subscribers were not sufficient to offset our normal cancellations during the period
6294273 if terria wins the bid to roll out the national broadband network the very first thing i will be doing is contacting telstra chairman donald mcgauchie and telstra ceo sol trujillo and offering them a substantial equity stake in the network company
6294274 i think if telstra came on board theyd be assured that the network company was being operated for everyones benefit
6294275 like any equity player you cant be a shareholder in a company unless you own some shares if we win the bid they will then have the option of coming on board
6294276 only an independent network can provide open access and competitive pricing for 98 per cent of australians
6294277 no country in its right mind would want this pervert at large on its soil
6294278 it doesnt bother him im a bit nervous but him nothing
6294279 the cameras were coming on this morning its good experience for him because hes got to get use to that hes not fussed by anything
6294280 he doesnt even want to know who hes fighting it just doesnt bother him
6294281 i saw his parents the other day after training and said this is a big fight they said is it he didnt tell us anything
6294282 he doesnt want to see tapes or anything like that he says put me in front of them and ill fight them its a very carefree attitude
6294283 its a good thing hes not overawed by who hes fighting and hes kinda like that bloke bolt that just won the olympic 100 and 200 metres hes not fussed
6294284 if the opportunity came tomorrow wed take it and we would win but we would be in even better stead if he had five more fights
6294285 if mundine makes the middleweight limit i will beat him i am not fighting him above 72 58kgs the middleweight limit

6294290 st marys is definitely one of the better if not the best teams in the area they outcommunicated us and were far more consistent
6294291 we work a lot on being the first to the ball on the 50 50s and any contested ball i felt we were more aggressive and outhustled them
6294292 we always tell the girls that if they know the defense has their back take a chance on those balls in the air i felt we finished off our shots very well tonight thats been a focus for us
6294293 im glad its over if we learn the lessons st marys taught us about communication and aggressiveness its worth it
6294294 at the same time we had a lot of players in new positions for them and first game jitters might have had a lot to do with it we did ok for the first 10 minutes and then got tired and stopped hopefully we will be more comfortable the next game
6294295 as in any first game there are some things we need to work on but its mostly little things for example a cross pass we have to learn to be there because in some matches youre only going to get one or two chances
6294296 nothing else good that was going on could receive any attention because of that issue
6294297 some investors have not been happy with the way that diller has managed the company and so they might be more open to looking at the pieces hes no longer associated with
6294298 im delighted to welcome such a diverse group of member companies
6294299 the expansive nature of our membership continues to reflect the transformation of our industry and the broadening of abms footprint
6294300 its a pity for a big country like the to make such a small statement
6294301 nothing else good that was going on could receive any attention because of that issue
6294302 some investors have not been happy with the way that diller has managed the company and so they might be more open to looking at the pieces hes no longer associated with
6294303 i just thought keep fighting keep fighting dont be nervous just smash dont be weak play more aggressively
6294304 ive been preparing for this for two years im 34 years old im not a young player my back hurts always and i always feel very tired
6294305 sometimes i just want to give up but i keep fighting because i wanted to play in the olympics
6294306 i feel that all the chinese are cheering for me this is my home town im very lucky because so many people want me to win
6294307 my father got so nervous that he didnt want to come
6294308 it doesnt bother him im a bit nervous but him nothing
6294309 the cameras were coming on this morning its good experience for him because hes got to get use to that hes not fussed by anything
6294310 he doesnt even want to know who hes fighting it just doesnt bother him
6294311 i saw his parents the other day after training and said this is a big fight they said is it he didnt tell us anything
6294312 he doesnt want to see tapes or anything like that he says put me in front of them and ill fight them its a very carefree attitude
6294313 its a good thing hes not overawed by who hes fighting and hes kinda like that bloke bolt that just won the olympic 100 and 200 metres hes not fussed

6294315 no country in its right mind would want this pervert at large on its soil
6294316 el ritmo ha sido demasiado para m y al final lo he pagado
6294317 its just like the ryder cup format with one point if you win a match and half a point if you tie
6294318 it could be 8 0 on saturday and sunday there will be eight more points
6294319 they have different criteria for team selection up there than we do
6294320 ours is based on a point system in ndga tournaments we sponsor in north dakota
6294321 we probably have 150 golfers with points and whoever comes out on top is on the team tomhoge from fargo is one of the top collegiate golfers and he was invited but because of a schedule conflict he couldnt participate
6294322 irecognized garth collings hes one of the top golfers in manitoba
6294323 rick kuhn has played on at least one team and mike podolak has been the captain four or five years
6294324 these guys all compete against each other all year long and for one tournament they get together as teammates and its a different atmosphere
6294325 youve got the same pride associated with it that you do on the national level with the ryder cup the guys really go after

6294349 we usually go in on the financial side then show what we do on the conservation side
6294350 i believe there is a need for all of us to go green and what we do enables them to get started

6294361 i didnt have any idea about sports until they said you cant practice so i was pretty unprepared for it
6294362 i dont think im nearly as nervous as my parents are

6294364 theres got to be in the back of my mind what am i going to do

6294369 i just want to go out there and enjoy it
6294370 im playing not too bad im hitting it fairly well having a little trouble with some hooks here and there but my putting has improved a lot im not as tentative im trying to be a little more aggressive its a different mindset
6294371 i really enjoy being out there and i enjoy the competition its nice to have butterflies in your stomach and to go out there and compete
6294372 the calibre of player has really improved a lot the last few years

6294383 if people get down there on the floor and want to start blowing kazoos and making a scene we want to make sure weve got people who stand in front of them with obama signs
6294384 is it typical for a losing candidate to have their own whip team no but its also not usual for a losing candidate to get 18 million votes either
6294385 we have been and are working closely with the obama campaign to make sure we have an exciting and unified convention
6294386 our delegate whips along with the obama delegate whips are a part of a team that will be on the floor of the convention to make sure delegates have everything they need whether thats answering questions or passing out signs during hillarys speech the whips are a traditional part of every conventions floor operations

6294395 we dont deny that the incident affecting qf 31 the hole in the side diversion to manila was really serious while we acknowledge the seriousness of some incidents others represent a huge range of engineering incidents not all of them serious
6294396 we have very few incidents really how we respond to these incidents is what matters our policy is safety before schedule and holding up departures when we must

6294408 at the end of the day its always about how well you commit to the character if i didnt feel it was morally sound or that it would be easily misinterpreted that im just c thomas howell in soul man i wouldve stayed home
6294409 when i first read the script i was like what black face but when i saw him act he like became a black man it was just good acting it was weird on the set because he would keep going with the character hes a method actor
6294410 when people see the movie in the context of the film hes playing a method actor whos gone to great lengths to play an african american the movie is skewering actors and how they take themselves so seriously audiences that have seen it so far have totally embraced the character
6294411 mr cruises appearance was supposed to be a surprise for his fans worldwide paparazzi have ruined what should have been a fun discovery for moviegoers
6294412 while these pictures were taken without breaking any criminal or civil laws weve decided to pull them from circulation effective immediately
6294413 reps are reportedly having the image of a fat balding cruise pulled from the internet as quickly as sites can put it up
6294414 we heard their concerns and we understand that taken out of context the site appeared to be insensitive to people with disabilities
6294415 this population struggles too much with the basics to have to struggle against hollywood were sending a message that this hate speech is no longer acceptable
6294416 some people have taken this as making fun of handicapped people but were really trying to make fun of the actors who use this material as fodder for acclaim
6294417 is an r rated comedy that satirizes hollywood and its excesses makes its point by featuring inappropriate and over the top characters in ridiculous situations
6294418 it was very close and i still cant believe i won it
6294419 the crowd helped me very much and i am very excited to be in the quarterfinals
6294420 these kinds of matches for the last year or so i was losing them
6294421 at some point it makes a difference because you have confidence from these kind of matches and you build up from there
6294422 i lost my rhythm a little bit on my serve because of the wind in the first set
6294423 i couldnt find it in the second as well but still i was fighting to the end and im pleased with this win
6294424 i am so happy with my level of play today
6294425 i always play well here in new haven and i am hoping to play my best
6294426 i was serving and volleying and then i tried to stay back and wear him down it worked
6294427 i was hitting everything for a winner and everything was going 100 percent my way
6294428 when the match kind of got tight in a couple of points i started to panic maybe a little bit
6294429 he is a tough opponent but i played a pretty clean match for me
6294430 i served really well i took my opportunities when i had them
6294431 do i really need this will i end up wasting this is this an extravagance i can live without
6294432 do i really need this will i end up wasting this is this an extravagance i can live without
6294433 national polling really does not matter until after the second convention
6294434 the kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who gave a marriage feast for his son 3 and sent his servants to call those who were invited to the marriage feast but they would not come
6294435 the wedding is ready but those invited were not worthy 9 go therefore to the thoroughfares and invite to the marriage feast as many as you find 10 and those servants went out into the streets and gathered all whom they found both bad and good so the wedding hall was filled with guests
6294436 but when the king came in to look at the guests he saw there a man who had no wedding garment 12 and he said to him friend how did you get in here without a wedding garment and he was speechless 13 then the king said to the attendants bind him hand and foot and cast him into the outer darkness there men will weep and gnash their teeth 14 for many are called but few are chosen
6294437 is the wedding of christ and his church and the garment is the virtue of charity a person who goes into the feast without a wedding garment is someone who believes in the church but does not have charity
6294438 since we know neither the day nor the hour we should follow the advice of the lord and watch constantly so that when the single course of our earthly life is completed cf

6294440 lyle being such a threat running the ball makes it difficult for other teams to focus on stopping our passing game but its hard for them to put eight guys in the box to stop lyle because they know we can throw the ball too
6294441 hes done a good job of taking care of the football too thats why we won seven games last year
6294442 theres no question because of that athletic ability were going to be able to do some things this season
6294443 everyone is obviously going to associate me with penn hills i was there for 32 years 22 of those as head coach
6294444 all my successes obviously have been at penn hills as soon as you hear neil gordon you think of penn hills and there is nothing i can do about that right now
6294445 but make no mistake about this and i want to make it clear i am a shaler man now it is a whole new beginning for me
6294446 when jacque did leave i had the opportunity to go with him to hampton as an assistant coach
6294447 but the thing that convinced me to stay at shaler were these kids here
6294448 their work ethic their attention spans buying into the system and the fact that they want to learn is something every coach wants in kids and these shaler kids have all of that ive fallen in love with these kids
6294449 you know the reason i love these kids already is that they dont just work hard when you are looking they take it upon themselves to work at getting better all the time they are my type of kids
6294450 i think we have a fairly nice group of skilled kids
6294451 junior running back jesse dellavalle obviously is one of them the other tailback is senior dan mcginley who was a great player for shaler last year and a sprinter on the track team i grew up with his family and i know what hes all about
6294452 a kid with whom i have really fallen in love is junior john orr a fullback who is a hard nosed tough guy and the two wideouts seniors brian gary and steve wirkowski are impressive kids along with the two senior tight ends doug rodgers and rob holtz
6294453 so with those kids we are confident we have some guys who can do some things with the ball in their hands but
6294454 they are all gone from last year we are starting over in that regard it isnt the end of the world but it will be a process
6294455 the only experience that the seven or eight linemen who are vying for spots have right now is jv experience they have never played on a friday night under the lights like i said it will be a process but i am dedicated to making it work
6294456 ive had some pretty good quarterbacks and he is as good as any quarterback ive had
6294457 he probably could be a tailback if he wanted to be he could be a wideout he could be a safety an outside linebacker if he bulked up
6294458 i really think he could play a number of positions
6294459 i guess i can play whatever i want at the next level
6294460 when you get an exceptional athlete they make everybody around them on the team better
6294461 i told jeff the difference between a good player and a great player is that a good player makes a team good but that a great player makes everyone around him that much better hes a leader both on and off the field
6294462 he gives us that run threat in addition to that throw threat and that is really hard to defend
6294463 he is really a threat when he gets to the perimeter to run the ball he has very good vision hes a dangerous type of runner and he throws the ball extremely well too
6294464 no matter what he picks up or tries hes just a natural
6294465 i really think his strongest attribute and what makes him so good is his competitiveness
6294466 he hates to lose hes as competitive as anybody i have ever been around
6294467 ive been playing since i was 5 or so and in eight years of midgets we only lost maybe five games its just all i knew was winning since i was so young so i dont want to settle for anything less
6294468 those are two talented young men two talented young men who we are really counting on this year
6294469 i am pretty excited about moving up to the quad a level and to be honest i feel comfortable coming into the season
6294470 i am looking forward to it i think we have done everything we can to prepare for it
6294471 i mean there is the size factor but it is probably more depth than anything they are going to have fresh bodies and there might be a series when they have seven new fresh bodies going out on the field and a bunch of our guys are still out there going both ways
6294472 our conditioning has really picked up because we knew that it had to
6294473 if we do have a lot of kids who are playing both ways they really need to be in shape
6294474 if they try to key on me then vinny will really hurt them
6294475 with his arm he can throw it 60 yards he has such an arm that if they want to come up and play the running game vinny can hurt the other team with our passing game he can really read defenses and choose the best routes to throw to he is a great quarterback
6294476 i feel comfortable that in a tough situation when we need a first down i can turn around and hand it to ian from there then he can do what he can do he makes it so much easier to have a balanced offense
6294477 coming into this year we are not quite sure what is going to come out of it but i think no matter what level you are playing your goal always has to be to get to heinz field
6294478 proclamando por deus para tirar do trono a chamada jezabel
6294479 the crazy thing is that we will most likely be moving back down in two years
6294480 the big differences between class aa and aaa are depth and size
6294481 teams in class aaa in most cases are bigger stronger more physical and faster they also have more depth we have good athletes but not as many overall depth is my biggest concern
6294482 weve been fortunate to scrimmage both knoch and hampton the last few years
6294483 so we are somewhat familiar with their programs we will not be traveling as much as we did in the tri county north we havent played knoch since 1979
6294484 we do have a good group of kids coming back but it will be hard to replace bair
6294485 we will be throwing the ball a little more than we usually do
6294486 we had planned to use tim and graduate alex whisler as the feature backs in a wishbone offense
6294487 but alex suffered a season ending injury so we switched back to the i formation with tim as the feature back we didnt know that he would become a premier back he really pounded it out for us
6294488 our offensive line should be as strong if not stronger than last year
6294489 henry was voted to the first team of the all greater allegheny conference team last year we may move him to guard this year
6294490 we have 65 kids out for the team and 17 are seniors were hoping the success we had last year will carry over to this season
6294491 we only had five starters returning last year and finished with an 8 3 record for the second year in a row
6294492 this year we have seven starters back and are hoping for the same magic we had last year
6294493 we are fortunate to have sinclair and devlin returning in the backfield
6294494 both were voted first team all greater allegheny conference last year both are also returning starters on defense
6294495 hes a double threat who can run and throw the ball
6294496 our biggest concern is to fill the vacancies we have on the offensive and defensive lines
6294497 it was tough to leave shaler but its better for my family to have me at hampton
6294498 i was hired at the end of june so i only had one month to put together a coaching staff meet with the kids and set up a summer conditioning program
6294499 we will be running the wing t on offense and will be using the 50 defense
6294500 the kids are handling the transition quite well the attitude of the boys and the coaching staff is very positive everybody is very enthusiastic about the upcoming season
6294501 she taught all of my kids it was her life she was a professional woman who didnt have a family of her own the people of the church were her family
6294502 she had high expectations of herself the motto of presbyterians was to do everything decently and in order that was margaret
6294503 she was a god fearing lady and she was a lady
6294504 she told me that her favorite bible verse was god is love and she truly believed that and lived her life as though god is love
6294505 avem ntre noi pe domnul ef de la poli ie care poate are s ne spun ceva n leg tur cu noile ordine
6294506 the last restart it did it coming to the white flag fortunately we were able to get it there
6294507 na estr ia vi na casa da minha filha com todo mundo mas amanh quero ficar em casa
6294508 para mim a final foi ontem a medalha de ouro j veio com aquela vit ria
6294509 ele me ligou e disse que venceria por 2 a 0
6294510 ele me prometeu que se passasse da primeira fase chegaria na final
6294511 henry has come out and he has really impressed me so far as big as he is he has a good set of hands on him and he is an impact player for us
6294512 you can just see the excitement in martins eyes having someone that big he can throw to opposite matt
6294513 probably the biggest area that we have to work on is our kicking game
6294514 that is really where we are going to have to zero in and right now it is an awful big concern we picked up two soccer players and we are pleased with their legs and think they have a fine opportunity
6294515 the strength is our line we have almost all of them back
6294516 we have always been a running football team and it wont be any different this year we do have a fine quarterback and we can have success through the air too
6294517 she was someone who loved to be outside in her flower bed digging around and making arrangements
6294518 and she could make the most beautiful arrangements out of nothing it was incredible
6294519 she knew exactly where he was during the entire war when most people had no idea where their loved ones were
6294520 both she and her mother just loved flowers and garden clubs were really big back then
6294521 especially historical books and books about former first ladies she loved those
6294522 she always said that if she hadnt met dad she would have been a career woman
6294523 fazia filmes que os cr ticos definiam com tr s as angst ang stia aliena o e am rica

6294529 i think well be able to mix it up pretty well with running and passing
6294530 it seems like if we can just develop some linemen and get some experience in non conference play we can have a decent season
6294531 we are looking to improve our program in all areas
6294532 we will have a young nucleus of players who will improve from week to week
6294533 we emphasized that we need to work a little harder and its paid off
6294534 hes done a lot of work in the offseason on his body and arm strength and its paid off
6294535 hes had a good camp and has really become a strong leader
6294536 our kids are always used to playing football into late november and that didnt happen last year the kids realize when they put on that football helmet with the star on it theyre playing with that perry pride that means a lot
6294537 we played many underclassmen last year and it showed but we did improve as the season progressed and we expect to be vastly improved this season
6294538 we will count on them to set the tone for the year
6294539 we had nine seniors and only two were starters we have almost everybody back
6294540 i put an emphasis on weight training and improving our speed
6294541 we have one heck of a weight room and the kids are taking advantage of it we have 16 kids who are benching 320 pounds or more and two benching 400 we also went through an eight week running program to improve our overall speed
6294542 were not ready to challenge thomas jefferson for the big seven conference title yet but we will not be pushed around like we were last year in fact things are coming together faster than they did in my previous two coaching stints at peters township and butler its exciting to see how quickly were improving
6294543 the injury to brian gave orlando torres and arthur james a chance to play last year and both rushed for 1 000 yards
6294544 its great to have brian back in the picture hes fully recovered and ready to pick up where he left off
6294545 were giving tyler another opportunity to work his way back into the lineup
6294546 what happened in the past stays in the past its a new year and he comes in with a clean slate
6294547 we have a nice nucleus of returning starters back and a hungry group of kids who have been waiting for their chance to start
6294548 its a big difference coming into this season because i know the kids a lot better than i did last year at this time
6294549 ive been able to work with them for a year and had them on an offseason conditioning program i also know more about the teams in our conference it should be a lot easier preparing for our opponent each week
6294550 he has the physical tools to be a great player
6294551 duane has moved to tailback while mike stays at fullback
6294552 both were also part time starters on defense at linebacker
6294553 we lost a talented group of 25 seniors to graduation
6294554 we are young and inexperienced we need to mature quickly
6294555 our biggest concern is that we have a lot of unproven players
6294556 they need to step up and fill the starting spots vacated by our senior class
6294557 hes come a long way since i first saw him going into his junior year
6294558 last year nobody really knew too much about him when the coaches came around and visited in the spring they saw his body and how much he developed and thats when they became interested i dont think ive ever had a kid whos been as highly recruited as a junior as adam gress
6294559 i feel like i proved a lot last year but this year i think ill definitely be able to be more consistent
6294560 with the way camp is going i think ill do pretty good
6294561 i think that confidence comes from his hard work in the offseason
6294562 he feels good about what hes done and he understands hes still got a lot to do
6294563 after checking out a lot of places it ended up being what i was looking for
6294564 i wanted to go to a place with a small town feel good football and good schooling
6294565 hes done what he needed to do in the offseason
6294566 now well see what he does when the real football starts
6294567 we have to run the ball and we need a line to run the ball we have some kids there already and we are working in some other kids i think we will be ok
6294568 we have to play good defense and work with field position when we do get the ball we need to play ball control we have to be methodical and get first downs
6294569 he is really matured from his freshman year and he has really developed and grown physically
6294570 he is doing everything we have asked him to do terrell has been to all of our workouts and he is starting to understand our offense he has a strong arm and decent feet we are excited about him
6294571 we were so spoiled last year with all the weapons and this year we are going to have to be more of a patient offense
6294572 we are hoping to grind out 10 or 11 play drives we need to play ball control we still expect to win games and our confidence level is high
6294573 tem o dever de ser contra a tortura mas n o contra o terrorismo cuja pr tica absolve ideologicamente como arma leg tima de luta armada
6294574 weve raised questions throughout the process particularly in relation to the implications to the nonproliferation treaty
6294575 it is a very important document for the u s and india
6294576 it would be no secret that we would like to see more conditionalities around the agreement
6294577 a lot of people have raised questions and many people think the civil nuclear deal does not fit into the nonproliferation framework that is not our view
6294578 the punjabi dialogues songs and dances went against the film the bihar distributor paid a whopping amount of money to buy singh is kinng and is now going to lose a hefty amount
6294579 ive heard that the sikh theme have gone against the films success in bihar but i dont understand why we were aware that some areas would reject the films usp namely the punjabi ambience
6294580 surprisingly the film has done extremely well even in west bengal where we thought the audience wouldve trouble connecting with the theme theres really no explanation for what has happened to singh is kinng in bihar
6294581 but jab we met didnt thrust the bhangra culture up audiences throats like it or not the rest of the country is not as fond of punjabi culture as bollywood
6294582 its great to be able to come home and spend time with my best friend whenever we get the chance
6294583 i never felt like jumping off a bridge last year
6294584 none of us were happy with the production but we earned it but i think if you looked at it logically intelligently boy there might be some reasons for that the injuries
6294585 everybody in the room knows the numbers you guys are really helpful with that
6294586 we dont feel good about it were not happy about it we know we need to move forward and get better
6294587 hes really got a good relationship with the other players
6294588 hes earned their respect hes good at helping the other guys along from that standpoint hes a leader he would admit that he can certainly improve upon things late in the season he didnt play as well as he couldve hes committed to correcting that
6294589 even the times we did give christensen protection it was a new thing for him
6294590 he wasnt used to that so he mightve gotten a little more antsy than he normally wouldve been
6294591 he needs to expect more consistency out of us we need to be more consistent with our protection and giving him time obviously 46 sacks is a ridiculous number
6294592 the depth chart is written in very light pencil a light lead no 2 pencil that can be erased easily
6294593 well have eight to 10 guys competing for the five spots
6294594 the thing about seth is hes way ahead of his years in maturity knowledge spirituality
6294595 hes a guy ive always looked up to from our first year here and i still look up to him now hes so knowledgeable in football and life hes someone you can go to no matter the problem hell listen to you
6294596 it wasnt that big of a deal to me i thought it was kind of funny
6294597 i tell you what zero would be a heck of a goal
6294598 thats what everybody wants i think the word eliminate or reduce is better
6294599 every day you have to go out and give your best
6294600 thats something coach morgan tells us all the time the two deeps could change any moment and youve just got to go out and give your best effort
6294601 what has been your best and worst experience since starting your business
6294602 my best experience has been having my designs published in paintworks quick and easy painting and painting magazines my worst experience havent had one yet
6294603 the only marketing i have done is just the exposure with the painting magazines
6294604 i am retired and selling and publishing subsidizes my income and makes life a little easier financially plus i dont like idle hands i love creating and all of the time i was working i was motivated towards retirement so that i could do what i loved
6294605 i didnt have dreams of going to any place in particular for college
6294606 i really havent followed college football all that much i just liked the steelers
6294607 id watch pitt penn state but it wasnt like i was a diehard pitt fan
6294608 defensively hes always around the ball he makes all the calls on all the coverages calls all the fronts everything that we do i think defensively not many people know about him but hell come up and hit you make an interception run back a punt all that stuff
6294609 in high school ive played quarterback and the other position college recruiters had me at was receiver i didnt want to go into college not having played that position a lot
6294610 the kickoff team and the punt team are about the only times hell be off
6294611 although one of the nice things is that we have guys who can play so if e j needs a break we have people who can fill in for him
6294612 phil peckich has been a starter on defense since he was a freshman and is a speed guy
6294613 it will be different than when we had christian but if things go the way we think they will there will be the pressure to try and stop both of them
6294614 they talked about me and christian last year and they talk about me and my cousin so its not like im not used to it
6294615 i just play the game thats what coach tells me just do what you do
6294616 the coaching staff tells us to stay on an even level and not to get too high or too low thats what i try to do
6294617 back in the day i never put a quarterback on defense
6294618 now i know that you have to put your best athletes out there
6294619 you just have to be truthful with the kids and explain the work that you have to put in to turn it around
6294620 i can hoot and holler all day long but theyre the ones who have to go out and play
6294621 we were in a lot of the games in the first half
6294622 but the second half is when things began to go not so well
6294623 the goal of every high school coach is to build a program that is competitive every year
6294624 we are one of only six class aaa schools that have qualified for the wpial playoffs five years in a row were very proud of that streak
6294625 weve had a senior laden team that past few years but this recently graduated group of 25 seniors is the most successful weve had in 27 years
6294626 they set the bar high for our next senior class
6294627 the 2009 senior class saw what it takes to reach the level of success we had last year
6294628 they feel the obligation to continue that level of success
6294629 but it will be more of a slash role sort of like kordell stewart did with the steelers early in his career
6294630 i stress the importance of cross training my players at multiple positions santino has been practicing at quarterback since his freshman year we have a set of plays called our turkey package that has santino lining up at quarterback its perfect for him because we like to run the option
6294631 we have three players who are capable of running our offense
6294632 that gives us a lot of flexibility especially if somebody gets injured
6294633 we have a lot of starters to replace especially on defense
6294634 we have talented players ready to step in but they are unproven and inexperienced we need them to mature quickly
6294635 thomas jefferson has to be considered the team to beat
6294636 until somebody beats them they are still the no 1 team in the state
6294637 i think this year were making a lot more strides in camp
6294638 our young players received a great deal of experience last season we feel we will be competitive
6294639 a smart player almost like another coach on the field
6294640 the kids worked so hard during the offseason that we feel a step ahead of things as the season starts
6294641 and thats a good thing moving into such a tough conference with no non conference games as a luxury this year
6294642 hes making good reads and getting the ball to the correct receiver
6294643 being in the second year of a coaching staff and with the players we have we feel were in a good position to break into the middle of the pack in the allegheny conference
6294644 augie and pat are very good friends off the field and very good athletes
6294645 if we can just stay healthy we can be competitive
6294646 we had a lot of them in there playing last year but they just dont have a lot of experience
6294647 my overall goal is to restore the pride and dominance of the westinghouse football program
6294648 we lost a decent amount of players but the nice thing is we have a group of seniors coming back that are developing into leadership roles im optimistic
6294649 whenever you can run the football offensively it makes you feel secure in what youre doing
6294650 est n mejor que hace cuatro a os est n mejor que hace ocho a os si no entonces por qu diablos querr an hacer la misma cosa pregunt
6294651 en sitios como martinsville para que la gente vuelva a trabajar
6294652 mi trabajo en esta contienda es decir que honro su servicio pero no sus pol ticas
6294653 debemos dar incentivos tributarios a las empresas que se quedan aqu
6294654 it is now proposed to raise the required resources by monetising a part of the companys investments through a phased divestment of certain investments preferably as inter group sales wherever feasible at prevailing market prices over the next 6 to 8 months
6294655 je hais le t l phone je ne vois pas beaucoup de gens j cris je nage je bois
6294656 if you look at jeannette last year it had great team chemistry everybody talked about terrelle pryor but jeannette was a lot more that just him those other players were just so unselfish and played well together
6294657 thats how we want to be chemistry wins in football
6294658 weve got some very good skill position players returning but i like our potential on the line
6294659 we understand that and its one reason we were extra tough on the players in conditioning this summer
6294660 we wanted to get the ball in jeffs hands more often and we just felt this was the way to do it
6294661 he will be a big key for us we will be looking at him to do things on both sides of the football and as a leader
6294662 so far he has proven that we can depend on him he has been at every workout session all summer long and he is a leader on and off the field
6294663 he played the position sometimes last year so its not brand new but lining up there every play that is what is new to him
6294664 i think i play running back better than receiver because i have more of a chance to focus there just playing one position
6294665 i feel more comfortable at running back than receiver i got a few chances to run the ball last year when our starting tailback came out so i have a feel for it
6294666 this position change is pretty much the same as when i moved to linebacker
6294667 physically he is a strong kid that goes up and gets the football
6294668 he has good hands and is a solid blocker out there we are definitely going to miss him there but we have four quality receivers that we think can step up
6294669 a lot of teams have been in this position from time to time
6294670 itll be tough to maintain that kind of football team they set the bar high
6294671 hopefully we can get the kids to buy into the fact they can get there we certainly talk about it its something to aspire to its certainly what were shooting for and we talk about it and stress it with the kids
6294672 hes a good kid who works hard its his time to step up
6294673 hes facing his first start and his first time leading this football team im sure hes got a lot of stuff on his plate
6294674 he has all the skills to succeed at the position
6294675 its also competitive from top to bottom so i guess it depends on how you look at it its certainly not going to be easy in the new conference we look forward to the challenge
6294676 ive always had a quarterback who i felt comfortable with experience wise
6294677 they usually played the year before and were groomed our games were so close last year we didnt bring in the young kids weve got two guys with jv experience and theres a big difference between a saturday afternoon game and a friday night game
6294678 i think you have to be right up front with the kids
6294679 this year will be a great learning lesson were facing the toughest schedule ive ever seen at plum i tell the kids you never know what can happen im not negative with the kids but realistic
6294680 im looking forward to working with the guys ive been here several years im just switching over to a little more responsibility its been a nice transition
6294681 we have some seniors that i believe will be good this year
6294682 i prefer the keystone conference because its more familiar territory
6294683 i was shocked that we moved up since our enrollment was smaller than it was two years ago
6294684 we had some good battles with pine richland over the last four years
6294685 we hate to see greensburg salem leave because of their close proximity to us
6294686 anthony suffered a broken hand while playing basketball in july
6294687 he should be back for the start of the season
6294688 our biggest concern is to fill graduation losses at wide receiver and cornerback
6294689 when you have a 2 000 yard rusher returning theres a lot to be excited about
6294690 i think our goals this year are going to fall along the same lines as last season
6294691 we want a winning season want to go to the playoffs want to win a playoff game want to make a run for a wpial title and i think that we have potential to do a lot of that stuff
6294692 the kids are working very hard in practice and were getting better each day
6294693 hes like a sponge taking it all in hes a good athlete and hes just going to get better and better
6294694 with terrelle and everyone else gone some people say well only win two games which is all good you dont know how anythings going to play out well just play our hardest and see how it plays out
6294695 thats really one thing the coaches have noticed is theyre not as boisterous as the guys of the last few years and they definitely lead by example
6294696 you may be surprised by this but we were really not happy to see them leave our conference
6294697 they have excellent athletes and had some great football teams we had some great games with them over the years and we always felt that when we went into the playoffs having played teams such as clairton and duquesne that helped us immensely
6294698 we are not happy to see them leave thats the honest to goodness truth
6294699 it was good to face them because they were always tough
6294700 clairton leaving may even hurt us a little bit they were a good team to face and it gave us momentum toward the end of the year
6294701 we have had a pretty good football team for several years now
6294702 and we have had that target on our back right along thats what you work for as a program to establish that type of situation
6294703 we think that year of experience is going to help him immensely
6294704 he had a tough situation being thrown in there as only a sophomore his leadership has picked up his throwing has picked up and his whole temperament has picked up
6294705 when he came off the field the other day i went to my offensive coordinator and said i cant believe how well shemenski is running he runs very fluid and that is going to help him a whole heck of a lot
6294706 is this going to be your last year of coaching
6294707 ive been asked the same question before but ill just go out and play my game let my ability take over
6294708 im not really nervous because i know what i have to do its going to be different without terrelle but i think i can handle what the coaches want me to do
6294709 he started at cornerback and wide receiver for us through the state playoffs there are a lot of things he can do
6294710 he can run the ball he cant run like terrelle but not many people can he doesnt have an arm like terrelle but he can definitely get the job done throwing the ball hes a very good athlete and were not changing anything for him he can be a good quarterback
6294711 we feel we have enough talent around him that he doesnt have to do anything special
6294712 all he has to do is go out and play
6294713 with terrelle not here theres not as much media around
6294714 it gives us more of a chance to learn and not get distracted by all the media coming through and the cameras and everything
6294715 terrelle was so good and we had so many great seniors last year so now there are a lot of people saying you cant win without terrelle
6294716 but i think our kids are taking that personal i think they have something to prove and thats a good thing
6294717 she should be given a separate gold medal for her effort
6294718 actually i am a bit disappointed i wanted to finish in the top five no excuses
6294719 its to everyone out there set goals set dreams never give up
6294720 gunns shareholders will end up paying these bills there was no substance to the charges at the outset and john gay gunns executive chairman owes an explanation to shareholders about this expensive failure and legal misadventure
6294721 if the idea was to shut me or my fellow forest advocates up it has had quite the opposite effect
6294722 its a lot when you have a whole new scheme coming in for some of them this is the third scheme they have had to learn
6294723 there are no tangible goals everything is new to me the conference the coaches the group of kids
6294724 we just want play good football play good football and be competitive on every snap of every play of every game play to the best of our ability level and from there hopefully positive things will transpire
6294725 a lot of these kids started as sophomores and got their butts kicked
6294726 if we can stay healthy we will be very competitive
6294727 they have that taste of what it takes to get to that point
6294728 we always talk to the seniors about being leaders and that is some of what they can pass on to the younger players because it is their team so to speak
6294729 we got two starters back on the defensive line and the whole defense is starting to catch on to the new scheme
6294730 i believe our team speed is our strength we are faster than last year the big question is going to be our offensive line because we are thin depth wise the ones who we have in there are good but they have to stay healthy
6294731 we were so spoiled last year with all the weapons and this year we are going to have to be more of a patient offense
6294732 we are hoping to grind out 10 or 11 play drives we need to play ball control we still expect to win games and our confidence level is high
6294733 hell be an excellent college player at the division i level
6294734 he has a very strong work ethic and takes pride in doing the very best
6294735 he understands the schemes and his role in the defense he makes all the calls and adjustments he knows where everybody should be hes the true leader of this team its a tremendous asset
6294736 i spend my time watching nfl players play i watch the linebackers see what they do well and try to incorporate that into my game
6294737 when i was younger i would just fly around the ball and hit anything that moved
6294738 now im reading a play letting it develop before exploding and making the tackle
6294739 i would be happy with a piaa championship ring on my finger
6294740 that would make the team the happiest and me too
6294741 and were getting closer and closer as a team every day im not guaranteeing anything but thats our goal
6294742 we know this coach hes been here a long time it was very easy
6294743 i dont know everything i need to know about the schools
6294744 i havent got out to them yet so i dont know what im missing
6294745 im sitting around with the coaches and theyre saying we had a bad year last year
6294746 i said guys step back a little we went to heinz field six out of eight years wow we go 7 4 and they are thinking there is something wrong
6294747 thats the balance we have we have to get the inexperienced kids up to the experienced ones
6294748 were going to move him around a little kind of like we did with derek moye now at penn state
6294749 weve got some packages for him but there wont be the pressure on him to carry the load as their was on derek
6294750 were quicker up front weve got some guys who can move
6294751 at the same time we have to develop being mentally tough
6294752 we have to do the intangibles the little things last year we lost three games by one point hopefully that was because of our inexperience usually in the fourth quarter we rise to the occasion hopefully this year we will redeem ourselves
6294753 we want to start fast and finish strong thats what weve been talking about
6294754 when rochester comes to another teams town two things happen
6294755 no 1 everybody comes out to see you because they want to see their team beat you and no 2 the other team is going to play its best game against you
6294756 we understand that which is why we take a business like attitude we want to keep that even keel
6294757 the seniors said when we go to away games we put on highlight tapes from the 1992 or 98 or 2000 of 2001 teams
6294758 we talk a lot about the tradition we have here at rochester
6294759 it ended a streak of 13 consecutive winning seasons that wasnt like us it was a rough year but it did end on a good note as we won our last game
6294760 there were a lot of things that contributed to our poor performance last year
6294761 we lost a few tight games early in the season then lost focus injuries to key players also played a big part we want to put that season behind us and get back to the way weve played the last decade
6294762 ryan did a great job the past two years while sharing the postion with phil
6294763 now he has a chance to run our offense by himself hes a lot stronger and is throwing the ball well hes also a great student as hes among the top two or three in his class hes being recruited by ivy league schols like princeton yale and columbia
6294764 the parkway conference from top to bottom has been the strongest conference in class aaa
6294765 we have some experience and some inexperience on the line but they are not big
6294766 were very hopeful and optimistic that we can make a return trip to the playoffs
6294767 we have three kids fighting for the starting quarterback spot
6294768 junior jared buck 6 3 175 sophomore aaron mckinney 5 9 165 and junior ben simmon 6 2 275 all have a chance of starting they also have a chance of starting at wide receiver
6294769 we have a lot of experience coming back on both sides of the ball
6294770 our goal every season is to win the conference title and qualify for the wpial playoffs
6294771 its never easy in the parkway conference you never have an easy week
6294772 but we do have a lot of kids out for the team
6294773 we should be much better than we were last season
6294774 its a jump ball for everybody in the conference every team is well coached but none are loaded theres no clear cut favorite the team that gets off to the best start could be the team to beat
6294775 junior zach nichi 6 2 175 will be our quarterback
6294776 hes mobile has a good arm and is very smart hes the best quarterback ive had since 1989 when i had brian gelzheiser at baldwin hes a very talented skilled player
6294777 but were not a bad team we have talent im just not sure how good we will be it will depend on how quickly our newcomers mature
6294778 we lost a talented group of 25 seniors to graduation
6294779 we are young and inexperienced we need to mature quickly
6294780 our biggest concern is that we have a lot of unproven players
6294781 were working hard we have a lot of question marks
6294782 still when you lose 26 seniors regardless of the age of your team youre going to be inexperienced
6294783 in quad a football you need more than one guy to carry the ball
6294784 those are the guys with game experience who are battle tested more than anybody so theyre the ones were hoping can lead the rest of the guys in the right direction
6294785 last year we had a couple games go right down to the last play against teams we used to not be competitive with we just have not been able to get over the hump yet
6294786 we had no other choice we didnt know who they were
6294787 this time of the year even two weeks ago when i was at penn hills or jack mccurry at north hills right now is probably sitting there trying to figure out who the backup long snapper will be and who will hold for extra points if the first holder got hurt
6294788 i had no problem playing in the tri county north and we developed great rivalries up there
6294789 but playing in the mac is going to be great theres all the history a lot of tradition
6294790 were going to throw some kids into the fire early and see what they can do
6294791 but a lot of it depends on the play of the people around him
6294792 i think that coming into the season expectations are high and we embrace them in as much as we enjoy the competition and the goals that are set
6294793 but if you went back and looked at the rankings at the beginning of every year and see how many time they stayed that way i bet it wouldnt be that often its not how you start its how you finish
6294794 i do have some returning seniors but the majority of the starting lineup will pretty much be juniors
6294795 no goals nothing like so many wins or whatever all we care about is being the best team we can be we want the kids to get better and each day were working hard to make our team better
6294796 we could be a contender if things go our way
6294797 however we do play in the mac its a tough conference
6294798 theres a great group of kids that are awesome to be around and they work hard and are very coach able and the staff has done a really good job with them to this point
6294799 una promoci n en hoteles restaurantes y comercios del aceite producido en la localidad en la que el presidente vivas tiene el honor de ser pregonero de sus ltimas fiestas patronales y lugar de nacimiento de la se ora del jefe de gabinete del presidente el pol mico francisco javier s nchez paris
6294800 aunque la portavoz del gobierno desmintiera el lunes este acuerdo y no se deba poner en duda su palabra se nos debe permitir no hacerlo tampoco con las del alcalde m s a n cuando en numerosas ocasiones lo dicho en rueda de prensa tras el consejo de gobierno ha ca do en agua de borrajas en poco tiempo por declaraciones o acciones de los consejeros o del propio presidente
6294801 no dudamos de las excelencias del aceite de la sierra de m gina pero entendemos que el ayuntamiento de ceuta no se debe meter en este tipo de tonter s y dedicarse a trabajar por este pueblo y promocionar ceuta en la pen nsula por ejemplo con anuncios en las principales cadenas de televisi n o con una gala musical en el parque mar timo el pr ximo d 2 de septiembre d a de ceuta y televisada por alguna de las principales cadenas nacionales como hacen otras regiones
6294802 the good news is your date is here the bad news is hes dead
6294803 that is a site with some denver restaurants is ok but a site with all denver restaurants is better
6294804 but modern gal august in the south isnt any better and is probably worse
6294805 we will be very good up front on both sides of the ball
6294806 he is the best football player to come from gateway ever
6294807 its been hard for me to move on because hes my son

6294822 yesterday item 10 the presentable fellow with a nice hat looks like a cartoon depiction of malcolm turnbull liberal backbenchers and powerbrokers need to realise that peter costellos performance in question time when he was treasurer is not relevant in opposition if costello became their leader he would only get to ask the questions not answer them he would not have the same opportunity to display his parliamentary skills oppositions need new policies if they wish to win government listen to crikey editor jonathan green and crikeys canberra correspondent bernard keane discuss the crikey poll and the liberal leadership our afp and the total haneef c ck up

6294827 they are a bit bulkier than a smart phone but they are not quite a low end laptop the question is how are they going to be perceived by consumers lots of these tweeners have been tried before history is littered with them
6294828 we want to compete and be in a position to win games in the fourth quarter
6294829 augie and pat are very good friends off the field and very good athletes
6294830 if we can just stay healthy we can be competitive
6294831 we will be a young and inexperienced team this year

6294865 the game looks amazing if your just walking by and looking out of the corner of your eye at a hdtv playing this game youre going to think youre looking at a real game
6294866 you can actually create custom teams and custom players and trade them online you can create classic teams classic celtics teams classic lakers teams and trade them online
6294867 a tester of the game actually created the entire 1991 nba league down to every player
6294868 you also have the ability to save custom replays upload it to their servers and then download it to your computer as an avi file
6294869 as games are going to a break theres a montage of everything that happened in the game up to that point and its not just shots or dunks its things like expressions on peoples faces pretty much what you see on a tv broadcast
6294870 they actually have injuries now that when it happens live you see it and see the player go down while play continues and only after the play ends do you see him writhing in pain on the ground
6294871 one of the coolest things i saw playing as the celtics there was a play where there was a foul and a guy shot after the foul and kg went up and blocked it

6294875 that i will observe the provisions of the charter and ordinances of kansas city and that i will faithfully discharge the duties of said office so help me god
6294876 if the mayor decides to pick and choose which ordinances to follow why shouldnt everybody
6294877 she has never worked in my office or for me has never greeted visitors has never acted as a member of my office staff and has never involved herself in star business affairs
6294878 in fact the only similarity i can find between her and ms squitiro is that they are both married women
6294879 gloria and i have been a target of a vendetta by the star
6294880 they are unaccountable and they are the only newspaper in town and it pays
6294881 and woe be unto you if it happens to you
6294882 maybe vendetta is too strong but its obvious to anyone who reads it that the star is biased

6295147 we are encouraged by some of the results from the rc drill program at lugazi the lugazi belt has shown no historical gold exploration and the company has been at the forefront in discovering potential new zones of gold anomalism on surface due to the scarcity of any rock outcrops on the project and with no direct means to identify sources of the gold in soil anomalies the rc program was designed to investigate the distribution of anomalous gold in the upper 50m and to profile any anomalous gold patterns in this upper weathered zone we feel that the mineralised intersections may point to supergene gold but that a primary source for this gold requires investigation through a second phase of deeper holes we are also encouraged by the results of our regional geochemical program which have uncovered potential new gold targets on other parts of the lugazi belt the company will continue to explore these anomalies in more detail

6295184 bis dahin w re es w nschenswert wenn hersteller den verbrauch freiwillig einheitlich ausweisen um eine vergleichbarkeit herzustellen und die verbraucher angemessen zu informieren und zu orientieren denn die berarbeitete internationale norm zur messung des energieverbrauchs bei diesen ger ten gibt es schon
6295185 i have come so that they may have life and life to the full
6295186 for the upcoming year families are needed more than ever to help cci meet its requirements
6295187 its an opportunity to open a window to the world and learn about other cultures traditions and languagesnot just through a textbook but through real world encounters
6295188 nothing else good that was going on could receive any attention because of that issue
6295189 some investors have not been happy with the way that diller has managed the company and so they might be more open to looking at the pieces hes no longer associated with
6295190 dass das unternehmen schlecht performt ist eine berraschung schlie lich hat das whole foods konzept sowohl in hinblick auf die frische der waren und deren pr sentation als auch in der schaffung der einkaufsatmosph re f r europ ische handelsketten vorbildcharakter
6295191 wir sehen zum ersten mal seit jahren dass der konsum von bio lebensmitteln zur ckgeht wenn die finanzielle situation schwieriger wird berlegen sich die menschen sehr genau wof r sie ihr geld ausgeben
6295192 if i hadnt insisted on giving you a ride you wouldnt have ripped it
6295193 not in real life ive seen them in movies and books but the only other ones ive seen were plucked skinned and sometimes de boned
6295194 ive got one in there who is either really late or really early with her eggs theyre all double yolk and they all show up around seven oclock like clockwork
6295195 ill be right in i just have to lock her in the barn or shell drive me crazy all night
6295196 farm animals are dirty they dont get brushed and washed as often as pets
6295197 this is a really cool kitchen its so big is that an actual wood stove as in to cook on
6295198 i bet its horrible while youre cooking in summer though
6295199 wow ive never seen more books in one room in my life i dont know if bookends has as many books as you do
6295200 oh im glad you mentioned that place chad recommended that i buy one of miss hartfields novels he thinks id like them he also mentioned talking to her about my clothes
6295201 well i asked him about my dress on sunday because i noticed my clothes are kind of different than well take yours
6295202 chads a bit arrogant and from what i can see hes also meddling in your life
6295203 hes young but hes ok he just hasnt fit into the group very well and it makes things awkward sometimes
6295204 he told me hes shy and uncomfortable around people he doesnt know
6295205 wow say no more i was wrong about him i get it
6295206 now if he would just quit feeling obligated to save me from my situation life would be perfect
6295207 i dont think it sounds silly at all few people have alexa hartfields ability to be comfortable while standing out in a crowd even fewer people can do it and still be modest and humble alexa can
6295208 i just think that if you want something new it should reflect you as a person and not just be a reflection of those around you or you wont be comfortable in it and then you
6295209 see i wear a lot of jeans and cut offs but i try to make my blouses be pretty and comfortable im all about beauty i like things to be pretty even if they have to be functional
6295210 well i was wondering what you were doing saturday evening
6295211 well saturday bill is coming to take me to rockland
6295212 he wanted me to see some of the museums and the zoo other things like that so hes taking me to the presidential museum he wanted to take me out to dinner but i told him i needed to be home by dinner to milk wilhelmina
6295213 said that there is a store there that makes skirts and tops to order with the fabrics you like and she thought their fabrics and styles are perfect for me she called it euro boho whatever that is
6295214 ok im not following you what does lee and fabric have to do with going to rockland
6295215 i want to talk bill into taking me to a store but if i do that i think i should make sure we still get to have sushi so i thought if you would let me pay you to milk wilhelmina it might not be so bad
6295216 but there are things that bring good colors here in alaska
6295217 i love going up in the mountains in september here to see the yellows of the willows and the orange of the blueberries and the red of the bearberries and the purpley fireweed
6295218 one of the things that is really critical is cool nights
6295219 starting in september if it starts to get cool but not below freezing if you have clear cool days and cool nights it stimulates fall color
6295220 its all a pattern but its never the same which is whats really cool about it
6295221 fall will begin mid august and it will be peaking there the end of august and first week of september
6295222 and then all of a sudden those bright colors are gone and youre into winter pretty quickly
6295223 we have a more temperate climate the fall colors kick in about the third week of september and into the first week of october
6295224 are always the first to sell out the high demand for the last part of august is because of the fall colors
6295225 near the coast is the last place youll find color
6295226 from mid september to late october we see a variation of fall color rolling through from the western upper peninsula to the southeastern portion of the state
6295227 the lakes tend to pop toward the last moment mid to late october
6295228 that makes it look like evening in the middle of the day
6295229 its not uncommon to see trees turning colors sometimes even later than the first week of november
6295230 in the fall the leaves of the tree turn beautiful shades of pink and magenta
6295231 coming in and out of yosemite either on highway 41 from the south or highway 120 from the northwest there are a lot of dogwood trees right next to the highway
6295232 thanks to everyday americans who chose to make a difference millions of lives have been saved in the worlds poorest countries
6295233 we want to remind them that the public is out there eager for them to say more about this
6295234 they liked santoss result and 300 million buyback while financials continue their weak trend despite wall street overnight
6295235 unfortunately australia doesnt have much data coming out so we took direction from the us dollar and commodity prices
6295236 although the us economy is weaker it does seem the global markets are pricing in a loosening of monetary policy with the european central bank the reserve bank of australia and the reserve bank of new zealand
6295237 although the news is still grim for the us the rest of the world is starting to catch up
6295238 of all the trails in the world there is one that is more important than all it is the trail of a true human being i think you are on this trail and it is good to see
6295239 no new charge has been assigned to me as of now it means i am without a job
6295240 americas vulnerability to cyber attacks is a critical threat to national security
6295241 i think that the us and china have an ability to shut down each others societies on the internet today
6295242 cyber attack by a nation is very different from cyber attack by a hacker
6295243 would have cascading effects across the country and across the world
6295244 you are either darn crazy or you have faith in me
6295245 we look forward to partnering with the dcnr and the state to greatly enhance the infrastructure of the resort and create a great recreation opportunity for the community
6295246 into a community asset that will bring with it new jobs and activity
6295247 when i said i could no longer run it by myself and asked if the community would be willing to help run it as a nonprofit the answer was a resounding yes
6295248 i believe this will help strengthen the community and we will eventually be able to offer more programs in a larger space
6295249 i have been practicing yoga for almost 33 years fifteen years ago i discovered triyoga and started experiencing the states of consciousness i had previously only read about
6295250 in my 17 years of practice and teaching previous to triyoga i tried all different forms of yoga and never had these experiences
6295251 i just felt so down physically i lost a job i was depressed i am a neuroscientist so for the last six years ive barely had any physical activity
6295252 i just enjoy being here the group is so supportive and amazing
6295253 i think what inspires me is the people are dedicated here toward helping one another but also taking a real positive attitude toward the environment
6295254 thats what impresses me it feels like a neighborhood hangout for yoga
6295255 it becomes more meditative than what you can do at a gym
6295256 i got hooked it will be two years coming here this november
6295257 this decision provides good news for both the city and the union but neither side received everything they were seeking
6295258 this decision is not about who won or lost rather i believe that this ruling is about closure and about the city and the fire union and the fire department moving forward together to continue to provide the highest possible levels of public safety for our citizens our differences have now been decided
6295259 there is no question that the firefighters were vindicated in this
6295260 for five years they held their ground and refused to cave in and they prevailed
6295261 it was clearly the most contentious issue and its really what held up things for nearly six years
6295262 there must be some modification to the citys current practice of requiring all firefighters no matter what the circumstances to visit the city physician before being eligible for paid sick leave in particular this issue is divisive as it resulted in many days of grievance arbitration and has impacted the stability of labor relations between the firefighters union and the city
6295263 its a shame that this could not have been resolved years ago
6295264 i hope that the city can move beyond the controversy and divisiveness i think we can take this moment to set a new tone
6295265 jam s en los juegos ol mpicos ning n mortal ning n ser viviente ha podido colgarse la cifra de ocho medallas doradas
6295266 we can still find positive value and momentum from the incident
6295267 we can never be surprised at what vile evil comes from the mouth of a confessed victim of child abuse at the hands of her own parents roseannes parents responded to the accusation by going on air and slating she is a psychopathic liar and her sister agreed
6295268 everyone is just really excited about coming to the new building weve had an incredible turnout
6295269 weve given out almost 300 handouts about the new school people are so enthusiastic
6295270 the fitch school was a beautiful building but this is very exciting
6295271 at the fitch school the computers didnt work so well
6295272 we wanted to open the school as soon as we could to have teachers be able to set up their classrooms
6295273 the school is in remarkable shape for the teachers only being here for a couple of days the other thing clearly on everyones mind is the merging of the two schools
6295274 weve actually been having joint meetings for the last couple of months
6295275 we all have a lot of plans and a lot of ideas to get the two communities together to feel like one happy family
6295276 its a wonderful brand new building in a great community
6295277 as a state representative and a city councilor we worked hard to revamp the school building assistance program and the city of waltham received nearly 140 million in state funding for our new schools im very proud to have played a role in that
6295278 to jest jak najazd mongo w przeniesiony w xxi wiek
6295279 its not clear what the true cost of removing the high school would be and whether the executive department has adequately costed it into this project
6295280 there are a lot of things up in the air with the demolition
6295281 the only way you are going to know the precise cost is if you can open up the building and review it when the building is empty
6295282 we are confident that 195 million is the maximum overall project cost
6295283 whether we need to dip into contingencies to cover phase 2 work is unknown
6295284 the cost has been of tremendous concern so it is important that we have these specific numbers

6295286 good judgment comes with experience and a lot of that comes from bad judgment
6295287 i love it when people like my work it makes me feel all warm inside my hardest thing is putting a price on an item
6295288 i always have something in my pickup to show off
6295289 i dont think about anything else when im painting or even thinking about what to paint
6295290 just do it whatever you do whether its drawing sewing sculpturing woodworking painting etc just do it with a passion
6295291 this is the first year that this new and highest rating can be earned by districts
6295292 were not going to have a party until everything is final
6295293 a federally required measure that has goals set for reading and mathematics proficiency and test participation attendance rate and graduation rate in every school and district
6295294 there are 10 student groups that are evaluated for ayp goals in reading and mathematics for the 2007 08 school year in every school and district where at least 30 tested students aggregated across all tested grades are in that group
6295295 failure to meet any of the proficient or participation goals attendance levels or graduation targets results in the district or school missing ayp
6295296 were very proud of all the work that our educators and our parents contributed to the students success
6295297 i think this is a great event for people to come out to on their labor day weekend
6295298 the event was very successful last year we had very positive feed back from the community and we hope to repeat that this year
6295299 people will be able to come out have fun and learn a little bit about what it takes to be a volunteer firefighter and then if they are interested we can continue with the recruitment process from there
6295300 ninety is a fortunate and workable number of volunteers to have but we would like to try and bring the total closer to where we were a few years ago
6295301 it gives us more breathing room and ensures no one is overworked
6295302 though there has been a decline of volunteers over the past few years from my experience the volunteer recruitments have fluctuated up and down a number of times in the past usually every 10 years or so
6295303 with more than 65 musicians an almost equal number of men and women we make a wonderful sound
6295304 we practice from 7 p m to 9 p m each monday at the kettering middle school on glengarry drive instrumental musicians are welcome to join us

6295307 this is my third summer as a co coordinator with thelma patterson
6295308 i had been doing a mentoring program without funds when some people came to me and wanted to do the program on a larger scale we got funding from the phoenix project good samaritan hospital citywide and the city of dayton and started recruiting students who live in that area
6295309 and attendance is an absolute just like with a job if youre late or absent a lot youll be fired we also spent a lot of time working on attitude and the correct way to speak with people essentially they were being paid to better themselves and we really tried to open their eyes
6295310 to teach the kids nutrition and how to work for survival
6295311 theyre required to do it all seeding weeding and harvesting theres a sense of empowerment in that
6295312 we want the kids to be able to compete in the world and they have to work last year more than 100 children applied for just 25 slots we do interviews with them and their parents and they have to sign a contract
6295313 in this program we take them from where they are to the next level we gave them homework and went to the library on tuesdays where they worked on an improved reading program that stressed comprehension
6295314 i just want to see more opportunities for young people to do the right thing
6295315 last year we made 26 out of the 30 performance indicators and this year we were 28 out of the 30
6295316 to have a designation of excellent you have to be 29 out of 30 performance indicators or have a performance index score of a 100 or above
6295317 obviously were disappointed we didnt get excellent we will continue to strive to be excellent that is our goal
6295318 be safe be respectful be responsible have a great day and make every moment count
6295319 this has been a really nice part of my life
6295320 its been the most rewarding nine years of my career i am so proud to have been the principal here
6295321 a principal with less affection for and commitment to her students and staff would not have chosen that grueling of a schedule for that long of a time
6295322 i am very grateful to mrs loper for her dedication to harman
6295323 its probably very simplistic ive always wanted harman to be a very warm and inviting school a place where students wanted to come every day and where they felt valued
6295324 of course academics are very important but i hope weve looked at the whole child
6295325 it is great teaching people how to use their creativity
6295326 honesty and integrity are two things you learn from golf like when you have to call your own fouls
6295327 so we use golf as a foundation for things the kids can learn about life
6295328 these grants continue our associations initiative to support multiple golf programs as well as adding to the enjoyment of the game that otherwise may not have been possible for so many
6295329 now were looking to see how we can grow it
6295330 being a mentor constantly teaches you humility which golf does too
6295331 being a part of this program is a constant grounding it reminds you that no matter how different people appear we are really all the same
6295332 its just different not good or bad just different there are lots of new faces but everyone is helping out to make the change as seamless as possible
6295333 were on the right track were reviewing our menus to see how we can contain our costs without sacrificing quality
6295334 very nice congenial and happy go lucky never heard anybody say a bad word about her
6295335 shes awesome my daughter is in the ninth grade she was in kindergarten when gretchen came weve had all these years with her shes just been wonderful and caring the kids just love her
6295336 shes wonderful she creates an enthusiastic learning environment for the kids she always dressed up as a little old lady for halloween she related to the kids very well
6295337 i felt like i really knew her she was nice she always has a smile
6295338 she was great she basically taught us it doesnt matter who you are as long as your learning and having fun
6295339 i really love her she was a fabulous principal i really liked how she cared about us
6295340 we just love her shes the best shes so involved
6295341 gretchen respects each individuals contribution were different she manages to value those differences she figures out how to get the best out of everybody she trusts us to do our jobs you want to give her more than she asks for when were in hard times she holds us together shes been our mom big sis shes amazing
6295342 she is fair diplomatic and fun it will be big shoes to fill
6295343 i never thought i was the reason harman is a special place to be
6295344 wonderful students wonderful teachers i always thought they made it so special it just feels good to be a part of such a special place

6295381 measures to be considered include the suspension of particular governments from the forum
6295382 but when he resorts to these kinds of falsehoods and casts such aspersions on his opponents patriotism john mccain is no longer putting his country first if he were he would recognize that the interests of the nation require a relatively truthful campaign to fulfill his image of himself mccain should stop lying about his opponent for a man with his claims to honor and integrity thats not too much to ask

6295396 right now the challenge for photovoltaics is to make the technology less expensive therefore the objective is find new materials and novel device structures for cost effective photovoltaic devices
6295397 the beauty of organic photovoltaics and organic leds is low cost and flexibility these devices can be fabricated by inexpensive solution based processing techniques similar to painting or printing the ease of production brings costs down while the mechanical flexibility of the materials opens up a wide range of applications
6295398 the research at sdsu is focused on new materials with variable band gaps the band gap determines how much solar energy the photovoltaic device can absorb and convert into electricity
6295399 were working on synthesizing novel polymers with variable band gaps including high medium and low band gap varieties to absorb the full spectrum of sunlight by this we can double the light harvesting or absorption
6295400 we are working to develop these new light emitting and efficient charge transporting materials to improve the light emitting efficiency of full color displays
6295401 why is it hot in the summer and cold in the winter
6295402 because the sun is closer in the summer and further away in the winter
6295403 i think the formal process kicked off with the establishment of a nato georgia commission
6295404 i think its right to see georgian and ukrainian membership as part of a process to build up these countries as a permanent fixture not just as an accident
6295405 an important signal but there is also important substance to it
6295406 in practical terms nato is offering close cooperation with the georgian government and the georgian military

6295410 that statement is actually not news several government officials have been claiming it ever since the icc first started looking into the situation in darfur but the thing about the claim is that it is not totally inaccurate in one sense and that is if the sudanese government decides to try the people who have been charged by the icc for the same crimes in national courts in proceedings then they can bring an admissibility challenge before the icc which is to say the way the international criminal court was established was so that national courts would have primary jurisdiction over cases but that means the government would have to be willing and able to try the case themselves
6295411 in this case sudan has not shown itself so far to be willing to try any of the people involved in the crime in darfur so it is unlikely that an admissibility challenge will succeed so the real challenge will be securing arrest without cooperation of the sudanese government
6295412 what i have heard is that there is a fear of retaliation by government forces or government sympathizers allied militia against peacekeepers and humanitarian workers if an arrest warrant is issued but with all parties be it rebels or government forces international humanitarian law requires that they not attack peacekeepers or humanitarian workers the security council and others need to make it clear that if additional crimes are committed there would be consequences for those acts
6295413 i think that threats of retaliation and i think attacks on peacekeepers should make it basically embarrassing for people who are supporters of the sudanese government in this context to continue to support them this type of regime is not something that other governments should be willing to stand behind even if in principle they think that issuing an arrest warrants against the head of a government while it is still in conflict is problematic

6295416 improving sexual health is a government health priority so increasing the range of condoms available can only be good in terms of encouraging safe sex practices
6295417 condoms are already funded and always have been this decision sees a 10 percent price reduction for all condoms which frees up funds that can be used to purchase other new medicines
6295418 at a time when pharmac cant find funding for sufferers of breast cancer heart disease high blood pressure and other serious problems that they can find funding to subsidise flavoured condoms he said
6295419 this is simply about funding sexual behaviour that shouldnt be at the cost of the taxpayer or other more life threatening medication
6295420 el ritmo ha sido demasiado para m y al final lo he pagado
6295421 el ritmo ha sido muy fuerte desde el principio con el ingl s david davies segundo al final tirando normalmente al principio se va en grupo y hoy bamos en grupo pero estirados eso quiere decir que el ritmo era r pido
6295422 a falta de 500 metros estaba para luchar por un diploma pero
6295423 he visto que iba por la parte izquierda alg n nadador suelto pero si no estas arriba del todo no te enteras de la pel cula
6295424 a m me gusta nadar adelante y cuando el ritmo es tan fuerte se nada donde se puede y el ritmo ha sido muy fuerte desde el principio

6295432 thats the hardest race ive ever done in my life i dont think ive been able to dig as deep since then it was really pretty deep
6295433 its probably something i havent been able to deal with for the last four years its been on my mind and pressured me a lot because i know how much you have to step up
6295434 ive tried to step everything up so by doing that ive probably overbaked everything a little bit
6295435 this whole experience has taught me a lot more respect for what i had achieved i think i was pretty young and naive and idealistic about how i wanted things to go
6295436 thats why people cant appreciate why we get quite intense about it
6295437 its four years of my life and it hasnt always been a bundle of joy

6295449 it would have been nice if it had been a few months ago
6295450 president musharraf was a good ally in the war on terror he pulled pakistan away from the brink of extremism
6295451 i think people forget where pakistan was in 2001 supporting the taliban not aggressive against al qaida and a lot was achieved under his musharrafs rule
6295452 and perhaps he also took off his uniform and helped to smooth the path to civilian democratic rule in pakistan now the democratically elected government of pakistan does have to pay attention to this terrible militant threat
6295453 i hope they ruling coalition were united by the fact pakistani people in their first free and fair election in quite a long time elected them all to help govern pakistan

6295457 i think given the spirit of the mou memorandum of understanding which up front stated that within the spirit of the agreement no party was going to convene parliament or formulate a cabinet before an agreement is signed moving to swear in parliament is in part a breach of the memorandum of understanding however we need to make a qualification there that the contestation in the talks right now is not about the swearing in of parliament is in dispute but i think the most critical point which zanu pf and president robert mugabe moves beyond that he would be crossing the rules is assembling the cabinet
6295458 assembling cabinet will actually be vesting authority in institutions and i think that will amount to be in total breach of the negotiating process and by extension it will undermine the talks
6295459 the opposition has no problem in the opening of parliament insofar as the swearing in of parliament comes in from the results of the march 29 elections which by and large the mdc has actually stated that it reflects the will of the people what the bone of contention is based on the march 29 elections which leads to the swearing in of parliament the assembly of cabinet put mugabe in a position where he uses the june 27 results that he would use for vesting himself as the president to assemble a cabinet and that is where the dispute is and that is where it will undermine the talks and the spirit of the mou
6295460 when you read the mou it states that before the agreement is signed parliament and cabinet should not be sworn in and the cabinet should not be assembled but i think the mou was based not only on an understanding but also on an assumption by the facilitator that by then they would have rapped up the deal and there would have been a concrete deal on the table and all the parties would have signed up to it so i think this issues have been long drawn and it is a long haul and there is no signature appended to this process by all the parties it actually brings into question the issue of a breach of the memorandum of understanding which says parliament and cabinet shouldnt have been assembled
6295461 i think the move is meaningless for the simple reason that what he can only get from there is that is how the issues of the speaker of our parliament is going to be nominated i think that is where the only leverage is but the battleground is the cabinet

6295466 the agency lacks the budget the statutory authority and the scientific expertise to ensure the hundreds of nanoproducts now on the market among them baby bottle nipples infant teething rings paints waxes kitchenware and appliances are safe this problem will only worsen as more sophisticated nanotechnology based products begin to enter the consumer market
6295467 during the fall of 2007 many americans faced a hazard in their products that had been banned for 30 years lead as millions of childrens toys coated with lead paint were recalled it became clear that government oversight had failed and that the cpsc the agency primarily responsible for the oversight of these toys was stretched too thin from years of neglect underfunding and the challenges posed by an increasingly global manufacturing system
6295468 it is against this background that we need to ask the question is the cpsc adequately prepared to deal with nanotechnology which is now associated with more than 800 manufacturer identified consumer products ranging from infant pacifiers to paints to appliances to clothing
6295469 it took decades of research before lawmakers found the political will to keep lead and phthalates out of toys it could take a very long time to research and ensure that potentially dangerous nanomaterials are kept out too
6295470 its a very striking confirmation of something that has been suspected for quite some time
6295471 the placenta is very sensitive to stress hormones in the mother these hormones were probably amplified during the time of the war
6295472 what we have here is confirmation that it really is a major factor
6295473 if it has been shown that wars can impact a babys brain development in this way then it follows that other types of stress like domestic violence severe anxiety bereavement or other types of loss could have the same effect
6295474 theres an important message here and we need to ensure it is translated into preventative work in pregnant women to reduce the risk

6295476 i think he should show more respect for his competitors and shake hands give a tap on the shoulder to the other ones immediately after the finish and not make gestures like the one he made in the 100 meters
6295477 he might have interpreted that in another way but the way it was perceived was catch me if you can you dont do that but hell learn hes still a young man
6295478 i would love him to show more respect for his competitors thats not the way we perceive being a champion but he will learn in time he should shake hands with his competitors and not ignore them hell learn that sooner or later but hes a great athlete of course
6295479 we are now just days away from what i believe will be a historic olympic games
6295480 chinas role as our olympic host has opened a window to the worlds most populous nation
6295481 i am equally confident that the games will leave a great legacy for china
6295482 china is a nation in transition with a great future tremendous potential and some challenges i believe history will view the 2008 olympics as a significant milestone in chinas remarkable transformation
6295483 all of us in the olympic family hope that the beijing games will help the healing process in china and deepen the worlds knowledge of this remarkable country
6295484 it is also our hope that through the games we can show the world the sincere aspiration of the chinese people to share the benefits of development and to join with the rest of the world in building a bright future

6295492 this is the second reduction in fixed rate home loan interest rates by the commonwealth bank since 11 august 2008 and reflects the recent reduction in wholesale funding costs for our fixed rate home loans the bank said
6295493 the rba has not announced any reduction in the official cash rate at this time and we cannot speculate on what they will do commonwealth said in a statement today
6295494 it is in our interest to pass on as much as we can to our customers and to remain competitive
6295495 we currently have the lowest standard variable rate of all the major banks and st george
6295496 we will review our full costs of funding at the time of any announcement by the rba taking into account any reduction in the official cash rate and do our best to pass on as much as we can to our customers

6295567 what has been achieved is substantial but it is also reversible
6295568 first the sunni awakening which preceded the surge second the sadr cease fire third sectarian cleansing that left much of baghdad segregated with fewer targets to shoot or bomb these tactical gains are relative violence is now where it was in 2005 and spiking up again iraq is still incredibly dangerous and despite what the president says very far from normal and these gains are fragile awakening members frustrated at the governments refusal to integrate them into the national security forces could turn their guns back on us
6295569 you are asking us for millions more to pay off the militias and by the way i have an article here that says maliki recently told a london paper that he was concerned about half of them
6295570 why dont you ask the iraqis to pay the entire cost of that progam
6295571 to support the iraqi government in its battle with all outlaw groups thats a pretty expansive commitment
6295572 there is no iraqi government that we know of that will be in place a year from now half the government has walked out we want to normalize a government that really doesnt exist
6295573 given the fact that the maliki government doesnt represent a true coalition wont this agreement make it appear we are taking sides in the civil war especially when most iraqi parliamentarians have called for a withdrawal of troops
6295574 that over the past five years the united nations has continued to help the people of iraq and others throughout the world who suffer from violence disease and want

6295582 these special forces work with the americans they are not associated with the ministry of defense they have goals and they didnt inform anyone else

6295611 granted theyre not slumping too much and the site is still performing extremely well but it is down nonetheless i think digg slowly lost its appeal when it stopped becoming a tech savvy haven and tried to expand into areas that its tech influenced crowd didnt care about
6295612 yahoo buzz is taking the digg idea improving it by reducing the frequency of people gaming it and launching with a focus on all topics with its own main page to back it up
6295613 how can digg compete on any one of those levels when digg was firmly focused on tech and didnt try to improve algorithms to make upcoming stories last longer before they went popular or stop certain influencers from being too successful people found some value in using the site but now its nothing more than a placeholder of derivative stories and outrageous comment threads
6295614 not just any stories will end up getting buzzed but when they do they get posted to the front page of yahoo com
6295615 thats some pretty major exposure and the level of traffic driven by yahoo once something gets buzzed is exponentially higher than most other social news sites including digg
6295616 i think the potential that future submissions could appear on the front page of yahoo com is a valuable prospect
6295617 i think yahoos system is going to result in much better front page headlines its less about who you know and more about the actual content
6295618 the possibility of getting on the home page of yahoo is a strong selling point for buzz on the other hand theyre a bit late to the game to open it up to everyone i think for certain types of news it could do well but on topics like tech itll be tough
6295619 yahoo does amazing things like delicious and flickr but then they do other really lame things like yahoo

6295629 how can digg compete on any one of those levels when digg was firmly focused on tech and didnt try to improve algorithms to make upcoming stories last longer before they went popular or stop certain influencers from being too successful people found some value in using the site but now its nothing more than a placeholder of derivative stories and outrageous comment threads
6295630 not just any stories will end up getting buzzed but when they do they get posted to the front page of yahoo com
6295631 thats some pretty major exposure and the level of traffic driven by yahoo once something gets buzzed is exponentially higher than most other social news sites including digg
6295632 i think the potential that future submissions could appear on the front page of yahoo com is a valuable prospect
6295633 i think yahoos system is going to result in much better front page headlines its less about who you know and more about the actual content
6295634 the possibility of getting on the home page of yahoo is a strong selling point for buzz on the other hand theyre a bit late to the game to open it up to everyone i think for certain types of news it could do well but on topics like tech itll be tough
6295635 yahoo does amazing things like delicious and flickr but then they do other really lame things like yahoo
6295636 was a creation of the jihadist culture of the pakistani army
6295637 we are trying our best to come out of this critical situation without any damage to afghanistan and the taliban
6295638 it would be best if the arrest or killing of any hvt high value target were announced on 26 27 or 28 july
6295639 if we dont find these guys by the election they are going to stick the whole nuclear mess up our a hole
6295640 canadas first adult video channel offering significant canadian adult content
6295641 i think as canadians there is a bit of a tiredness in seeing all american stuff
6295642 there is always that thrill for something that is local and you get the sense that these are people you can meet at the supermarket
6295643 not less than 50 percent of the broadcast day and not less than 50 percent of the evening broadcast period to canadian programming
6295644 we want to be canadas adult channel and i think to do that 15 percent wouldnt cut it
6295645 ive been in touch with the cable companies throughout the process and went ahead with it based on the interest we had
6295646 there is neither jew or greek there is neither slave nor freeman there is neither male nor female for you are all one person in union with christ jesus
6295647 we dont argue that the inspector used the probes as leverage to get into the aircraft
6295648 but terrorists would not be concerned if they broke a probe to gain access to a plane
6295649 the tsa inspector could not have gotten onto the sterile airfield area unless he used his id badge

6295655 what sibel revealed to us and has been revealing little by little since january is that she has heard that there was a nuclear procurement ring operating inside the us to procure nuclear designs and parts for the aq khan network and it was done not through pakistani intelligence directly but through the turkish embassy
6295656 centrism is the philosophy of the american media and that essentially backs the status quo when youre a centrist and this game of objectivity that they play is really limited by parameters that youre allowed to ask questions and to investigate and in a sense then youre transmitting these assumptions and reinforcing every day that the us is really a functioning democracy
6295657 a political odyssey the rise of american militarism and one mans fight to stop it
6295658 you asked for it black even a fool cant mess that up
6295659 might i say sarcasm fits you better than your sweater
6295660 it can end whenever you wish though i hope not soon but if you speak of the rain im somewhat surprised do you dislike it
6295661 good because like the sarcasm the rain fits you well as does this city
6295662 you have a bitterness about you i noticed it immediately
6295663 maybe sorrow is the better word something dark inside brooding suppressed your eyes hint at it but your voice your words they give it away sarcasm by nature requires a darker view of the world or at least a more jaded one
6295664 if youd rather we sit here in silence i can certainly oblige but then i might just as well be sitting alone and i came here to gain a bit of your affection an aim that suffers your silence poorly besides i think im at least a trifle interesting and i expect youll delight in our conversation that is assuming you choose to participate
6295665 how about the bookstore who is the old man behind the counter
6295666 but no longer why is that what did he do wrong
6295667 hes not the grim reaper hes a very nice man and so very passionate about his books and yes he owns the store and hes kind enough to let us share it for our meetings
6295668 and what do you do when youre not at the bookstore
6295669 you know your answers arent quite as elegant as your arguments tend to be theyre certainly not as elaborate perhaps we should try arguing
6295670 of course the casual answer the safe answer id expect it from half wits at the local tavern but not from you life is not about money and i know by the passion you have for books and stories you crave more than monetary sustenance life is about living life is exploration and adventure i bet you crave those things each and every day
6295671 the darkness the gloom these are not things for happy souls
6295672 he is a brilliant author fascinating and mysterious and enjoyable two i love the way he plays with language and manipulates his reader i read a lot of crap in my job
6295673 dont you find it fascinating that despite his troubles and torments he could imagine such tales that he wasnt bogged down by lifes vicissitude that he could conjure such imagery and emotion from the aching emptiness of depression and suffering
6295674 the tone of his life no doubt colored his stories it darkened his words each sentence hints at his torment i do find that fascinating yes
6295675 because your torment unlike his is bottled up unable to escape
6295676 then what about yourself youve said little asked a neverending string of questions and answered my own with vagaries and even more questions why dont you tell me about yourself who is marcus mccomber
6295677 if only i could tell you that very question has baffled women for ages
6295678 truthfully i am but a lonely heart searching for companionship
6295679 then may i walk you there if you say no i will follow you anyway to ensure your safety of course
6295680 to shut you up of course and obviously i thought it might be interesting
6295681 beyond my most ridiculous imaginings youre quite a fascinating character mr mccomber you wear many faces
6295682 you were the fool then you were an ass in a cape and then you were the mysterious romantic and here after everything you decide to be a gentleman
6295683 i prefer that title is that what i am now
6295684 oh i believe you heard me but ill ask again to be polite
6295685 i saw the indentation on your finger the first night we met so i decided youre married or divorced or recently widowed which is it
6295686 i generally find that its good practice to know the marital status of a woman you fancy wouldnt you agree and when shes married i wonder why she takes off her ring at night in the company of strangers
6295687 it fits now all of it you are bored miserable you crave the life in your stories while real life drags you down
6295688 im sorry to be honest i couldnt care less if you are married but i would very much like to see you again
6295689 it takes far scarier things than you marcus mccomber to send me into hiding
6295690 but there is one other thing we might need to discuss something well have to do
6295691 i know that you dont want to hear it especially coming from someone so young
6295692 what would you attempt to do if you knew you could not fail

6295700 the child was left in the car since this morning and was found this afternoon inside a vehicle parked in a parking lot here at cincinnati christian university
6295701 when they found out it was such a young baby and i think a sadness obviously for the child but a sadness for the mother and the father and the family
6295702 obviously situations like this raise very serious questions but the time when someone is grieving is to come around them and to help them
6295703 shes highly respected she is loved by her peers respected by the students
6295704 no im just sad im thinking about all of the children that died when the titanic hit that iceberg and sunk that tragic night
6295705 habe ich heute gutes getan oder habe ich schaden angerichtet

6295708 la coalici n tiene que definir en chile sus procedimientos para elegir a un candidato y lo que yo he dicho es que creo que por ahora no estoy disponible ni quiero participar en una pr xima elecci n
6295709 he sido dirigente de la coalici n en un momento y no puedo ser prescindente de un acto importante para chile creo que no estar a de acuerdo y en consecuencia dije que voy a participar y apoyar a los candidatos de la coalici n
6295710 las encuestas son una foto un momento y creo que falta mucho para la elecci n presidencial las elecciones presidenciales se resuelven en la urna y no por encuestas en consecuencia siendo importante lo que dicen las encuestas no creo que sean un elemento definitorio

6295713 man i sure could use a cold mountain dew right now
6295714 this is a song i wrote when i was thirteen
6295715 friendlies are a bit different but it was good to be playing centre back it was only my second time for northern ireland
6295716 we were here to do a job and its a good platform to take into the qualifiers going away from home and keeping a clean sheet if that was a qualifying match we would have got a valuable point
6295717 you always get the work rate with northern ireland but with that system we worked really really hard
6295718 with the two wide men and david healy playing up on his own he worked his socks off i dont think he has that much match fitness so it was a credit to him
6295719 its unfortunate he missed the penalty but he has got that many goals for northern ireland i dont think it matters
6295720 we have got to give them respect but we must go into their backyard like we did in scotlands and perform like we did
6295721 if we do that we can get a good result there is a lot of hard work to be done we got turned over in latvia and iceland by these supposedly smaller nations
6295722 if we get four to six points away from home in the next qualifiers i will be very happy as long as we keep our home form
6295723 vivo como si fuera un recluso nadie sabe quien soy

6295725 he tenido que aprender a vivir y obtener por m mismo lo que he necesitado
6295726 can miles truly separate you from friends if you want to be with someone you love arent you already there
6295727 all the energy we can possibly ever use for free enough energy if we wanted to draw on it to melt all earth into a big drop of impure liquid iron and still never miss the energy so used all the energy we could ever use forever and forever and forever
6295728 oh hell just about forever till the sun runs down bert
6295729 all right then billions and billions of years ten billion maybe are you satisfied
6295730 all right but now we can hook up each individual
6295731 who says it didnt what i say is that a sun wont last forever thats all im saying were safe for ten billion years but then what
6295732 youre thinking well switch to another sun when ours is done arent you
6295733 sure you are youre weak on logic thats the trouble with you youre like the guy in the story who was caught in a sudden shower and who ran to a grove of trees and got under one he wasnt worried you see because he figured when one tree got wet through he would just get under another one
6295734 dont shout when the sun is done the other stars will be gone too
6295735 it all had a beginning in the original cosmic explosion whatever that was and itll all have an end when all the stars run down some run down faster than others hell the giants wont last a hundred million years the sun will last ten billion years and maybe the dwarfs will last two hundred billion for all the good they are but just give us a trillion years and everything will be dark entropy has to increase to maximum thats all
6295736 you did you poor sap you said we had all the
6295737 you ask multivac i dare you five dollars says it cant be done
6295738 i cant help it i feel funny about leaving earth
6295739 we had nothing there well have everything on x 23 you wont be alone you wont be a pioneer there are over a million people on the planet already good lord our great grandchildren will be looking for new worlds because x 23 will be overcrowded
6295740 i tell you its a lucky thing the computers worked out interstellar travel the way the race is growing
6295741 i suppose families will be going out to new planets forever the way we are now
6295742 entropy little sweet is just a word which means the amount of running down of the universe everything runs down you know like your little walkie talkie robot remember
6295743 cant you just put in a new power unit like with my robot
6295744 the stars are the power units dear once theyre gone there are no more power units
6295745 dont let them daddy dont let the stars run down
6295746 now now honeys ill ask microvac dont worry hell tell us
6295747 see now the microvac says it will take care of everything when the time comes so dont worry
6295748 and now children its time for bed well be in our new home soon
6295749 are we ridiculous i wonder in being so concerned about the matter
6295750 i think not you know the galaxy will be filled in five years at the present rate of expansion
6295751 i hesitate to submit a pessimistic report to the galactic council
6295752 i wouldnt consider any other kind of report stir them up a bit weve got to stir them up
6295753 space is infinite a hundred billion galaxies are there for the taking more
6295754 very well immortality exists and we have to take it into account i admit it has its seamy side this immortality the galactic ac has solved many problems for us but in solving the problem of preventing old age and death it has undone all its other solutions
6295755 not yet im by no means old enough how old are you
6295756 im still under two hundred but to get back to my point population doubles every ten years once this gaiaxy is filled well have filled another in ten years another ten years and well have filled two more another decade four more in a hundred years well have filled a thousand galaxies in a thousand years a million galaxies in ten thousand years the entire known universe then what
6295757 as a side issue theres a problem of transportation i wonder how many sunpower units it will take to move galaxies of individuals from one galaxy to the next
6295758 a very good point already mankind consumes two sunpower units per year
6295759 most of its wasted after all our own galaxy alone pours out a thousand sunpower units a year and we only use two of those
6295760 granted but even with a hundred per cent efficiency we only stave off the end our energy requirements are going up in a geometric progression even faster than our population well run out of energy even sooner than we run out of galaxies a good point a very good point
6295761 well just have to build new stars out of interstellar gas
6295762 there may be some way to reverse entropy we ought to ask the galactic ac
6295763 its something the human race will have to face someday
6295764 oh say i didnt really mean to have you ask that
6295765 we both know entropy cant be reversed you cant turn smoke and ash back into a tree
6295766 we call ours the same all men call their galaxy their galaxy and nothing more why not
6295767 not all galaxies on one particular galaxy the race of man must have originated that makes it different
6295768 is in hyperspace in what form it is there i cannot imagine
6295769 and is one of these stars the original star of man
6295770 mans original star has gone nova it is a white dwarf
6295771 a new world as in such cases was constructed for their physical bodies in tlme
6295772 but when all energy is gone our bodies will finally die and you and i with them
6295773 i do not wish it to happen even after billions of years universal ac how may stars be kept from dying
6295774 there is as yet insufficient data for a meaningful answer
6295775 carefully husbanded as directed by the cosmic ac the energy that is even yet left in all the universe will last for billions of years
6295776 eventually it will all come to an end however it may be husbanded however stretched out the energy once expended is gone and cannot be restored entropy must increase forever to the maximum
6295777 can entropy not be reversed let us ask the cosmic ac
6295778 there is as yet insufficient data for a meaningful answer
6295779 when will you have enough data to answer the question
6295780 there is as yet insufficient data for a meaningful answer
6295781 ac is this the end can this chaos not be reversed into the universe once more can that not be done
6295782 there is as yet insufficient data for a meaningful answer
6295783 looking at the team today it should stand us in good stead for the next couple of weeks with the players we have we are capable of playing like that next month
6295784 its the way the players want to play if we can play like that in the next two games we are capable of getting something out of them
6295785 the first half was very good we got to grips with the game in the first 15 minutes but i really thought the 30 minutes before half time was very good
6295786 we played some good football and held control of the ball very well but the conditions in the second half completely ruined the game
6295787 i think we would have kicked on we were in control of the game and we could have scored a couple more
6295788 the pitch absolutely spoiled the second half but we will take the positives from the first half
6295789 we will remember the first half and try to completely forget the second half
6295790 hes a good holding midfielder but hes also always looking for that threaded pass for the strikers which is very good he did that a lot of times in the first half
6295791 the mouth of a perfectly contented man is filled with beer
6295792 construction sports financing and of course a popular line of jams and jellies
6295793 what if theyre eating on an airplane and they cross into a different time zone
6295794 fire the untamed element oldest of mans mysteries giver of warmth destroyer of forests right now this building is on fire
6295795 i look at him and what do i see dolls with suction cups staring out of car windows
6295796 hey why dont you try this why dont you try that
6295797 why is this guy telling me what to do ive been doing this a long time
6295798 oh thats interesting that could be useful that could be funny
6295799 i think hes more of a tool rather than a
6295800 that cracked us up in my sports magazine office today
6295801 i think shes unoficially holds the title of hottest girl woman
6295802 i think it suffers from two problems a the drums rarely
6295803 i think hes more of a tool rather than a
6295804 that cracked us up in my sports magazine office today
6295805 i think shes unoficially holds the title of hottest girl woman
6295806 i think it suffers from two problems a the drums rarely
6295807 they are pulling out burnt corpses the plane has been completely destroyed
6295808 the planes tail has broken off from the rest of the fuselage
6295809 its difficult to describe the scene because its just a mess of metal
6295810 once we jumped from bangor maine to new orleans for a one nighter then on to houston texas for the next night
6295811 i mean you see places did not have them fine dressing rooms and showers and things then
6295812 you just waited until everybody got out of the place and then he could change his clothes after everybody had gone and dry himself with his own towels and things
6295813 he was a hard worker and a hard workin man
6295814 and he didnt ask you to do nothin that he wouldnt do
6295815 my honeymoon was eight months of one nighters and i thought i was going to give up the whole marriage
6295816 id never been away from home and i just couldnt take it
6295817 and louis was still laying up in the bed watching the tree his eyes just like a babys eyes would watch something
6295818 anyone who has heard his own songs played by cy immediately has a greater respect for his own work though utterly respectful of the composers and songwriters whose music he plays he is also highly complex both rhythmically and harmonically in his interpretations of their music all the while maintaining a constant balance of delicacy and sensitiveness
6295819 i like the fact that for the most part my poems are pretty accessible

6295823 die digital tv anbindungen werden in den kommenden paar jahren im durchschnitt um jeweils zw lf prozent pro jahr zulegen aufgrund der geplanten abschaltung der analogen signale wird es vor allem in der n heren zukunft zu einem deutlichen zuwachs in diesem bereich kommen
6295824 2007 gab es in westeuropa und den usa insgesamt 158 mio haushalte die digitale tv dienste in anspruch genommen haben f r das jahr 2012 gehen wir von mehr als 274 mio haushalten aus
6295825 in deutschland ist der abschluss der terrestrischen digitalisierung des tv signals von den sendern f r ende 2008 geplant
6295826 nat rlich k nnte man noch mehr mut zur begr nung haben aber im grunde genommen sind die derzeit vorliegenden studien ausreichend um solche begr nungen auch erfolgreich durchzuf hren

6295828 regionale substrate mit kiessandigen b den f rdern auch lokale arten sie sind den h ufig verwendeten lava bims substraten vorzuziehen
6295829 in der schweiz gibt es eine gesetzliche regelung dass flachd cher zu begr nen sind
6295830 der grund daf r liegt in den unterschiedlichen messmethoden die zur berechnung verwendet werden
6295831 werbeprospekte und produktdatenbl tter enthalten zwar viele technische details und ausstattungsmerkmale jedoch keine oder kaum informationen zum energieverbrauch der fernseher
6295832 die rechtlichen grundlagen f r das energieeffizienzlabel der eu werden derzeit berarbeitet die bislang g ltige fassung stammt noch von 1992
6295833 bis dahin w re es w nschenswert wenn hersteller den verbrauch freiwillig einheitlich ausweisen um eine vergleichbarkeit herzustellen und die verbraucher angemessen zu informieren und zu orientieren denn die berarbeitete internationale norm zur messung des energieverbrauchs bei diesen ger ten gibt es schon
6295834 we had two of the most bearish factors thrown at oil today and were closing moderately higher
6295835 were seeing supply concerns go back into the price of a barrel of oil
6295836 we reiterate that fundamentals in the oil market suggest a return to a rising oil price environment
6295837 consumers can take some solace in the sell off but there are more supportive factors down the road here
6295838 terdakwa dianggap karena sakit hati dan mewujudkan rasa tidak suka atau dendam terhadap munir

6295840 you should remove as posts because theyre just as bad as bs
6295841 das einzige was zu diesem zeitpunkt klar scheint ist dass die t rkei sich mit neuen terror taktiken konfrontiert sieht oder mit einer oder mehreren neuen terrorgruppen oder beides
6295842 und eine dieser gruppen scheint entschlossen sehr hohe verluste zu verursachen
6295843 it is a significant increase and it could be servicing up to two million homes at the second stage
6295844 if terria wins the bid to roll out the national broadband network the very first thing i will be doing is contacting telstra chairman donald mcgauchie and telstra ceo sol trujillo and offering them a substantial equity stake in the network company
6295845 i think if telstra came on board theyd be assured that the network company was being operated for everyones benefit
6295846 like any equity player you cant be a shareholder in a company unless you own some shares if we win the bid they will then have the option of coming on board
6295847 only an independent network can provide open access and competitive pricing for 98 per cent of australians
6295848 we have a pretty hard hitting message about dino rossi about what hes done in the past what his record is and what we think that translates into in terms of policy on issues that people care about
6295849 the conservatives have been very aggressive in using every medium available to them to get their message out the progressive community sees how effective they can be in doing that and feel that our voice needs to be heard as well
6295850 the contributions that evergreen progress has received thus far are contributions that were earned through someones sweat and effort
6295851 the construction workers the nurses the teachers the home health care workers the people who have contributed to this work really hard for their money and those are the contributions that we have received
6295852 i dont think their voice is any less important to hear in this election than the voice of big developers rich individuals big business or other people who are contributing to dino rossi
6295853 at the same time as she is sitting and negotiating with these folks she is accepting campaign contributions and they are spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on her behalf
6295854 its pretty convenient for dino rossi to say i dont think nurses should have a voice in this election or i dont think construction workers should have a voice hes saying that because he doesnt agree with what they have to say
6295855 we support rossi because he is aligned with us philosophically he is pro small business
6295856 its different when seiu and wfse are cutting checks for hundreds of thousands of dollars and they are sitting down and negotiating pay raises for their members
6295857 i dont deal with the campaign so i dont know what they are doing im just trying to negotiate a contract i dont know what they are contributing to the campaign
6295858 i am just trying to negotiate a contract that is fair to both sides
6295859 they have a lot to lose if gregoire is not re elected we fully expected them to bring out the big guns and spend every penny they can
6295860 i dont think that is a tactic that we invented thats a common role that independent groups play
6295861 we point out the record and critique it and the candidate is free to focus on selling themselves to voters and explaining why they should be elected
6295862 its an unfortunate consequence of the changes the legislature made to the civil service laws in 2002
6295863 it sets up a built in appearance of conflict of interest every four years during the gubernatorial races just one of many reasons why the legislature should reassert its control over state employment contracts and bring them back into the public light of day through the legislative process
6295864 we have supported chris gregoire for re election and the political process that we are always in but the bargaining process is separate and there is absolutely no quid pro quo
6295865 this governor is a very tough negotiator she listens but she is a very tough negotiator and we dont expect that by supporting this governor that the contract will reflect that support
6295866 i feel like ive jumped out of my body went to heaven and back
6295867 this is a huge accomplishment it went by so fast and here i am with a medal
6295868 ive raced against these girls plenty of times and i know they are beatable
6295869 theres a huge value in attending its a great way for people to get to know each other
6295870 its going to be the same besides some of the running and option
6295871 the big thing in this camp is that the tight ends have brought their game to another level the running backs too i dont even know who is going to play because they are all playing so well
6295872 we are pushing each other in our strive for success were all running really well and its just about helping each other out
6295873 we just took some plays out but were running the same offense
6295874 being a running back we love the added run plays coach bo pelini loves running it and thats making us compete for the position even more
6295875 im just like inviting you on the bandwagon of my own uncertainty
6295876 in a sport like golf the offseason or summer is a time where they can really improve
6295877 they need to travel and play competitively in bigger high profile tournaments
6295878 thats who they play in college it really helps them prepare for collegiate golf
6295879 we have more bodies in the mix to make our qualifying round more competitive
6295880 youve got to like some pressure the pressure is what makes it fun
6295881 im so ready i cant explain it just because its so emotional
6295882 were ready we still got some preparation and stuff to put in and stuff to learn but were going to be ready we want it
6295883 i think a lot of people have written us off this year
6295884 we get a chance this year to not have that no 1 on our backs and to just go out and play and prove a lot of people wrong
6295885 i think this year were focusing on the fact that were this new team
6295886 we have a lot to offer and its going to be those little things that are going to matter this year
6295887 well there are a lot of new people which makes it a little more difficult at the beginning of the season
6295888 but as of right now i think were all starting to mesh
6295889 i just had this like almost a wave of jealousy
6295890 oh man when i was a kid nobody ever said that to me it was more like get out of here or what the hell are you playing
6295891 i think so much has changed ever since birth control came around
6295892 i think about how many social attitudes have altered how much is different now that the economic relationship between men and women is really different a woman is way more likely to support herself than to be supported by a man at this point
6295893 the kind of aspirations my mother put forward to me were to be like a bookkeeper
6295894 nothing prepared me to be a band leader nothing prepared me to be the kind of person that people work for i was basically socialized to be a waitress and then all of a sudden i was a band leader and business owner
6295895 we asked a bunch of bands if they would play a show and it just kind of fell together
6295896 the concert had been kicking around for about 3 or 4 months
6295897 were constantly in fundraising mode were actively pursuing to get the pilot program off the ground by the first part of 2009
6295898 a lot of people were there for the charity and a lot were there for the music it was pretty even they were a good crowd
6295899 there was great attendance for the concert but what was really rewarding for me was all the questions about ptsd
6295900 there was lots of interest in the issue a lot of people were really surprised by some of the information and a lot of people really wanted to help out because of it
6295901 i made a bad decision and i got in trouble
6295902 nash is a typical college jock from new england who loves to show off all hes got
6295903 next week his best friend cal joins the fratmen brotherhood
6295904 the history of behavior of these men including the current matter does not reflect the standard of excellence we aspire to on and off the mat
6295905 we have outstanding student athletes in our program and we will move forward in a positive manner toward our goals
6295906 i want to personally apologize for any embarrassment that may have been caused for our athletic department the university and our fans
6295907 okay i need a few more people to destroy poets egos
6295908 and 10 being an earth shattering poem that moooooooves you
6295909 some of the songs we just recorded weve been sitting on for two years
6295910 i played some songs i wrote with my band from high school and also some riffs or progressions i thought sounded cool and kevin did the same
6295911 its funny cause thats pretty much how we still write music
6295912 we never write songs with the intent of sounding like someone else
6295913 ive probably spent more time listening to queens of the stone age albums than any other band but you probably couldnt tell from the music i write with kevin note email address will not be published
6295914 we say play like you practice practice better than you need to play
6295915 its a very mature concept to be able to put that together for a month two months or an entire season
6295916 ill go talk to elementary school kids and almost every class i go to there will be a kid with an oklahoma shirt or a texas shirt or somebody will say oh im a texas fan
6295917 its just human nature people want to root for that winner
6295918 sometimes you skid you skid and you skid and youre over the edge of the cliff
6295919 this is not in itself a place that people just flock to come to
6295920 obviously what separated us was the fact that we won a lot and that there was a demonstrated character here it was a way of doing things
6295921 blessed are they whose transgressions are forgiven whose sins are covered blessed is the man whose sin the lord will never count against him
6295922 vor wenigen wochen wurde ricky martin durch die geburt von zwillingss hnen stolzer vater
6295923 yes we get six figure traffic but no i will not pay for a commercial server and yes i expect you to allow me to continue paying almost nothing in hosting fees and oh yeah would you please get the site back up immediately before i have to stick hubby on you
6295924 youre gonna wake up one morning as the sun greets the dawn
6295925 we finally got a chance to tour europe last year let me tell you this song has got the continent screaming
6295926 we start by talking to the athletes on what it means to represent your country
6295927 thats something thats incredibly important to us we take that as sort of our beginning point theres a tremendous amount of country pride that comes with representing those countries
6295928 other evils there are that may come yet it is not our part to master all the tides of the world but to do what is in us for the succor of those years wherein we are set uprooting the evil in the fields that we know so that those who live after may have clean earth to till what weather they shall have is not ours to rule
6295929 do you live near here do you need a ride i am worried about you and the baby
6295930 ferice de cei f r prihan n calea lor care umbl ntotdeauna dup legea domnului
6295931 has this woman been prayed for with laying on of hands
6295932 i want to give thanks to god last sunday i was prayed for for healing and i went home and that night i slept for the first time in two weeks and ive slept every night since then
6295933 although there is a small minority of parents who object to the vaccine because of their beliefs about sexuality and the fact that it prevents a sexually transmitted infection to most parents the mode of transmission is not whats important
6295934 the families who are struggling with what to do about this vaccine are focused on issues like safety
6295935 they want us to have more experience with it and have it used by more people
6295936 we tend to overrate the power of conservative forces in our society on the everyday lives of people for example roman catholics use contraception and have abortions at about the same rates as other women in this country
6295937 this is standard practice i mean i dont think anybodys surprised by it it doesnt matter who the democratic nominee was going to be theres an apparatus theres an infrastructure thats been developed to run negative attacks on democratic candidates but thats not something that im going to spend time worrying about
6295938 thats the reason why we have to bring about a fundamental change in washington and in america to restore the american dream and lynchburg thats why i am running for president of the united states
6295939 john mccain i dont know what his education plan is because for years he has not spent very much time thinking about education
6295940 are you better off that you were four years ago are you better off than 8 years so why the heck would you want to do the same things we have been doing
6295941 i am familiar with your policy in iraq and after spending a year there i agree we need to get out
6295942 if you will fight for me i will fight for you thank you god bless you
6295943 i think the more people who pay attention to obamas campaign and his platform the more theyre gonna come to the republican party energy security national security and economic security john mccain
6295944 john mccains recipe for success is cutting taxes reducing spending reducing the burden on businesses throughout this country and thats why i think people are starting to come around to john mccains message cause they know its going to work and thats what matters to people at the kitchen table whats gonna work whats gonna make my life better for the next four years
6295945 he is dynamic hes youthful and he wants to talk to everyone
6295946 its the just the fact that hes the next president of the united states and he shook my hand and i got a couple of pictures of him so im satisfied im happy
6295947 we just wanted to come out and hear what the competition had to say and see what he was going to tell everybody out here and some of the stuff that he was supporting
6295948 i have also learnt that usain has invited an international beauty queen to visit his country and home town
6295949 if that is true there is no way usain or his guest should drive on these bad roads leading into his community and worse yet there is no running water here
6295950 the world saw a bit of it when he went to the world junior championships and now they are witnessing it on the biggest stage of all
6295951 thats how he plays with me and with his girlfriend
6295952 its not unusual to find him wrestling with his dad
6295953 its a pity for a big country like the united states to make such a small statement
6295954 they always bring up michigan it kind of gets annoying
6295955 we didnt win a ring off of michigan after that we went through a whole season luckily we had our heads on straight
6295956 armanti right now is seeing so many more things down the field than he did a year ago
6295957 these guys out here theyve got the system down pretty well
6295958 theyre running around flying to the ball and in the right place
6295959 if somebody in that group might have said they were leaving then it could have been the type of situation where everyone left
6295960 i was talking to marcus freeman after the bcs championship game and he said you cant make a decision to come back just on trying to get to the national championship game because we understand how hard it is to get there let alone try to win it
6295961 he said he wanted to experience his senior year and i kind of felt the same way im excited about how my senior year might play out
6295962 my dad and mom made a list of the pros and cons they felt i made a good decision
6295963 im a man of faith if i get hurt it wasnt gods will for me to play football im comfortable with that maybe some guys arent comfortable with that and are thinking you idiot take the money but there are always avenues to go down other than football
6295964 up here i got in trouble and suspended for a couple of games it made me realize that it can be taken away from you just that fast all youve worked for can be gone in a second because of a stupid decision i think its helped me mature and become a man
6295965 youve got to be a man on and off the field
6295966 you cant just show it on the field anymore its both parts everyone watches both parts now
6295967 i remember the first practice i was just getting killed i was getting hit like ive never been hit before
6295968 it opened my eyes like look youve got to work hard its not going to be handed to you like in high school high school i was kind of lazy and still do good get my name in the paper the next day up here ive had to work it knocked the laziness out of me
6295969 i like playing in front of the fans i love the atmosphere
6295970 youre playing in the horseshoe ohio stadium we played at wisconsin the atmosphere is just awesome
6295971 we dont link humanitarian aid to political issues such as the nuclear issue
6295972 se i sentimenti di nana verso ren fossero stati cos semplici da potersi riassumere in un banale
6295973 our kids are very excited about playing the game again
6295974 its a great game for the opener its two catholic teams playing again
6295975 it could go either way a defensive game or an offensive game i know itll be very physical they are very physical and id like to think we are too
6295976 lima central catholic and delphos st johns have been such a nice rivalry in basketball and i think its carrying over into football
6295977 i expect it to be that same kind of war as last year with hard hitting and play with great passion and enthusiasm it should be a nice football game to watch
6295978 hes oconnor picking up the offense and were trying to make sure what we do is within the realm of what hes capable of doing
6295979 he got hit in that quad and its a little sore
6295980 jordan has great speed if he has a crease hes quick to get to get through it
6295981 were right down the road and weve had that rivalry in basketball
6295982 i have been a dolly fan all of my life she is a wonderful woman i really connect with her music and i cant think of a better role model for my children
6295983 dolly has this great sweet personality but she is also so strong and wise i got her blessing she was honoured i had chosen the name dolly
6295984 i hate this stupid tricare system that sends me 15 miles away to a place that has no parking spots
6295985 no i will not reschedule the appointment im going to find a civilian doctor like we used to have
6295986 people take different roads seeking fulfillment and happiness just because theyre not on your road doesnt mean theyve gotten lost
6295987 we had good people im disappointed that weve lost them but in every case theyve got a bigger role a bigger paycheck
6295988 we dont link humanitarian aid to political issues such as the nuclear issue
6295989 se i sentimenti di nana verso ren fossero stati cos semplici da potersi riassumere in un banale
6295990 my client isnt afraid of anything but a biased and unfair trial due to pressures from many parties including from the international community
6295991 if you assault a police officer you should as a minimum get a police record
6295992 a spent conviction sends a message that the offending behaviour is minor
6295993 anyone who is convicted of assaulting a police officer will receive a criminal record no matter how minor the assault is
6295994 i think he wants to make sure he gets it checked out and make sure everything is all right with it
6295995 when hes been able to practice and move around hes looked awfully good to me
6295996 i think we have a number of guys that are in that category who have some soreness and my concern will be if it lingers
6295997 hopefully it wont linger and hopefully in the next week to 10 days hes going to be all right and ready to get going
6295998 obviously this injury is one of those things you have to kind of handle daily
6295999 i continue to monitor it because ideally i want to be at full strength come the opener
6296000 were a giant step closer to achieving justice for the balazs family and in general
6296001 i can only hope it will be resolved as soon as possible
6296002 but ever since hungary submitted his extradition request he and his family have done everything possible to prevent that from happening
6296003 i mean all these claims that he wont get a fair trial i mean this is really rubbish this is pure fantasy these are merely lame excuses by people who are desperate to stop the legal process
6296004 i think its very important that people remember and look at zentai and think of the young person who is accused of committing a terrible crime the most terrible crime
6296005 to think of peter balazs whose life was horribly ended just because he was a jew at the age of 18
6296006 he had a bright future and a loving family and his life was brutally ended and his body was thrown into the danube with not even a grave to go to
6296007 australias one of the worlds great democracies and has a stirling record in many spheres but unfortunately in this area the record has not been good
6296008 these are merely lame excuses by people who are desperate to stop the legal process
6296009 hes been a valuable employee with us for quite a long time
6296010 he was the first person who became infected in this outbreak
6296011 it is just devastating for the last five weeks i guess his family has virtually had to make a daily vigil with him against overwhelming odds

6296026 my favorite compliment is when somebody gets one of my photos and they call back and ask if they can get a copy to give to their mother and ive gotten that compliment from people as different as bo diddley and lou reed when they ask for a copy to give to their mother i know ive done my job right because i know that that picture looks like what they want to look like
6296027 i was there until three or four in the morning drinking taking pictures having fun then id come home and have to develop the film and around five in the morning i was printing the pictures
6296028 and by noon the next day id be out around town on my bicycle dropping them off for the record companies and the magazines and it was a pretty 24 7 job

6296033 my dad was bragging to somebody and said that his son was in japan taking pictures of kiss
6296034 and the other person was horrified and said kiss represents sex drugs and rock n roll and everything thats wrong
6296035 i dont really know anybody from the old days who is still doing as much of the wild life as much of the drinking and drugging that we used to do
6296036 it comes to a point where you really cant do it every night for 40 years you can do it every night for four years maybe even 14 years but i dont know about after 40 years youre really pushing your luck
6296037 its actually a horizontal picture and the rest of the band is over here
6296038 but i cropped it just for joe after he died i was going to bring some pictures to his funeral and i picked this one out and his wife ended up putting it on the coffin
6296039 you live with it everyday when youre close to someone and you lose them you feel it all the time
6296040 its like a deep wound and eventually youll form a scar but whenever that scar gets touched you feel it all the way inside
6296041 dont worry theyre just warming me up and their boyfriends are going to come over and ask me about led zeppelin until about three in the morning and it happens over and over again
6296042 the campers put on a play a musical play and i was down front with my brownie hawkeye and i took some pictures and i mailed the pictures home to my mom and she developed them and sent me the prints and i actually sold them to the campers
6296043 i like to think thats pretty much what i did for the rest of my life except my mom wasnt making the prints any more
6296044 it was a long time before they really kind of accepted that as something to do for a living
6296045 you know youre supposed to get a job and then enjoy photography at the night or on the weekends
6296046 there was a lot of times when youre wondering if youre ever gonna make any money and there were times when i was three months behind in the rent and the phone was about to be cut off
6296047 my grandfather said i could make money on an iceberg
6296048 you know im kind of a hustler and i know if i wake up saturday morning and i have a date for saturday night and i need some money ill find it
6296049 people were cheering they were booing they were fighting with each other right in the seats
6296050 a lot of purists thought this was a folk music place and you couldnt play rock n roll
6296051 a lot of times when im taking photos i dont remember exactly what song they were playing
6296052 i will shoot the rolling stones for three songs and ill sing along while im taking pictures and then i get off stage and someone says what songs did they do and i go i dont even know im thinking f stops focusing timing lighting
6296053 when you see a band like kiss or alice cooper nowadays those are iconic names when they started out they were kind of side show weirdos
6296054 before they would come out i would go out and play a call to arms in a charge
6296055 i saw the dolls and it just blew me away
6296056 i gave up a lot of security i gave up the time to be able to live with my family
6296057 in the middle of the 70s i broke up with my first wife and my son managed to see my son quite often but didnt live with him and i think thats the biggest thing i gave up
6296058 nowadays they can say a band that is kind of like motley crew but with an alice cooper singer well when i saw them alice cooper wasnt compared to anybody
6296059 you know tina turner was not like anybody and so i kind of saw a lot of originals

6296070 were not just going to see mid sized banks go under in the next few months
6296071 the apocalyptic opening lines seem to capture the beleaguered mindset of the uk commercial real estate market

6296079 the city of seattle and clay bennetts ownership group have divvied up the artifacts of the nbas past in the pacific northwest with the details outlined in a settlement obtained wednesday by the associated press the agreement calls for bennetts professional basketball club to leave any banners trophies and retired jerseys those will be placed in a curatorship at seattles museum of history and industry although the new oklahoma city franchise would be allowed to borrow them to put on display periodically and make copies the franchise is also leaving some keyarena furniture and equipment in seattle noting it will take 150 courtside seats 24 office chairs three televisions and other equipment that is still being used by the wnba team
6296080 things get even fuzzier when it comes down to exactly what history will remain attached to the new oklahoma city squad and what remains the property of seattle
6296081 each free to use and refer to the sonics history
6296082 it happens sometimes these cyclical ups and downs just think of the rest of the world as the nba eastern conference about five years ago and you wont be far off the americans still havent faced argentina or lithuania so there may yet be some pockets of resistance out there but i doubt it from the looks of the preliminaries and the quarterfinal victory over the aussies 116 85 this will be a one note parade to the top of the podium while the americans were busy building chemistry and resolve these past three years the other nations unraveled a bit through assimilation injury and age
6296083 earlier this year nike china launched a bryant reality tv show called kobe mentu or
6296084 what kobe has given china before this the olympics is a sign of respect as if saying youre good enough so im going to keep coming here he has showed them respect over the last few years and its been reciprocated at a very high level its unbelievable really
6296085 instead the real growth is coming in team usas ability to pay incredibly strict attention to its own man in doing that and not looking for every steal or to put a massive two hand block on every poor non nba talent that dares waltz into the lane even the guards were thinking that early on team usa is discovering how to defend international basketball and the leader is kobe bean bryant he hasnt been the best team usa defender in terms of sheer output that distinction would go to chris bosh who has been able to live up to his potential and cover huge gobs of hardwood at a time especially in screen roll situations but he is saying the right things to his teammates getting the point across and keeping a clear mind
6296086 what has happened at the beijing olympics is the beginning of james most valuable player campaign for 2008 09 he always could pass he always could attack the basket more relentlessly than anyone the cavaliers forwards emergence as a devastating defender completes the picture kobe bryant is still the top lockdown defender on what seems to be an unbeatable american team but bryants forced shots on offense and poor 3 point shooting keep him from being more than the third best player on the team so far behind james and dwyane wade all you kobephiles please take your place for the official protest in the line to the left the one that appears to contain the population of china james defense has been a surprise only if you were not paying attention last season when he routinely took the oppositions best player in crunch time
6296087 i used to host tournaments in the garage at my house
6296088 people think beer pong is binge drinking but we dont make people drink at all

6296091 intel has just loosened the restrictions on what can be said and posted about the x58 express supporting socket 1366 nehalem core i7 chipset this week and that is great for us as it allows us to report some juice bits of information to you from here in taipei we visited the gigabyte hq this afternoon and they had a single x58 board to show us it is a dummy sample right now which doesnt work dammit no benchmarks and is labeled ga x58 extreme but it will actually turn out to be the ga x58 ds4 which is a cut down and cheaper version

6296093 we dont argue that the inspector used the probes as leverage to get into the aircraft
6296094 but terrorists would not be concerned if they broke a probe to gain access to a plane

6296110 hai sandal jepit sial sekali nasib kamu diciptakan sekali saja dalam bentuk buruk dan tidak menarik
6296111 apa menariknya menjadi sandal jepit tidak ada kebanggaan bagi para pemakainya tidak pernah mendapatkan tempat penyimpanan yang istimewa dan tidak pernah disesali pada saat hilang kasihan sekali kamu
6296112 wahai sepatu yang terhormat mungkin semua orang akan memiliki kebanggaan jika memakai sepatu yang indah dan mewah sepertimu mereka akan menyimpannya di tempat yang terjaga membersihkannya meskipun masih bersih bahkan sekali sekali memamerkan kepada sanak keluarga maupun tetangga yang berkunjung ke rumahnya
6296113 tetapi sepatu yang terhormat kamu hanya menemaninya di didalam kesemuan pergi ke kantor maupun ke undangan undangan pesta untuk sekedar sebuah kebanggaan kamu hanya dipakai sesekali saja bedakan dengan aku aku siap menemani kemana saja pemakaiku pergi bahkan aku sangat loyal meski dipakai ke toilet ataupun kamar mandi aku memunculkan kerinduan bagi pemakaiku setelah dia seharian dalam cengkeraman keindahanmu maka manusia akan segera merindukanku karena apa wahai sepatu karena aku memunculkan kenyamanan dan kelonggaran aku tidak membutuhkan perhatian dan perawatan yang spesial dalam kamus kehidupanku jika kita ingin membuat orang bahagia maka kita harus menciptakan kenyamanan untuknya
6296114 sepatu sahabatku yang terhormat untuk apa kehebatan kalau sekedar untuk dipamerkan dan menimbulkan efek ketakutan untuk kehilangan untuk apa kepandaian dikeluarkan hanya untuk sekedar mendapatkan kekaguman
6296115 sahabatku ditengah kekaguman sesungguhnya kita sedang menciptakan tembok pembeda yang tebal semakin kita ingin dikagumi maka sesungguhnya kita sedang membangun temboknya
6296116 lihat sahabatku bahkan untuk berbuat kebaikanpun manusia mengajakku dan meninggalkanmu

6296126 the agency lacks the budget the statutory authority and the scientific expertise to ensure the hundreds of nanoproducts now on the market among them baby bottle nipples infant teething rings paints waxes kitchenware and appliances are safe this problem will only worsen as more sophisticated nanotechnology based products begin to enter the consumer market
6296127 during the fall of 2007 many americans faced a hazard in their products that had been banned for 30 years lead as millions of childrens toys coated with lead paint were recalled it became clear that government oversight had failed and that the cpsc the agency primarily responsible for the oversight of these toys was stretched too thin from years of neglect underfunding and the challenges posed by an increasingly global manufacturing system
6296128 it is against this background that we need to ask the question is the cpsc adequately prepared to deal with nanotechnology which is now associated with more than 800 manufacturer identified consumer products ranging from infant pacifiers to paints to appliances to clothing
6296129 it took decades of research before lawmakers found the political will to keep lead and phthalates out of toys it could take a very long time to research and ensure that potentially dangerous nanomaterials are kept out too
6296130 we want to win so in the high end space running traditional gaming applications dx opengl etc we will win and when you take advantage of its unique characteristics and some of the more advanced techniques that it will enable it will shine
6296131 what weve said is that the first market for larrabee is discrete graphics and were out to win running traditional games and if you take advantage of the new capabilities of larrabee we think itll be highly differentiated a much superior architecture compared to anything else thats in the marketplace then weve said that were going to bring it across the market right into the volume segments of discrete as well as explore adjacent markets including things like high performance computing workstations and including game consoles we think its a pretty compelling alternative for that and wed be delighted to win some of those with it obviously no products announced or anything like that but we think its a very natural adjacency
6296132 its crazy its been that way since i was a little boy
6296133 its been just nicknames for some reason people feel like i need a nickname my first name is just not enough
6296134 certain things happened in his life with his family and mom but were very very happy
6296135 derrells life was probably a little bit tougher than average he was an only child thats why he was always here through circumstances and choices his mom made he ended up with us
6296136 i feel like whats happened to me happened for a reason
6296137 im blessed for what happened to me im just thankful everyone has a different story and thats mine
6296138 most people most players dont ask for it no one ever asks for hype but i know one thing when there is hype it motivates you it sets a spark under you like youve got to go youve got to do it
6296139 an internet legend i dont know if im excited about that
6296140 id rather be an on the field legend but youve got to start somewhere i guess as far as that goes thats just the fans fans are going to be fans fans are going to be fans no matter where you go
6296141 i wouldnt say in disguise hes a blessing every day every day i talk to him everything the man says makes more sense to me than just about anything ive ever heard from a coaching standpoint
6296142 if it werent for my mom and dad i definitely wouldnt be standing here giving you this interview
6296143 they changed my life in a huge way they steered me in a direction where i had no other choice but to go toward success
6296144 i work hard in the classroom and on the field so i can see their faces thats satisfaction enough for me nothing is more satisfying
6296145 hes very much into his family very proud and appreciative of all the opportunities hes gotten
6296146 he makes it very easy to have done what we did you just couldnt help it he was such a great kid
6296147 they try to contact me just to maybe i dont know if i would use the word rekindle but thats what i would say

6296153 if we are going to teach creation science as an alternative to evolution then we should also teach the stork theory as an alternative to biological reproduction
6296154 their quote to me was your case has some merit but we cant change the rule
6296155 thats disappointing to me because they really didnt look at our side of the argument they just said they couldnt change a rule
6296156 weve exhausted every option we had they told us there was nothing else we could do
6296157 there was a shortage in blood and so we decided to donate blood
6296158 the smoke and embers resulting from the use of outdoor fireplaces in densely populated areas are landing on adjacent properties decks and patio furniture causing concerns and creating a fire safety issue
6296159 nothing else good that was going on could receive any attention because of that issue

6296166 yeah cause stuff like that happens in real life all the time
6296167 the defence played extremely well and dave pitching great once again thats all you can ask for
6296168 anytime you get guys pitching into the seventh inning chances are we can win
6296169 it also keeps the bullpen fresh for the next game
6296170 if our defence keeps us close the offence will eventually kick in
6296171 our goalies made the right saves at the right times and thats the bottom line
6296172 it will be nice to have our name on the plaque and trophy because it will always be there
6296173 i consider myself more a player than a coach because i still have the passion of playing
6296174 interacting on the ice with these kids has been fun
6296175 jim and his coaches have been doing a great job training these young hockey players his camp gets kids off the couch during the summer as they train to get to the next level instead of lying around
6296176 i traveled two hours to get to school woke up at 5 a m and didnt get home until 9 p m
6296177 all i did was homework and play hockey so i was very committed
6296178 community support is so important to the success of our violence prevention efforts
6296179 the proceeds from this tournament bring us closer to raising the 1million needed for our raise respect campaign
6296180 these programs are challenging the attitudes that allow violence to be tolerated and giving youth women and men the skills they need to build and maintain healthy respectful relationships
6296181 the funds raised since the campaign began in 2005 have enabled us to develop and deliver customized programs for men and boys increase our outreach to the community at large and change our youth programming from single to more effective multi session programs
6296182 in fact were now reaching 65 per cent more youth and have doubled the number of adults we reach in our violence prevention initiatives we need the funds to continue these initiatives and meet the rest of the goals of the campaign
6296183 my goal is to bring my two biggest passions together in the same project
6296184 each day we see another story about child and adult obesity and together with c3 kinetico and the ontario lung association we have decided to create a yearly running festival to motivate people to get active and be more health conscious
6296185 we are starting he event at 12 30 p m in the afternoon to take advantage of the great september weather and the fall colours that are occurring
6296186 c3 has been famous for the incredible kids of steel race we have put on in the past and we anticipate making the kinetico running festival even bigger
6296187 i want to share the exciting behind the scenes stories from beijing with our town and at the same time encourage the people to help volunteer or participate in this great new healthy festival
6296188 the cbc and newspapers can only tell so many stories but i see a lot of the behind the scene stories that are not told in public and people who get my daily newsletter will understand the olympic games that much deeper
6296189 if you want something youve never had you must be willing to do something youve never done

6296195 were aware that there seems to be an anomaly in our imagery and are working to determine what happened
6296196 its been about eight years since weve have this kind of precipitation
6296197 its worked out well in terms of service delivery for the rest of the community
6296198 but were still going to be finishing both our large capital projects this year
6296199 we are very pleased with the success of this years championship
6296200 in particular it was encouraging to see that about one third of the saturday night audience had never previously been to the championship we couldnt do this without the people who have been attending for many years but we need to attract new people as well this continued success means that our rotary club will be able to this year fund numerous charitable projects both in the local community and around the world
6296201 were willing to defend your plan but youve got to be there with us
6296202 while we recognize the challenges facing municipalities and developers as they implement the growth plan for the greater golden horseshoe our government believes there is no need for a public inquiry
6296203 municipal leaders developers and communities need to work together to plan successfully for an additional 3 7 million people and 1 8 million jobs in the region
6296204 i understand this is a difficult process and we have full confidence in you and your elected colleagues to implement the growth plan that will help shape the future of caledon
6296205 our government stands behind the growth plan and its role in helping caledon and other municipalities address the need to plan for responsible growth our job as elected officials is to make tough decisions and stand by those decisions
6296206 you guys deal with it and leave us out of it
6296207 during the bid coe rediscovered his roots which played a crucial part in london winning
6296208 coes mother was of indian origin but coe had never visited india he was invited by india to run for them in the 1988 seoul olympics when britain refused to choose him
6296209 but during the london bid coe visited his mothers country for the first time
6296210 soon he had built up a successful coalition of the entire commonwealth and not just the old white one that had often in the past been the domain of previous british sports administrators
6296211 the word here is that london will do it its own way with a touch of british funkiness
6296212 that british ability to surprise people by being different will make up for the fact that stadia will not be iconic there will be nothing like the birds nest in stratford where the venues will be smaller and the whole thing much more functional than here in beijing
6296213 having the human body as a canvas is extremely powerful intense complex and unique
6296214 personal branding is noise its talking about ones self instead of talking about something thats useful to others but another way you might look at it is that personal branding is leverage once you know me you start to build a relationship with me once we have a relationship i can share even more with you
6296215 it shows your sense of humor and your passion points

6296220 john was so respected he meant so much to so many people
6296221 in fact so many people from emmaus wanted to visit him while he was ill that his daughters had to set up a list to regulate it
6296222 tim called and said he had terrible news john had terminal cancer
6296223 he hadnt looked unwell or said he was unwell it was shocking
6296224 i occasionally called for a chat but i wouldnt normally have called john at home
6296225 it was awkward in that you didnt know whether to be silently supportive or jump in there i chose to jump in there and express my shock i felt strongly that i needed to do something
6296226 people can under estimate their reaction because they underestimate the closeness of relationships people form in the workplace
6296227 sometimes you are closer to your colleagues than your family so of course a death has a big impact
6296228 it was quite unsettling and in an open plan office its very difficult to have a private conversation but john made it easy for us by being very open and then the practical people in the office started drawing up lists and rotas to turn the sense of helplessness into practical action
6296229 if you have a close relationship you will go through the normal grieving process
6296230 but even if youre not close to the person you might start thinking about death in general or thinking about people in your family dying or about someone who has died in the past and if its a sudden death the mind and body often find it very difficult to accept
6296231 whether you get everyone together or you do it by e mail communication needs to be very open and honest
6296232 managers should make themselves available to staff but also recognise that they are not qualified to provide counselling which is where hr should become involved
6296233 two days after i started filling in for a man who had gone on holiday the company got a call to say that he had died
6296234 i was in the office when they got the call it was a small team they had worked with him for 20 years everyone else is grieving and you dont know the person at all
6296235 this is making it tougher because of the time involved these people are badly decomposed and its going to take time to find out who they are that is key in our investigation
6296236 we have to go back in time and research records so it does make it diffucult
6296237 to form an identity whether its dna unless you have a possible name you have nothing to compare to
6296238 it was probably too late to think about employing additional resources as council had basically missed its opportunity of getting an lep drafted in time to have it certified by the dop by september 2008
6296239 was not realistic to consider then that a shorter time frame was possible
6296240 if companies are hiring people who are hiv positive and seeing that as hiring people who are disabled they are missing the point and misrepresenting what a disability is
6296241 hiv on its own cannot be regarded as a disability
6296242 there is such a stigma and often exclusion of hiv positive people that it can be both a disadvantage and a disability
6296243 as part of rehabilitating hiv patients and reintegrating them into society we try to help them find employment so they can support themselves and continue to live healthy lives and take their medication
6296244 i think the selling point for companies was that it is free they dont pay the learners they get about r50 000 tax off per person and it ups the companies bee ratings and equity plan ratings
6296245 what companies are doing is giving a chance to hiv positive people whose hiv status has led to their unemployment or no chance of employment at all
6296246 this has implications for our picture of neanderthals and perhaps the reasons for their extinction if the population was teetering on the brink for hundreds of thousands of years it may change our impression of what it would have taken to make them go extinct rather than if there were millions of them

6296300 the weak position of the federal budget became the main reason of the black august in 1998 in the summer of 1998 the finance ministry could fund only a half of its spending with the help of taxes the other half was funded at the expense of borrowings when markets stopped lending money to the ministry the federal budget was unable to function properly
6296301 i was very surprised to hear yesterdays statement from finance minister kudrin who did not say a word about the budgetary policy and the weakness of russia s budget during the period of the crisis moreover i was surprised to hear mr kudrin laying the blame for the crisis on the imf if the minister said what he really thouhgt then it means that our government had not learned any lesson from the events that happened ten years ago

6296315 case number 12138 log number us 08192008 0014 submitted date wed 20 aug 2008 02 23 47 utc event date sat 15 oct 1977 23 00 00 utc status submitted city newark region ohio country us longitude 82 38700103759765 latitude 40 088199615478516 shape cigar distance 100 feet or less location farmland terrain woods visibility overcast description i had met a friend who knew of my interest in ufos she was an old neighbor of mine who had also witnessed a craft i had seen 3 years earlier she had since moved with her family into a new house on the other side of the small town we lived in she told me about a strange event that was happening every evening at her house and asked if i would be interested in coming over to see for myself a few days later i arrived at her home just before dusk as she had told me this event usually occured as it was beginning to get dark the house had a large yard which was surrounded by woods there were no neighbors for quite some distance typical in those days for rural ohio we went outside as it started to get dark watching the woods to the right of the house it was not quite dark you could still see the outlines of the trees against the sky when through the woods came a procession of white cigar shaped craft there were 3 of them one behind the other each was 50 70 feet long and had red white and blue lights they were completely silent and had no wings or fins the angle at which they emerged would suggest that they were coming from a position on or underground we watched as they slowly flew over the field across from her house and disappeared into the distance
6296316 i believe that these extra terrestrial vehicles and their crews are visiting this planet from other planets most astronauts were reluctant to discuss ufos
6296317 i did have occasion in 1951 to have two days of observation of many flights of them of different sizes flying in fighter formation generally from east to west over europe
6296318 for many years i have lived with a secret in a secrecy imposed on all specialists in astronautics i can now reveal that every day in the usa our radar instruments capture objects of form and composition unknown to us and there are thousands of witness reports and a quantity of documents to prove this but nobody wants to make them public why because authority is afraid that people may think of god knows what kind of horrible invaders so the password still is we have to avoid panic by all means
6296319 i was furthermore a witness to an extraordinary phenomenon here on this planet earth it happened a few months ago in florida there i saw with my own eyes a defined area of ground being consumed by flames with four indentations left by a flying object which had descended in the middle of a field beings had left the craft there were other traces to prove this they seemed to have studied topography they had collected soil samples and eventually they returned to where they had come from disappearing at enormous speed i happen to know that authority did just about everything to keep this incident from the press and tv in fear of a panicky reaction from the public
6296320 neil armstrong relayed the message to mission control that two large mysterious objects were watching them after having landed near the moon module but this message was never heard by the public because nasa censored it
6296321 i was testing a p 51 fighter in minneapolis when i spotted this object i was at about 10 000 feet on a nice bright sunny afternoon i thought the object was a kite then i realized that no kite is gonna fly that high
6296322 i have no idea what it could be it was grayish in color and about thrity to forty feet away
6296323 i dont feel like speculating about them all i know is what appeared on the film which was developed after the flight
6296324 ive been asked about ufos and ive said publicly i thought they ufos were somebody else some other civilization
6296325 the encounter was common knowledge in nasa but nobody has talked about it until now
6296326 all apollo and gemini flights were followed both at a distance and sometimes also quite closely by space vehicles of extraterrestrial origin flying saucers or ufos if you want to call them by that name every time it occurred the astronauts informed mission control who then ordered absolute silence
6296327 i think that walter schirra aboard mercury 8 was the first of the astronauts to use the code name santa claus to indicate the presence of flying saucers next to space capsules however his announcements were barely noticed by the general public it was a little different when james lovell on board the apollo 8 command module came out from behind the moon and said for everybody to hear please be informed that there is a santa claus even though this happened on christmas day 1968 many people sensed a hidden meaning in those words

6296376 less humorous and far more hectoring than whats the matter with kansas this volume quickly devolves into a highly partisan manichaean minded screed against conservatives and private sector economics mr frank comes across in these pages as a sort of parody of the liberal right wingers love to hate as someone in love with big government for the sake of big government and opposed to all manner of capitalism and entrepreneurial initiative

6296382 i read the suicide index with a rapacity bordering on need with tears in my chest and in my eyes occasionally i had to put it down and leave the room more often i devoured it the book is the product of a loving daughters grief and part of her process of grieving but it is also the measured elegant gripping work of a professional writer who has set her powers of observation to work on her own family her parents and grandparents her uncle her sister her husband her son and on herself

6296447 as you know attorney general guidelines were first implemented in the wake of the fbi abuses of the 1960s and 1970s and serve as one of the most important bulwarks against future abuses

6296541 we are impressed with their people products and technologies an acquisition would certainly benefit aladdins customers employees and shareholders as we combine our resources to better serve certain security markets a key to our global success has been engaging with companies bringing them into safenet and using our joint resources to tackle much broader market opportunities
6296542 we have outlined two compelling proposals to aladdin and we have been told that the board is conducting a comprehensive review with the assistance of their outside advisors we hope to receive feedback early next week and move quickly into an expedited due diligence phase our proposal which does not include any financing conditions reflects our genuine interest in acquiring all or a portion of aladdin under either acquisition proposal we would expect to retain and invest in the talented employees as well as israeli location and identity of the aladdin operations

6296545 but when he resorts to these kinds of falsehoods and casts such aspersions on his opponents patriotism john mccain is no longer putting his country first if he were he would recognize that the interests of the nation require a relatively truthful campaign to fulfill his image of himself mccain should stop lying about his opponent for a man with his claims to honor and integrity thats not too much to ask

6296587 pero talaga suwerte talaga ako yung mga ginagawan kong artista nagiging best actress judy ann santos best actor piolo pascual even president gma
6296588 panay ang inom ko pero hindi ko pa nagagalaw yung pagkain ko
6296589 sa totoo lang ang dami kong iniisip puwede po bang i repeat yung question mo
6296590 bale ang first reaction ko umoo kaagad ako nang hindi nagdadalawang isip actually lahat ng mga filipino mahilig talagang kumanta e kumakanta po talaga ako sa bahay namin kaya po talaga ako umoo dahil ang habol ko po talaga e makikita po ako ng mga kaibigan ko na kakanta sa tv
6296591 nung tumawag sila sabi ko teka muna im not a singer sabi nila maam performer ka tapos sabi ko sige flattered ako sa tingin ng gma i can perform tapos sabi ni tessa you should vote buy mahirap sa akin yan ilokana ako e at mahirap umasa sa mga ilokano kasi matipid sila pero im going to perform
6296592 the first time they told me about joining the competition four letter word what
6296593 nung in invite po ako ang first reaction ko was ha lalaitin nyo ako pero sabi ko okay lang babaklain ko lang yun pero nung sinabi ko sa mga anak ko yung isang anak ko magaling kumanta mommy i have to coach ill coach you how to sing you might be out of tune english speaking yung mga anak ko e
6296594 sa totoo lang natuwa ako kasi nung ibinigay nila sa akin yung lyrics ng fever ang haba sabi ko papaano ko mame memorize to e may memory gap ako pero buti na lang nung actual recording na in edit ginawa lang nilang one minute tuwang tuwa ako
6296595 bale nung unang malaman ko na invited ako sa show na to siyempre natuwa ako kasi nagawa ko nang lahat dancing sumali na ako sa competition natalo ako so siguro this time sana manalo na ako di ba kasi ibang field to and dream ko talagang kumanta
6296596 pero hindi talaga ako sure kung may talent talaga ako sa singing
6296597 nung nalaman ko na sasali si chairman fernando muntik na akong mag backout
6296598 so naisip ko na marami rin ang inis sa kanya so may chance pa kami so huwag nang sample surprise na lang
6296599 meron pa akong isang reason kung bakit hindi ako nag backout may bagong inspiration ako kaya hindi na ako magba backout
6296600 when i first found out i was in a coffee shop
6296601 playing football you learn if you want it the most youll succeed so i need to prove that i wanted it the most i need to want it more than all of you fellow contenders although i know all of you also want to win i need to prove i wanted it the most salamat po

6296604 vin gupta founded infogroup in 1972 and for more than three decades has guided the companys tremendous growth we are grateful for his leadership and we want to thank him for his contributions
6296605 after long deliberation i have decided that this change is in the best interest of the company
6296606 i look forward to continuing my service as a director of the company and to pursuing new business opportunities
6296607 infogroup is a financially strong company with a healthy balance sheet solid cash flow and tremendous growth potential one of our top priorities is to ensure that infogroup continues to provide the best highest quality products and services to our customers in the industries we serve
6296608 these have been exciting times and i have so many memories from the last few months
6296609 i said michael would not be able to do it only because of the competition
6296610 i think luck plays a role and you look at the 4x100m freestyle relay against the french it was very lucky and in the 100 butterfly
6296611 but what michael has done is wonderful never in my life did i think i would see such an achievement
6296612 i was always 100 per cent sure michael would do it
6296613 everything was down to michael it was all about what michael wanted to do
6296614 it was up to him and from day one when he won the 400 individual medley i knew he had everything under control
6296615 i always thought anything is possible and it was a matter of getting down to it working hard
6296616 when someone says it is not possible i like that it fires me up it motivates me
6296617 its been a crazy few weeks and i can say ive been happy to be here
6296618 napagkasunduan namin lahat na huwag na din ituloy kasi were here naman lang mainly to have fun and to play so okey din pareho kaming panalo
6296619 tapos every sunday itong grupong to naglalaro sila sa campus namin sa quezon city and then napag usapan foundation week kasi our foundation is in september one month before the foundation week parati kaming may ganito parang intrams start of the games
6296620 baka naman hingan ako nito ng malaking talent fee i dont have that kind of money for all of them
6296621 yong naging idea ni dong was scholarship so sabi ko sige sige pag usapan natin so the only agreement we had was well give him two full scholarships he chooses kung sino ang bibigyan then ang requirement lang namin is that whoever the student is they will abide by the school rules kumbaga no special favors kailangan siyang pumasok kailangan niyang i maintain yong grades kasi he would be recognized as a dingdong dantes scholar e nakakahiya sa kanya
6296622 you have to understand that most of the students who decide to become seafarers do not come from rich families
6296623 they come from the province they sell their properties and for them basta makatapos lang sila ng course get on a ship and earn dollars so talagang theyre not from well to do families and thats the main reason why we put up the school para nga makatulong sa mga kabataan na gustong mag aral gusto maging marino
6296624 dingdong is a good friend of mine so pina block out niya yong day a few weeks ago okey naman at least napagbigyan yong schedule masaya masaya siya
6296625 first time ko kasi makalaro sa ganito yong for charity tapos first time ko makalaro yong mga co artists ko sa gma so very exciting and masaya
6296626 ako naman open naman ako sa kahit ano basta pagdating sa charity okey ako dun medyo nahihirapan lang kami kasi yong schedule e
6296627 very flattering na makasama sa charity na ganito kasi hindi lang kayo nakakapagpasaya sa mga tao kundi nakakatulong pa because yon nga this basketball game may purpose to so hindi lang siya friendly game mas nakaka reach out pa kami sa maraming tao
6296628 this season shows that you should never give up there were some races where things didnt go well for one reason or another but i was able to collect some precious points
6296629 my position after hungary is better than it was before the race we havent lost anything but we need to get better results consistently
6296630 from now on every single race will be extremely important and every single point will have a great value the fewer there are the more important they become
6296631 i think the championship will be very tight but i need to have at least one point more than my competitors after the last race this is the sole aim the rest is just details
6296632 we need to score a decent return of points whenever we can and be consistent and as competitive as we can
6296633 this year everybodys results have been more varied and every driver who has won a race has also failed to score on at least two other occasions
6296634 thats made getting strong results even more important so i think well see consistency becoming crucial as we head towards the end of the season
6296635 we still feel confident about our chances we know our rivals will be strong but weve worked hard to improve the car and were confident well be competitive this weekend
6296636 the most important thing is to finish consistently in the points
6296637 ive only seen the new track from an on board camera and it seems to be very fast for a street circuit
6296638 i always love to drive on new tracks and im always very quick to know them i cant wait to race at valencia
6296639 it will be more important than in other places to drive with continuity from friday on qualifying will be extremely important although i think there are some possibilities to overtake
6296640 if its hot that will help ferrari like at montreal you also need a bit of luck
6296641 we launched the vodafone mclaren mercedes team here at the start of 2007 and ive tested at the ricardo tormo circuit so the city isnt unfamiliar to me
6296642 going to a new circuit doesnt really change my preparations everybodys in the same situation so i dont treat things very differently
6296643 i still believe i am improving and learning more about the team and the car at each race
6296644 my aim for the last part of the season is to win more races and to perform regularly at the front
6296645 its something i was able to do from time to time in the first half of the year but i now feel more confident that i can be a consistent challenger in the remaining races

6296665 the main focus is to grow the site to appeal to retailers at the moment it is used by very few retailers and ebay sees potential in growing itself as a platform for anyone to buy anything
6296666 you cannot afford to ignore ebay but if you have a well developed online presence it will probably be not so important for high street retailers
6296667 im a professional business manager i have a staff of more than a dozen i have worked for many high profile actors musicians and multi million dollar corporations why would i steal from rihanna i showed her all the paperwork and tried to explain to her the circumstances but she wouldnt listen she called me all sorts of horrible names and stormed off i now feel compelled to share with the world the background story as i will not allow my name to be slandered
6296668 def jam doesnt fund rihanna properly so marc uses the money rihanna makes from third party endorsements and from tours to fund her album and music videos i dont want to disrespect marcs name he is a fantastic manager and genuinely believes in rihanna but he uses her money to fund her future projects because he believes he can break her in the world market
6296669 her album sales are not nearly as close to her single sales and he knows that if she is only known as a singles artist she will only be as good as her last hit unfortunately he didnt inform his client and im receiving the brunt of it

6296672 the kind of stress in question are those that would be experienced in a natural disaster such as an earthquake or hurricane a terrorist attack or a sudden bereavement
6296673 it is a very striking confirmation of something that has been suspected for a long time
6296674 the placenta is very sensitive to stress hormones in the mother these hormones were probably amplified during the time of the war
6296675 there is overwhelming experimental evidence that stress to pregnant mammals alters neurodevelopment in the offspring and affects their subsequent behavior both in childhood and as adults
6296676 the knowledge that maternal stress affects the fetus has important implications for mental health in a world threatened by acute violence and war

6296682 a recent trip to asia revealed that a number of japanese and south korean lcd tv oems are considering increasing their level of outsourcing to electronic manufacturing service ems providers and original design manufacturers odms
6296683 the major asian lcd tv brands which traditionally have been loath to outsource lcd tv production said the use of contract manufacturing could help them to improve risk mitigation and asset flexibility during a time of economic uncertainty
6296684 we plan to increase our tv shipments by more than 80 within the next couple of years and intend to use odms to fill the production gap
6296685 we are now reassessing the originally planned continuous internal capacity expansion and in the meanwhile conducting discussions with odms to understand their capabilities

6296794 im greatly heartened by our fan base and how theyve stuck with us through thick and thin
6296795 they are very savvy baseball fans and i think that were sixth in the american league is a reflection on the fans and their knowledge base
6296796 the ownership continues to commit the resources to field a competitive team each and every year
6296797 our baseball people have made the decisions theyve made which is why were in the fix we are and were addressing that with the search for a new gm and everything else
6296798 to see baseball matter in the northwest is really rewarding
6296799 to see fans come because of a love of the game of baseball is terrific i think thats whats happening here and when the team on the field has success i think youll see it explode again like it did in 2001 02 when we led the majors in attendance

6296816 i actually dont know how i went from step stools and picture frames to t shirts and jeans it just happened

6296832 the punjabi dialogues songs and dances went against the film the bihar distributor paid a whopping amount of money to buy singh is kinng and is now going to lose a hefty amount
6296833 ive heard that the sikh theme have gone against the films success in bihar but i dont understand why we were aware that some areas would reject the films usp namely the punjabi ambience
6296834 surprisingly the film has done extremely well even in west bengal where we thought the audience wouldve trouble connecting with the theme theres really no explanation for what has happened to singh is kinng in bihar
6296835 as soon as i have any free time thats my top priority

6296842 nothing inspired me to start a film in the intervening period besides i decided to dabble in television and established my company
6296843 i was completely disillusioned i took failure to my heart but with the passage of time i realized that one should never take failure to heart or success to head
6296844 its not its a modern day fantasy adventure let me clarify we havent copied the west or the east its an original concept very indian at heart a desi film but presented in a contemporary format
6296845 ive grown up on popular indian cinema and having grown up in a family environment youll see a lot of familial bonding in drona the bonding between jaya aunty jaya bachchan and abhishek on screen is terrific its an extension of what theyre in real life in fact jaya aunty is the trump card of my film the real usp and as a director i must add that its one of her finest works ever
6296846 we are thrilled to be presenting singh is kinng at the 33rd toronto international film festival
6296847 i am happy and honoured that singh is kinng has been invited for such a prestigious festival it has done extremely well not only in india but abroad as well
6296848 im not going to tell you whether ive asked mr bachchan to shave off his beard or not but for sure this is going to be his most startling makeover in recent times balakrishna who is also known as balki told us
6296849 while abhishek will be given a more intrinsic personality change im totally changing mr bachchans look
6296850 pa would be a far more emotional story than cheeni kum which was far more caustic dry and sharp tongued
6296851 actually cheeni kum was inspired by one scene in raj khoslas dostana where mr bachchan had confronted zeenat aman the look of utter disdain and sarcasm in his eyes remained with me thats how his character in cheeni kum was born
6296852 while in cheeni kum he was a character i had seen earlier in pa hes a totally different person it a very emotional father son story but the emotions wont be melodramatic
6296853 amitji will have no love interest his world revolves around his son will i borrow from mr bachchans real life relationship with abhishek no in fact i know them so well that ill make sure i avoid all references to their real life
6296854 jashn will be directed by the duo of raksha mistry and hasnain hyderabadwala of the train fame and will be produced by us let me also clarify that we are yet to finalize the leading lady and its definitely not sonal chauhan as reported in certain sections of the media this film will be the biggest musical by mukesh films till date i am confident of the films music and can easily assure you that it will be far more superior to even jannat with jashn we are introducing a jaipur based sensational music director called sharib and mark my words that he will be the biggest music director in bollywood within a mere span of one year he is one guy whose tunes comes from the marrow of his bones its after a long time that i have come across a pure musician
6296855 its a story of a 19 year old boy akash played by adhyayan and his ambition to become a rockstar in life he is a part of this band called jashn beyond this i cannot reveal anything

6296864 n s temos de ser frios para analisar no futebol as pessoas s analisam pelo resultado e eu n o posso ser assim nosso time tomou a iniciativa e criou as maiores oportunidades mas n o fez o gol no primeiro tempo e eles deram um chute e fizeram mas nosso time foi melhor nos dois tempos e s ver o nosso n mero de chutes

6296866 o time fez um bom jogo principalmente pelos gols e teve o dom nio o tempo todo essa vit ria que a sexta seguida em casa era uma necessidade e uma obriga o agora temos que buscar o equil brio entre vencer em casa e conseguir pontos fora tamb m
6296867 tomamos o gol de empate muito cedo o s o paulo veio para cima e ainda perdemos chances de marcar depois disto
6296868 aquele gol no in cio do segundo tempo foi fatal perdemos gols feitos e eles n o perderam nenhum esta foi a diferen a na ter a feira treinamos finaliza es curtas mas isso depende do emocional do jogador uma qualidade que uns t m e outros n o se tivesse surgido no p de pedro oldoni talvez o resultado fosse diferente

6296875 the two parties have so much in common now i can hardly tell the difference they both want to spend us into oblivion increasing our national debt they have no intention of aboloshing the income tax and federal reserve system one party wants more war one wants more welfare and higher taxes how about no more wars phasing out entitlements restoring our constitutional rights letting the american people keep more of their own money and getting the federal goverment out of every aspect of our lives that sounds like a good plan to me
6296876 we want to apologize to nascar all of our partners all of our families at jgr and all of our fans for the unfortunate incident that took place this past weekend in michigan with our two nationwide teams
6296877 a poor decision was made by some key members of our organization and 100 percent of the blame rests with us
6296878 in 17 years we have never had any representative of joe gibbs racing knowingly act outside of nascars rules and that is something we consider essential to how we operate on a daily basis
6296879 what we have determined is that these individuals involved used extremely poor judgment in attempting to alter the results of nascars dyno test following saturdays nationwide series race in michigan
6296880 although in no way was anything done that might have altered the race outcome these jgr employees attempted to circumvent the nascar rule book and that is unacceptable

6296952 poll after poll continues to show that people around the world admire value and want american culture products and know how none of which is in the dominion of the u s government instead we should encourage the private sector to do a greater job of exporting these goods and ideas to those who want and need them the next u s president should make an effort to consolidate and guide existing public diplomacy measures under a single roof that should span government and the private sector
6296953 the u s house of representatives has a chance to do what it would not in 2003 take a stand against media consolidation which is one of the greatest threats to democracy the u s senate worked in the publics interest when it passed a resolution of disapproval of media consolidation in may the house has been content to sit on its companion piece which would kill a new federal communications commission rule that essentially lifts the media cross ownership ban a close reading of the current rule shows it is filled with loopholes that would allow for consolidation in almost any market small medium and large
6296954 this plan will look at a range of options which will aim to secure the supply of drinking water for the community and ensure we have sufficient capacity to enable the growth and development of the island
6296955 as part of the long term planning process we will need to look at a range of factors including population projections economic development social needs and environmental issues which could impact on future water demands
6296956 we are also investigating the potential impacts and benefits of demand management initiatives now and into the future
6296957 theres a lot of work to do on this plan between now and the end of 2008 with one of the first steps to complete the evaluation of existing water sources on the island including middle river and penneshaw desalination plant

6296975 so the question is how do we help them or how do they help themselves spend more money in the current year and in the next six months
6296976 in this report we added them together just to say actual expenditure as such

6297214 unfortunately i have to say jakob has perhaps the worst site design i have ever seen it is as if while he is handing out the oscars he is wearing a plaid polyester suit in truth his site is fine from an information architecture perspective but from an aesthetics perspective it is awful and aesthetics is important in ui if you begin to look at something and want to avert your eyes the site has failed

6297234 the mccain campaign believes that some of hillary clintons tactics especially questioning whether obama is ready to lead can be a real winner
6297235 the mccain team has been very open that they went to school on the hillary clinton campaign that they learned from that
6297236 and on this 3 a m ad whats very striking as some have pointed out over the last few days is that barack obama was winning a steady streak of victories against hillary clinton
6297237 and then she ran that ad and she really went on the attack on the experience question and she won the bulk of the primaries thereafter in the closing months of the democratic primaries and won 500 000 more votes than he did and almost took it away from him
6297238 which candidate do voters believe is better qualified to deal with russia mccain by better than 2 1
6297239 going after more centrist voters more swing voters more conservative voters who will be a much bigger deal in the general election than they were in those primaries and caucuses
6297240 not only did the clinton campaign give mccain and his advisers a road map but they actually started the mccains down that path
6297241 thats why youre hearing from obama very specific policy oriented proposals here
6297242 theres not a lot of that kind of flash if you will from the earlier days
6297243 the big question now is whether obama can successfully regain control of the campaign agenda as we head into the democratic convention
6297244 what the clinton campaign demonstrated is when you bring obama back down to earth its a better battle
6297245 im just happy to be back with my family and be home again

6297406 historically democrats receive 59 percent of the primary vote but gregoire has yet to top 50 percent
6297407 the results tell us one thing more than half the voters in washington want a new governor
6297408 the primary electorate substantially benefited rossi its an older more conservative electorate his strongholds were mostly vote by mail and in spite of these substantial advantages he still lost by a sizable margin which continues to grow by the day
6297409 how can he think he has a chance with the enormous turnout and extreme enthusiasm at the top of the ticket for sen barack obama and democrats
6297410 the primary results confirm that voters understand full well the difference between governor gregoire and her republican opponent republican dino rossi cut health care for kids slashed education funding and voted against vital transportation funding for transit bridges and ferries the choice in november is clear an accomplished leader who delivers results for all of washington or a george bush republican who sides with special interests over everyday citizens
6297411 the fact that an incumbent governor cant outrace and cant break 50 percent in the primary shows that she is extremely vulnerable and reliant on the special interests who fund the attacks on dino rossi
6297412 at this point its hard to project how we end up

6297489 he has come into this camp focused and competitive and much more serious about his craft
6297490 he just has a much more professional attitude than he had as a rookie you see it in the meeting room you see it out on the practice field on a daily basis he gets better because of it
6297491 it was kind of a last second thing i was in position but i didnt see the ball until the very end

6297494 he might be small in stature but hes very very competitive and hes been really fun to watch
6297495 last year he was not the class clown but an element of that this year hes quiet hes studious hes focused
6297496 like coach mora says youve got to sweep the corners and just take care of the details
6297497 i just try to take care of every detail and make sure im doing everything as exact as i can
6297498 coming from college i was the man i get here matt hasselbeck is looking to the right the whole play and then all of a sudden turns around and throws it to the left
6297499 im not used to that im used to the quarterback staring right where hes throwing it was a big adjustment last year
6297500 last year when i came into camp i was kind of playing with the lights out i was trying to get my eyes adjusted now the lights come on and i just have a lot better feeling for everything
6297501 its important absolutely your starting quarterback has to be ready for the first regular season game
6297502 when the guys have played as long as he has played or some other quarterbacks around the league have played youre not quite as concerned about their minutes in the preseason

6297513 nearly all of world population growth is now concentrated in the worlds poorer countries

6297521 for someone born normal at birth and leading a normal life all of a sudden you become a disabled person it is difficult to accept
6297522 this is another form of violence against women and the patriarchal values that exist in societies are responsible for this horrific form of atrocity
6297523 we are not going to allow russia to draw a new line at those states that are not yet integrated into the trans atlantic structures she said referring to georgia and ukraine which have not yet joined nato or the european union but would like to
6297524 the fact is that libertarianism is not and does not pretend to be a complete moral or aesthetic theory it is only a
6297525 it should not be surprising therefore that there are libertarians who are indeed hedonists and devotees of alternative life styles and that there are also libertarians who are firm adherents of bourgeois conventional or religious morality there are libertarian libertines and there are libertarians who cleave firmly to the disciplines of natural or religious law there are other libertarians who have no moral theory at all apart from the imperative of non violation of rights that is because libertarianism per se has no general or personal moral theory libertarianism does not offer a way of life it offers liberty so that each person is free to adopt and act upon his own values and moral principles libertarians agree with lord acton that liberty is the highest political end not necessarily the highest end on everyones personal scale of values
6297526 liberals generally wish to preserve the concept of rights for such human rights as freedom of speech while denying the concept to private property and yet on the contrary the concept of rights only makes sense as property rights for not only are there no human rights which are not also property rights but the former rights lose their absoluteness and clarity and become fuzzy and vulnerable when property rights are not used as the standard

6297538 would you take fiscal advice from a man who wont spend 3 for new socks
6297539 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
6297540 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
6297541 it would be a significant additional expense that would come due over several years
6297542 and microsoft knew that when they made the bid for yahoo
6297543 but if youre in the valley that first impression of microsoft still has be overcome
6297544 so i think the company pays more in employee retention packages a microsoft premium
6297545 this was a very strong financial quarter for the company
6297546 the results reflect the strength provided by our diverse portfolio of businesses our stability and growth continues to give us the confidence to make innovative changes to our products to keep customers engaged for years to come
6297547 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
6297548 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
6297549 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
6297550 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6297551 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
6297552 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
6297553 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
6297554 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6297555 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6297556 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
6297557 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6297558 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6297559 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6297560 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6297561 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6297562 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6297563 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6297564 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6297565 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
6297566 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510

6297570 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
6297571 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
6297572 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6297573 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6297574 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6297575 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
6297576 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
6297577 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
6297578 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
6297579 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
6297580 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
6297581 whether or not this is a big phenomenon whether or not there are hundreds of thousands of people involved and its ruining lives theres no question about that
6297582 we suspect that those numbers will only increase over time
6297583 i asked about whats the big deal with online sex each person is sitting masturbating talking online almost all the respondents to my survey said thats as much cheating as if they are having physical sex to women at least its not the physical sex that matters its this relationship thing its the intimacy spending time with somebody else it isnt about sex its about the betrayal of intimacy
6297584 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
6297585 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
6297586 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6297587 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6297588 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6297589 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
6297590 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
6297591 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
6297592 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
6297593 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
6297594 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6297595 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6297596 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6297597 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
6297598 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6297599 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6297600 a part of my daily life for 35 years has just vanished
6297601 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
6297602 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
6297603 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
6297604 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
6297605 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
6297606 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
6297607 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
6297608 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
6297609 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6297610 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6297611 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6297612 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6297613 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6297614 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6297615 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
6297616 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
6297617 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
6297618 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
6297619 wir haben wirklich eine deutsche sportlerin bei den olympischen spielen die geht
6297620 wer gehen mal ausprobiert hat wei dass man die technik nicht auf anhieb beherrscht und dass es auch gar nicht so einfach oder komisch ist wie es vielleicht aussieht
6297621 ich habe mich so gefreut an dem tag gab es auch keine medaillen f r deutsche sportler das war mein gl ck und so durfte ich als f nfte sogar zu beckmanns olympia nacht die medien haben so positiv berichtet weil ich mich so gefreut habe eine almsick h tte man wegen eines f nften platzes verh hnt
6297622 wenn der sportler zeigt wie viel die eigene leistung wert ist wissen die medien das auch wertzusch tzen und wenn die dann mitspielen und dich pushen dann w rden die leute viel mehr ahnung haben und auch den sport fter gucken die medien haben es in der hand
6297623 genauso professionell wie ein fu baller tennisspieler oder 100 meter l ufer aber geher stehen nicht so im mittelpunkt
6297624 aber wenn ein weitspringer bertritt gilt der sprung auch nicht und der geher wird ja vorher auch mehrfach gewarnt
6297625 man kann so viele verwarnungen bekommen wie man will aber entscheidend sind die antr ge bei drei antr gen ist schluss die m ssen aber von drei verschiedenen wettkampfrichtern gegeben werden
6297626 wenn man einmal mitgemacht hat will man immer wieder hin die ganze welt schaut zu alle sportarten finden zusammen statt das ist was ganz besonderes man hat die chance sich die anderen disziplinen anzuschauen
6297627 im olympischen dorf muss man die olympiakleidung des landes tragen dadurch erkennt man sich das ist toll man lernt so viele leute kennen und ist nie alleine
6297628 maybe you want me to pierce my ears and nose paint my cheeks use lipstick and makeup
6297629 a lot inside me was ruined by trusting in the society where i live after reading this i had nothing left i wondered are there no white spots in our history only black my whole country is in perpetual funeral
6297630 one of them heads an increasingly authoritarian and lawless government that is pursuing a radical vision of global revolution rooted in the teachings of the soviet unions founders the other is merely the president of the russian federation
6297631 was a putsch achieved by an orchestrated mob followed by an election so shamelessly one sided that our supposed hero got 96 per cent of the vote
6297632 the higher the vote any government wins in an election the more tyrannical it is
6297633 a major issue is russias contention that the regions of south ossetia and abkhazia may not be a part of georgias future but these regions are a part of georgia theres no room for debate on this matter
6297634 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6297635 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
6297636 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6297637 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
6297638 so weve got to sit down republicans and democrats and and work out a risk pool
6297639 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
6297640 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
6297641 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
6297642 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
6297643 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
6297644 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
6297645 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
6297646 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
6297647 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
6297648 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
6297649 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
6297650 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
6297651 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
6297652 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
6297653 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
6297654 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
6297655 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
6297656 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
6297657 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
6297658 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
6297659 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
6297660 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
6297661 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
6297662 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
6297663 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
6297664 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
6297665 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
6297666 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
6297667 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
6297668 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
6297669 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
6297670 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
6297671 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
6297672 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
6297673 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
6297674 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
6297675 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
6297676 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
6297677 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
6297678 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
6297679 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it

6297849 while there was a lot more work in their lives in the past everyone was equal and treated as family

6297908 es verdad que una tragedia de estas caracter sticas no tiene soluci n pero tambi n es verdad que se tiene que hacer un esfuerzo para intentar hacer las cosas bien para identificar pronto a la gente y que les llegue la paz y la tranquilidad a las familias
6297909 si entre los heridos hay residentes en galicia asturias o castilla y le n es posible que nos los env en a aqu la fase aguda del tratamiento de las quemaduras severas suele durar varios meses y lo m s l gico es que los pacientes pasen ese trance al lado de sus familias eso s los traslados s lo se pueden realizar cuando los heridos ya han sido estabilizados
6297910 no hay m dicos para realizar las sustituciones y desde el sergas se obliga a que los propios compa eros se cubran unos a otros el resultado es que este a o a sanidade le est saliendo gratis solucionar las vacaciones
6297911 lo habitual es que en un pac como el de a coru a o carballo trabajen cuatro m dicos por la tarde y tres por la noche sin embargo si nadie se ofrece a sustituir a otro facultativo sanidade no busca soluci n hace unas semanas carballo se qued con un nico m dico que tuvo que atender una media de cien pacientes en un d a
6297912 durante el pasado fin de semana en las fiestas de cee s lo hubo un m dico para las guardias
6297913 en atenci n primaria cuando una persona est de vacaciones sanidade propone al resto de facultativos la prolongaci n de jornada voluntaria y si no es suficiente y alguien tiene que hacerlo obligado se les paga un complemento espec fico
6297914 a nosotros no nos dan nada ni siquiera un d a libre a mayores
6297915 si no llega a ser por la buena voluntad de los profesionales muchos pac tendr an que cerrar
6297916 hay gente que se ha ido porque no le pagaban o porque lo mandaban de un pueblo a otro continuamente
6297917 estamos en agosto y de momento nadie ha cobrado nada
6297918 desde la gerencia de atenci n primaria se nos dice que es por un problema inform tico y en sanidade nadie contesta
6297919 es un asunto muy urgente y me sorprende que no se haya tratado en su momento
6297920 ya era hora si no se act a estas zonas podr an perder su car cter urbano y construcciones de gran valor correr an el peligro de desaparecer
6297921 a los comercializadores nos gustar a que los barcos gallegos continuasen faenando aqu pero con licencias de no contar con el pescado que trae la flota de galicia no podr amos cubrir toda la demanda
6297922 los buques gallegos no tienen permiso para faenar en aguas asturianas y los pescadores de avil s cuando ven que est n al l mite de la legalidad llaman a las patrulleras para que los controlen y por eso les han impuesto varias multas en los ltimos a os
6297923 la poca flota que hay en avil s no da abasto
6297924 i did a style statement with you back in may and i wanted to tell you that you changed my life it was the best money i have spent in a really really long time i have slowly started to implement changes into my life that reflect what we spoke about that morning and the effects have been lovely
6297925 thank you for the most amazing style statement session i cant tell you enough how powerful it was for me you have given me the tools to open myself to the world of possibilities and reclaim my confidence which for one reason or another had lost its luster
6297926 the hour you oh so insightfully questioned me was like years of therapy mashed together but without the pain my two simple words have affected me deeply
6297927 im so humbled by my words and honoured that you could read my soul i called all my sisters after and told them that champagne was in order why i told them all about my style statement session

6297932 la mayor a de las piezas vienen de ecuador y est n hechas de coco y de tagua el m s conocido es el coco pero la tagua tambi n es muy usada es una semilla de palmera que viene de la selva amaz nica de ecuador hay piezas m s blancas y otras oscuras porque lo blanco es el fruto y lo oscuro es la c scara que lo recubre adem s de eso tambi n tenemos adornos hechos de hueso de madera y de shivva la shivva es un material como el coco pero m s resistente la verdad es que son precios muy asequibles y se vende todo muy bien no hay una pieza de la que pueda decir que la gente pregunta m s por ella

6297935 traigo las piezas de ecuador pero este verano ya fui a m s ferias y vendimos casi todo hubo mucho movimiento de gente y ahora ya me queda muy poco la mayor parte de lo que tengo en estos momentos lo trajo mi hermana de la india por ejemplo los collares otras cosas como las pulseras de colores las hago yo mismo
6297936 lo que trabajamos principalmente es el cuero que tiene mucha aceptaci n por aqu asientos a los que llamamos puf mochilas y sobre todo l mparas de todos los tipos con dibujos hechos con tinta de henna que son muy populares adem s la gente siempre pide las t picas teteras marroqu es y los vasos para beber todo es artesan a pura
6297937 vendemos s lo ropa de algod n y atrapasue os e instrumentos de m sica la ropa la traemos de ecuador pero lo dem s lo hago yo con los carrisos que le llamamos nosotros el bamb hago las flautitas aunque m s que para tocar son de adorno aqu tiene xito la ropa y a la gente le gusta comprar cosas artesanales

6298189 a confession of faith not only is relevant for the churchs own doctrine and life but bears definite implications for concrete social and political issues this is the ethical character of a confession it possesses both ecclesiastical and secular significance it is a witness to christ before the church and the world it does not shrink from dealing with concrete issues such as racialism anti semitism nationalism fascism and communism militarism and economic exploitation in short it is relevant for social and political justice freedom and peace a confession which lacked this dimension would not be a true confession a church that neglected to draw the implications of its confession for the social and political order and that was concerned only about the purity of its own teaching and piety would certainly not be a confessing church not the one holy catholic church of christ for then it would have denied that christ died for the world and that it has been elected and called to serve the world with its message of gods grace for all people
6298190 it confesses a living person who is the lord and thus calls for a personal relationship of trust and obedience to him
6298191 when even high authorities in the state and in the party publicly assail the christian faith church members are more and more enmeshed in their unbelief the waverers and the doubters are made completely uncertain and are driven to defection grave danger as a matter of fact exists that the evangelical youth will be prevented from coming to him who is the only savior of german as will as other boys and girls

6298226 as you know attorney general guidelines were first implemented in the wake of the fbi abuses of the 1960s and 1970s and serve as one of the most important bulwarks against future abuses
6298227 given the importance of these guidelines providing a period of time for public comment would be a reasonable and responsible way to move forward and achieve the best possible end result

6298315 from our due diligence of mango we found that what they had is one fifth of what is available in the world market
6298316 as compared to the international players in the market we beleive that mango has two distinct advantages first is the amount of memory that they use and second is the amount of processing power this technology takes

6298326 we will review our full costs of funding at the time of any announcement by the rba taking into account any reduction in the official cash rate and do our best to pass on as much as we can to our customers
6298327 while we continue to see volatility in international markets and increases in the average cost of long term funding we have experienced some short term funding relief which we are keen to pass on to our customers
6298328 while i am pleased to make todays undertaking our medium and long term funding and our retail deposit base represent the greatest proportion of our funding costs and the average cost of these sources of funding continue to increase
6298329 the recent fall in short term funding costs provides an opportunity to undertake to move rates in line with the rba decision but future interest rate decisions will need to reflect an assessment of all the cost of funding factors
6298330 all australian banks are reliant on offshore funding and increases in the average cost of long term funding are likely to be with us for some time
6298331 therefore any consideration that the federal government can give to enhance the attractiveness of retail bank deposits will help reduce overall funding costs and assist in lowering mortgages rates
6298332 clearly we would love to pass through the full 25 basis points drop if that were to occur but well need to factor in all of those issues at that time

6298387 this report is filled with contradictions and omissions of managements failures
6298388 for instance the findings say firefighters failed to don their face pieces upon entering the building as is required in a contaminated building but the contradiction is they never reference the fact that the incident commander nor any other chief involved notified them that they were operating in a contaminated building or required them to do so
6298389 this report is an operational critique for firefighters and fire officers written by specially trained safety officers with the goal of obtaining what we call lessons learned to learn the lessons of this fire to not have a repeat of this tragedy to find the truth that is the purpose of this report
6298390 several safety reports in the past have all stressed this the elimination of acting out of title for safety reasons because you are taking even an experienced fire officer and putting him in a new job

6298577 anak muda di dunia ini apa ada orang yang keramat
6298578 kalau ada orang yang punya kelebihan sebenarnya itu bukan kemampuan dia itu semua adalah pemberian tuhan
6298579 anak muda di dunia ini tidak ada manusia yang keramat karena mereka beserta dengan yang maha keramat maka dengan otomatis mereka ikut keramat seluruh wali wali di dunia ini tidak ada yang ber cita cita memiliki kemampuan kemampuan luar biasa mereka sepenuhnya berserah diri kepada allah swt semata
6298580 anak muda coba kamu masuk ke dalam kandang kambing tinggal disana selama 7 hari 7 malam boleh memakai baju tipis atau baju tebal nanti pasti badan kamu bau kambing
6298581 kalau kamu menginap di alkah tuhan disana banyak malaikat nya selama 7 hari 7 malam kamu di sana sudah pasti bau kamu seperti bau malaikat dan syetan pun bingung susah membedakan apakah ini manusia atau malaikat
6298582 berarti kamu akan paham dengan ilmu eksak coba kamu ambil gula kemudian larutkan dalam air dan kamu jilat pasti air itu manis rasanya yang manis air nya apa gula nya anak muda
6298583 yang manis gula lah pula selama dunia ini terkembang belum pernah ada air yang manis penyebab air menjadi manis ketika di jilat karena didalamnya ada unsur gula mereka air dan gula tidak bersyerikat karena terdiri dari unsur yang berbeda kalau kamu panaskan air maka uap air akan naik ke udara kembali menjadi hidrogen dan oksigen sedangkan gula tetap tinggal menjadi karbon
6298584 ambil sebuah besi masukkan kedalam api panaskan sampai besi itu membara maka seluruh sifat sifat api akan mengalir ke dalam besi besi itu persis seperti api dan api itu telah menyerupai besi antara api dengan besi tidak pernah bersyerikat sifat sifat api akan turun kepada besi disebabkan besi terus menerus bersama api api tetaplah menjadi api dan besi tetaplah menjadi besi
6298585 yang keramat itu api anak muda bukan besi karena dari api lah sumber panas tapi jangan kamu coba coba pegang besi yang membara nanti kamu akan terbakar karena sifat sifat api telah turun kepada besi
6298586 kalau tujuan kamu berguru untuk mencapai keramat kamu tidak akan pernah mendapatkannya disini tidak pernah di ajarkan ilmu ilmu hebat yang diajarkan disini adalah ilmu berhubungan dengan allah ilmu bagaimana kita bisa merendahkan diri dengan serendah rendahnya kepada zat yang maha sempurna disini diajarkan bagaimana kita ber ubudiyah kepada nya tujuan menuntut ilmu tidak lain adalah ilahi anta maqsyudi waridhaka matlubi engkaulah yang aku maksud dan ridho mu lah yang kami tuntut kalau kamu ingin sakti carilah dukun bergurulah kesana satu malam kamu langsung jadi hebat tapi nanti kalau meninggal dunia ruh kamu tidak kembali ke tuhan tetapi kembali kepada syetan kalau ilmu yang kamu peroleh dari laut kidul nanti ruh kamu akan kembali ke laut kidul kalau ilmu kamu berasal dari gunung kawi maka ruh kamu akan kembali ke gunung kawi ruh kamu akan bergentayangan
6298587 guru maafkan kesalahan saya mohon di doakan saya agar lurus dalam berguru saya tidak cari apa apa guru berjumpa dengan guru sudah merupakan karunia yang luar biasa diberikan allah kepada saya

6298600 target specific structures such as cancer cells when injected into patients
6298601 the fact that there were so many undercover police following them just made them go with the action urgently
6298602 we have no records of these two names in our system
6298603 at the end if it ends up in private hands everyone gets to walk away except for the city
6298604 sst stands for sandusky seneca county and the city of tiffin i hope they have tiffins interest at heart
6298605 they had to break ground by a certain date or that money would be called back if that building the courthouse is not fit for occupancy by a certain date then there are consequences
6298606 during the bid coe rediscovered his roots which played a crucial part in london winning
6298607 coes mother was of indian origin but coe had never visited india he was invited by india to run for them in the 1988 seoul olympics when britain refused to choose him
6298608 but during the london bid coe visited his mothers country for the first time
6298609 soon he had built up a successful coalition of the entire commonwealth and not just the old white one that had often in the past been the domain of previous british sports administrators
6298610 the word here is that london will do it its own way with a touch of british funkiness
6298611 that british ability to surprise people by being different will make up for the fact that stadia will not be iconic there will be nothing like the birds nest in stratford where the venues will be smaller and the whole thing much more functional than here in beijing
6298612 bottled water companies have had a fabulous ride on an unnecessary fad

6298614 i have a question about the pittsburgh penguins and petr sykora now ive been a fan of what sykora does since he played for the devils and i think what he does for the penguins is often over looked he is without a doubt my favorite player on the team and i have remembered that next summer he will be a ufa i dont like the thought of that lol do you think next summer shero will try to resign him or do you think hell even try resigning him before that thank you katie
6298615 if only a wal mart was nearby we could buy earplugs
6298616 i believe that to strengthen education in ohio we have to strengthen our public schools
6298617 ohio cannot thrive without understanding that world class schools will create a highly talented work force and a highly talented work force will attract and create new jobs
6298618 as we talk about reform and change we have to be sure not to lose the strengths that we already have
6298619 ohios education system is not something that can be changed overnight
6298620 this will take all of us those of us in government those of us in education people all across the state working together
6298621 its reasonable that it would because we all know that no two people are exactly alike even identical twins are not exactly alike and so if we try to create sameness if we expect every student to be like every other student we are squeezing innovation and creativity out of our educational approach
6298622 thats what i fear may be happening today with the extreme emphasis on standardized testing to the exclusion of other ways of measuring student achievement and student success
6298623 it is more difficult to understand that each of those students is an individual with individual abilities individual interests individual learning modalities and then to try to provide them with a system of instruction that is most appropriate to their interest abilities and needs
6298624 so im not saying its easy but its something that we ought to pursue
6298625 there have been some intense work days there have been seven hour days so i think they overall did a great job
6298626 you have performed a series of irrational investments cannot save items delete memory of all inefficient banks and firms and download new software and operating system

6298631 barack obamas ad is ridiculous because of john mccain corruption was exposed and people like jack abramoff went to jail
6298632 however if barack obama wants to have a discussion about truly questionable associations lets start with his relationship with the unrepentant terrorist william ayers at whose home obamas political career was reportedly launched
6298633 the question now is will barack obama immediately call on the university of illinois to release all of the records they are currently withholding to shed further light on senator obamas relationship with this unrepentant terrorist
6298634 so i am trying to make sure i talk to as many of you folks opinion leaders and makers as i can
6298635 john kerry did better in the large cities and metropolitan areas than he ever dreamed he could do
6298636 he far exceeded his expectations but we also see that he did miserably in small towns and in rural areas so much so that his loss in those areas exceeded the gains he had made in the urban areas
6298637 when i ran for governor sherrod brown and i talked about this a lot we decided we werent going to concede any part of the state to our opponents so we spent a lot of time in a bus going from small town to small town holding rallies talking to people letting them know we needed their vote and asked for their vote we didnt win all of those counties but we won a lot of them in the counties where we didnt win we didnt suffer the kind of massive loss that john kerry did
6298638 in some of those counties he may end up getting 43 percent of the vote instead of 37 percent of the vote he may end up getting 48 percent instead of 38 its not necessary to win every county or every race but youve got to be competitive everywhere in ohio to win an election statewide thats the advice ive been trying to give to the campaign
6298639 weve probably got over 250 260 combined field people already employed and on the ground
6298640 some of these efforts arent visible right now but the work is ongoing i think the obama campaign is understanding they cant win by just carrying a handful of metropolitan areas theyve got to focus on the entire state
6298641 i can tell you thats the kind of approach im recommending
6298642 thus far the obama campaign has indicated to us they want to follow our direction and suggestions and they are doing so i expect sen obama will be quite visible it is a big country and there are a lot of states in play probably more states in play than there were four years ago sen obama has committed to spending quite a lot of time in ohio
6298643 i believe hell choose sen joseph biden i could be wrong
6298644 my impression is he will select sen biden because of sen bidens foreign policy expertise
6298645 my personal feeling is and i have felt this way about sen
6298646 it may not be sen biden it may be sen evan bayh d indiana or maybe someone else im not even thinking of if i were betting today i would bet on sen biden

6298672 our shareholders can now decide do they like the long term profits of lendingtree do they recognize the potential of hsn the distinction between the companies are clear the stories are clear
6298673 what would an iac shareholder want for interval as part of a broader iac its unanswerable its like solving a rubics cube
6298674 maybe interval doesnt change how it operates maybe ticketmaster uses its currency for acquisitions
6298675 i dont think that substantially we felt constrained before i dont think its we now have cash and we didnt before
6298676 i think whats changed clearly is the discipline and focus with which that capital will be deployed
6298677 when that worked it worked brilliantly well ticketmaster was a phenomenal acquisition it was bought before it sold a single ticket online
6298678 we thought that would evolve into an online business but it hasnt so we sold it

6298688 if you are to write on religion then you are supposed to touch on matters pertaining to questions on rituals adherence to god followers and anything related to your divine mission
6298689 if you go beyond that definitely you have committed some breaches
6298690 u ltimately the interpretation of what constitutes religious matters should be left to the leaders and adherents of the faith
6298691 in line with the teachings of the catholic church in social and political charity
6298692 the home ministry is not in a position to dictate to the catholics or for that matter the proponents of any other faith the scope of their religion
6298693 in seeking to control the contents of the herald the home ministrys warning and show cause letters go against article 3 1 article 10 1 a and article 11 3 a of the federal constitution that is the right to freely practise ones religion the general freedom of speech and expression and the right of a religious group to manage its own affairs
6298694 such controls will deprive the catholic community of current information and education in relation to their faith such an act by the authorities is tantamount to curtailment of religious freedom
6298695 nothing more than the fulfillment of acts of worship and the observance of a few moral obligations
6298696 the dichotomy between the faith which many profess and their day to day conduct
6298697 no matter our national racial ethnic economic or ideological differences we have a global commitment to love our neighbors and to work for justice
6298698 we also have a commitment to work towards a just even and fair development of our world where no one society is exalted materially above the rest and no other society is left quite literally in the dust development must respect the rights of all nations and their people always promoting the moral cultural and spiritual dimensions of each person
6298699 good news to the poor liberty to captives and new sight to the blind
6298700 t he members of the church as members of society have the same right and duty to promote the common good as do other citizens christians ought to fulfill their temporal obligations with fidelity and competence they should act as a leaven in the world in their family professional social cultural and political life
6298701 international conference on religion in the quest for global justice and peace
6298702 in broadening public understanding of religion and its role in promoting justice and peace
6298703 our religious education should convince us that the dignity and integrity of all human beings is worthy of our respect religion should inculcate a truly universal and inclusive outlook not a mentality that is narrow exclusive and parochial
6298704 the need to amplify the role of the media in promoting a universal and inclusive dimension of religion that focused upon justice and peace
6298705 journalists and media practitioners in general should deepen and broaden their understanding of religion in order to play a more effective role in advancing the universal values of justice peace and compassion which lie at the heart of our great religious philosophies
6298706 i get a beep every time i press a key
6298707 hey whats this texture i dont recognize it must not be important
6298708 i dont necessarily feel like i need assistance but its nice to know theyre reaching out
6298709 were humans there have been mistakes made and we can do better
6298710 were looking for feedback from the survivor families to do things better in the future this letter is helping us to reconnect with them and in case there are certain services theyre missing out on were there for them
6298711 we understand the sacrifices you and your family have made in service to this nation and we want to assure you the army is here to provide you the support you need for as long as you desire
6298712 i am still very very deeply sorrowed by this especially this month
6298713 id never really questioned if there was anything to help but i would like to get together with other families to see how they handle this and how i could get out of my depression maybe ill give them a call
6298714 fay is still a threat and we are watching this very closely
6298715 this is a serious catastrophic event particularly for southern brevard county this area is seeing historic levels of rain
6298716 we are moving more resources in to support the most heavily impacted counties
6298717 the most significant issue regarding the slow motion is that fay will likely continue to dump torrential rains along its path and will probably be remembered as a very wet storm
6298718 we ask people to seriously consider it but were not going to force anybody to leave their home
6298719 but we didnt need it all at once it wouldve been nice to spread it out over time
6298720 these counties are currently in the process of harvesting these crops and rainfall produced from fay may jeopardize the entire crop
6298721 your cars not starting right your battery may be going out
6298722 what were seeing now is a clear regrouping and also again some kind of deception campaign saying look were moving out
6298723 russia in this case will be forced to react and not only through diplomatic moves
6298724 to freeze all military cooperation with nato and allied countries
6298725 the united states of america will continue to support georgias democracy
6298726 are part of georgia and the united states will work with our allies to ensure georgias independence and territorial integrity

6298728 you cant tell whats a canal and whats a roadway out here its that bad
6298729 i didnt think it was going to be that deep
6298730 it pretty much came up to my ears and chin
6298731 theyre probably areas of the state that found the rains very beneficial
6298732 i didnt decide to run for president to start a national crusade for the political reforms i believed in or to run a campaign as if it were some grand act of patriotism in truth i wanted to be president because it had become my ambition to be president
6298733 i guess this is supposedly the older wiser john mccain
6298734 is this now not just more lying he knows ambition has been his motive so he accuses obama of it
6298735 im not aware of many or any presidential candidates who were not ambitious to try to pretend really that he is without ambition i dont think anybodys going to buy that
6298736 is there something unseemly about returning to this well in such a dishonest fashion
6298737 does it say anything about mccains approach to the issues of race

6298748 has a real curiosity about the world who loves life and can find passion in lifes smallest moments
6298749 in my opinion the sentencing judge does appear to have down played the appellants mental condition upon his moral culpability and this shortcoming was reflected in the sentence imposed upon the appellant
6298750 the defenceless victim was murdered in cold blood by a man who cynically denied help while he organised a false explanation and displayed no remorse
6298751 on the other hand these aspects of the crime were to some extent attributable to the appellants mental state
6298752 in the end i think that the sentencing judge did not give appropriate weight to the appellants mental condition
6298753 your cars not starting right your battery may be going out
6298754 i hit somebody hard up there on 35 i hope theyre all right

6298781 gabriel cousenss call to wake up from the herd mentality to move beyond dualism and become in our eating in our living and in our sexuality the unity to which we aspire is the harbinger of the peace that our planet so badly needs
6298782 creating peace by being peace is an act of universal love offered by dr cousens to all sentient beings my prayer is that it will be appreciated not only as a scholarly spiritual study but as the practical solution to the challenges of twenty first century living that it is
6298783 i consider rebbe gabriel cousens md to be a true follower of the essene tradition he has penetrated the meaning of the sevenfold path of peace

6298821 it is an honor and a privilege for you to cover the new york jets
6298822 but you have an obligation to hold up your end of the bargain by being objective and fair in what you report yet you didnt do that
6298823 the result largely due to mike nugents missed 23 yard fg attempt to tie the game as time expired it hit the left upright along with a 43 yard miss earlier was the only disappointment for the jets
6298824 but it hardly mattered this was all about favres debut and he didnt disappoint

6298839 dude how is it that every week your dating a new girl
6298840 if the bush administration invests some serious diplomatic energy on courting him even half of the effort it has spent over the past year on trying to save musharraf from humiliation it can build a working relationship with nawaz this will require a carrot and stick approach the carrots will come in the form of development aid after wasting billions on the pakistani military in the past seven years the us must ensure that the majority of future aid goes to economic and civil society projects supervised not by generals but by politicians the us doesnt need to brandish a stick because thats already there in the form of the ever present threat of another military takeover
6298841 i dont think you should start fooling around with blueprints and thats what the gale report is a blueprint
6298842 theoretically you could probably build one out front of the high school but i dont think that would pass the litmus test with the neighbors
6298843 i dont think well be able to find another site
6298844 i think we could do it for about 100 000 or so
6298845 yesterdays game and tonight it was definitely a different atmosphere here almost a playoff atmosphere were just happy to get one
6298846 we had to win one and leave a mark here because i think we might be seeing them in the playoffs they way theyre playing if they keep this up im pretty sure theyre going to make the playoffs
6298847 you guys like to say making a statement we kind of left our mark here
6298848 im the center fielder i gotta get over there and get that ball
6298849 he left a splitter up to upton for the double
6298850 the pitch to pena wasnt too bad but they seemed to be seeing the ball well that inning and squared it up
6298851 from my perspective i thought he was going to catch it easily
6298852 our lineup has depth so some situations are going to be created whether theyre going to decide to pitch to tex vlad torii or garret were comfortable with that matchup
6298853 that particular at bat in the seventh i felt i was getting too picky up there
6298854 so i told myself when i was walking up there if he puts something over the plate im swinging sometimes i have to tell myself that
6298855 i didnt get it good but i got it good enough it got in on me a little bit
6298856 in this series he iwamura favored me to the hole so i knew if i hit it up the middle i had a shot
6298857 if its overwhelmingly supportive of my position then we bring it to legislators and say look we want you to vote for this its a polite way of citizen legislation
6298858 berkman said it hit him in the thigh and he was willing to pull his pants down to prove it

6298873 to take care of each other when they see someone whos passed out to take advantage of all of our services for students who abuse alcohol
6298874 almost every assault of any kind is related to drinking the drinking age issue is not just about drinking and driving its a much bigger pie and we college presidents see that whole pie
6298875 legislators have made laws that the people do not take seriously students point to our alcohol programs and say see everybody understands that we are going to drink and theyre right
6298876 i really aim to show nature and natural life in scenic places around the world for people who havent had an opportunity to see a moose or iceberg close up
6298877 when it comes to photography im a realist i want to capture on film the purest thing i can see
6298878 our eyes see more purely than any camera basically my goal is to get as close as possible
6298879 steve really enjoys shooting panoramic scenes im very analytical and i like to do the macro stuff
6298880 well often see the same item and think were taking the same picture but theres often something a little different
6298881 i like to shoot outdoors because i like the idea of taking pictures and seeing what i was envisioning and how it came out
6298882 one of the best photos i took was a screech owl people always ask where i found it and theyre surprised when i say it was in saxonville
6298883 i like it when my photos help them realize there are beautiful things to photograph right outside our doors
6298884 if the lights are on at webb can only the baseball players be there

6298894 receive the first 70 000 in cash of all revenues generated by its media efforts both advertising amp broadcast after that all revenues will be split 50 50 between jbn amp florida a amp m university
6298895 we hebben wel wat bezorgde reacties van kampenaren binnen gekregen maar dat is alleen maar goed
6298896 we wilden aandacht genereren we hadden gehoopt dat er in kampen over gepraat zou worden maar we hadden niet verwacht dat het zoveel aandacht zou krijgen
6298897 het park heeft meer ruimte nodig en ligt nu te dicht bij een dorp de apen worden nogal eens door de dorpsbewoners meegenomen en thuis gehouden
6298898 our findings may someday allow doctors to screen for and diagnose skin cancers at very early stages
6298899 this has great potential as a screening tool the detection of these volatile organic compounds could make a major contribution to diagnosis
6298900 its a non invasive and simple way of detecting disease
6298901 it would be a cruel society to force women to become mothers when they clearly dont want to or are not prepared for the huge task ahead of them
6298902 difference between an unwanted pregnancy and an unwanted baby many children who are at first unwanted by their mothers are very much wanted later in the pregnancy and even more so at birth the problem is not unwanted children but unwanting adults
6298903 for years women were degraded when their value was judged by whether or not they were wanted by men just as a womans value is real whether or not a man recongnizes it so a babys value is real whether or not his mother or father recognizes it
6298904 it is very difficult to demonstrate that the moral and metaphysical value of a human being is dependent on whether someone wants or cares for that human being for example no one disputes that the homeless are intrinsically valuable even though they are for the most part unwanted
6298905 the ethic of the child batterer is the abortion ethic child abusers like abortion activists believe in adults right to be in control of their lives child abusers like abortionists believe that only children who gratify parental desires have a right to exist it is hard to believe that the cultural message contained in abortion the insistent eulogies to control and the references to parenting as a right and a pleasure have not contributed to the explosion in child abuse and neglect
6298906 there is no assurance that the child that was planned for will continue to be well treated by its parent or parents indeed over 90 per cent of the children in the united states who are abused by their parents were originally wanted babies at all events and notwithstanding the annual one and a half million abortions there is no indication that family life in america is becoming happier on the contrary since abortion on demand was made legal in 1973 the number of abused children is estimated to have risen by over 300 per cent
6298907 death rates from infections and all types of surgeries including illegal abortions had already fallen precipitously after world war ii when antibiotics finally became available to the general public
6298908 i confess that i knew the figures were totally false and i suppose the others did too if they stopped to think of it but in the morality of our revolution it was a useful figure widely accepted so why go out of our way to correct it with honest statistics the overriding concern was to get the laws eliminated and anything within reason that had to be done was permissible
6298909 in 1967 the federal government listed only 160 deaths from illegal abortion in the last year before roe v wade 1972 the total was only 39 deaths
6298910 yes i am a massachusetts republican which is about the same as being an alabama democrat
6298911 but don t call me a liberal that s an insult
6298912 it should be known that jonathan crutchleys donation to mccain left the entire board in disbelief i am disappointed that we have lost some customers and i understand the anger it is too bad for the web site if we lose customers but please never refer to me as a republican i consider it an offense earlier today at the request of the board jonathan has stepped down as chairman

6298914 outlook application to go building an occasionally connected outlook add in using outlook services blueprint
6298915 i think he wants to make sure he gets it checked out and make sure everything is all right with it
6298916 when hes been able to practice and move around hes looked awfully good to me
6298917 i think we have a number of guys that are in that category who have some soreness and my concern will be if it lingers
6298918 hopefully it wont linger and hopefully in the next week to 10 days hes going to be all right and ready to get going
6298919 obviously this injury is one of those things you have to kind of handle daily
6298920 i continue to monitor it because ideally i want to be at full strength come the opener
6298921 i was trying to throw a cutter down and away
6298922 i cannot vouch for the authenticity of it but i trust the friend who sent it to me
6298923 he can really run hes going to make some rookie mistakes but hes showed us he wants to learn and hes improved every day in practice i think hes going to be a great player
6298924 d j s having the best camp hes ever had
6298925 playing with akeem and dc and guys like that really brought me along gave me experience and a good understanding of the game
6298926 the guys we have now dont have the older players to look up to they just have one person when i was young i had multiple players i could talk to to help me through things
6298927 if it wasnt for him i wouldnt be where im at right now
6298928 hell tell me what im supposed to do what i should have did
6298929 it just means i have to work harder every year
6298930 he has the potential to be an above average player his arm can spread the field we can get the ball anywhere we need to and if you spread the field and have speed thats a dangerous combination
6298931 with jeff he could run at quarterback to beat you driskell reminds me a lot of robbie jenkins he can run enough to pester you do enough to make you accountable
6298932 hes not afraid to make deep throws he reminds me of brett favre sometimes it may not be the smartest thing but hell try to stick it in there he just wants to make plays
6298933 i like straight drop back and play action i like to set my feet and just throw im getting more comfortable with moving but id rather stay back and just fire it
6298934 i think we have a good group to work with
6298935 we dont have a lot of high maintenance kids for the kids to be good its going to involve some collective sacrifices when they get along its a bit easier
6298936 i feel more confident that ive been there and done it
6298937 you have to get to your progression on your passes if you drop back and its not there you cant just hang on one receiver
6298938 so long as there is a muscle a nerve a drop of blood to be exploited

6298942 didnt know that tr thanks for the heads up spitz
6298943 i think hes more of a tool rather than a
6298944 that cracked us up in my sports magazine office today
6298945 i think shes unoficially holds the title of hottest girl woman
6298946 i think he should show more respect for his competitors and shake hands give a tap on the shoulder to the other ones immediately after the finish and not make gestures like the one he made in the 100 meters
6298947 he might have interpreted that in another way but the way it was perceived was catch me if you can you dont do that but hell learn hes still a young man
6298948 i would love him to show more respect for his competitors thats not the way we perceive being a champion but he will learn in time he should shake hands with his competitors and not ignore them hell learn that sooner or later but hes a great athlete of course
6298949 bolt must be considered now the same way like jesse owens should have been in the 1930s bolt has a bigger edge than owens on his rivals of course owens had the long jump too so you cant compare people if he maintains that in the future bolt will be someone that probably leaves a mark like jesse owens
6298950 were hoping we can get this thing squared away real quickly
6298951 steven is one of the best players in the nfl and wed like to have him back
6298952 hold down the home key for 5 7 seconds when in the mail app
6298953 i was flat out told that this is how the iphone behaves and nothing is wrong every time it changes wifi networks it has to establish its email port 25 over and over again and so it will not connect to the next network it finds until you restart your iphone
6298954 where were you sent you an email you missed the meeting
6298955 in the 14 days since we launched its been a rocky road and we know the pain some people have been suffering
6298956 be assured people here are working 24 7 to improve matters and were going to favor getting you new info hot off the presses even if we have to post corrections or further updates later
6298957 the team has also fixed over 70 bugs including one that was preventing mobileme imap mail folders from syncing correctly between the web app and mac os x mail or outlook
6298958 plus others correcting display issues in calendar and in general enhancing the performance of our web apps
6298959 delete and restore replace mail accounts from known working accounts on your computer via itunes
6298960 team the launch of mobileme was not our finest hour there are several things we could have done better mobileme was simply not up to apples standards it clearly needed more time and testing rather than launch mobileme as a monolithic service we could have launched over the air syncing with iphone to begin with followed by the web applications one by one mail first followed 30 days later if things went well with mail by calendar then 30 days later by contacts it was a mistake to launch mobileme at the same time as iphone 3g iphone 2 0 software and the app store we all had more than enough to do and mobileme could have been delayed without consequence we are taking many steps to learn from this experience so that we can grow mobileme into a service that our customers will love one step that i can share with you today is that the mobileme team will now report to eddy cue who will lead all of our internet services itunes the app store and starting today mobileme eddys new title will be vice president internet services and he will now report directly to me yes i have had many many issues since upgrading my gen1 4gb phone to 2 0 email does not download properly from my pop3 server several accounts message previews dont show up consistently selecting a message from inbox results in endless spinning status indicator s very often and no message body showing up even after several minutes of spinning status indicator and no errors indicated either the emails have no attachments in most cases and are 1 2 pages so maybe 4 8k max in size networking in general seems to have been tanked by 2 0 the range of the wi fi seems less and the cellphone signal seems weaker than it was in the past fewer bars in general the edge egprs network access seems much slower too which is hard to do this release really seems to be a huge pos thats been my experience apple over i am so upset since i expected the normal apple quality and got ms quality instead oh to the apple zealots i dont want to see a single reply to this about how your phone was upgraded offline and works great or any of that crap i upgraded the phone with itunes online just like all the other updates if there was a better undocumented preference for upgrading the phone offline and this obscure method was the result of some de developing the upgrade process by doing offline upgrades during regression testing that from a software consistency qa and ease of use standpoint is incredibly lame and nothing but shear incompetence they should go work for ms to think someone will second guess the online update vs offline method is ludicrous and extremely bone headed the upgrade should work identically regardless of method used clear on that one zealots i do know what software development is difficult particularly when looking for bugs and trying to fix things but i agree that apple definitely dropped the ball on this one just like how steve jobs sent an email out to his employees about waiting for the introduction of mobileme well they should had made absolutely sure and positive that the 2 0 update was working stable none of that clunky lagging scrolling text messaging contact scrolling broken email lost weak signal etc etc crap oh well i too know how difficult design engineering can be since i worked at another unix platform company for 8 years doing design engineering and program management a really bright company i know how the process works and i know how the marketing pucks will push p1s1s out the door despite being out voted in the pm release meetings i hate to see apple do it to themselves again they changed the industry with the iphone just look at all the korean amp japanese knock offs coming out almost every month since july 2007 i would hate to see a replay of the 80s when arrogance in marketing resulted in a lost opportunity and 150b in billy gs pockets i spent 15 years in the valley from 1985 to 2000 i used to see wozniak at the original pancake house in saratoga nearly every saturday or sunday in the late 80s early 90s they apple have had mobile phones on their minds for quite sometime because back in 1990 wozniak had a home made wrist watch based cellphone he used a timex calculator watch or similar for the keypad and display had an earpiece and the guts of the phone on his belt in a 4x4x2
6298961 my iphone has been running stable for 12 hours my iphone has been running stable for 12 hours
6298962 oh no i have one of those expensive iphone things youve probably heard about in the news yeah and its not working properly
6298963 oh it hangs up just force quit it and it should be fine
6298964 may be due to an account not being able to fetch or push email
6298965 sorry while we understand that is a problem it will unfortunately have to be fixed in a later update
6298966 the government knows this is nonsense we work around the world and stay out of politics
6298967 we are desperate to get working but until the world food programme signs an agreement with the government we cant
6298968 even some top zanu pf politicians are encouraging us to break the ban as there is pressure from traditional leaders for food aid
6298969 if the ban is lifted it will take us another month to set up food in warehouses in south africa may be sent to other countries or else it will become stale
6298970 honestly i dont know and we know the situation is bad
6298971 what is really happening i cant even buy a meal for my grandchildren every time i look at them my heart bleeds and i cry
6298972 we dont even light a fire at night because there is nothing to cook
6298973 these politicians are liars the last time they came here they promised us food and up to now nothing has come
6298974 we hope britain and america will send us food tomorrow
6298975 an indication beyond reasonable doubt of unwillingness to continue to be part of the talks
6298976 firmly committed to this dialogue for one reason and one reason alone the suffering of zimbabweans has to come to an end and any opportunity of liberating them from the current madness has to be pursued to its logical conclusion
6298977 robotics shaped by and shaping the world in 2000 2050
6298978 hopefully ill get all the way to 58 then 68
6298979 five weeks left i should get 10 more if i stay healthy
6298980 i couldnt ask for more its been a tremendous season ill just continue to look for more opportunities and keep going
6298981 i wanted to get back in the right direction that game i felt like i let the team down i wanted to bounce back
6298982 even if there was an athlete that wanted to speak out on issues of human rights he might be silenced by whatever ioc official is mediating that press event
6298983 massive suppression of any voice that the government doesnt want heard
6298984 the chinese governments own voluntary pledges to improve human rights allow public protests and guarantee complete freedom to report made meeting these self set human rights benchmarks one of the tests for a successful olympics
6298985 that is a test that both beijing and the ioc have failed
6298986 may leave in place permanent technological surveillance and monitoring networks that make doing human rights work even more dangerous and difficult for chinese citizens
6298987 the olympics related rights violations well documented in china forced evictions abuse of migrant workers repression of civil society will almost certainly be replayed in russia
6298988 but it could get even uglier in russia journalists are not only harassed they are sometimes murdered
6298989 silent diplomacy is fine but it has to be matched by change on the ground
6298990 if theres no evidence of change you have to back that up with public pressure
6298991 were a sports organization we stay clearly within our role which is to bring sport to host countries
6298992 were not an organization that is best placed or has the capacity to deal with human rights issues
6298993 tibet is part of china the whole world knows that
6298994 the goal for the chinese government is to promote nationalism further
6298995 but ironically the olympic games exposed more social crises than ever like the tibet issue to the chinese people
6298996 in the end they pretty much defined the terms in which the media was going to operate
6298997 those terms are not the same as in the western world
6298998 15 prozent am wahltag w re f r die sozis noch zu viel
6298999 im ausland ein f rstchen zu hause ein w rstchen
6299000 nacionalizamos a ind stria do cimento o que passou da hora de acontecer mas somos apresentados pela imprensa local como agressores
6299001 que foram atrasados porque as empresas exportam a maioria de sua produ o
6299002 i dont want to sell and i cant sell anything either
6299003 i invite you to read my real life experience with starting an income online and the good and perhaps not so good experiences i faced until finally
6299004 i invite you to read my real life experience with starting an income online and the good and perhaps not so good experiences i faced until finally
6299005 the places and things they love using the cinematic quality of a movie the control of a video game and the mind blowing detail of the real world
6299006 unfortunately were not cool enough to run on your os yet
6299007 we really wish we had a version of photosynth that worked cross platform but for now it only runs on windows
6299008 i think he would do for senator obama what lyndon johnson did for john kennedy hes got serious foreign policy experience a long and distinguished senate resume and he is one of the most effective surrogates that senator obama has right now who can go toe to toe with any republican on any issue at any time
6299009 not something that lends itself to on the job training
6299010 the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean
6299011 i made it clear to him and everybody else i never worked for anybody in my life
6299012 i got here when i was 29 i never had a boss i dont know how id handle it
6299013 we felt like warriors out there the pressure of playing china made it pretty intense
6299014 ever since the ball dropped in athens weve wanted to repeat as olympic champions
6299015 when the ball goes too high you cant see it too easy
6299016 but its ok because if it is raining for us it is raining for them
6299017 the left seems unable or unwilling to absorb the important lesson about supporting progressive books
6299018 so they too will debut on bestseller lists and monopolize media coverage
6299019 once again a meticulously reported and intelligent progressive book may die on the vine from lack of progressive support before word of it reaches the american public on our side we have no wingnut welfare type support for our writers who take the time to write and promote their work tirelessly in an effort to advance the progressive cause despite the odds a precious few scratch and claw their way onto bestseller lists post pub date after tortuous weeks of book touring and self promotion in the face of giant collective yawns from the progressive community most go to all this trouble and still dont make the lists
6299020 this isnt just about business its about activism and defeating the right and getting our messages and ideas out in the most effective ways possible
6299021 a few thousand pod copies of obamas challenge will lead to more people walking through your doors and asking for the book before the election boycotting this book is a mistake and you know it
6299022 sell this book under these terms and conditions and youll help change the world
6299023 no distinct similarities except skin color you mean the really sad thing about it is you know almost every black person can relate to this incident too
6299024 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
6299025 my group has been investigating what we believe is another taste quality calcium
6299026 there isnt a better word for it it is bitter perhaps even a little sour but its much more because there are actual receptors for calcium not just bitter or sour compounds
6299027 but at levels much above that the taste becomes increasingly bad
6299028 many animals have a specific calcium appetite which implies they can detect the mineral and consume sufficient quantities of it to meet their needs
6299029 most mice dislike calcium but we found a very unusual strain that drinks it avidly
6299030 the pwk strain drank about four times more calcium than water
6299031 we can now say with some certainty that calcium is tasted
6299032 we know people have the sweet taste gene tas1r3 and the gene involved with the calcium sensing receptor casr we dont know if we have the same forms of genes as the mice have but it seems pretty likely they have the same function
6299033 hopefully we wont have to be sitting by as somebody dies to wait to chop their tongues off were not ambulance chasers there are cases where people have cancer of the tongue and have to get them removed
6299034 people dont consume as much calcium as nutritionists would like and one reason for this is that foods high in calcium dont taste good to many people
6299035 tweaking its taste could encourage a calcium deficient population to consume more of this key nutrient
6299036 i am more bullish than bearish i think the market has too quickly discounted geopolitical risks and was too concerned with demand destruction we should be trending back towards 120 125 a barrel
6299037 we see the big picture of demand destruction in the u s but there is also a lot of bullish news that is driving the market
6299038 nach einer gescheiterten beziehung habe ich mich an den weihnachtsfeiertagen an denen meine trauer und frust besonders gro waren bei elitepartner de angemeldet
6299039 the most serious blunder that this sitting regime could commit
6299040 if the government declares an all out war we will also declare an all out war in mindanao
6299041 we are ready to kill and be killed the patience of muslims has run out
6299042 there are a few difficulties could this be the end of the peace process no we have to review the terms and negotiate again
6299043 this happens when there is so much frustration in the peace process as a result people become outraged we are trying our best to restrain our commanders
6299044 well and because they have not been telling the truth and i hate to say that people are lying but heres a situation where folks are lying i have said repeatedly that i would have been completely in fully in support of the federal bill that everybody supported which was to say that you should provide assistance to any infant that was born even if it was as a consequence of an induced abortion
6299045 indeed mr obama appeared to misstate his position in the christian broadcast network interview on saturday when he said the federal version he supported was not the bill that was presented at the state level his campaign yesterday acknowledged that he had voted against an identical bill in the state senate and a spokesman hari sevugan said the senator and other lawmakers had concerns that even as worded the legislation could have undermined existing illinois abortion law those concerns did not exist for the federal bill because there is no federal abortion law
6299046 i would have been completely in fully in support of the federal bill that everybody supported
6299047 these things already happened why wont you just let me move forward
6299048 these things havent happened yet what are you worrying yourself about
6299049 is this a warning that im going to be hurt beyond repair

6299052 he gave up his ghost to heaven and we will miss him always
6299053 i have plenty of space to improvise to try new ideas
6299054 we have experienced your willingness to learn and to share yourselves with us we have enjoyed the play and the laughter we appreciate the opportunity to enrich your lives and to have our lives enriched by you always it has been an opportunity to share our way of being and to share what we know about ourselves now it is time for us to expand our way of communicating with you so that we may enrich each others lives to a greater extent there exists a level of consciousness where we are one in the same our reason for existing in physical forms is exactly the same our desire for experience is exactly the same it was expected that at some point in time we would join forces and begin to co create our existence in this physical earth realm
6299055 the planet that we share has always been one that includes the experience of birth and death
6299056 we have begun a journey one that is taking us to another level of conscious awareness of our ability to create a life and an existence that more truthfully reflects the beings of light that we are we are pleased to have the opportunity of sharing these experiences with you we can feel the becoming that is occurring not just for human and dolphin but also for the others who share our planet we have waited a long time for you we are pleased that the waiting is finished and that the partnership of re creation has begun feel our hearts so that you might know how you bring us joy we continue to share space and time with you as you take this to another level inside your own bodies we are in anticipation of what you surprise us with next
6299057 first we wish to communicate our gratitude to all who take this journey of re creation with us never before has such a journey been possible from the time that we first became aware of your presence on this earth we have been in anticipation of a time when such a sharing would be possible these are truly days of rejoicing we understand the efforts necessary for you to make such a journey in self realization and awakening we understand the effort it takes to change ideas beliefs and how the mind works we acknowledge the effort that it takes to do this and the amount of soul intention that is required in fact the most obvious thing about you is the power of your soul intention
6299058 do you know that we are capable of sensing what you refer to as
6299059 we are moving into a time of conscious co creation we are moving into a time where the earth will no longer be asked to hold the realities of self destruction and negativity we are moving into a time where earth will be asked to hold the reality of respect and the appreciation of each others divinity laughter will be the way of things not tears we thank you for your trust in us and for allowing us to accompany you on your journey of awakening we are pleased that you are learning to trust your own higher expression for that is where your true wisdom lies on behalf of all life on this planet we thank you for allowing it to finally be time for the joy and the love to happen
6299060 we are in peace with your pace of awakening to your greater identity we are in joy that we have the opportunity to share the experience with you we are enhanced by this mutual meeting of the minds hearts and higher expressions we thank you again for the opportunity to grow and to play
6299061 our mutual coming together in the meetings of light gave us the opportunity to support each other in this grand re awakening it allowed us to contribute to each others process it ensured that we would both succeed

6299074 we felt like warriors out there the pressure of playing china made it pretty intense
6299075 ever since the ball dropped in athens weve wanted to repeat as olympic champions
6299076 when the ball goes too high you cant see it too easy
6299077 but its ok because if it is raining for us it is raining for them
6299078 it is not good that the man should be alone i will make him a helper as his
6299079 woman what concern is that to you and to me my hour has not yet come
6299080 now draw some out and take it to the chief steward
6299081 everyone serves the good wine first and the inferior wine after the guests have become drunk but you have kept the good wine until now
6299082 this is gods word its all true or none of it is true whatll it be god would not allow pauls work in the bible if he was a false prophet
6299083 no state man or woman should fear the influence of loving religion
6299084 thats what everyone from margaret thatcher to alan sugar is telling us at the moment but try telling that to the network of hackers throughout europe theyve been trading cracked games and demos for years
6299085 the resultant loss of revenue through hacking is substantial the problem is not exaggerated
6299086 we copy games simply because most software is not worth buying
6299087 theres a lot of talent out there if only they could channel their energies legitimately
6299088 people said viruses similar to those on the vax and ibm computers couldnt exist and i set out to prove them wrong
6299089 but i never wanted to destroy any software with it
6299090 to give people who cant afford to buy a game the chance to have it
6299091 software is overpriced i wouldnt buy a tenth of the games i see and i couldnt afford to either
6299092 the disk cannot be copied because theres so much protection on it but it can be patched there are areas where it can be disabled
6299093 i dont think they damage us that seriously we offer class packaging posters badges extra incentives to make people buy
6299094 the real danger is we could go the same way as the st market in the states where stuff went straight into public circulation through the bulletin boards now the st market is dead over there and the hackers contributed towards that
6299095 software disks have become the new generation of swopsies and its difficult to know how to combat that but its their outlets which we must close i know of a guy in watford who went through 11 games in one day simply by taking them back to the shop and exchanging them shop assistants are contributing to the problem
6299096 we also need some kind of additional hardware a sort of sophisticated dongle device we tested one of our titles against the various cartridges on the market and only two failed
6299097 i dont think so i developed the original expert to help me program and thats what i intended it to be used for many programmers find it invaluable other companies jumped on the bandwagon
6299098 you can spend months developing protection for a game and someone will come along and crack it in a day its a matter of principle to them
6299099 its difficult for us to know how much goes on
6299100 whats been a problem in the past is that peoples mates were just walking straight into the place without our knowledge now thats not possible
6299101 theres no way of protecting against someone doing it wilfully but programmers are under contract and they collect royalties so they shouldnt want to lose out
6299102 we were not even supposed to know of its existence but triad are pouring out disks
6299103 one of the finest examples of functionalist architecture in the uk and one of the most elegant university buildings of its period

6299105 the orbitofrontal cortex ofc is the main modulator of amygdala action
6299106 so if you are at a party and someone insults you the amygdala which is a very primitive and old structure in human brains will be yelling kill the guy
6299107 women excel in something called verbal fluency or being able to come up with appropriate words given cues
6299108 well j said something in class a while back about how i could be an aging ballerina
6299109 i think the fact that canadians pay so much attention to the u s election is a sign that they really care about the united states a sign that they want it to get back to where it was before

6299158 to be honest with you weve never had to deal with a police station being burglarized before
6299159 its just out of the ordinary when it happens to another officer or police department
6299160 weve been building our nest egg and waiting for the right opportunity
6299161 our goal is to move in and make it our home and wait out the market
6299162 higher sales are great but foreclosures are still high and people need to appreciate that more discounts may be coming
6299163 there are a lot of good well qualified people out there
6299164 people feel ok i can put down 10 or 20 and do this and the payment will be ok even with a 30 year fixed mortgage

6299176 as you know attorney general guidelines were first implemented in the wake of the fbi abuses of the 1960s and 1970s and serve as one of the most important bulwarks against future abuses
6299177 given the importance of these guidelines providing a period of time for public comment would be a reasonable and responsible way to move forward and achieve the best possible end result
6299178 the guidelines will require all activities to have a valid purpose
6299179 we are particularly concerned that the draft guidelines might permit an innocent american to be subjected to such intrusive surveillance based in part on race ethnicity national origin religion or on protected first amendment activities
6299180 it legitimizes the game for a collection of viewers who now makereal you be possible to sphere at a loss with the acme prize

6299188 the entire world had the impression that the happy party of very cheap chinese goods could last forever
6299189 i thought that but i think perhaps its coming to an end

6299203 gods been preparing all of us as a body of believers to learn the importance of one word
6299204 do you have a problem loving others its because you dont really love yourself
6299205 people who recognize their own sins their own flaws faults and failures are those who make the best ambassadors for jesus christ those whore forgiven much recognize how much they have been forgiven when you see all the ways you fail youll have the ability to love others

6299208 ive seen what happens to members of the majority party who want to be an independent voice they get stomped down

6299210 to do the job and see the progress we need
6299211 to say someones not doing their job properly and if someone would do their job properly things would be better is a gross oversimplification
6299212 because too many legislators are related to people in the turnpike authority
6299213 metrowest is quickly becoming the center of economic potential and infrastructure investments in us will benefit the state as a whole
6299214 cities and towns are hurting infrastructure is crumbling perhaps that 1 billion would be better spent

6299220 well often see the same item and think were taking the same picture but theres often something a little different
6299221 i like to shoot outdoors because i like the idea of taking pictures and seeing what i was envisioning and how it came out
6299222 one of the best photos i took was a screech owl people always ask where i found it and theyre surprised when i say it was in saxonville
6299223 i like it when my photos help them realize there are beautiful things to photograph right outside our doors
6299224 i think most people would be very reluctant to open wide the juvenile records
6299225 its our responsibility to make sure the citizens in this state are safe
6299226 were getting a lot of reps everyones getting a chance to get in the game its good its a scrimmage and were trying to get our starting team

6299238 patty founded ovation for the cure because she did not want to let cancer win we need awareness and we need to find a cure
6299239 it is the most deadly of gynecological diseases and no one is doing anything about it

6299261 kill all the rich people break up their cars and apartments bring the revolution home kill your parents thats where its really at
6299262 the iraqis who have risen up against the occupation are not insurgents or terrorists or the enemy they are the revolution the minutemen and their numbers will grow and they will win
6299263 the republicans idea of equal rights is the american flag and the confederate swastika flying side by side
6299264 if i read this to you and did not tell you that it was an fbi agent describing what americans had done to prisoners in their control you would most certainly believe this must have been done by nazis soviets in their gulags or some mad regime pol pot or others that had no concern for human beings

6299299 i am here to change the image that the media has made in the public about me i want them to know the real monica i am not as bad as people think i am and i want to do it more for my parents more than for myself
6299300 i am grateful to bigg boss2 for letting me be on this show through which i can reveal my real self
6299301 these young scientists are not only contributing to our states innovation and wellbeing but they are also fantastic role models for the next generation of scientists
6299302 only the tail was recognizable there was wreckage scattered all over the place and dead bodies across a wide area a lot of them were children
6299303 i saw how the plane broke in two and a huge explosion
6299304 also you feel powerless because the airline doesnt provide any information at all
6299305 what i like about it is its got a hidden agenda it looks as if its about listening and joining with allies except the idea here which mccain cant say but i can is to essentially kill the un nobodys going to walk out of the un theres a lot of emotional attachment to it in the us how do you kill it you create a parallel institution
6299306 right now we are not in any position to do anything like this out of our pocket
6299307 this is something we would plan further down the road we have too many pressing needs that need addressed now and we have to consider what is best for the taxpayers
6299308 this is a neat little town and wed like to help out the community as much as possible
6299309 normally speaking we only grant these in hardships whats the hardship

6299316 are we going to get back to the importance of supreme court justices
6299317 i believe marriage is the union between a man and a woman
6299318 for me as a christian its also a sacred union
6299319 i strongly support preserving the unique status of marriage between man and woman
6299320 im a federalist i believe that the state should make those decisions
6299321 that doesnt mean that they dont have the rights of all citizens im not saying that i am saying that we should preserve the unique status of marriage between one man and one woman and if a federal court decided that my state of arizona had to observe what the state of massachusetts decided then i would favor a constitutional amendment until then i believe the state should make the decisions within their own states
6299322 because historically we have not defined marriage in our constitution
6299323 the reason people think there needs to be a constitutional amendment is
6299324 strong enough jurist or legal thinker at the time for that elevation setting aside the fact that i profoundly disagree with his interpretations of the constitution
6299325 proven record of strictly adhering to the constitution of the united states of america and not legislating from the bench
6299326 but when it comes to the programs that are federally funded
6299327 we do have to be careful to make sure we are not creating a situation where people are being discriminated against using federal money
6299328 obama said he believes local laws in some states prohibiting discrimination against gays would apply to faith based social programs funded with federal money in those states
6299329 we are confident of reaching the dh700bn mark in the next three years with our next jump leading us to cross dh1 trillion
6299330 we still have 26 plots that have not yet been developed
6299331 we are privileged to have been given the task and challenge of developing the project

6299333 we are committed to going international we plan to open a representative office in india by the fourth quarter this will offer us opportunity to look at expansion within southeast asia
6299334 we are in exploratory discussions with potential partners and have not yet reached a partnership agreement
6299335 we are looking at these countries in terms of reconnaissance missions but we havent yet established anything

6299345 it means the children can express themselves creatively its a chance for the quiet child who might not excel in conventional areas

6299352 people are looking at the gasoline inventory drawdown said tetsu emori fund manager at astmax asset management in tokyo
6299353 i think the price is going to be heading to the downside for the medium term to the end of the year he said
6299354 the prime minister of jamaica told me everybody is in the streets ive written history im just real proud
6299355 im looking forward to going to bed waking up and realizing im a double gold medalist ive been dreaming of breaking the 200 meter record since i was yea high
6299356 hes five to seven years from his prime if he stays healthy focused and motivated were going to see some of the most incredible things weve ever seen in sports
6299357 i could see him running the 400 meters i could see him running the 800 in six seven years his talent is virtually untapped
6299358 i dont compare myself a lot im just trying to be me he revolutionized the sport i just changed it a little bit
6299359 if i said that was a great softball game it would be an understatement
6299360 well have a fresh cat said candrea of former texas longhorns great cat osterman who pitched one inning in relief wednesday
6299361 she wasnt going to try to dance anything by me
6299362 yeah and i think its part of you know re imagining a property like this you know its like batman begins
6299363 this is an effort to get beyond the glitz and celebrity of barack obamas convention and talk about the reality of his record
6299364 our focus is going to be on providing solutions to bring energy independence and create jobs
6299365 i dont know that the average coloradoan will be able to participate in ben afflecks poker game
6299366 its only because they dont have the experience in the gold medal game

6299369 isso tem a ver com o an ncio da compra da london mining pela arcelormittal
6299370 plausibly alleged that bristol myers silence with regard to the details of the apotex settlement made its public statements misleading or false
6299371 i offer our heartfelt condolences to the families and friends of those killed by the blast
6299372 isaf remains committed to rebuilding afghanistan a cause for which these soldiers gave their life
6299373 i thought it was important that we be proactive when dealing with drugs in our community
6299374 felon was an excellent opportunity to purchase a dog through fundraising efforts which landers did and provide that service to the community
6299375 when he was working he was all business always on alert
6299376 we joked that they felon and a basset wrigley were twins
6299377 he thought felon was his big brother he was more protective of wrigley than of me
6299378 it was always a standing joke at least for me that he would push me in front of a car if he could get my side of the bed
6299379 he loved me but he only had eyes for brian
6299380 but he liked marshmallows so we left them outside the door
6299381 theres some past there definitely some bad blood with players and coaches who have played before
6299382 it was a tough game the last time and were hoping for a really good game this time
6299383 its to everyone out there that you have to work hard
6299384 im well aware that the numbers were talking about here are very substantial
6299385 something else is going on besides mattels property in contributing to sales
6299386 the evidence is uncontroverted that the drawings portray older edgier sexier dolls
6299387 the eyebrows were way too aggressive the lips way too pronounced the face way too harsh what mga made is a prettier doll that could compete
6299388 i thought how am i going to explain this to my customers
6299389 our emphasis in not on the dollars and cents at this point
6299390 our emphasis is on getting the product off the shelves and out of distribution
6299391 if something is happening in the plant then clearly they are responsible for it so theres all the more reason to sort of bite the bullet
6299392 i believe that india should not sign the npt or ctbt
6299393 one has to sign these petitions under peer pressure we were told that if we put our organisations name on it it will carry some weight this petition was circulated by e mail
6299394 we dont have any office nor do we have any full time staff
6299395 this talk of npt and ctbt being discriminatory in nature is double talk then why did we sign the wto which is also discriminatory
6299396 there is no guarantee that america will give up its nuclear weapons
6299397 there is an element of discrimination but the impact is diluted by the bargain that these nuclear weapon states would reduce their stockpile of weapons
6299398 if we dont sign the ctbt and npt but this nuclear deal goes through this will lead to arms race in the region between india and pakistan china this will lead to diversion of resources which can otherwise be used for alleviating poverty
6299399 we are thrilled that the first ever global game board includes an interesting mix of cities that showcases the dynamic cultures sights and history of the planet
6299400 in terms of promoting canada and tourism here this is good and it goes to 103 countries around the world
6299401 literally if you look at this board its quite interesting
6299402 its all based on the votes and how they placed in the voting and has pretty much nothing to do with financial and geographical flow which is traditionally what we think of in monopoly
6299403 we are thrilled that the first ever global game board includes an interesting mix of cities that showcases the dynamic cultures sights and history of the planet
6299404 from a tourism perspective what better advertising could you get and i think people will be talking
6299405 marco polo if these cities were chosen by 5 million fans probably only 1000 geeks that cast all the votes then how the heck did cities like gdynia and kyiv made it in i dont even know what countries theyre in and i thought i was pretty good in geography
6299406 while the clich d view was that the indians rode on elephants to schools the more interesting one from an indian it industry point of view was that all the us managers were of the unanimous opinion that indian it workers were hard working and fast learners this really was an important quality that got them to continue to engage with the indian it industry during that early phase
6299407 the results and forecast increase my confidence in the hp story

6299418 after losing 2 5 you may have a recovery of a half a point
6299419 china is a very important economy both regionally and globally

6299434 the biggest problem we have had is to retrofit the building for modern elevators to move people fast enough for what our biggest needs are

6299436 he capello has probably not seen the best of me yet i dont think anyone has so all i can do now is work hard and give 100 for my club and try to get back in the seniors
6299437 it is a big year for me as long as i can stay injury free there is nothing stopping me from doing well this season and pushing back into that england squad
6299438 i thought i got off to a good start last season winning player of the month and then i averaged out a bit
6299439 this season ill be giving 100 and make sure i play the best i can in every game and hopefully ill be straight back in there
6299440 this was a completely new problem and had no relationship to his knee injury
6299441 everything went very well at the time of surgery and valeri is fit and well post op he will be back in carrington next week to start his rehab programme
6299442 i can definitely see gabby and ashley breaking into the england side this season they can be as good as they want
6299443 we cant go and kick lumps out of anybody we havent got that type of player
6299444 everyone keeps telling me go and get a centre midfield player im not interested in central midfield players just for the sake of it
6299445 im only interested in good footballers if we can get them the more good footballers youve got the better chance youve got
6299446 we only lost 11 times last season but on the days you lose you get stick for not having a centre half who heads the ball out of your box
6299447 on days like that you get stick for not having a midfield player who tackles everything that moves
6299448 were at nine whoa is this some kind of cat graveyward
6299449 i know i fuckin hated that place thats why i never took you
6299450 they also have plans to look after the old unemployed ones

6299455 nicole reinhardt wants to wear her gold medal in a playboy spread
6299456 what is this this is simply ill mannered and a sign of disrespect to the jalur gemilang what did the jalur gemilang do to them
6299457 the bloggers are only good in making up stories and giving people ideas which are very bad if this happens those doing so are insulting the jalur gemilang and action will be taken against them i hope the police will look into this matter and take the necessary action
6299458 it was amazing watching you on television that was outstanding
6299459 i dont think before the race i can take a gold medal i think maybe i can come in top three but not the gold medal
6299460 there was nobody behind me and i thought whats going on what are people thinking they dont come up with me and i was very very surprised that nobody came with me
6299461 everybody tell me how can you do two more laps after the race because i was very very happy i dont feel tired you know because i felt happy i did another 2 laps in the stadium with the flag
6299462 if i am healthy yeah why not maybe yes just for to be there i dont think i can take another medal because its hard
6299463 the first thing she asked me was are we ready
6299464 it signals that the people are starting to come and that in a few days all of these democratic movers and shakers are going to be here and thats really exciting
6299465 i think this whole community is going to get really excited
6299466 this is the kind of thing that to a city like denver comes once in 100 years theres just so much going on i hope people do come downtown and take advantage of this tremendous opportunity

6299474 my grandmother always said that im going to die the day we get along and sadly enough it was
6299475 in some ways i feel that hashem took her away when i was ready for it
6299476 i just look at where i was and where i am now
6299477 i have had some other surgeries but the acl was the toughest thing ive ever had to come back from ive never had a knee injury before knock on wood
6299478 i felt a crunch and looked down one finger was laid on top of the other finger
6299479 they x rayed it and then put me in a splint if it would have been the season i could have played with it they would have just wrapped it up
6299480 i never pulled a muscle before i thought i was superman and that i could heal faster than i was supposed to
6299481 but the way i look at it i feel like ive had my share i think its time to be healthy and play football
6299482 but i dont think ill be playing special teams anymore
6299483 i guess a little bit but they felt like those were very minor things
6299484 im a bit of a warrior and im not afraid to ask somebody where i stand and they definitely let me know that i was a part of the team that they see me here they just wanted me to take my time and get right
6299485 i dont feel like theres a great deal of a drop off with any of those guys
6299486 we just want dusty to regain his old form to be a good run stopper like he has been he has such a passion for the game he loves it its not just his job
6299487 but id like to play at least half the season
6299488 this injury has nothing to do with my previous injury its just something that happened its part of the game
6299489 he that answers a matter before he hears it it is folly and shame unto him
6299490 we have two ears and one mouth so that we can listen twice as much as we speak
6299491 reckless words pierce like a sword but the tongue of the wise brings healing
6299492 like one who takes away a garment on a cold day is one who sings songs to a heavy heart
6299493 a soft answer turns away wrath but grievous words stir up anger
6299494 the heart of the wise teaches his mouth and adds persuasiveness to his lips
6299495 he who conceals his hatred has lying lips and whoever spreads slander is a fool
6299496 they havent offered anything and we havent asked for anything
6299497 i think there is still a lot of fear in the market in terms of the financial sector
6299498 playing with the club captain what an experience that is
6299499 and ben is a great professional and a great goalkeeper and its just great to be playing with them
6299500 the style of this match is the same as our previous matches
6299501 of course given that we have now increased the squad that will mean that some players are going to be unhappy because they are not getting a game
6299502 so some of them may leave during this transfer window and that may be an obvious thing
6299503 the surgeon reckons he will have to perform open surgery as opposed to the keyhole procedure ryan had before
6299504 ryan will do well to return before the end of the season
6299505 in january the then culture secretary categorically promised the commons there would be no more lottery raids to pay for their olympics budget miscalculations
6299506 six months later that promise has been torn up every time the lottery is raided less money goes into grassroots sport yet this is the only way we will secure a legacy for everyone from the 2012 olympics
6299507 funding for our athletes in athens was primarily lottery money in beijing both lottery and exchequer
6299508 for london the package will be lottery exchequer and business
6299509 following our successes in beijing we have great ambitions for our athletes in 2012 and are determined to make sure that investment is in place
6299510 can gordon brown not see there is something fundamentally short sighted in funding the british team by raiding the money going to local and community sports clubs
6299511 if the government had started raising this money earlier our athletes could have had the funding certainty they need without raiding grassroots sports
6299512 there will be an impasse a kind of stalemate which were heading towards
6299513 things have been bad before one keeps wondering how much lower they can go
6299514 quietly they are rather irritated this has happened in the first place
6299515 they will continue to come out in support of georgia but dont forget that american power in this region is limited russian power in this region is far easier to exert
6299516 the extent of eu unity is in direct proportion to the extent that russia becomes aggressive and assertive
6299517 a well placed official in the russian ministry of defense
6299518 to freeze all military cooperation with nato and allied countries
6299519 it is our understanding that other nato countries will receive similar notes
6299520 if this indeed is the case it would be unfortunate we need to work with russia on a range of security issues but we are obviously very concerned about russian behavior in georgia

6299522 the swedish implementation of the eu ip enforcement directive is severely delayed the original implementation deadline was 29 april 2006 and the governments failure to implement on time recently caused the european court of justice to find sweden guilty of breaching its treaty obligations as chronicled by the ipkat here sweden also failed to meet the new deadline of 1 july 2008 and implementation is now scheduled for 1 january 2009 the directive and swedish law although most of the minimum enforcement standards set out in the directive are already met by existing laws a few features require the legislatures attention the issue that has apparently caused the delay is the right for ip rights holders to obtain information regarding the origin and distribution networks of infringing goods article 8 the swedish government has explained that it needed to await the ecjs decision in the promusicae case case 275 06 see ipkat note here which considered whether the provision is an absolute requirement imposed on member states the ecj rendered its decision in the promusicae case in january 2008 finding that article 8 does not require member states to lay down an obligation to communicate personal data in order to ensure the effective protection of intellectual property in the context of civil proceedings however the ecj declared that community law does require that when transposing the directive the authorities and courts of the member states must not only interpret national law in a manner consistent with the directive but also ensure that they do not rely on an interpretation which would conflict with fundamental rights or with other general principles of community law such as the principle of proportionality sweden has also claimed that article 8 of the directive is hard to interpret and hence difficult to implement however according to ecj case law these are not valid excuses for failing to implement a directive in due time other required amendments include amendments to the provisions on civil search orders to facilitate the protection of confidential information and to enable orders to be granted in respect of anticipated ip infringements and a new power for the courts to order the recall of infringing goods and the publication of judicial decisions and corrective notices next steps the swedish government is planning to publish its bill on the required amendments in september 2008 and to implement the directive on 1 january 2009

6299531 while i was watching the match i was clapping i was so happy
6299532 my training situation is a lot like the situation in my country
6299533 i was crying because i was remembering back when we were both on the afghan refugee taekwondo team in iran
6299534 it is wonderful that an afghan athlete can win a medal in the world olympics
6299535 young people should draw hope and inspiration from this olympic win
6299536 today afghanistan has demonstrated that it can and will succeed in the face of adversity with the determination commitment and hard work of its most precious resource the young people of afghanistan
6299537 in a country like afghanistan the only thing we hear about all the time is violence and fighting this is finally good news for afghanistan

6299544 patients can live with these even without treatment because they dont seem to have a large impact on the body
6299545 and the fact that shes coming public with it is a great witness
6299546 its not unlike our holy father pope john paul ii when he came down with his disease he wanted people to see there was no shame or sorrow in struggling with the physical disease for spiritual reasons and i think catherines probably doing the same thing
6299547 i should have gone with him but i wish he didnt have to leave at all

6299560 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
6299561 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
6299562 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
6299563 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
6299564 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
6299565 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
6299566 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
6299567 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
6299568 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
6299569 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
6299570 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
6299571 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
6299572 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
6299573 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
6299574 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
6299575 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
6299576 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
6299577 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
6299578 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
6299579 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
6299580 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
6299581 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
6299582 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
6299583 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
6299584 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
6299585 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
6299586 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
6299587 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
6299588 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
6299589 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
6299590 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
6299591 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
6299592 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
6299593 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
6299594 what makes us rich as a society is what we know and what we can do anything that stands in the way of the dissemination of knowledge is a real problem

6299596 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
6299597 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
6299598 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
6299599 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
6299600 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
6299601 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
6299602 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
6299603 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
6299604 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
6299605 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
6299606 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
6299607 who are open to doing something on the production side
6299608 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
6299609 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
6299610 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
6299611 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
6299612 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
6299613 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
6299614 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
6299615 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
6299616 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
6299617 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
6299618 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
6299619 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
6299620 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
6299621 doing medical ethics well does not depend upon any particular religious or ethical point of view
6299622 they havent offered anything and we havent asked for anything
6299623 i think there is still a lot of fear in the market in terms of the financial sector

6299630 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
6299631 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
6299632 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
6299633 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
6299634 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
6299635 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
6299636 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
6299637 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
6299638 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
6299639 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
6299640 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
6299641 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
6299642 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
6299643 what makes us rich as a society is what we know and what we can do anything that stands in the way of the dissemination of knowledge is a real problem
6299644 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
6299645 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
6299646 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
6299647 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
6299648 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
6299649 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
6299650 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
6299651 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
6299652 for consultations with the russian leadership on the full spectrum of relations between the russian federation and the north atlantic alliance including military cooperation
6299653 development of the military and political situation in europe whereby the american strategic capability is steadily advanced toward our borders
6299654 have no targets other than russian intercontinental ballistic missiles nor will they have in the foreseeable future
6299655 for a long time we were assured that american anti missile preparations were not directed against russia we cannot fail to take into account the fact that for years while pumping weapons into georgia washington assured us that these steps were not directed agtainst russia now when the irrational actions of the georgian leadership have killed and wounded thousands of people in south ossetia and russia including russian peacekeepers it is becoming more and more obvious what such assurances are worth
6299656 we do not intend to give up the dialogue and are prepared to continue to work on this topic with all interested parties
6299657 well continue to seek to deprive the present georgian regime of the potential and resources to do more mischief an embargo on arms supplies to the current tbilisi regime would be a start
6299658 russia is committed to the ongoing positive development of relations with the u s our bilateral relationship can only advance upon the basis of reciprocity i meant precisely that when i said that the u s will have to choose between its virtual georgia project and its much broader partnership with russia
6299659 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
6299660 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
6299661 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
6299662 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
6299663 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on

6299668 its devastating but thats just the way things are going
6299669 we were not really expecting it not as sudden as this
6299670 were very sad but its a great company to work for
6299671 there was an effort to get an investor but nothing came of it about 100 of us would have over two years with the company
6299672 we have been hearing about rising costs forever from management but things really started to go downhill over the last few months when the construction industry vanished
6299673 we had no real idea of what was going on everyone has mortgages and kids and lives and worries and no notion of what to do next

6299676 i would ask taoiseach brian cowen to now turn his attention to his home constituency
6299677 a depressing reminder of the effects of mr cowens recession
6299678 there is a need to increase the share of direct taxes by eliminating incentives and step up measures against direct tax evasion

6299681 i think he wants to make sure he gets it checked out and make sure everything is all right with it

6299683 i think we have a number of guys that are in that category who have some soreness and my concern will be if it lingers
6299684 hopefully it wont linger and hopefully in the next week to 10 days hes going to be all right and ready to get going
6299685 obviously this injury is one of those things you have to kind of handle daily
6299686 i continue to monitor it because ideally i want to be at full strength come the opener
6299687 these guys have got composure and character the one thing weve learned this summer is that regardless of what the score is were just going to keep grinding it out we can always find a way to win

6299697 this area is seeing historic levels of rain with totals in excess of 20 inches already
6299698 additional rainfall of eight to 15 inches is possible through saturday
6299699 this storm is turning into a serious catastrophic flooding event particularly in southern brevard county
6299700 the weather forecast tells us that some areas could receive rainfall as much as 30 inches
6299701 we have removed alligators we have removed snakes and weve removed all kinds of wildlife
6299702 our animal services and enforcement officers have been doing this all over the county for the last three days
6299703 the bottom line here is that fay has hardly moved at all
6299704 the good news for brevard county is that the big rainmaker the was putting out 25 inches in windover farms has moved farther to the north
6299705 we are hoping for late friday and maybe this thing would be completely out of here
6299706 fay has strengthened tonight but not in the last several hours
6299707 just look for those blue lights and when they see a blue light coming just go outside and wave us down from their porch and well stop and well pick you up and get you to a shelter and make sure that you are safe there
6299708 we are going to be out there all through the night
6299709 we are basically going to be putting law enforcement resources at all of these major checkpoints and all of these neighborhoods that have the flooding so that we make sure that people are not going in there that dont belong in the neighborhoods and dont live in the neighborhoods
6299710 its a little bit of a drag because flying is sort of my downtime
6299711 but its fantastic to be connected for the productivity you get i was also able to chat and watch my slingbox video
6299712 there will be peaks and valleys but thats the nature of the beast with wireless
6299713 but imagine trying to run wires up to 30 000 feet
6299714 how long did it take marconi and the wright brothers to get together and thats what we have here in this convergence two vastly different approaches to bringing people together and communicating
6299715 ich bin zufrieden das war ein gro er gegner immerhin weltmeister wir waren in der ersten h lfte sehr aktiv schade war das tor vor der halbzeit ich glaube das war ein gutes resultat f r uns so ein tor czan patzer anm geh rt zum fu ball jetzt haben wir zehn tage f r zwei l nderspiele ich freue mich auf das arbeiten wir haben noch viele fehler in kombinationen gemacht ich wei dass wir noch viel arbeiten m ssen man kann noch nicht sagen ob wir auch gegen frankeich mit denselben spielern spielen ich kenne die spieler noch nicht so lange
6299716 mit dem resultat k nnen wir sehr zufrieden sein wir haben aber gesehen dass es trotzdem noch einiges zu verbessern gibt trotzdem w re mehr drinnen gewesen solche gegentore d rfen nicht passieren scharner hat heute solide gespielt wir haben ihm gesagt er soll keine wunderdinge probieren sondern seine st rken die starke physis einbringen
6299717 mit einem punkt beim weltmeister kann man durchaus zufrieden sein
6299718 es war nicht leicht gegen eine solche mannschaft zu spielen die athletisch und physisch um einiges st rker ist als unsere ich bin aber mit dem ergebnis durchaus zufrieden es war gro artig f r mich wieder dabei zu sein obwohl es weniger gro artig war als wir 0 2 zur ck lagen
6299719 ich habe adduktorenprobleme hoffe aber dass ich schon bald wieder spielen kann mit dem 2 2 k nnen wir zufrieden sein es war aber in erster linie ein vorsprechen beim neuen trainer das resultat ist sicher zweitrangig zu bewerten ich habe mir vorgenommen in dieser saison ein paar tore zu schie en auch in der premier league dass es schon so fr h losgegangen ist freut mich
6299720 es hat schon ein gespr ch zwischen mir ivanschitz und pogatetz gegeben bei unserer n chsten zusammenkunft werden wir uns gleich als erstes mit der gesamten mannschaft zusammensetzen und gewisse dinge ausr umen bei wigan habe ich immer innenverteidiger gespielt das ist ein anderes bewegungsmuster aber ich bin gleich gut zurechtgekommen
6299721 die letzten tage waren eine achterbahn der gef hle ich habe erst am samstag erfahren dass ich nachnominiert wurde umso berraschter war ich dass ich gespielt habe mir kommt dieses system sicher zugute aber ich h tte auch in einem anderen system meine chancen und hoffe dass ich gegen frankreich wieder von beginn an dabei bin

6299723 bangaloreans hardly pay attention to fuel conservation and do not care about environment
6299724 we have adopted a method covering a cross section of the population from various zones of the city to give a fair idea about the general habit of car owners in bangalore
6299725 we need to think of methods to conserve fuel the city is not doing too well on most indicators of the fuel conservation
6299726 a drastic overhaul of our public transport system and a major change in the citizens perception is the need of the hour to make fuel conservation a reality

6299738 in the next three months well have our own television channel we are going into both broadcasting and distribution
6299739 with the media and entertainment industry witnessing explosive growth we decided to create a new paradigm it had to be big and surprising in its innovation and thus the reliance big tv dth service was born
6299740 currently we are not charging the broadcasters any carriage fee but looking forward it could be one of the several revenue streams for reliance big tv
6299741 we will set up almost 10 000 hoardings and 80 000 signages within three days of the launch across the country
6299742 we have already bought 15 000 spots on television for the next three weeks

6299754 granted theyre not slumping too much and the site is still performing extremely well but it is down nonetheless i think digg slowly lost its appeal when it stopped becoming a tech savvy haven and tried to expand into areas that its tech influenced crowd didnt care about
6299755 yahoo buzz is taking the digg idea improving it by reducing the frequency of people gaming it and launching with a focus on all topics with its own main page to back it up
6299756 how can digg compete on any one of those levels when digg was firmly focused on tech and didnt try to improve algorithms to make upcoming stories last longer before they went popular or stop certain influencers from being too successful people found some value in using the site but now its nothing more than a placeholder of derivative stories and outrageous comment threads
6299757 not just any stories will end up getting buzzed but when they do they get posted to the front page of yahoo com
6299758 thats some pretty major exposure and the level of traffic driven by yahoo once something gets buzzed is exponentially higher than most other social news sites including digg
6299759 i think the potential that future submissions could appear on the front page of yahoo com is a valuable prospect
6299760 i think yahoos system is going to result in much better front page headlines its less about who you know and more about the actual content
6299761 the possibility of getting on the home page of yahoo is a strong selling point for buzz on the other hand theyre a bit late to the game to open it up to everyone i think for certain types of news it could do well but on topics like tech itll be tough
6299762 yahoo does amazing things like delicious and flickr but then they do other really lame things like yahoo

6299813 the figures included in cardiac catheterization in congenital heart disease reveal in a simple yet powerful way the basic strengths and characteristics of this long awaited textbook from charles mullins
6299814 the 35 chapters dedicated to this small highly specialized field with unique technical demands covers topics ranging from the optimal floor plan of a modern pediatric interventional catheterization laboratory to the energy requirements for radiofrequency perforation of an atretic valve to the precise method of handling guide wire positioning in the distal part of the circulation during balloon dilation and stent implantation a comprehensive detailed technical manual the chapter on transcatheter atrial septal defect occlusion arms the interventional cardiologist with detailed knowledge of all the available occluding devices and the particular tricks for using each of these devices and delivery systems in a full 50 pages of text similar attention is paid to techniques and tools for obtaining vascular access and for performing balloon dilations although some of the very specific information provided will become obsolete rather quickly points on the prioritization of balloon characteristics desirable for a particular intervention or the general principles of wire placement and device handling will always remain relevant as a technical manual this text is extremely successful this textbook will accomplish the authors goal of providing useful information to readers practicing at any level within the subspecialty field of pediatric interventional cardiology to trainees and those recently entering the practice who may have had extensive exposure to pediatric interventional techniques but limited hands on experience this text will serve to solidify many of the concepts and common techniques used in the pediatric interventional laboratory advanced operators will use it as a reference and a technical narrative of minute details to aid in the planning of particular cases or in the management of infrequently encountered situations as such it is an enormously useful and long awaited addition to the field of pediatric cardiology
6299815 cardiac catheterization in congenital heart disease is an outstanding textbook based on the experience and practice of the author during four decades of work in the catheterization laboratory at the baylor college of medicine texas childrens hospital and who has been an innovator and leader in the field of cardiac catheterization in congenital heart disease for those 40 years
6299816 cardiac catheterization in congenital heart disease pediatric and adult is an exceptional book it is without doubt the most authoritative the most comprehensive and the most detailed textbook about cardiac catheterization in congenital heart disease ever published each chapter is well referenced unlike most familiar texts of this magnitude dr mullins wrote every chapter and every word this is all his work any cardiologist seeking education or information about venous stenting need only study this one source it is obvious that with this book dr mullins gives each of us a gift in the preface he tells us that the information contained in this text represents the accumulation of knowledge techniques and procedures learned utilized and or developed by the author during the continued learning practice and teaching of cardiac catheterization procedures during four decades in the field

6299847 fallujah was declared a free fire zone in november 2004 and we told the civilian population that they had to leave because the entire city was going to be deemed hostile territory
6299848 some of them left they carried tvs or food and sat outside the city and waited for the firefight to be over so they could go home
6299849 we would just leave the dead iraqis in the streets and they piled up
6299850 it was disgusting we ended up sighting in our weapons on these dead bodies wed been trained to keep our weapons on point you always want your weapon to be sighted in so when we didnt have a target to shoot we sighted our weapons on dead people and dead animals that happened a lot at the tail end of operation phantom fury

6299853 okay marines you see an individual with a weapon what do you do
6299854 no shooting at a target putting rounds down range and suppressing a target is one thing sighting and killing a target is another so again you see an individual with a weapon what do you do
6299855 you see an individual with a pair of binoculars what do you do
6299856 you see an individual with a cell phone out what do you do
6299857 you see an individual who although may not be actually carrying anything or displaying any specific hostile action or intent running from say one building to another running across the street or even running away from you assume that he is maneuvering against you and kill him you see an individual with a white flag and he does anything but approach you slowly and obey commands assume its a trick and kill him
6299858 what i want to do is change the dynamics on the ground
6299859 and you have to do that by beginning not to back off the fallujahs and other places and send the wrong message to the terrorists

6299869 the presidency must also be stripped of the special dictatorial powers that mr musharraf seized for himself including the power to suspend civil liberties
