6540000 passing through customs is always interesting we say were in a band and cant say what kind of music we play and then its really unfortunate when they ask us our band name
6540001 we were very na ve and at that point not all music was made by musicians but artists rather one didnt need to know chords to express ideas with sound
6540002 a fan contacted us and said he wanted to make us a guitar this five feet long and weighs more than our whole band put together
6540003 its huge and heavy and involves mallets etcetera well we lugged it halfway around the world and used it its called a mood swinger
6540004 we were really most inspired by sonic youth and suicide and after our first record we toured with sonic youth it was a bit of a head trip
6540005 we wanted to pull back and make a record we could be more proud of
6540006 we heard from radiohead after our second album drums not dead
6540007 not a critic favorite but one we were proud of it was a complete surprise
6540008 were happy to go along of course the truckers didnt like converting their trucks from diesel to biofuel but its inspiring
6540009 radiohead makes up for others by caring about what they do while hauling things around the world and they make it easy for everyone catering for all the masses of crews and roadies
6540010 the rewards are in your head the reward is invisible its what you like to do
6540011 armed with outstanding management teams appropriate capital structures and their own currencies hsni ticketmaster interval and tree com are now ready for independent futures while the internet businesses that make up new iac can operate with a collective purpose and common goals
6540012 i think there is still potential for takeover from people
6540013 kathy spent quite a lot of time with her father
6540014 during the last six months of his life she was by his side which is more than i can say for cindy who was there once

6540026 you train your whole life and you want to win
6540027 if people want to assess the blame to me thats ok i mean i can take whatever it is that people are going to dish out
6540028 we had good chemistry the hand was back there she was there i dont know what happened
6540029 its an amazing thing to have an olympic medal but we had the game like we had it in our grasp and we let it slip away
6540030 the reality of it is japan was the better team tonight
6540031 as athletes its awfully tough to handle the disappointments but thats athletics like i told the girls tonight theres going to be other things in life thats more tragic than tonight
6540032 der schl ppi ist weg mein schl ppi ist weg
6540033 i think setting an artificial timetable for withdrawal is a significant mistake it is it sends mixed signals and bad signals to the region and to the iraqi citizens listen the iraqis are wondering whether or not were going to stay to help people in america wonder whether or not theyve got the political will to do the hard work
6540034 and if the congress wants to test my will as to whether or not ill accept the timetable for withdrawal i wont accept one i just dont think its in the interest of our troops i think it im just envisioning what it would be like to be a young soldier in the middle of iraq and realizing that politicians have all of a sudden made military determinations and in my judgment that would put a kid in harms way more so than he or she already is
6540035 the prime minister says what iraq and her people now need is time not a timetable they seek our patience not political posturing they require resolve not our retreat were going to succeed in iraq if given a chance liberty will succeed every time and liberty will help yield the peace we need
6540036 theres a temptation to let the politics at home get in the way with the considered judgment of the commanders thats why i strongly rejected an artificial timetable of withdrawal its kind of like an arbitrary thing you know we will decide in the halls of congress how to conduct our affairs in iraq based upon polls and politics and were going to impose this on people as opposed to listening to our commanders and our diplomats and listening to the iraqis for that matter
6540037 in the area of security cooperation the president and the prime minister agreed that improving conditions should allow for the agreements now under negotiation to include a general time horizon for meeting aspirational goals
6540038 well we have always said that the roles missions and size of the american forces here the coalition forces was based on the conditions on the ground and what is needed we have agreed that some goals some aspirational timetables for how that might unfold are well worth having in in such an agreement and i have to say if i could just make the point the reason we are where we are going talking about this kind of agreement is that the surge worked iraqi forces have demonstrated that they are strong and getting stronger
6540039 you are so fucking beautiful that looking at you makes me feel like our souls are dancing together in an ocean of love and chocolate mousse
6540040 it was just so awful to sit through that wretched rendition of blablablablabla something else pretentious
6540041 with house building hitting rock bottom this governments centralised housing targets are beginning to look like nothing more than a pipe dream
6540042 but unreachable targets will not help the thousands of families in unsuitable housing
6540043 this is yet another example of how divorced this government is from reality
6540044 it is clear that those who are rich and white will continue to be treated differently to those who are poor
6540045 he is now being placed under strict conditions on parole until completion of his sentence
6540046 barack obama is friends with ayers defending him as quote respectable and mainstream
6540047 obamas political career was launched in ayers home and the two served together on a left wing board why would barack obama be friends with someone who bombed the capitol and is proud of it do you know enough to elect barack obama
6540048 mr ayers is a 60 plus year old individual who lives in my neighborhood who did something that i deplore 40 years ago when i was 6 or 7 years old
6540049 by the time i met him he is a professor of education at the university of illinois we served on a board together that had republicans bankers lawyers focused on education
6540050 when the american public fully understands the close continuing relationship between their potential president and a remorseless domestic terrorist we believe it will send a chill down their spines
6540051 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
6540052 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
6540053 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
6540054 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
6540055 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state

6540059 heilig hen in uw waarheid uw woord is de waarheid
6540060 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
6540061 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
6540062 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
6540063 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
6540064 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
6540065 da entsteht ein neuer riese auf den rivalen schon achten m ssen
6540066 zudem ist vor allem continental in zukunftstr chtigen marktsegmenten wie sicherheitstechnik oder bei klimaschonenden antrieben bereits gut aufgestellt
6540067 strategisch ist es f r schaeffler jetzt mit continental m glich sich langfristig vom verbrennungsmotor zu l sen und in richtung elektronik zu gehen
6540068 und die bilanzstruktur wird durch den conti einstieg sicher sehr strapaziert
6540069 eine schlechte nachricht w re es wenn neben wennemer auch noch einer der beiden kronprinzen ginge weil er nicht chef wird
6540070 die konjunktur schw cht sich ab die preise f r benzin sind hoch und vor allem der us automarkt steckt in der krise bislang hat continental sich angesichts dieser probleme aber gut geschlagen
6540071 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
6540072 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
6540073 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
6540074 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
6540075 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
6540076 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
6540077 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
6540078 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
6540079 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
6540080 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
6540081 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
6540082 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
6540083 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
6540084 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
6540085 china might have a kfc right near the forbidden city but if youre looking for more exotic delectables olympic snack foods include fried scorpion goat lung soup starfish and cicadas over rice and starfish on a stick served up like corn dogs
6540086 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
6540087 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
6540088 now that my jee is over how should i propose nida
6540089 what who will you go to in delhi nida where will you live
6540090 what i am not funding you dont you think of it
6540091 ya i wont tell them anything about my going to delhi i will just leave a note that i will come back in a few days dont worry
6540092 wow and you expect them not to worry come on they are your parents they will no doubt worry for you
6540093 they wont coz they havent you just be ready with money and i will tell you later where to deliver it
6540094 wait take my cell no call me when u r in delhi
6540095 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
6540096 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
6540097 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
6540098 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
6540099 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
6540100 for the land to which you are coming to possess is not like the land of egypt out of which you came where you sowed your seed and which you watered by foot like a vegetable garden but the land to which you pass to possess is a land of mountains and valleys and absorbs water from the rains of heaven
6540101 a land the lord your god looks after the eyes of lord your god are always upon it
6540102 he will close off the heavens and there will be no rain
6540103 lot raised his eyes and saw the whole plain of the jordan that it was well watered everywhere before the lord destroyed sedom and gomorrah like the garden of the lord like the land of egypt bereshit 13 10
6540104 a land the lord your god looks after the eyes of lord your god are always upon it
6540105 its destroying our family for what amounts to a high school prank
6540106 yes he deserves punishment but he didnt do anything wrong that would make him deserve being on the sex offender registry
6540107 he knew what he was doing was mean but he had no clue of the legal ramifications
6540108 i keep thinking how many other high school kids are forwarding e mails or texting pictures that if prosecuted would nail them on the sex offender registry
6540109 i support getting tougher on sex offenders and as a former prosecutor i believe that the prosecutorial edict of seeking justice not merely convictions provides safeguards in the process of certain charges being appropriately matched to the underlying facts of a situation
6540110 five years ago i thought getting this punk mermaid in a clam shell plastered all over my chest and shoulders would make me look cool i cant believe i was that stupid
6540111 hey zhou this guy wants his tat to say something spiritual in chinese
6540112 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
6540113 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
6540114 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
6540115 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
6540116 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
6540117 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
6540118 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
6540119 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
6540120 here we go again people going to be talking shit when this shit hits the fan lol
6540121 the basic fact that you have a distinction between low property wealth districts and high property wealth districts ultimately that leads down the road to gaps in education performance
6540122 on dit quils ont le pouvoir de changer la vie
6540123 la guerre a tu cass d truit mais au village prot g es par les mots de mi e les familles sont saines et sauves
6540124 whoa whoa whoa pump the brakes back it up what did you just say
6540125 a question of fair air play can current remedies for media bias handle threats like sinclairs aborted anti kerry program
6540126 a broadcast licensee shall afford reasonable opportunity for discussion of conflicting views on matters of public importance
6540127 the single most important requirement of operation in the public interest the sine qua non for grant of a renewal of license
6540128 there is no sanctuary in the first amendment for unlimited private censorship operating in a medium not open to all
6540129 the supreme court unanimously found the fairness doctrine advances first amendment values it safeguards the publics right to be informed on issues affecting our democracy while also balancing broadcasters rights to the broadest possible editorial discretion
6540130 if one view received a lot of coverage in primetime
6540131 then at least some response time would have to be in primetime likewise if one side received many short spots or really long spots
6540132 the perception of broadcasters as community trustees should be replaced by a view of broadcasters as marketplace participants
6540133 weve got to look beyond the conventional wisdom that we must somehow regulate this box
6540134 we do not believe that language adopted in 1959 made the fairness doctrine a binding statutory obligation
6540135 the decision contravened 25 years of fcc holdings that the doctrine had been put into law in 1959
6540136 a struggle for nothing less than possession of the first amendment who gets to have and express opinions in america
6540137 since the demise of the fairness doctrine we have had much less coverage of issues
6540138 80 hours per week more than 4 000 hours per year programmed for republican and conservative talk shows without a single second programmed for a democratic or liberal perspective
6540139 political opinions expressed on talk radio are approaching the level of uniformity that would normally be achieved only in a totalitarian society there is nothing fair balanced or democratic about it
6540140 the fccs pro industry anti regulatory philosophy has effectively ended the right of access to broadcast television by any but the moneyed interests
6540141 media general and a coalition of major tv network owners nbc universal news corp and viacom made clear that they are seriously considering an attack on red lion as part of an industry challenge to an appellate court decision scrapping fcc media ownership deregulation earlier this year
6540142 whoever is in charge of government is going to determine what is fair under a so called fairness doctrine which wont be called that itll be called something else
6540143 so will web sites and bloggers have to give equal time or equal space on their web site to opposing views rather than letting the marketplace of ideas determine that
6540144 this election if it goes one way we could see a re imposition of the fairness doctrine
6540145 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
6540146 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
6540147 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
6540148 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
6540149 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
6540150 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
6540151 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
6540152 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
6540153 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
6540154 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
6540155 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
6540156 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
6540157 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
6540158 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
6540159 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
6540160 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
6540161 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
6540162 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
6540163 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
6540164 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
6540165 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
6540166 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
6540167 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
6540168 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
6540169 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
6540170 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
6540171 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
6540172 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
6540173 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
6540174 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
6540175 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
6540176 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
6540177 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
6540178 who are open to doing something on the production side
6540179 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
6540180 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
6540181 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
6540182 i said youre joking and she says no im serious my boss wants you to leave the fairgrounds and i said tell your boss to come down here and tell me that
6540183 they didnt have any they said its too graphic they said my wife is too graphic because shes paralyzed
6540184 first i apologize for the problems and inconvenience our booth has caused you second we removed mr harn from tonights schedule as a volunteer and we have vocalized this to him so should he come to the fair it will not be as a volunteer for madd
6540185 i lost my best friend last year in a car accident and i saw her in that vegetative state a week before she died and it was really offending i actually had to end up leaving work early because i couldnt handle it
6540186 to our detriment people with disabilities are still far too often treated as second class citizens shunned and segregated by physical barriers and social stereotypes and this is unconstitutional
6540187 an educated person is one who has learned that information almost always turns out to be at best incomplete and very often false misleading fictitious mendacious just dead wrong
6540188 a little revolution now and again is a good thing dont you think
6540189 an educated person is one who has learned that information almost always turns out to be at best incomplete and very often false misleading fictitious mendacious just dead wrong
6540190 die heute ausgezeichneten programmkinos und filmkunstverleiher leisten einen wichtigen beitrag dazu dass das kino seine wichtige gesellschaftliche funktion als kulturort weiter erf llen kann ich habe mich auch bei dem neuen entwurf des filmf rderungsgesetzes daf r eingesetzt dass die kulturellen aspekte der filmtheaterf rderung weiter gest rkt werden
6540191 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
6540192 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
6540193 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
6540194 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
6540195 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
6540196 yo seguir siendo el portero de la selecci n mexicana porque a m familia le gusta viajar
6540197 an educated person is one who has learned that information almost always turns out to be at best incomplete and very often false misleading fictitious mendacious just dead wrong
6540198 so no wonder obama wants to raise taxes on your income your electric bills even your life savings
6540199 29 pointed to mccain as the candidate running a negative campaign
6540200 41 of respondents said neither mccain nor obama is running a negative campaign
6540201 5 11 racist comments are not appropriate for a country that pretends to be the leader of the free world
6540202 nearly one third of voters see mccains campaign as negative while just 5 say the same of obama
6540203 obama will raise taxes for all except those in the bottom 3
6540204 these are exactly the kind of wild claims that that a dirty campaign runs
6540205 the celeb ad is the only negative ad that ive seen mccains people put out and its overshadowing anything else he has to say
6540206 mccain is mediocre graduating fifth from the bottom of his class too many americans are lazy about learning and fall for advertising instead of studying the issues
6540207 unless theres another republican candidate for president much of that rnc money is being directed towards mccains campaign quibble much
6540208 mccain is mediocre graduating fifth from the bottom of his class too many americans are lazy about learning and fall for advertising instead of studying the issues
6540209 also a graduate who for example is ranked 894 of 899 is sixth not fifth from the bottom
6540210 obama will raise taxes for all except those in the bottom 3
6540211 6 19 pm nice deflection your response is about oil money care to answer the original statement and defend those claims
6540212 sen obama got a little testy on this issue he said i was questioning his patriotism let me be clear i am not questioning his patriotism i am questioning his judgment
6540213 the bottom line is that sen obamas words for all their eloquence and passion dont mean all that much
6540214 your response is about oil money care to answer the original statement and defend those claims
6540215 do you agree mccain should distinguish between raising your taxes which implies for everybody and letting the bush tax cut expire for the top brackets
6540216 if someone wants to claim civility and nonpartisianship then one cannot make the argument that obamas lack of experience is a factor in anything the only way i will accept that argument as legitimate is by someone who stated george w bush lacked experience
6540217 so no wonder obama wants to raise taxes on your income your electric bills even your life savings
6540218 if someone wants to claim civility and nonpartisianship then one cannot make the argument that obamas lack of experience is a factor in anything
6540219 i dont want another 4 years of bush wake up
6540220 mccain has admitted he would not run again at age 76 he is a puppet and a joke at this point
6540221 his supposed expertise on national security seems to be built upon the notion that because he was a downed fighter pilot and pow he has more of a cogent foreign policy or national defense strategy than his opponent
6540222 they know the average american voter will cling to tradition and un change in a desperate attempt to allay his her own fear
6540223 you really can ask yourself if you have here the true democracy with soo much money involved in politics that you can buy political influence with money politics has corrupted itself and it will go down because of its inability to change
6540224 obamas lead bounces around between 3 and 7 all summer
6540225 it says a lot about the republican party that one of its chief criticisms of barack obama is that he thinks before he speaks
6540226 h e does really attempt to understand the points of view of other people who look at the world or a particular issue differently than he does hes much more intellectual much more thoughtful much more interested in discussion debate and dialogue than the typical politician and that gives me some confidence about him even though from my perspective hes much too liberal ive never voted for a democrat in my entire life hes the first one i might vote for
6540227 i need to have the security system checked again just to make sure there are no problems jacob has a friend that is in the security business and hes going to give me a deal on some extra cameras

6540343 similarly the sharp divisions between republicans and democrats that previously existed on this issue have disappeared
6540344 i just wanted to say thank you for serving our country
6540345 i know you share with me a deep love for america and an awesome pride in those who defend her when i meet with our troops they always inspire me with their sense of duty and honor they are americas finest citizens
6540346 the harsh reality is that in the years since 2001 more than 99 000 americans have been murdered and more than eight million have been the victims of violent crime
6540347 the united states needs a strategic plan that embraces the reality that protecting our communities depends on our ability to fight both crime and terrorism
6540348 this fractured approach has sewn confusion among public safety agencies
6540349 we need to realize that fighting crime and fighting terrorism goes hand in hand

6540352 maam let me say that i dont disagree with anything you said and thank you and i am grateful for your support of all of our veterans
6540353 he just locks down and cant get the words out
6540354 for such a fine speaker its really quite remarkable that hes had issues
6540355 the important thing to watch is what happens in the polls after the conventions
6540356 because they have a lot to do with what happens in the polls after the conventions and that in turn could affect what happens at the polls in november
6540357 for instance this year barack obama looks like hes ahead on average by two or three percentage points but if you think about the kind of year this is very low levels of presidential approval high levels of dissatisfaction with the direction of the country you would expect him to be doing better than that so in this case the convention should provide a sort of corrective if it follows the predictable pattern it should give him a pretty substantial bump and bring him more in line with where his poll standing should be if the election were to turn out about the way one might expect it to
6540358 yesterday john mccain said the economy was fundamentally strong this puzzled me
6540359 ill have to check with my staff true quote im not sure ill have to check with my staff so he asked his staff and they said at least four at least four now think about that i guess if you think being rich is you have to make 5 million a year and you have to think about how many houses you have then you might think the economy is fundamentally strong
6540360 but if youre like me and youve got one house or you are like the millions of people who are struggling to keep up with their mortgage so they dont lose their home you might have a different perspective and by the way the answer is john mccain has seven homes
6540361 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
6540362 does a guy who worries about the price of arugula and thinks regular people
6540363 assuredly i say to you that it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven and again i say to you it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of god
6540364 assuredly i say to you that it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven and again i say to you it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of god so what are you kiddin me about this obama moron talk about an utter bs machine mccains the only guy with substance guys clue up
6540365 the perceived gaffe gave the obama campaign an opening to harp on the arizona senator for his wealth
6540366 i know this is going to be used out of context but how about

6540381 the relationship between the ambitious obama and the unrepentant ayers is a subject that excites republicans who havent really thwacked that pinata as hard as they might
6540382 it really irritates obama and his political champion chicagos sovereign lord mayor richard m daley
6540383 its really unfortunate theyre friends so what people do make mistakes in the past you move on this is a new century a new time he reflects back and hes been making a strong contribution to our community
6540384 it does not speak well of the kind of candidate he would be in the fall against sen

6540679 what this course helps them do is look at their decisions is this a wise decision for me should i be going out with this person should i trust this person to hold my drink while i go to the bathroom
6540680 it definitely made me think a lot of what you looked like when you were drinking
6540681 when i had a hold of them i realized i was grabbing them forcefully and really knocking them on the ground with head butts and kicks and really trying to beat the crap out of them
6540682 when i say pseudo we arent going to jump them out on the a very controlled environment
6540683 while i was there i found a deep passion for research and for working in higher education
6540684 to be around students who look like you and who are ambitious and who set these tremendous goals was encouraging and empowering
6540685 american higher education is multitiered and so are black colleges
6540686 some small schools are challenged just as small colleges are across the board
6540687 morehouse spelman hampton among others are stronger than they have ever been
6540688 15 prozent am wahltag w re f r die sozis noch zu viel
6540689 if at first you dont succeed call it version 1 0
6540690 the biggest challenge is making a limited amount of funds go in a million different new ways
6540691 a parent with two children in college is going to be taking out more loans than a parent with one child because there are two of them
6540692 you cant ask for more than to be taken seriously as a researcher if thats what you want to do
6540693 i wont be paying back student loans for the rest of my life
6540694 to nominate up to 10 colleges that are making improvements in academics faculty students campus life diversity and facilities these schools are worth watching because they are making promising and innovative changes
6540695 we know a lot about colleges and we play a key gatekeeper role in the college admissions process
6540696 brown was great despite it being a rainy cold day
6540697 the admissions officer was so passionate i was ready to sign up then
6540698 despite health problems that forced him to miss a lot of school over the years joey worked hard in senior year boosting his fall grades above 3 0 while he was conditioning for spring baseball his passion and applying to colleges he got into cincinnati but starts at indiana this fall
6540699 youd find them after graduation as chief technology officers but not as ceos
6540700 i just went up to my professor and said i wanted to do biomedical research
6540701 lots of people admission counselors deans students parents of students
6540702 a lot of art schools dont stress the intellectual component and i am looking for a school that has both
6540703 so i said you must like science she said no then i said do you like to read a lot and again she said no she had just been telling me what her parents had always told her
6540704 it was close to home but far enough away that i could become my own person
6540705 they come here and they discover poetry they discover art they discover china
6540706 whenever im not teaching a class or in a meeting
6540707 it would be a lot easier if there was a magic formula
6540708 who is this person and why would we want him or her to join this community
6540709 we no longer are just looking to pick up students
6540710 if youre not in the ballpark extracurriculars arent going to get you in
6540711 students ask us is it better to get an a in a regular class or a b in an ap class
6540712 well its better to get an a in an ap class but we are looking for students who have challenged themselves
6540713 oftentimes i find myself trying to talk students off the ap ledge
6540714 i see students who are doing all they can to keep up with the work and dont have time to keep up with the learning were not counting aps has this student taken a rigorous curriculum has it prepared them its that engagement thats central
6540715 students feel i need to find that exotic thing that sells
6540716 doesnt have to be a week in africa it can be you were a clerk at safeway for the summer and that changed the way you view race relations or the environment
6540717 turning points in their lives are kind of premature for kids of this age
6540718 a student travels in a few swift paragraphs from one perspective to another and has seen the deeper meaning learned the lesson or found the humor
6540719 our office is grieving and in shock and sad so its a tough time for us all our prayers and best wishes go to their families
6540720 he hasnt had a chance to grieve and now hes looking at an aggravated murder charge
6540721 if you like the ocean theres no better place to be than ucsd
6540722 i guess that is one of the awesome aspects of having a small major you know everyone
6540723 its not the school that limits what you can do here
6540724 its all about you making the most of the time you have here
6540725 im an artist too i dont want a strict math and science curriculum
6540726 youve got to boil it down to your most basic needs what do you want to get out of your education
6540727 as soon as they learn to take a blood pressure theyre out there doing screening
6540728 the faculty and students greeted me even though mom was there it was all about me
6540729 conspiracy day here on the retort i know exactly what the conspiracy theorists will say
6540730 number of skyscrapers that have fallen ever except for the ones in the wtc comlex due to fire 0
6540731 scientists with the national institute of standards and technology say their three year investigation of the collapse of the 47 story world trade center 7 was the first known instance of fire causing the total failure of a skyscraper
6540732 investigators also concluded there was no evidence that the collapse was caused by fires from a substantial amount of diesel fuel that was stored in the building
6540733 make real for me all the stuff i learned in class
6540734 i wanted an environment where i could focus and grow scholastically
6540735 students have a keen role in making it what they want
6540736 canada condemns in the strongest terms the cowardly attacks perpetrated this morning in algeria including one against a bus transporting algerian employees of a major canadian company in which 12 algerians were killed
6540737 on behalf of all canadians i offer my condolences to the families of the victims and wish a speedy recovery to those injured
6540738 there is no justification for these vicious attacks they are the desperate acts of those who wish to undermine algerias stability by killing innocent civilians canada will continue to support president abdelaziz bouteflikas efforts to bring back peace and prosperity in algeria
6540739 the goal is to find that ideal fit that great institution that is best for each individual
6540740 notes friedhoff but the average admission rate at u s colleges and universities stands at 70 percent and the numbers for many schools speak for themselves allegheny accepted about 57 percent of its applicants in 2007 purdue university nearly 79 percent and evergreen all but 3 percent
6540741 it doesnt hold you back to go to a college that is lesser known
6540742 in fact it can be just the opposite it can be the thing that will assist you dramatically there are opportunities for b students to shine and be the top of their class
6540743 we will enroll 7 000 freshmen so i dont have to worry about having trombones for the marching band because we will get them
6540744 but my colleagues at kalamazoo college in kalamazoo mich need to make sure they have tenors for the school choir
6540745 even if you only save 1 percent on a 5 500 loan that saves you 55
6540746 theres the rub something that you say when you are explaining what the difficulty is in a particular situation
6540747 i used to study half an hour for a test in high school
6540748 omigosh you have to study at least two hours for a test in college
6540749 i would think back to what color i wrote the fact in and be able to remember it
6540750 seeing the professor write something on the board or show a diagram that helps me recall it easily
6540751 tell them to look up tell them to remember the stars
6540752 mts has made an agreement with apple on the sale of iphones
6540753 the news is positive as mts is promoting 3g networks and this is a toy for advanced users who will become the main consumers of the services which the company is going to offer within these networks
6540754 in order for a copyright owner to proceed under the dmca with a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner its agent or the law the owner must evaluate whether the material makes fair use of the copyright
6540755 notorious for his efforts to control all uses of his material on and off the internet
6540756 the dmca already requires copyright owners to make an initial review of the potentially infringing material prior to sending a takedown notice
6540757 a consideration of the applicability of the fair use doctrine simply is part of that initial review
6540758 efficiency of the internet will continue to improve and that the variety and quality of services on the internet will expand
6540759 someone tells you over the phone they have one child
6540760 and then you walk into the house and see three pairs of shoes in different sizes
6540761 people greet me on the streets i know their children and families even family members dont visit them as often as i do
6540762 growth is likely to slow going forward because of the close link to the economies that share the euro as a currency but it wont collapse like it did in the u k
6540763 we would need to end the riskier loan agreements and tighten our credit requirements but because of the direct contact with customers we can see changes in their situation very quickly
6540764 i am your nightmare i am the shape in the dark
6540765 a range of 10 to 20 minutes seems likely for the tiny fraction of the most disproportionate bandwidth users
6540766 if they continue to a disproportionate user after they get de prioritized the technique will come back on again but if they change their consumption behavior there wont be any impact
6540767 as a result of those collaborations we became aware of the fact that some of these new technologies would enable us
6540768 our goal is to get to this technique before the end of the year and im sure well have more to say about it soon
6540769 virtually no one is going to be impacted by this test
6540770 it is only a tiny tiny segment that would be the heaviest users we havent heard any complaints from anyone they havent noticed any difference
6540771 comcast has shown itself to be dishonest so we have to be skeptical and vigilant
6540772 the fcc has required them to disclose all the details so we look forward to seeing that before we can fully evaluate any move that doesnt involve illegally blocking consumers access to the internet is a positive step but we wont know for sure about this particular practice until we see the details
6540773 im endorsing tracey brooks for congress in new yorks 21st district because she knows its time to end the war in iraq and invest that money here at home
6540774 tracey brings hands on community experience to congress and will be a strong voice for families on guaranteeing health care for all protecting a womans right to choose fighting for pay equity gun safety measures and getting our economy back on track
6540775 i am honored to have the endorsement and support of geraldine ferraro
6540776 our campaign is growing stronger every day as i speak directly to the voters on issues important to them like ending the war in iraq providing affordable health care for all standing up for a womans right to choose and addressing skyrocketing gas prices
6540777 its a lot of competition and the last couple of years ive had more and more students wait listed than in the past
6540778 the good news is that the acceptance rate for all four year colleges has remained in the 68 to 70 percent range since the mid 1980s and more than 80 percent of these colleges say yes to more than half their applicants
6540779 theyre going in state and saving their money for graduate school
6540780 but just because you have a learning disability doesnt mean you are not as smart or you cant excel or do what you want to in your education it just means you learn differently
6540781 has allowed me to study better for tests not to be nervous to speak out in class and to genuinely know that i can go as far in the academic setting as those around me
6540782 the increase isnt a reflection of more students who have ld but more who have been diagnosed and are willing to come forward and ask for help
6540783 there are an increasing number of people who are ready for college because the high schools are recognizing and preparing the students rather than just assuming theyre not smart enough
6540784 take the act early on and then compare it to the psat
6540785 if youre dividing your energy between tests its likely to leave you divided and conquered
6540786 a lot of schools consider the act comparable to the sat but the only way they can accept it as a replacement is if students take the act with writing
6540787 feel more confident like i had a good understanding of what was going to be on the test
6540788 prep classes are only as good as the effort a student is willing to put into them
6540789 go to class every day take notes work with a study buddy and get help early when you need wait
6540790 cramming is less effective it puts your grades in peril throws your schedule out of whack and makes you bad company submit
6540791 how can i come to your house and shave your head while you sleep
6540792 a r ssia informou nos atrav s de canais militares que tomou a decis o de parar a sua coopera o em eventos militares
6540793 posso apenas dizer que a r ssia n o precisa mais da coopera o da nato do que a nato precisa da r ssia
6540794 n o pretendemos fechar a porta mas tudo vai depender das prioridades
6540795 se as suas prioridades passarem por um apoio incondicional ao regime falhado do presidente georgiano saakachvili e se o pre o que eles est o dispostos a pagar a ruptura das rela es com a r ssia ent o essa n o ser uma escolha nossa
6540796 contrariamente ao que se previa h pouco mais de seis meses j pouca gente acredita que o eng jos s crates consiga renovar a maioria absoluta
6540797 unc had the lowest tuition rate and they offered me a scholarship
6540798 contrariamente ao que se previa h pouco mais de seis meses j pouca gente acredita que o eng jos s crates consiga renovar a maioria absoluta
6540799 oil is the driver and then it depends on a series of other factors that are kind of like magnifiers
6540800 all three reports tend to indicate that were bottoming out but that there is no real end in sight and thats what i think the market has to get used to
6540801 i said what the heck is that and there was an alligator floating by
6540802 i took my flashlight and was like youve got to be kidding me a big old alligator swimming around here
6540803 this storm is going to be with us for a while
6540804 it needs to come and get gone so we can get back to what we were doing
6540805 im ready to get back to work this is insane itll drive you nuts being stuck like this
6540806 we very much believe in the preparation of elon students as global citizens
6540807 for this past year we were looking for 225 students for our incoming class and we received over 4 000 applications
6540808 what i say to parents is do you want to ensure that when your student graduates he or she doesnt have to come home
6540809 people are finally realizing that this russian situation has the potential to be bad for a very long time
6540810 the russians have shown evidence that theyre willing to cut off energy supplies to advance their aims there is concern that they are now going to be much more assertive in that area
6540811 if military activity heats up again pipeline flows into europe could be disrupted and that would affect the united states as well
6540812 this is probably about it in terms of a retail gas drop we may be a few cents away from the august bottom
6540813 the slide in the dollar has taken some of the wind out of the bears sail in the energy complex
6540814 terrified of allowing western countries to build any kind of cushion for the unexpected because it has the potential to return prices to normal or sustainable economic levels
6540815 music companies are selling over 90 percent of their music drm free what benefits do they get from selling the remaining small percentage of their music encumbered with a drm system there appear to be none
6540816 but i figured you have to know how a consumer thinks to market to them
6540817 freedom of conscience is not to be surrendered upon issuance of a medical degree
6540818 researchers at unc and in china studied more than 750 chinese men and women aged between 40 and 59 in three rural villages in north and south china the majority of study participants prepared their meals at home without commercially processed foods about 82 percent of the participants used msg in their food those users were divided into three groups based on the amount of msg they used the third who used the most msg were nearly three times more likely to be overweight than non users
6540819 we found that prevalence of overweight was significantly higher in msg users than in non users
6540820 we saw this risk even when we controlled for physical activity total calorie intake and other possible explanations for the difference in body mass the positive associations between msg intake and overweight were consistent with data from animal studies
6540821 well that is all very nice but i dont eat chinese food and i avoid foods with msg on the label
6540822 quand on voit un mec qui arrive avec son gamin les filles a les attire

6540824 i consider fear and loathing in las vegas to be comfort reading i like the al pastor tacos at tacos mexico and i count among my literary influences the chainsaw from doom
6540825 you have the dollar down over 1 today and that is a pretty meaningful move for the dollar
6540826 running back to gold running back to oil so it seems we are seeing some of the running back to safe haven
6540827 the risk factors are back on the rise with the latest fears about fannie mae and freddie mac and that seems to have captured the imagination of the market
6540828 if the dollar does fall off a lot of these guys foreign investors are able to consume more and buy more on a pure dollar per dollar basis
6540829 when you consider that russia is a major exporter of oil outside of opec and is a major supplier of oil the threat of a supply disruption
6540830 the speculation is that we are drawing closer to the actual realization of any production being pulled offline in russia
6540831 the reason why gas supplies are so tight is because refineries are not making any demand is not there
6540832 we are going up for the same reasons we went to the highs concerns about the dollar the economy the feds ability to raise interest rates
6540833 if we close above 120 then the next big number everyone will be talking about would be the 125 130 area
6540834 therefore i remind you to keep ablaze the gift of god that is in you through the laying on of my hands for god has not given us a spirit of fearfulness but one of power love and sound judgment
6540835 when we think they might be dying out or merely surviving they are actually thriving
6540836 they are moving into new states and settling or establishing new settlements in communities where local officials arent acquainted with them that creates some misunderstanding on zoning issues or other unique factors in amish practice
6540837 as they live their lives they really do not become very involved with government
6540838 one family doesnt go there is a group of them that goes like two or three or four
6540839 they can continue to let people know were here come visit us how the land is the orchards do great or whatever
6540840 an amish woman said we joke among ourselves if we keep growing at this rate soon half the world will be amish and the other half will be taxi drivers
6540841 first of all you should know this no prophecy of scripture comes from ones own interpretation because no prophecy ever came by the will of man instead moved by the holy spirit men spoke from god
6540842 because no prophecy ever came by the will of man
6540843 instead moved by the holy spirit men spoke from god
6540844 plante amor e paz e a vida lhe trar colheita de paz e amor

6540850 quando nel corso degli umani eventi si rende necessario ad un popolo sciogliere i vincoli politici che lo avevano legato ad un altro ed assumere tra le altre potenze della terra quel posto distinto ed eguale cui ha diritto per legge naturale e divina
6540851 sometimes the pressure of a big name school or one that has a reputation becomes more important than the needs of the child
6540852 the counselor is their lifeline for what they need to do to get to college
6540853 we very much believe in the preparation of elon students as global citizens
6540854 while companies have an important role to play we also believe the us government has the most significant leverage through diplomatic avenues on global issues of human rights
6540855 trade is one of many tools the government has in its toolbox to help effect change on these important international issues
6540856 ideas and intellectual content those are some of our greatest industries and we allow china to sell all sorts of things over here
6540857 a case primarily focused on chinas content review would be extremely unlikely to succeed at the wto as a general matter ustr looks very closely at the merits of any potential wto case and is extremely resistant to moving forward without a strong legal basis
6540858 attempts to address other kinds of political issues would put additional strain on the wto at a time when its legitimacy has been weakened by the collapse of the doha round and could threaten to undermine its ability to enforce trade rules
6540859 the desire to rule is the mother of all heresy
6540860 it would seem that the creation of microsoft was largely supported not least financially by nsa and that ibm was made to accept the microsoft ms dos operating system by the same administration
6540861 strong suspicion of a lack of security fed by insistent rumours about the existence of spy programmes on microsoft and by the presence of nsa personnel in bill gates development teams
6540862 orders of magnitude easier for the us government to access your computer

6540865 is breaking its own laws those of other countries and international law the absence of court issued warrants permitting surveillance of specific individuals is but one example
6540866 the same agencies also eavesdropped on japanese representatives during negotiations with the u s in 1995 over auto parts trade
6540867 the issue is whether the president can unilaterally conduct secret surveillance taking into his hands the awesome power to invade privacy
6540868 the right of people to be secure in their persons houses papers and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures shall not be violated and no warrants shall issue but upon probably cause supported by oath or affirmation and particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized
6540869 something like this technology could be embedded in tables and work surfaces
6540870 so as soon as you put down an appropriately equipped device it would immediately begin drawing power
6540871 youd just drop your espresso maker down on them and you would never have to plug it in
6540872 from intels position that seems like the thing to shoot for right now
6540873 it could be that cellphones and pdas are even more compelling but i think we are going to start with the laptop its easy to dial down from laptops
6540874 adobe is aware of the malware posing as its flash player and on monday warned users to ignore any updates that didnt originate on its own servers
6540875 do not download flash player from a site other than adobe com
6540876 this goes for any piece of software reader windows media player quicktime etc if you get a notice to update its not a bad idea to go directly to the site of the software vendor and download the update directly from the source if the download is from an unfamiliar url or an ip address you should be suspicious
6540877 we do not have any data or information about how long the effect lasts
6540878 the latest cellulite treatments sound too smooth to be true
6540879 theres nothing that has been shown in any objective way to create improvement for cellulite
6540880 a statement which one would naturally associate with a period of church history considerably later than pentecost
6540881 confirming his word by means of signs that attended it
6540882 that same working should be active in the lives of believers today for we have the same spirit the same power the same anointing that the disciples would have had biblical leadership taps into the working and anointing of the holy spirit that lives in them
6540883 they supposedly fixed the problem which the pilot later said was with the air conditioning and then we took off
6540884 the plane was wobbling from one side to another then i began to suspect we would crash i dont know what happened next i was in a sort of river and saw people smoke explosions which i think woke me up
6540885 we cant afford to give john mccain the chance to serve out george bushs third term
6540886 the john mccain of 2000 wouldnt even consider voting for the john mccain of 2008
6540887 the price he paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
6540888 and now he embraces the failed bush policies over the last eight years politics that helped break washington in the first place and that doesnt exactly meet my definition of a maverick
6540889 i dont think the obama campaign has done a particularly good job of linking mccain to george bush
6540890 i think obama has not delivered the message with the degree of focus and repetition he needs to be successful in a presidential campaign
6540891 the conversation lately hasnt been about bush and the state of the country its been more about obama
6540892 mccain is seen as a different kind of republican hes not seen as politically like bush when we ask people to rate the ideology of the candidates bush is way off to the right and mccain is sort of in the middle so he can be seen as an agent of change too
6540893 weve constantly got to pay attention to the need to excite our base
6540894 at the start of the election cycle the republican party was pretty dispirited after the 2006 election and in many cases that remains true today
6540895 all campaigns have to have a clear strategy theme and message and this is a pretty strong one i think theyll keep hammering at it
6540896 if my dad knew what i was up to hed crucify me
6540897 rock voyager have arranged a special fan package for the upcoming tour dates below including a meet and greet with all the bands please note that the offer is limited to 15 people per show
6540898 i guess if you think that being rich means youve got to make 5 million and if you dont know how many houses you have then its not surprising that you might think the economy was fundamentally strong
6540899 gene upshaw did everything with great dignity pride and conviction
6540900 he was the rare individual who earned his place in the pro football hall of fame both for his accomplishments on the field and for his leadership of the players off the field he fought hard for the players and always kept his focus on what was best for the game his leadership played a crucial role in taking the nfl and its players to new heights
6540901 we are deeply saddened and shocked by the sudden and unexpected death of our leader gene upshaw
6540902 gene learned he was sick this past sunday and he died with his family by his side
6540903 few people in the history of the nfl have played the game as well as gene and then had another career in football with so much positive impact on the structure and competitiveness of the entire league as gene
6540904 in both careers if you hit him in the head he could hit you back twice as hard but he didnt always do so he was very tough and also a good listener he never lost sight of the interests of the game and the big picture
6540905 he was a giant in the nfl since entering the league in 1967 first as a hall of fame offensive lineman then as an active member of the collective bargaining process in the late 1970s and early 1980s and finally as executive director of the nflpa
6540906 gene continually served in the best interests of the game of football he played a colossal role in the success the nfl enjoys today even more than many people realize
6540907 to halt international military cooperation events between russia and nato countries until further instructions
6540908 for all practical purposes military to military cooperation had really already been ended with the russians
6540909 i cant imagine a circumstance right now that we would engage in military cooperation with the russians until the situation in georgia is resolved
6540910 we still have some very important issues that we need to work with russia on
6540911 its a whole series of things that are not very important theyve got important sounding titles but reality of that nato russia council is they look for things to talk about
6540912 theres plenty of agenda items but theres not much substance in them
6540913 i didnt bring your breakfast because you didnt eat your din din
6540914 i had baby jane on my list of roles that i wanted to play someday and a friend pushed me to do it now so we did
6540915 its irritating when you have a man who does it better than you do he absolutely is the right person for the part
6540916 thats exactly why i didnt want to do that part
6540917 it was virtuosic on every front but i was tracking how they did it not the story
6540918 youre sending it up and loving it at the same time
6540919 thats a good question i never thought of doing it without craig
6540920 everybody has interpreted the shrinking population of working age people as a mass exodus by young people out of vermont but thats really a very small part of the story
6540921 the biggest part of the story is that people just arent being born
6540922 this low birthrate is a component of a much bigger problem
6540923 employers cite adequacy of the work force as one major concern for future success here
6540924 we have employers who have created good jobs and want to create more but they need a qualified work force to take those jobs
6540925 i want to go home the russian troops are here

6540927 ive been searchin all day for the exs42 and other studio instruments where they do i find them and open them up so i can put samples in it

6540932 the vets who had a look at him were really surprised at how fast hed gone downhill
6540933 hes having difficulties breathing and his flippers were at an unnatural angle
6540934 their advice to us was hes not going to last much longer hes suffering and you should take action
6540935 theyll need to locate it first and the poor little guy could have passed away in the night
6540936 once they figure out whats happened theyll take it from there
6540937 its a really tragic result from an operation that people worked really really hard for
6540938 theres no way that the logistics of feeding that animal by hand or in an aquarium is going to work
6540939 there are too many difficulties with it and the animal first of all has to be convinced to eat out of a tube its got to get to an aquarium and then youve got to find a product for it to eat which you can supply for probably a year
6540940 so i think for humans to try and keep it alive is just going to end up as a disaster
6540941 get it into the vicinity of the other cow and calf and hopefully the cow would take on two calves which would be pretty unusual
6540942 there were four cookie cutter shark bites in it and that has most likely occurred while it was out in the open water its just another thing that compounds the whole problem
6540943 even if they are able to entice the calf out into open water it would face a higher predation pressure from sharks
6540944 our hearts are breaking with whats happening with baby colin
6540945 the key here is hes weakening hes losing the strength to get him fed and to a pod that will care for him

6540964 indeed russia and the u s were allies during the two tragic conflicts of the second and the first world wars which allows us to think theres something objectively bringing us together in difficult times and i think i believe it has to do with geopolitical interests and also has a moral component the ability to compromise is not a diplomatic politeness toward a partner but rather taking into account and respecting your partners legitimate interests
6540965 we were thinking about each others interests and at the same time about the interests of the country in question the problems the issues we were trying to address based on such an approach in the end we resolved the issue to a large extent at the same time where we fail to be guided by those basic principles where we push forward some economic or political self interest we fail to arrive at solutions that would realistically address the issue where we try to take into account each others interest we achieve lasting results
6540966 the bloc system of relations must be replaced by an altogether different system based on common rules that are called international law and those rules should be strictly abided by at the end of the day only this may ensure stability and respect for the interest of small nations and not just large ones and superpowers like the united states
6540967 presumptive democratic presidential nominee barack obamas campaign has admitted that he has misled the public since 2004 on a hot button social issue but

6540970 most such cases involve an abortion procedure in which labor is induced prematurely the infants are expected to be killed by their own mothers contractions but a few survive the birthing process the lungs of the survivors usually are not mature enough to sustain life so the babies need immediate medical intervention many illinois hospitals however decline to provide the lifesaving care
6540971 obama opposed it because it would have defined a baby that survived an abortion procedure as a person
6540972 if my people which are called by my name shall humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from wicked ways then will i hear from heaven and will forgive

6540977 because of this trend hotspot operators are turning to other methods to generate revenues

6541040 i had a very good feeling with my horse all week but in the second round today i was a bit worried when i came in because the water at the liverpool was leaking and what came back to me was that night in athens when the gate fell down and then after it was put up again and i rode down to it again it fell down once more
6541041 i knew eric was coming behind me and he has a very fast horse so i have to try but my horse got too strong on the last run and couldnt steady for the jump im super satisfied with ninja he is not so big but he is very brave and he never thinks about not jumping if i steer him at something he always tries to jump it and clear it in everything he is a very sweet horse and i really enjoy every minute of riding him but we had a great winner today
6541042 he basically is a really really careful horse i have all the confidence in the world in him
6541043 you cant come back in a sport if you dont have the support of your friends your family and people who wanted it for me they made it impossible for me not to try
6541044 but he is a light horse and it was easy for him to get back into his work in florida early this year he was still a bit bothered but now he is feeling really good
6541045 and all three horses of the riders on the podium were dutch breds all three quite small but light and full of energy

6541275 before you spent more time getting there and more time in the ice wed have helicopters looking for breaks in the water for us
6541276 we have to ask ourselves whether were prepared for these ships coming to our shores
6541277 when everything goes wrong fall time storms tragic loss of vessels lost people on land theres nothing thats ever been so far away than the coast guard
6541278 its affecting our hunting practices in more ways than one

6541290 i wanted to bring something raw some of that reality stuff
6541291 its just us in a big rv picking up talent and just surprising them with something wild they really dont know who theyre fucking theres no script and everything is done on the fly
6541292 they had no idea that they were going to be having sex with the same guy or even having sex in front of each other
6541293 it was really spicy because they havent done it before so it was obviously not staged and you can see all the giddiness in them
6541294 because ive already established a 12 year relationship with the strip club industry and everybody knows me in the adult industry it wasnt a difficult task for me
6541295 i found actors that really wanted to work with each other and let them do it however they wanted to do
6541296 it was working because it wasnt contrived it wasnt stop start sex that everybody is having i was getting such great hot sex because these people were acting like they were at home
6541297 im very much an exhibitionist i didnt do adult movies for the money i just liked being naked
6541298 i wanted to have a part in the movie but i wasnt quite sure if i wanted to do the full gamut of directing having sex and having a big part because i feel that your movie suffers if you do that i have never closed the door to sex on camera its just that the role wasnt quite right to do it
6541299 im not somebody that says that im never going to spread my legs for the camera because thats just ludicrous
6541300 i played so bad at the pga i wanted to get that out of my system and just play golf today and i did
6541301 i was looking forward to this week and today its a great venue great golf course and im looking forward to the next couple of days
6541302 it was a pretty tough week but you learn from your mistakes
6541303 it wasnt an easy week and the golf course was hard too so it was double hard its just something i made a mistake and learn from it and try to move on from it i talked to the right people and clarified everything and got everything out in the open with them
6541304 i didnt play well enough to make the team on points so i have to go another way
6541305 i dont know exactly what hes thinking with the picks but i think hes going to pick the best players he can and it was a good move having the picks a little bit later and see what guys are playing well and build a little momentum from the fedexcup and roll into the ryder cup
6541306 well see i would love to be a pick but got to earn it too i am looking forward to that challenge and the opportunity the next couple of weeks
6541307 youre just trying to get into the round and kind of build some momentum on your side
6541308 i hit two really good shots i hit it and i hit it exactly the way i wanted to and it went in that rarely happens i was surprised and excited
6541309 everything kind of slopes right to left and everything is pushing left and the hole goes right and its a little uncomfortable but it is tough and to finish that way was great

6541324 the unprecedented importation of old computers into africa from developed countries to satisfy information technology need has resulted in electronic waste that adds to environmental pollution
6541325 i appeal on developed countries not to use africa as a dumping site for computers
6541326 this is the situation in most african cities where computer villages for selling old imported computers especially laptops are springing up
6541327 a lot of used cars imported mostly from europe ply the streets of accra emitting high levels of smoke

6541354 i usually stay up until probably about five or six in the morning
6541355 i just got a text message from my teenaged daughter asking for help on her computer
6541356 there are a number of issues pertaining to children and teenagers that we just didnt think of years ago we used to think of these types of disorders as pertaining to the elderly but they dont
6541357 part of the problem is the technological invasion of the bedroom with computers cell phones and music there are teens who text message or listen to music all night compounded by early school hours parents should optimize sleep quality for their family with regular sleep and wake times and bedrooms should be kept quiet dark and conducive to sleep
6541358 they know i dont get enough sleep and they say i should they say i should just turn everything off and sit in the dark and i hate doing that i dont really want to

6541361 witnesses feared a massive heart attack after he slumped on to the wheel of his hire car
6541362 they initially reported his condition as unknown prompting fears of serious cardiac problems up to and including a massive heart attack but he has now been discharged
6541363 oh we already hired someone but we wanted to hear what you had to say because we thought he sounded knowledgeable
6541364 freedom of conscience is not to be surrendered upon issuance of a medical degree
6541365 you can support us or leave to our fate but if they come for us and all hope is gone we will turn the middle east into a radioactive wasteland until the end of time
6541366 they can say whatever they want to say but theyre not being truthful
6541367 i stand up for soldiers im sure the word got out that id encouraged soldiers to speak
6541368 i know for a fact that he saved a couple of soldiers lives chuck was there for them and helped them get through a rough time
6541369 perch una 50 chilometri non una semplice gara ma una storia nessunaltra gara cos lunga e in quelle quasi quattro ore pu succedere di tutto lallenamento ti dice cosa vali quali sono i tuoi limiti e quanto sei capace di sacrificarti vai alla linea di partenza con in testa un copione poi succede qualcosa che te lo cambia liniziativa di un avversario il coraggio o la follia di un altro qualcosa che nel tuo motore si inceppa o nella tua anima e tu devi valutare rispondere resistere ragionare e qualche volta fai bene a seguire il tuo istinto
6541370 sono qui per questo il resto non mi interessa anche se so che non sar facile
6541371 no semmai mi lusinga significa che qualche cosa ho gi combinato daltra parte sono lunico cinquantista al mondo che nelle ultime due stagioni ha marciato due volte sotto le 3h38 comunque essere il favorito conta poco ogni gara fa storia a s sono importanti solo le gambe se dopo 40 chilometri non ne hai pi la gara finita non c possibilit di bluffare
6541372 io vorrei andare al mio ritmo senza concedere molto agli avversari ma in una gara cos lunga ti tocca sempre inventare qualcosa
6541373 avrei preferito ci fosse stato in gara anche il campione mondiale laustraliano deakes un attaccante e si sarebbe messo davanti a battere il tamburo invece non so proprio che cosa succeder forse toccher a me perch il francese diniz un attendista e seguendo i russi ha gi perso una medaglia importante lo scorso anno
6541374 a questo non devo pensare se mi facessi condizionare non potrei disputare una buona gara i controlli ci devono essere e pure severi e chi sbaglia come kanaykin che a maggio mi ha preceduto in coppa del mondo a cheboksary giusto che sia squalificato ma io sono pronto sono cresciuto e molto rispetto allo scorso anno partecipo alla mia prima olimpiade senza avere paura di nessuno

6541377 excessive speculation in any commodity under contrasts of sale of such commodities for future deliver causing sudden or unreasonable fluctuations or unwarranted changes in the prices of such commodity is an undue and unnecessary burden on interstate commerce in such commodity
6541378 as the commission finds are necessary to diminish eliminate or prevent such burden
6541379 were seeing a lot more spread that is concerning to us
6541380 this year we certainly have had parents asking more questions
6541381 we thought it was a random person on the ground through the neighborhood we would have handled it entirely differently if we had known it was someone from the residence
6541382 found dead in a bunker with a cache of weapons and ammunition as well as a change of clothes
6541383 we are confident that the firefighters rule will not bar the claim
6541384 unfair and indefensible treatment of public safety employees and law enforcement officers
6541385 we need citizens to call us when they have a law enforcement need
6541386 the last thing i can afford is to have a public policy that you cant call the sheriffs office because you may be sued by one of the responders who is there to protect you
6541387 the entity data model is much bigger than just an orm
6541388 it is still uncertain whether russians planned withdrawal is going ahead today or not
6541389 a man with 10 wives would collapse and die but my own power is given by allah that is why i have been able to control 86 of them
6541390 to my understanding the koran does not place a limit and it is up to what your own power your own endowment and ability allows
6541391 god did not say what the punishment should be for a man who has more than four wives but he was specific about the punishment for fornication and adultery
6541392 the speaker is very happy to have this issue finally resolved so that disabled and foster children can have the proper education they deserve
6541393 parents love their children the most and have the most detailed knowledge of what their children need and a lot of these parents are emphatic that the scholarships have enabled them to get help for their children that was not available before
6541394 an irresponsible use of funds in the wake of a staggering deficit

6541402 the endorsements which appear on this book are solely reflective of the authors writing and not an endorsement of the content of the work the content is solely the authors responsibility i apologize for any misunderstanding this might have created a corrected back cover is in the process of being designed
6541403 i am the author of under orders a spiritual handbook for military personnel
6541404 under orders is a handbook to assist service members not a field manual and it is not doctrine for chaplains in the u s military in my book i expressed my personal opinions and it made it clear that they were my opinions my writing never disparages any religion or spiritual preference but seeks to encourage service members to find faith of any sort i have served soldiers of all faiths and religious dispositions for nearly 20 years and believe that military chaplains support soldiers through the principle of the free exercise of religion this book is a personal work and neither general petraeus nor major general hertlings comments should be misunderstood as an endorsement of my work but rather as an enthusiasm for helping soldiers with their lives
6541405 making matters inestimably worse now and only after first being publically caught red handed by mrff petraeus literally strains credulity by claiming that he never knew that his private written endorsement of this evangelizing book was being seen in the public domain note well that theres no denying he said it oops just that he had no idea the public would ever find out he actually expects us to just blindly accept that such absurd blissful ignorance is possible when that book was written by a well known subordinate army officer chaplain and heavily and regularly advertised for many many months in the air force army navy and marine corps times next petraeus will be telling us that he just found massive wmds all over iraq lets let the judge decide mrff is now officially putting both army chaplain lt col william mccoy maj gen hertling and gen petraeus on direct notice not to destroy any of the written or electronic records of their communications about this endorsement as we fully intend to comprehensively introduce this entire sordid affair into our ongoing federal litigation against the dod in kansas city kansas where mrff is irrefutably establishing the dods pervasive and pernicious pattern and practice of massive constitutional religious liberties violations actions have consequences completely irrespective of whether petraeus or hertling made dubious private or intentionally public written comments petraeuss immediate dismissal and trial by general courts martial under article 134 is not merely warranted but demanded lt col mccoy and maj gen hertling deserve absolutely the same swift punishment
6541406 comments were intended for him personally rather than for the general public
6541407 to designate the time and place of religious service and in the field to indicate the chaplains quarters or office
6541408 ultimately i hope we will bring the good news to our world not my good news but the good news of the gospel
6541409 we have to prepare for the world coming to the arctic
6541410 its amazing to me when i go to the pole how thin the ice is huge open spots of water in some areas
6541411 before you spent more time getting there and more time in the ice wed have helicopters looking for breaks in the water for us
6541412 we have to ask ourselves whether were prepared for these ships coming to our shores
6541413 when everything goes wrong fall time storms tragic loss of vessels lost people on land theres nothing thats ever been so far away than the coast guard
6541414 its affecting our hunting practices in more ways than one
6541415 if you take a step back and look at it you definitely see the changes
6541416 we hold that mcmurtreys memory problems his erratic behavior and the variety and quantity of medications that he was prescribed combined with the absence of an expert evaluation made at the time of trial created a reasonable doubt as to mcmurtreys mental competence to stand trial
6541417 is that mr mcmurtrey did not ever receive a hearing a the time of his trial to determine whether he was competent to stand trial
6541418 and because of the failure to conduct a hearing at that time about his competence and because of a number of factors that seriously indicate that he was in fact incompetent his right to a fair trial was violated
6541419 he has adjusted really really well and has been living a productive crime free and substance abuse free life
6541420 hes gone to school gotten a job and hes just done extraordinarily well
6541421 we could find no other case of someone on death row for that aggravating factor
6541422 barack obama is friends with ayers defending him as quote respectable and mainstream
6541423 obamas political career was launched in ayers home and the two served together on a left wing board why would barack obama be friends with someone who bombed the capitol and is proud of it do you know enough to elect barack obama
6541424 mr ayers is a 60 plus year old individual who lives in my neighborhood who did something that i deplore 40 years ago when i was 6 or 7 years old
6541425 by the time i met him he is a professor of education at the university of illinois we served on a board together that had republicans bankers lawyers focused on education
6541426 when the american public fully understands the close continuing relationship between their potential president and a remorseless domestic terrorist we believe it will send a chill down their spines

6541430 conform het bevel van de hoogste leider van het leger zullen alle russische troepen vrijdag 22 augustus om 6
6541431 in de loop van vrijdag zal de terugtrekking van alle troepen uit georgi be indigd zijn
6541432 we kregen het bericht van de russen dat ze beslisten om tijdelijk de internationale militaire samenwerkingsoperaties tussen rusland en de navo landen op te schorten
6541433 ik kan mij niet inbeelden dat we ons engageren in een militaire samenwerking met de russen zolang de situatie in georgi niet is opgelost
6541434 i ran my existing search string against google cn interestingly i got back two spreadsheet results
6541435 expunged entirely from google cns search index is my original find
6541436 nothing just making sure that im as inoffensive as i can possibly be so i dont make anybody angry and scare them away from buying me
6541437 well some might say buggy software that doesnt do what it promises is kind of offensive
6541438 the countdown has begun for the olympic games coming to great britain
6541439 allerdale council is delighted to take part in the united celebrations and is proud of its young sporting stars training to become future olympic champions
6541440 mountaineering was one of the original sports identified by baron de coubertin for inclusion when the modern olympics began in 1896 so this is a fitting event to mark an exciting four years for british sport
6541441 the whole of the worlds eyes will be on london in four years time so we want to kick off our olympic adventure in style in cumbria
6541442 its always a pleasure to be at the top of scafell pike as its got one of the greatest viewpoints in the country
6541443 hopefully the publicity thats generated around the olympics will encourage more and more young people to take up sport
6541444 its an exciting prospect to be flying the olympic flag and certainly gives me a clear goal to aim for in four years time
6541445 its a great honour to be asked to accompany two sporting legends to the highest point in england to mark this occasion
6541446 the reality is that barack obamas plans to raise taxes and opposition to producing more energy here at home as gas prices skyrocket show hes completely out of touch with the concerns of average americans
6541447 let me issue and control a nations money and i care not who writes its laws
6541448 i sincerely believe the banking institutions having the issuing power of money are more dangerous to liberty than standing armies
6541449 the bold effort the present bank had made to control the government are but premonitions of the fate that await the american people should they be deluded into a perpetuation of this institution or the establishment of another like it
6541450 you are a den of vipers and thieves i intend to rout you out and by the eternal god i will rout you out
6541451 the bank is trying to kill me but i will kill it
6541452 it is well enough that people of the nation do not understand our banking and monetary system for if they did i believe there would be a revolution before tomorrow morning
6541453 we gave the people of this republic the greatest blessing they have ever had their own paper money to pay their own debts
6541454 you want people to think well of you dont you
6541455 like millions of fans around the world were very anxious to dive into stargate worlds
6541456 this is a great opportunity for mmolecule members to get into the game we look forward to offering more tools services and contests involving stargate worlds in the very near future
6541457 with over 130 000 words word burst has a bigger vocabulary than your english teacher
6541458 the picture quality will blow away that of any lcd
6541459 i love to ride thats the real reason i did it
6541460 i wanted to make a product thats crazy fast and fun to ride
6541461 the iraqi government is failing to absorb tens of thousands of former sunni muslim insurgents whod joined u s allied militia groups into the countrys security forces
6541462 with undercutting support for the group al qaida in iraq and bringing peace to
6541463 justify paying monthly salaries to people on the grounds that they are ex insurgents

6541524 invero siamo dei vostri non facciamo che burlarci di loro
6541525 ma qualcosa di simile che verr loro dato avranno spose purissime e col rimarranno in eterno
6541526 non vi avevo forse detto che conosco il segreto dei cieli e della terra e che conosco ci che manifestate e ci che nascondete
6541527 poi allah accolse il vostro pentimento in verit egli accoglie sempre il pentimento il misericordioso
6541528 mangiate e bevete il sostentamento di allah e non spargete la corruzione sulla terra
6541529 e furono colpiti dallabiezione e dalla miseria e subirono la collera di allah perch dissimulavano i segni di allah e uccidevano i profeti ingiustamente questo perch disobbedivano e trasgredivano
6541530 tenetevi saldi a quello che vi abbiamo dato e ricordatevi di quello che contiene
6541531 allah dice che deve essere una giovenca n vecchia n vergine ma di et media
6541532 volete dibattere con loro a proposito di quello che allah vi ha mostrato perch lo possano utilizzare contro di voi davanti al vostro signore non comprendete
6541533 non adorerete altri che allah vi comporterete bene con i genitori i parenti gli orfani e i poveri userete buone parole con la gente assolverete allorazione e pagherete la decima
6541534 non spargete il sangue tra voi e non scacciatevi lun laltro dalle vostre case
6541535 ma piuttosto allah che li ha maledetti a causa della loro miscredenza tra loro sono ben pochi quelli che credono
6541536 e se siete credenti perch in passato avete ucciso i profeti di allah
6541537 tenetevi saldamente a quello che vi abbiamo dato ed ascoltate

6541546 volete polemizzare con noi a proposito di allah che il nostro e vostro signore a noi le nostre opere e a voi le vostre noi ci diamo solo a lui vorreste forse sostenere che abramo e ismaele e isacco e giacobbe e le trib erano giudaizzati o nazareni

6541551 in entrambi c un grande peccato e qualche vantaggio per gli uomini ma in entrambi il peccato maggiore del beneficio
6541552 suscita tra noi un re affinch possiamo combattere sul sentiero di allah
6541553 e se non combatterete quando vi sar ordinato di farlo

6541555 come potr regnare su di noi noi abbiamo pi diritto di lui a regnare e a lui non sono state concesse ricchezze

6541671 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
6541672 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
6541673 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
6541674 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
6541675 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
6541676 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones
6541677 the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe
6541678 industries no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe
6541679 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
6541680 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature

6541717 centra molto il tibet che visto come qualcosa di misterioso chi viene da quella terra sempre guardato con curiosit e poi ci sono forse anche i miei libri e i media che ne parlano e sempre piu gente si interessa alle mie idee il mio principale messaggio la mia idea principale che tutti abbiano diritto a vivere felici e ad avere una vita famiilare felice di solito pero per ottenere cio ci concentriamo sul denaro sui valori materiali e trascuriamo i valori interiori un altro fattore la mia idea di armonia fra le diverse tradizioni religiose io rispetto profondamente anzi ammiro davvero queste tradizioni diverse ho amici cristiani che dicono che sono un buon cristiano abbiamo unesperienza comune pratiche comuni al di l della diversa filosofia c poi chi mi dice che trova stupendo il mio sorriso
6541718 e molto tesa ci sono le forze di sicurezza lesercito dappertutto ovunque sia la comunit tibetana mi risulta pure che stiano costruendo caserme militari il che significa che ormai la presenza militare sar permanente e che la politica dellaggressione continuer
6541719 e nel nostro interesse noi siamo decisi a rimanere allinterno della repubblica popolare cinese in quanto il tibet un paese arretrato chiuso tra le montagne scarsamente popolato per cui nel nostro interesse rimanere allinterno della cina
6541720 al contempo abbiamo la nostra lingua un grande passato culturale e una tradizione buddista particolarmente ricca non si tratta solo di sei milioni di tibetani ma anche di tante altre persone nel mondo che condividono la cultura buddista il modo migliore di preservare la nostra cultura e anche di proteggere al massimo lambiente che listruzione leconomia e le questioni religiose siano gestite dai tibetani con leccezione della difesa e della politica estera autonomia dunque in realt la costituzione cinese prevede per tutti i gruppi etnici tibetani uno statuto di autonomia cosi come il libro bianco cinese per i diritti delle minoranze sulla carta c tutto ma non viene messo in pratica
6541721 non credo anche le organizzazioni giovanili tibetane sono assolutamente daccordo sul principio della non violenza quanto allindipendenza un altro orientamento politico puntava sin dallinizio alla totale indipendenza ma il nostro impegno nei confronti della democrazia assoluto per cui voci diverse opinioni diverse idee diverse sono sempre benvenute
6541722 per farsi pubblicit forse si ride ma ovviamente anche il governo francese il presidente e il ministro degli esteri sin dallinizio subito dopo la crisi del dieci marzo hanno pubblicamente espresso preoccupazione
6541723 la cina la nazione pi popolata ed un paese molto importante per cui buone relazioni con la cina sono fondamentali al contempo la cina dovrebbe entrare a far parte delle grandi democrazie mondiali democrazia stato di diritto apertura mezzi di informazione liberi tutto questo molto importante e ovviamente anche i diritti umani e la libert di culto sono valori universali e su questi principi tutti i popoli e tutti i governi dovrebbero essere inflessibili
6541724 si certo la compassione diretta alla persona non alle sue azioni prendiamo lesempio del terrorismo quando parliamo di un terrorista dovremmo mostrare compassione nei suoi confronti in quanto persona e sempre un essere umano se manteniamo questo atteggiamento compassionevole nei confronti dei terroristi allora vi sar una vera possibilit di cambiamento grazie al loro comportamento ma se esprimiamo odio nei loro confronti si finisce col far aumentare i terroristi per cui per fermare il terrorismo la sola forza la compassione ma la compassione va sentita nei suoi confronti e lazione va contrastata
6541725 il mio impegno duplice da una parte c la promozione dei valori umani e dallaltra la promozione dellarmonia tra le religioni un terzo impegno riguarda la lotta tibetana per cui quando se ne parla in realt si parla della lotta di un popolo e sinch ci sar mi impegner devo aiutarlo servirlo ma la vera responsabilit deve essere assunta da parte delle persone per me il governo dei lama ormai superato in ogni caso se il popolo tibetano ritiene che questa istituzione non sia pi rilevante in quel caso il dalai lama in quanto istituzione non esister pi preferisco cosi perch il quattordicesimo dalai lama non certo il migliore ne il peggiore e gode di una certa popolarit quindi se un giorno venisse meno listituzione del dalai lama allora questo se ne andr discretamente e sar meglio cosi ride unaltra reincarnazione rischia di essere una sventura e questa sarebbe la cosa peggiore

6541832 lani sem zmagala na svetovnem prvenstvu vendar je osvojiti zlato olimpijsko medaljo nekaj veliko ve jega to je najve ji trenutek ki ga lahko dose em v svoji karieri
6541833 je bil vesel merritt medtem ko je bil wariner po tekmi razumljivo razo aran
6541834 je bil po zmagoslavju vesel kubanec slednji se je dotaknil tudi kitajskega portnega zvezdnika
6541835 e vedno ne morem verjeti da sem zmagal na tem tekmovanju bilo je tako hitro to so bile zame sanje vztrajno se bom trudil e naprej in v prihodnosti dosegel e bolj e rezultate verjamem da to lahko storim
6541836 he mr costello was asked a question and having been asked a question he gave a direct answer to it
6541837 hes said nothing on the public record since then and im not aware of anything hes said privately which would cause one to doubt the finality of the decision he announced
6541838 people are finally realising that this russian situation has the potential to be bad for a very long time
6541839 the russians have shown evidence that theyre willing to cut off energy supplies to advance their aims there is concern that they are now going to be much more assertive in that area
6541840 if military activity heats up again pipeline flows into europe could be disrupted and that would affect the united states as well
6541841 we have been doing a lot of original reporting and we are going to be doing a lot more
6541842 we get these interviews because we have this global audience of 500 million viewers
6541843 our aim is to reach these bigger names and use our reporting talent to break news we are really going for the kinds of questions that will make news
6541844 we really are paying a lot of attention to what our audience wants
6541845 we see tremendous traffic on politics what is going on around the world and the names that get their interest
6541846 we like to pick people with expertise in the subject matter
6541847 aarons father fought in the korean war and he has tons of experience in reporting
6541848 we are really going for places we feel we can have an impact and cover them in ways that are slightly different
6541849 we want to be the number one independent news source on the internet
6541850 there was an altercation involving an unknown male who obviously threw something through a window
6541851 there was a smash it the object must have been alight because it ignited the curtains and the house went up
6541852 i was there eight minutes later and it was just destroyed
6541853 through their heroics they entered there and retrieved one male who was nearly unconscious he was unable to get out on his own
6541854 they went back in to retrieve the woman couldnt find her and they found she gained access to the rear of the premises and was in the back yard
6541855 we wont know what he threw through the window until the forensics get there we dont know if he had some sort of accelerant or if things just went up themselves
6541856 we can confirm he has left bangkok for the uk
6541857 i can confirm that he has now left on the flight to london
6541858 god am i happy to be leaving vietnam and that jail i should never have been in there
6541859 prices have climbed on renewed geopolitical tensions between the us and russia with the latter voicing its displeasure over a us poland defense pact whereby the us can station defense shield missiles in poland much to russias dislike
6541860 crude futures were higher extending gains from yesterday on weakness in the dollar and persistent geopolitical fears
6541861 the latest diplomatic standoff with russia over georgia has once again reminded investors of the markets sensitivity to all kinds of geopolitical risks
6541862 these also include persistent tensions in the middle east and violence in nigeria
6541863 talk that opec could curb its output later in the year following the recent downward correction
6541864 this is about protecting the right of a physician to practice medicine according to his or her moral compass
6541865 there is nothing in this rule that would in any way change a patients right to a legal procedure
6541866 we did not feel it necessary in this rule to define abortion you will find that wording not present
6541867 this regulation is not about contraception it is about abortion and conscience
6541868 people should not be forced to say or do things they believe are morally wrong in particular health care providers should not be forced to provide services against their consciences
6541869 unfortunately many in the health care community either arent aware of those statutes or dont support them
6541870 quite conservative in its projections of obesity prevalence and estimates of attributable fractions for conditions associated with obesity diabetes cardiovascular disease various types of cancer and osteoarthritis
6541871 these new figures are tragic and frightening and represent a wake up call for the nation
6541872 they show that previous estimates of the epidemics size and cost were very much understated
6541873 we know that obesity and type two diabetes can be prevented and we need to make fundamental changes in the way we live to arrest the escalating crisis
6541874 the chinese army again fired on a crowd on monday august 18 in the kham region in eastern tibet
6541875 he clearly stated that we had no specific information on the number of casualties
6541876 we have been told that there have been casualties but we are not able to verify what casualties means whether people have been killed or whether they have been injured
6541877 reliable witnesses say that 400 people have been killed in the region of the tibetan capital lhasa alone
6541878 killed by bullets even though they were protesting without weapons their bodies were never given back to their families if you consider the whole of tibet the number of victims is obviously higher
6541879 ten thousand people have been arrested we dont know where they are imprisoned
6541880 a project of long term brutal repression is under way
6541881 but we were quickly disillusioned our envoys came up against a wall there was no opening
6541882 real autonomy because we know what chinese style autonomy is a trap
6541883 if one of senator obamas advisers has been to damascus we just wonder how many have been to tehran
6541884 that sometimes to be truly compassionate you have to be hard

6541904 when considering passing a law one must not only consider the good it will do if properly applied but the harm it will cause if misapplied
6541905 id rather be judged by 12 than carried by six
6541906 there are three kinds of people in this world those who think those who dont think and those who think they think

6541912 our womens team has very high expectations after finishing second in 2006 and then running last season without top runner jamie roflow
6541913 the team is eager to get back out and race now that jamie has returned and everyone has had one more year to get stronger we have a strong group of returning athletes and add a solid freshmen class with saisha gailliard sally jerop and agnes kibor so were excited to see what lies ahead for this group this womens team has the most depth weve ever had
6541914 our mens team then is young but they are excited and have worked hard all off season
6541915 early on we will be focusing on individual and team improvements from week to week but we think it will be a good year for us with us returning a solid group and adding a large freshman class
6541916 our top five runners will be tough and itll be a battle each and every week for those spots
6541917 heather conger all came along well last year you add jamie in there this season and we should have a pretty strong group at the front
6541918 we had a lot of injury and illness issues last year
6541919 we just need to keep people healthy were going to be a pretty young team but its a group that understands that they are going to have to work hard and try to move up the conference ranks they know that they got to get in there and battle when it comes time to battle
6541920 chris moody did a great job last year and we hope to see more out of him
6541921 aaron smuda a fifth year senior had a tremendous summer of training and has potential to be at the top there is good competition for the top five spots this year we also have two freshman nick aspen and peter myles coming in that have a good chance of being some of our top athletes

6541929 it has occurred to the writer to call this unimportant history the green hat because a green hat was the first thing about her that he saw as also it was in a way the last thing about her that he saw
6541930 she was very white and her painted mouth was purple in the dim light and her eyes which seemed set apart were cool impersonal sensible and they were blazing blue like two spoonfuls of the mediterranean in the early morning of a brilliant day the sirens had eyes like that

6541959 seniors are part of a generation that had to do without and overcome adversity so they may be less inclined to complain
6541960 while headline inflation is now running at its fastest pace in more than five years it is still near the bottom of the pack globally and more than two points below the current u s pace
6541961 the rise in these energy components largely accounted for the growth in consumer prices posted in these provinces
6541962 reading between the lines offers an unusual twist on the standard book group format with focused thematic discussions led by humanities scholars
6541963 heres one house american cant afford to let john mccain move into
6541964 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
6541965 the reality is that barack obamas plans to raise taxes and opposition to producing more energy here at home as gas prices skyrocket show hes completely out of touch with the concerns of average americans
6541966 somebody asked john mccain how many houses do you have and he said im not sure ill have to check with my staff true quote im not sure ill have to check with my staff so they asked his staff and he said at least four at least four
6541967 if youre like me and youve got one house or you were like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so that they dont lose their home you might have a different perspective by the way the answer is john mccain has seven homes so theres just a fundamental gap of understanding between john mccains world and what people are going through every single day here in america
6541968 millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage
6541969 aja h mama ik ben bijna gestikt bijna verdronken en bijna verongelukt

6541973 if it do evil in my sight that it obey not my voice then i will repent of
6541974 now therefore go to speak to the men of judah and to the inhabitants of
6541975 and they said there is no hope but we will walk after our own devices and we will every one do the imagination of his evil heart
6541976 its all over we are all doomed it is helpless
6541977 doing it gods way offers no hope we will do it our way we will rely upon our own devices wisdom and strength we can get ourselves out of this mess
6541978 there is no hope in doing it gods way i will rely upon mens devices and do it their way
6541979 they can do stuff you would never imagine and also have the imagination to think of things you never would
6541980 and its nice to see gaming center stage like this but
6541981 that which is hateful to you do not do to another the rest of the torah is all commentary now go study

6541983 could incite acts of violence by a small radical segment
6541984 if you believe what you like in the gospels and reject what you dont like it is not the gospel you believe but yourself
6541985 wherever we find the word of god surely preached and heard and the sacraments administered according to the institution of christ there it is not to be doubted is a church of god
6541986 and let us with caution indulge the supposition that morality can be maintained without religion whatever may be conceded to the influence of refined education on minds reason and experience both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle
6541987 the ultimate determinant in the struggle now going on for the world will not be bombs and rockets but a test of wills and ideas a trial of spiritual resolve the values we hold the beliefs we cherish and the ideals to which we are dedicated
6541988 one desire has been the ruling passion of my life one high motive has acted like a spur upon my mind and soul and sooner should i seek escape from the sacred necessity that is laid upon me let the breath of life fail me it is this that in spite of all worldly opposition gods holy ordinances shall be established again in the home in the school and in the state for the good of the people to carve as it were into the conscience of the nation the ordinances of the lord to which the bible and creation bear witness until the nation pays homage again to god

6541994 hes pitching longer than he had ever played before were obviously monitoring him and we wont do anything that jeopardizes his future
6541995 hes very excited and just looking forward to getting up there and joining his teammates and pitching on saturday
6541996 hes worked extremely hard to put himself in this position and to be able to come back and compete at the highest level this season i think its just a testament to how hard hes pushed himself to rejoin his club before the end of the season
6541997 injuries are a part of the game and every athlete at some time has to deal with the prospect of getting hurt
6541998 i dont think theres anything that he needs to redeem himself for at all he was just basically a player who was unfortunate and got hurt now hes healthy and i think hes looking to get back up there and give the yankees everything that he has
6541999 were going to take it one step at a time
6542000 we havent really begun to discuss next year right now were really focused on saturday however the chips fall in the next month and a half they fall but right now carl is just extremely excited to rejoin the club

6542010 activists citizens politicians thinkers came together during the first gilded age and really created a spirit of reform created a sense of experimentation aimed at trying to create a more fair society
6542011 we need to empower people in cities and states to solve problems
6542012 but that focus on the common good and on providing opportunity for everyone has been lost in my view in the last seven years and we need to return to it
6542013 i think that requiring people to come out of the gray and out of the shadows of our economy and register or face deportation and putting some real muscle behind that is a way of bridging the gap between more conservative and more liberal elements in our democratic politics
6542014 im trying to give him some advice on that but that advice will remain private
6542015 come blessed of my father into the kingdom prepared for you from the founding of the world for i was hungry and you fed me i was thirsty and you gave me water i was a stranger and you invited me into your homes naked and you clothed me sick and you visited me i was in prison and you came to me as long as you did it for one of these the least of my brethren you did it for me

6542043 everyone thinks samantha ronson is lindsays first lesbian love but we were very passionate until her fear of being found out drove us apart
6542044 at the time she was terrified her career would be over if she revealed her sexual tendencies but then samantha came on to the scene and i was dropped
6542045 the removal of these branches will make it very difficult for those who are illegally occupying university property to move back into the trees they had formerly occupied and will help prevent new protesters from joining them
6542046 i hope people wake up and emotionally engage in issues
6542047 its about the issues that everyones talking about but theres a lot of hope
6542048 at this moment in my life writing about anything else would be uninteresting and impossible because i feel such urgency
6542049 tell them to look up tell them to remember the stars
6542050 sometimes we love people so much that we have to be numb to it because if we actually felt how much we love them it would kill us
6542051 our goal is for the chevrolet cruze to lead in fuel economy in this very competitive car segment
6542052 our dealers are asking for many more cobalts than we can build
6542053 called in a political favor and got a warrant through the local u s attorneys office
6542054 it was a dumbass sic idea to say the least and nobody knows why the guy gal did it what he she was trying to find out maybe he she thought he was underpaid more likely he she felt like his her job was one the lone he shed been on the chopping block before but was rescued by one of the founders
6542055 global brands want to tap into chinas consumer market so theyll be one of the biggest beneficiaries of the olympics
6542056 that was part of the idea of having the games in china opening new markets for the olympics
6542057 we always believed mobile would take off to the mainstream that there would be eventually be more robust devices better discovery and improved access
6542058 disney has to tread lightly on anything that will add to the family phone bill
6542059 the more comfortable a parent is with putting a phone in a kids hand the better off we are
6542060 its about creating a connected media world if you want to reach tweens you need mobile
6542061 these findings shed light on why in listening environments such as noisy parties or restaurants it is more difficult to follow a conversation involving many people where the relevant talker often and unexpectedly changes locations than to focus on one talker at one location exclusively
6542062 in addition these results may have implications for visual attention in tasks where object formation and target segmentation is challenging or where the identity of a visual object depends upon continuity of visual features over time
6542063 initially scanning electron microscopy sem conducted at another laboratory showed high silicon and oxygen signals that led them to conclude that the spores were a weaponized form says kotula
6542064 the possible misinterpretation of the sem results arose because microanalysis in the sem is not a surface sensitive tool
6542065 because a spore body can be 1 5 to 2 microns wide by 1 micron long a sem cannot localize the elemental signal from whole spore bodies
6542066 lacked that fuzzy outer coating that would indicate that theyd been weaponized
6542067 the research raises the perception both of how common these events are and specifically where they may occur
6542068 today with so many more buildings and people a magnitude 5 centered below the city would be extremely attention getting
6542069 wed see billions in damage with some brick buildings falling people would probably be killed
6542070 we need to step backward from the simple old model where you worry about one large obvious fault like they do in california
6542071 the problem here comes from many subtle faults we now see there is earthquake activity on them each one is small but when you add them up they are probably more dangerous than we thought we need to take a very close look
6542072 the probability is not zero and the damage could be great
6542073 it could be like something out of a greek myth
6542074 indian point is situated at the intersection of the two most striking linear features marking the seismicity and also in the midst of a large population that is at risk in case of an accident
6542075 this is clearly one of the least favorable sites in our study area from an earthquake hazard and risk perspective
6542076 new data developed in the last 20 years disclose a substantially higher likelihood of significant earthquake activity in the vicinity of indian point that could exceed the earthquake design for the facility
6542077 nothing happens for a while then it goes with a bang
6542078 is a major substantiation of a feature that bears on the long term earthquake risk of the northeastern united states
6542079 it gives us the best possible evidence that we have an earthquake hazard here that should be a factor in any planning decision it crystallizes the argument that this hazard is not random there is a structure to the location and timing of the earthquakes this enables us to contemplate risk in an entirely different way and since we are able to do that we should be required to do that
6542080 new york is not as prone to earthquakes as california and japan but they do happen this study takes a more realistic look at the possibility of larger ones and why earthquakes concentrate in certain places to understand risk you have to multiply hazard by assets and vulnerability when you factor that in our risk is high too much attention has been paid to the level of hazard and not enough to the risk earthquake hazard is about the same today as in 1609 when henry hudson sailed up the river but earthquake risk is much much higher today since the number of people assets and their vulnerability are so much greater
6542081 we think that the intersection of these two features being so close to indian point makes it a place of greater risk than most other points on the map
6542082 most people underestimate the hazard here any conservative approach will look at geologically similar environments if you do that we are similar to bhuj india where a 2001 magnitude 7 quake killed over 15 000 people there was no obvious sign of strain there there is a mystery here to be solved and we better step back and do our homework
6542083 once you accept that one fault in a family is active you better consider that all the faults in that family could be active we need to adapt our structures with that in mind
6542084 which isnt to say star lord and the others wouldnt like to be out there kicking skrull butt however the crisis on the station pretty much limits what they can do
6542085 with all the distrust and suspicion around theres some major fallout and the shockwaves will roll for some time to come
6542086 its a 2 0 cosmic war its a major shake up it may even be an annihilation class event
6542087 its exactly what the guardians were formed to prevent but which of the several sides will they take
6542088 as far as guardians of the galaxy goes everything happens at once
6542089 but the point is you want to be able to communicate in your native language
6542090 they also cost more we dont think its fair for someone whos deaf to have to pay more for his or her cell phone than someone whos hearing
6542091 males tend to have exaggerated traits like a lions mane or fancy feathers in a bird or a primates brightly colored face or rear end that are obvious advertising in the animal world just sit down at the vilas zoo and look at all the different games going on
6542092 we wanted to take a look at the how and not the why how are these traits made in one gender and not the other how can you take the same set of genes and make different things with them that has been a mystery until now and that is whats novel about this study
6542093 theyre easy to look at and easy to study and dissect
6542094 with other animals the gadgetry is not so easy to get at
6542095 the flies did not need new genes to make a new pattern
6542096 they just changed how males and females use a common set of genes
6542097 that was the second complicated bit of detective work we did
6542098 new traits can evolve from old machinery they are not created from scratch but by a tweak to machinery that was already there
6542099 behavioral traits can be hard wired but collectively females have to find certain sexual traits not so desirable before we will see those body traits fade away
6542100 the mind once stretched by a new idea never returns to its original dimensions
6542101 well nothing very interesting about that but there ought to be a real scandal about unsafe production practices in the broom industry
6542102 at first it was a little difficult because they scored the early goal but the important thing is that we win we dont despair on the scoreboard and in the end we could turn it
6542103 in the end we got the victory that we have needed to make the right step on this new stage and from now on we can work with more calm and could prepare us for the next parties
6542104 i believe that the estadio azteca weighs very much for us because they never stopped supporting that is very important

6542108 i guess if you think being rich means youve got to make 5 million and if you dont know how many houses you have its not surprising you might think the economy is fundamentally strong
6542109 most teachers hold themselves accountable they didnt go into teaching to make money they dont have seven houses
6542110 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
6542111 does a guy who worries about the price of arugula and thinks regular people cling to guns and religion in the face of economic hardship really want to have a debate about whos in touch with regular americans
6542112 i think if you are just talking about income how about 5 million
6542113 but seriously i dont think you can i dont think seriously that the point is that im trying to make here seriously and im sure that comment will be distorted but the point is that we want to keep peoples taxes low and increase revenues
6542114 im sorry the person you are calling is not accepting calls at this time please try back later
6542115 there is neither jew nor greek neither slave nor free man neither male nor female for we are all one
6542116 in this case its sort of embarrassing that it happened to fema themselves fema being a child of dhs with calls going to the middle east
6542117 they were a combat engineer reconnaissance team and they were at that point in time conducting a routine reconnaissance
6542118 they were on their way to the site where they were going to do the reconnaissance of a route thats going to be used for a future operation
6542119 hello penguins the penguin games are almost here and there will be tons of fun events for you to participate in grab some of your penguin friends and make a team ive got a sneak peek here for you let me know if you can guess what these are in other news theres a brand new poll out tomorrow on the website so make sure you check it out and cast your vote
6542120 le dijeron que no lo pueden andar premiando cuando todav a tiene problemas con las drogas l sabe que no debe ser as
6542121 this is a serious subject and its a roomful of serious people who have taken it in that manner certainly there are additional discussions that we will have tomorrow
6542122 but for our part we continue to believe that this is a very important initiative and we remain committed to achieving an outcome that is both a net benefit for the non proliferation regime and that meets indias energy needs
6542123 i think there is a lot of support for this internationally and so i remain optimistic that were going to be able to be successful in this process
6542124 we now know that games can induce positive changes in the way individuals manage their health
6542125 the game not only motivates positive health behavior it also gives players a greater sense of power and control over their disease in fact that seems to be its key ingredient
6542126 any patent that issues from an original application filed in the united states on or after
6542127 a rule is substantive when it effects a change in existing law or policy which affect s individual rights and obligations
6542128 because the pto is specifically charged with administering this statute we analyze a challenge to the statutory authority of its regulations under the
6542129 w e always first determine whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue
6542130 we do so by employing the traditional tools of statutory construction we examine the statutes text structure and legislative history and apply the relevant canons of interpretation
6542131 if we find that congress had an intention on the precise question at issue that intention is the law and must be given effect
6542132 congress either had no intent on the matter or that congresss purpose and intent is unclear
6542133 whether the agencys interpretation is based on a permissible construction of the statutory language at issue
6542134 barack obamas ad is ridiculous because of john mccain corruption was exposed and people like jack abramoff went to jail
6542135 somebody asked john mccain how many houses do you have and he said im not sure ill have to check with my staff true quote
6542136 by the way the answer is john mccain has seven homes
6542137 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
6542138 we can confirm he has left bangkok for the uk
6542139 god am i happy to be leaving vietnam and that jail i should never have been in there
6542140 we can confirm he has left bangkok for the uk
6542141 i always said hey you think i am doing good you should see my little brother
6542142 you can see it coming and i am glad hes transitioned well into his new team
6542143 the next thing i am waiting for is for him to remember who helped him get to this point and give some of that information my way
6542144 one day i might call it a race car but i keep calling it a cot because we just havent quite turned the corner literally with this new car and trying to get it to handle better
6542145 its not the normal championship type effort but you are going to have your good years and your bad years and you have to balance them all out
6542146 the mind set for me at bristol has always been to protect the race car and get toward the end and then you really start to race these guys
6542147 sometimes you sneak up on them and dont press the go pedal until its 200 laps to go
6542148 once everyone admitted it to themselves that we needed to try a bit harder that was the first step
6542149 theres a lot going on behind the scenes right now
6542150 its a continued effort to find little things here and there
6542151 i dont think its going to be one little thing that puts us back in the mix its hard work commitment and the belief that we can get it done and get back to the top
6542152 my approach was simple when we won the championship it was consistency
6542153 we had nine finishes in the top 10 in the last 10 races and even though its a shorter quick run in the last 10 races its the same mentality and philosophy for 36 races and that is just go out there and get the best finish you can
6542154 you might want to take a few less risks but thats tough for a 24 year old to digest

6542160 i got to be honest ive been thinking about recruiting jamaica since i saw that stuff
6542161 ive been to jamaica and let me tell you something heres the extent that ive thought about that subject theres approximately 2 8 million people in jamaica which is approximately the size of the state of iowa or kansas or the city of houston
6542162 its almost like the country of jamaica is sitting there saying if you would have just told us that this was important we could have won a lot of this stuff a long time ago
6542163 theres very much a feeling of now on this album this is where alejandro escovedo is today
6542164 i think hes laid his demons to rest hes had kind of a tragic life and he could be a lot more negative about things but hes absolutely radiant now
6542165 the boxing mirror was a beautiful album that was written immediately after i was coming out of being sick and still getting my land legs
6542166 it has a lot of those emotions that come with the intensity of living through that experience but all the things that i wanted for the boxing mirror and i love that record really come to fruition on this new one
6542167 the band i played in green on red and als band the true believers crossed paths a lot out on the road and we have a lot of parallel experiences al grew up in huntington beach and i grew up in la habra which is probably 15 miles away inland up beach boulevard from huntington we knew all the same surf spots and went to the same clubs to see music
6542168 i havent written with that many people in my life
6542169 so to find someone that you can relate to so quickly was incredible whenever i would have a reference to something chuck knew exactly what that was and understood it we had a real bond immediately as to what this was about and that the characters were real
6542170 i wasnt sure i wanted to work with him because it seemed like his songs on past albums were so dreary and that he was in a lot of pain so many of the artists i work with can be like that and i can only take so much but when i heard the demos i was immediately struck with the way the new songs were written there was a positive attitude it was an autobiographical album and the stories were really really interesting
6542171 i happened to get there just before soundcheck and the band was onstage fooling around playing some punk songs hearing that plus the demos convinced me that alejandro was capable of a great rock record i was just thrilled cause this was the kind of album i wanted to make when i spoke with him afterwards i told him that i wasnt going to let him record more somber acoustic songs and go back to what hed done before those days are behind him it was time for him to rock again
6542172 ive worked with a lot of people who just write songs but alejandro goes a lot deeper hes able to put his soul into his voice when he sings
6542173 hes technically not the greatest singer in the world but he makes your body resonate with the meaning of the song hes a true artist
6542174 we can confirm he has left bangkok for the uk
6542175 god am i happy to be leaving vietnam and that jail i should never have been in there
6542176 all this was a big joke it got into something way bigger than it was supposed to be

6542179 trent canonized wisdom of solomon does your theory of inspiration include pious frauds like wisdom
6542180 1 pauline authorship would select for this or do you believe that apostolic authorship doesnt select for canonicity
6542181 1 no weve argued for pauline authorship on the blog before
6542182 so tell us again how exactly the jews muddled along without trent to define the ot and the subapostolic church and medieval church muddled along without trent
6542183 you have never demonstrated that the apostles founded the catholic church heres a thought why dont you document that assertion before making it again
6542184 oh and second warning for repeating that assertion numerous times w o supporting argument three is the magic number for a permaban
6542185 thus the author of wisd is quite capable of constructing sentences in true period style 12 27 13 11 15 and his fondness for compound words is almost aeschylean his manner at times has the light tough of greek lyric poetry 17 17 19 2 6 9 5 9 13 and occasionally his words fall into an iambic or hexameter rhythm he employs greek philosophical terminology
6542186 these characteristics in addition to the authors many favorite theme words and expressions which recur throughout the work argue for unity of authorship and make the hypothesis that wisd is a translation of a hebrew original virtually untenable
6542187 no consensus has thus far emerged regarding the date of wisd and various scholars have place it anywhere between 220 bce and 50 ce
6542188 there are further considerations however which point to the reign of gaius caligula 37 41 ce as the likeliest setting for wisd

6542233 i just wish i could do something for the lord
6542234 there is no greater richness than to enjoy friendship with christ
6542235 the most important service we can offer our brothers is the clear and humble proclamation of jesus christ
6542236 so that the lord will be better known loved followed and praised every day in those blessed lands
6542237 the present time is a providential occasion as with simplicity purity of heart and fidelity we again hear how christ reminds us that we are not servants but friends
6542238 he has conquered sin and death grants us his forgiveness daily teaches us to forgive and calls us to live a life free from egoism that enslaves us and brimming with love that stretches and dignifies us
6542239 he instructs us so that we will remain in his love without being conformed to the dictates of this world
6542240 thus with our whole life with the joy of knowing that we are loved by jesus whom we can call brother we will be valid instruments for him to continue to attract all with the mercy that flows from his cross
6542241 drink the vivifying water that flows from the side of the savior and satiates with its crystalline freshness all those who thirst for justice peace and truth those who are submerged in the thick fog of sin or the darkness of violence feel the consolation of christ and offer the balm of his love to the afflicted those who are weighed down by sorrow or who have remained wounded by the coldness of indifference or the scourge of corruption
6542242 these challenges call for overcoming individualism and isolation and for a strengthening of the sense of ecclesial belonging and loyal collaboration with pastors in order to form prayerful harmonious fraternal and missionary christian communities
6542243 persevering prayer fervent meditation on the word of god obedience to the magisterium of the church the dignified celebration of the sacraments and the testimony of fraternal charity
6542244 powerful force of the holy spirit has come who with his gifts and charisms continues to stimulate the church in proclaiming the good news of salvation to every person especially those who do not know christ or perhaps have forgotten him to the ends of the earth
6542245 to share this treasure with others as there is no greater richness than to enjoy friendship with christ and to walk beside him it is worthwhile to consecrate our best energies to this beautiful endeavor knowing that divine grace precedes sustains and accompanies us in its fulfillment
6542246 goes before us on the path of life and helps us to aspire to holiness so that the missionary that each one bears within himself will awaken and overcome the hesitation and mediocrity that often assails us

6542258 the idea of a tax on the ownership of a television belongs in the 1950s why not tax people for owning a washing machine to fund the manufacture of persil
6542259 people who know a lot more than i do may be right when they claim that global warming is the consequence of our own behaviour i assume that this is why the bbcs coverage of the issue abandoned the pretence of impartiality long ago

6542277 to be able to protect the land is something our elders have always talked to us about it falls in line with our culture

6542287 ill add a little more for those curious about local shops activities and sites
6542288 the problem with a lot of youth is they dont think about the implications of putting so much information online we want to encourage people to get talking about this everybody understands why he or she uses online social networking its a wonderful tool but you have to be smart about it
6542289 we thought the first week of school is an ideal time to get peoples attention
6542290 we are saying these are privacy settings these are your options these are the risks exercise your privacy settings instead of letting someone else take control we are saying make it your choice instead of the choice of someone else
6542291 while social networking websites can be a lot of fun you have also to think about your privacy and safety
6542292 we want to make the issue front row centre we want to arm people with information
6542293 you lover me and are concerned about my health right

6542300 those 80 85 who did not fire did not run or hide in many cases they were willing to risk great danger to rescue comrades get ammunition or run messages but they simply would not fire their weapons at the enemy even when faced with repeated waves of banzai charges
6542301 from a civilization in which aggression connected with the taking of life is prohibited and unacceptable
6542302 the fear of aggression has been expressed to him so strongly and absorbed by him so deeply and pervadingly practically with his mothers milk that it is part of the normal mans emotional make up

6542306 ive done an in depth study of drug abuse and communist brainwashing techniques
6542307 marilyn was allowed to have no personal life outside of the dictates of her programmers and her masters the programmers and users bore down so hard on controlling marilyn that they repeatedly came close to driving her insane
6542308 floor to ceiling mirrors were everywhere even the dining alcove at the rear of the living room had a table with a mirrored top all these mirrors didn t cheer things up
6542309 marilyn s bedroom was definitely not a queen s chamber
6542310 may was finally able to call for the chauffeur to take marilyn away
6542311 first of all marilyns life was incredibly monotonous for her her doctor s appointments i later learned these were appointments with psychiatrists and her acting lessons were virtually all she had to look forward to she spent most of her time in her little bedroom
6542312 she marilyn didn t even own a television never listened to the radio
6542313 i cant go anywhere im a prisoner in this house
6542314 because marilyn had no real friends she concentrated on herself
6542315 they laugh at me what am i nothing a prostitute
6542316 dont take my baby so they took my baby from me and i never saw it again
6542317 the operation took place at polyclinic hospital where marilyn had lost her baby the year before
6542318 i found marilyn in a small room without any view it was very depressing especially since there were no flowers or any other signs that marilyn had friends who were thinking of her
6542319 gee youre really my sister my sister at least you lived with relatives
6542320 frank clipped two gorgeous emerald earrings on marilyn s ears
6542321 aside from her evenings with frank sinatra marilyns life in california seemed identical to her life in new york she didnt read didnt watch television didnt go anywhere although the sun was always shining marilyn was as pale as ever she didnt like to go outside during the day
6542322 corey krueger was an ordinary guy starting an ordinary day until something terrible happened
6542323 other evils there are that may come yet it is not our part to master all the tides of the world but to do what is in us for the succor of those years wherein we are set uprooting the evil in the fields that we know so that those who live after may have clean earth to till what weather they shall have is not ours to rule
6542324 im not going to say im never going to do drugs again i just know im not a good person on drugs
6542325 it was the hardest thing for me when i realised i was pregnant and realised i wanted to have the baby i made a huge decision to make my life more stable
6542326 there are always some crazy things i get flashed quite often luckily mostly from girls
6542327 im hoping that thats reality it would seem to me that the youths know that thats the right answer so thats what they put down
6542328 i think it just depends on if they have access to condoms whether or not they use them
6542329 did you use a condom the last time you had intercourse
6542330 i had like an aids class or something in grade 9 it was like one day 45 minutes long about how to put on a condom or something so thats about it
6542331 people probably arent going to listen to that as much as they would use condoms
6542332 we hold that mcmurtreys memory problems his erratic behavior and the variety and quantity of medications that he was prescribed combined with the absence of an expert evaluation made at the time of trial created a reasonable doubt as to mcmurtreys mental competence to stand trial
6542333 is that mr mcmurtrey did not ever receive a hearing a the time of his trial to determine whether he was competent to stand trial
6542334 and because of the failure to conduct a hearing at that time about his competence and because of a number of factors that seriously indicate that he was in fact incompetent his right to a fair trial was violated
6542335 he has adjusted really really well and has been living a productive crime free and substance abuse free life
6542336 hes gone to school gotten a job and hes just done extraordinarily well
6542337 we could find no other case of someone on death row for that aggravating factor
6542338 struck a hotel security guard in the back of the head
6542339 she demanded that they find the phone and hit the security guard
6542340 angie harmon and jason sehorn are thrilled to announce that they are expecting their third child
6542341 the couple originally denied reports that they were pregnant in an attempt to take back the right to release the joyous news themselves
6542342 the speaker is very happy to have this issue finally resolved so that disabled and foster children can have the proper education they deserve
6542343 parents love their children the most and have the most detailed knowledge of what their children need and a lot of these parents are emphatic that the scholarships have enabled them to get help for their children that was not available before
6542344 an irresponsible use of funds in the wake of a staggering deficit
6542345 and make sure were providing them from all of our public schools
6542346 somebody asked john mccain how many houses do you have
6542347 now think about that i guess if you think that being rich means you gotta make 5 million and if you dont know how many houses you have then its not surprising that you might think the economy is fundamentally strong
6542348 but if youre like me and youve got one house or you were like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so that they dont lose their home you might have a different perspective
6542349 what people are going through every single day here in america
6542350 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
6542351 does a guy who worries about the price of arugula and thinks regular people cling to guns and religion in the face of economic hardship really want to have a debate about whos in touch with regular americans
6542352 the reality is that barack obamas plans to raise taxes and opposition to producing more energy here at home as gas prices skyrocket show hes completely out of touch with the concerns of average americans
6542353 maybe youre struggling just to pay the mortgage on your home
6542354 then again that same day when asked how many houses he owns mccain lost track he couldnt remember well its seven seven houses
6542355 and heres one house america cant afford to let john mccain move into
6542356 from my perspective obama needs to introduce a game changer and fast before public opinion starts to gel around the notion that he is a phenom who deserves great respect but is not seasoned enough and would be too much of a risk in the oval office
6542357 its just unlike any other closing ceremony ive ever seen said neal executive vice president of nbc olympics usually a simple vehicle for extinguishing the olympic flame and setting the stage for the next games this years ceremony will have a great deal of entertainment he said
6542358 not everyone is working in solar or nanotechnology or solid state lighting but they turn up to the plenary sessions just to learn more about what is going on
6542359 the cross disciplinary reality of this meeting means that the solar plenary speaker is talking about nanotechnology the nano plenary speaker is talking about applications for solar and so on these links crop up everywhere throughout the week
6542360 i saw plenty of existing clients here and many new prospects
6542361 i came with a list of things i need to buy
6542362 what is nice about this exhibition compared to just looking on the internet is that if the booth youre visiting doesnt have what you need they will refer you to the booth across the aisle so you can find the best fit i get to speak to suppliers in person and everyone is very relaxed
6542363 solutions to these problems will require technical economic social and political skills
6542364 you can make a difference and i urge you to do so
6542365 freedom of conscience is not to be surrendered upon issuance of a medical degree
6542366 when we think they might be dying out or merely surviving they are actually thriving
6542367 they are moving into new states and settling or establishing new settlements in communities where local officials arent acquainted with them that creates some misunderstanding on zoning issues or other unique factors in amish practice
6542368 as they live their lives they really do not become very involved with government
6542369 one family doesnt go there is a group of them that goes like two or three or four
6542370 they can continue to let people know were here come visit us how the land is the orchards do great or whatever
6542371 an amish woman said we joke among ourselves if we keep growing at this rate soon half the world will be amish and the other half will be taxi drivers
6542372 our goal for the chevrolet cruze is to lead in fuel economy in this very competitive car segment
6542373 it never starts out brilliant it starts out ridiculed because its different

6542378 this c is totally unacceptable to me im an a student
6542379 im leaving early for my ski vacation so ill need to take the final early
6542380 hey i havent seen you in a while its good to have you back
6542381 but its getting better in fact the right it band feels tighter than the left today
6542382 you can run a little this week you can run every other day and no more than five miles at a time if you have intense pain though you need to stop right away
6542383 i have been sitting at my desk more then normally lately so i have
6542384 i agree with the comments about getting pants taken in if they are clothes you
6542385 another vote for a tailor even if the pants were only 20 its still cheaper to
6542386 obviously his strategists met on the portico of the mccain estate in sedona or maybe in one of his six other houses and decided what line of attack they were going to use
6542387 seven months of job losses for americans seven houses for mccain
6542388 the valley of the suns finest example of life beyond the expected

6542393 after making history as the first african american woman elected to congress from ohio the congresswoman worked to expand the rights of all americans
6542394 it wasnt enough for her just to break barriers in her own life obama said in a statement
6542395 she was also determined to bring opportunity to all those who had been overlooked and left behind and in stephanie they had a fearless friend and unyielding advocate
6542396 the release of this commemorative postage stamp in memory of khan saheb is a token of our nations and our governments respect for him and the noble tradition he represented
6542397 his music lives and endures beyond the boundaries of religion caste language and nation i respectfully pay homage to this great son of india
6542398 his legacy which is an integral part of our composite culture will continue to inspire many many generations to come
6542399 it is no exaggeration to say that his music was divine soothing the nerves and having a balming effect on people who listen to it the transformation of the shehnai from a mere accompanying piece in concerts to a respected instrument owes a lot to the creative endeavours of bismillah khan
6542400 a devout muslim he did not find any contradiction between his faith and music
6542401 we will have the best and brightest and by the way they dont have to be democrats
6542402 there are republicans like richard lugar the chairman of the senate foreign relations committee who is one of my dearest friends and advisers in the senate
6542403 she figured if george w bush can run the country so can she
6542404 surprisingly enough paris is really good when it comes to foreign policy shes been all over the world and has found herself in many uncomfortable situations as a socialite and reality tv star so she thinks she can handle the pressure
6542405 the best part it doesnt leave 20 pounds of crap on the street
6542406 one of my guy friends just got mugged recently but im still down here
6542407 they wouldnt let me in because i dont have my i d
6542408 if you want to get heard this is where you want to be

6542411 no longer can they be kind of i talk to the media i dont talk to anybody else i talk to big donors i dont talk to anybody else increasingly they recognize they have to talk to average people
6542412 obviously hes very excited to be back in the big leagues and to pitch for the club
6542413 his plan and his focus was to make it back this year and obviously he worked extremely hard to put himself in this position
6542414 its very important i wouldnt be able to do without it i had to order oil for my tank and i could only afford 300 and that only got me half a tank
6542415 without it id have to give up my home and ive spent 51 years in it and winters coming and were older
6542416 television viewing hurts the development of children under 3 years old and poses a certain number of risks encouraging passivity slow language acquisition over excitedness troubles with sleep and concentration as well as dependence on screens
6542417 watching television can slow the development of children under 3 even when it involves channels aimed specifically at them
6542418 we applaud frances decision to stop television channels from targeting infants and toddlers the ruling rightly recognizes the risks of fostering screen dependence upon babies it also sends an important message that in france the wellbeing of infants and toddlers is more important than the bottom line of companies such as babyfirsttv that exploit our youngest and most vulnerable children by falsely claiming to parents that their programming is educational frances historic ruling highlights the failure of the united states to effectively regulate the predatory baby media industry it has been more than two years since the campaign for a commercial free childhood filed a federal trade commission complaint against babyfirsttv for false and deceptive marketing yet the ftc has still not responded on french television programming for babies has been banned in this country we cannot even prevent the producers of television for babies from deceiving parents

6542420 the big 3 semiconductor spike predicted slowdown and genius advertising
6542421 we are very close we have a text but not the final agreement everything has been addressed
6542422 the us has gone very far in this agreement it is a very advanced agreement
6542423 redoubling efforts to bring it a deal to a final conclusion
6542424 it has taken us a very long time but we are very very close to close this agreement
6542425 still issues concerning exactly how our forces will operate i think that is only natural at this point
6542426 we are continuing to work to make sure that any timeline aspirational timelines that are in the agreement really do reflect what we believe and what is reasonable
6542427 its not a treaty so it would not require senate ratification or anything like that
6542428 fa am o que digo n o fa am o que fa o
6542429 actualmente las autoridades est n haciendo una obstrucci n a la labor de la defensa aqu no se ha permitido que nuestros consultores t cnicos tengan acceso a los hallazgos de la exhumaci n y eso es necesario para poder realizar nuestra actividad jur dica
6542430 nuestros consultores deben tener acceso a los rastros seos al tubo del cr neo y a todos esos elementos que nos van a permitir no solamente establecer una l nea de acci n sino colaborar con la b squeda de la verdad
6542431 la fiscal a dice que nos autoriza pero cuando hemos llegado en tres oportunidades a la medicatura forense de los teques nos niegan el acceso los trabajadores de ah dicen que la fiscal a no los ha autorizado
6542432 estamos trayendo un escrito formal ante el ministerio p blico para que esta situaci n cese de inmediato no se obstruya nuestra actividad y se prosiga la investigaci n con la colaboraci n que al menos de parte nuestra siempre hemos tenido con el ministerio p blico de forma irrestricta
6542433 no tiene ning n tipo de restricci n para recibir visitas ni tampoco para el ejercicio de su actividad profesional tiene sus visitas normales la presencia policial no falta por orden judicial y seg n la decisi n del tribunal se trata de una medida de naturaleza cautelar
6542434 deben estar en sinton a de lo que ocurri en la realidad
6542435 se tiene que determinar si se cometi el delito o no se cometi y cu l fue el sitio del suceso se hace referencia que el parque caiza fue el sitio de liberaci n del cad ver y hay evidencia cierta que apunta a ello ahora que el consultorio sea el sitio del suceso es algo que a nuestra manera de ver no est acreditado
6542436 i think setting an artificial timetable for withdrawal is a significant mistake it is it sends and bad signals to the region and to the iraqi citizens listen the iraqis are wondering whether or not were going to stay to help people in america wonder whether or not theyve got the political will to do the hard work
6542437 and if the congress wants to test my will as to whether or not ill accept the timetable for withdrawal i wont accept one i just dont think its in the interest of our troops i think it im just envisioning what it would be like to be a young soldier in the middle of iraq and realizing that politicians have all of a sudden made military determinations and in my judgment that would put a kid in harms way more so than he or she already is
6542438 theres a temptation to let the politics at home get in the way with the considered judgment of the commanders
6542439 in the area of security cooperation the president and the prime minister agreed that improving conditions should allow for the agreements now under negotiation to include a general time horizon for meeting aspirational goals
6542440 freedom of conscience is not to be surrendered upon issuance of a medical degree

6542449 when people come into our custody we have an obligation to protect the people that do come in from each other to protect the community from escape so thats why the security is important
6542450 this has to run just like a bricks and mortar jail might
6542451 we have to plan in case we would need it
6542452 no ones going to be here more than a few hours
6542453 the purpose of that is so everybody that is arrested in denver that week is treated the same
6542454 our goal is to get them through here quickly and to the courthouse where they will have access to lawyers
6542455 how can any progressive look themselves in the mirror after the election if mccain wins and they have not devoted at least some time to the obama campaign
6542456 i promise to appoint more justices to the supreme court like roberts

6542458 la posibilidad de un conflicto entre rusia y occidente inquieta a los inversores

6542460 el niega cualquier situaci n en el delito que se le imputa
6542461 expectativas poco probables si tomamos en cuenta que el fin priorizado de estas gestiones no parece ser otro que la preservaci n del poder pol tico a toda costa y a cualquier precio
6542462 es demasiado abarcadora y ubicua para poder delimitar un antes y un despu s entre ambas administraciones
6542463 las m s apremiantes expectativas en la direcci n de los cambios esperados
6542464 hasta ahora el peso principal de las reformas est fundamentalmente dentro de las categor as econ micas y no pol ticas
6542465 parecen afectadas por una especie de s ndrome de la nostalgia por el fracaso del socialismo real y por la desaparecida uni n sovi tica
6542466 nuevas bajas de notas son posibles en los bancos estadounidenses que est n tal vez peor que en la mitad de la crisis
6542467 la pregunta que tratamos de responder es qu bancos tendr n la flexibilidad financiera suficiente para generar problemas muy graves en los pr ximos siete u ocho trimestres
6542468 lo cierto es que estamos enfrentando una situaci n sin precedentes y la flexibilidad financiera en forma de capacidad de captar capitales o a vender activos ser crucial en esta instancia
6542469 lo m s probable es que sta se centre nuevamente en la incapacidad para controlar la inflaci n exceptuando el incremento de las tasas de inter s de forma tard a y draconiana
6542470 en otras palabras esos mercados emergentes flexibilizaron su pol tica monetaria cuando al mismo tiempo su econom a crec a r pidamente y todav a m s r pidamente en el caso de los productores de petr leo no es una buena idea
6542471 vine a ratificar mi declaraci n anterior me gustar a saber si el ministerio p blico que est cumpliendo una petici n de landaeta y quiere saber c mo recib las actas tiene el mismo inter s de saber qu piensan de esas actas el ex fiscal isa as rodr guez gumer quintana maikel moreno belkis cede o el juez florencio cilano los fiscales yoraco bauza gilberto landaeta que estuvieron involucrados en un caso que dej unos muertos en el camino unos presos y otros a n exilados
6542472 as tenga que meter preso a un ex fiscal general de la rep blica
6542473 lo importante es que el ministerio p blico nos diga si la experticia que realizaron demuestra que estaban forjadas y si estaban forjadas que se asuma que contaminan todo el expediente del caso de danilo anderson
6542474 pareciera que hay alguien que quiere enredar este caso porque en realidad la familia anderson quiere saber qui n mat al fiscal globovisi n y los venezolanos queremos saberlo los familiares de los presos los perseguidos los hostigados de terrorismo y asesinato tambi n quieren saberlo
6542475 creo que en alg n momento tendr que darle la cara a la justicia porque aqu se ve que hubo un libreto y que hay fiscales que se contradicen en este caso hay de todo afortunadamente en la fiscal a veo que citaron a isa as rodr guez y a landaeta lo malo es que va un poquito lento

6542496 i was completely shocked that now three years after it had happened to me were coming back to this
6542497 i would never even have thought that this was an option
6542498 the pharmacist clearly said to me that she would not fill either of my prescriptions because of her personal belief
6542499 this regulation is not about contraception its about abortion and conscience
6542500 the issue i asked to be addressed in this regulation is not abortion or contraceptives but the legal right medical practitioners have to practice according to their conscience and patients should be able to choose a doctor who has beliefs like his or hers
6542501 an early draft of the regulations found its way into public circulation before it had reached my review it contained words that lead some to conclude my intent is to deal with the subject of contraceptives somehow defining them as abortion not true

6542515 they say to me look the board of supervisors in san francisco has become a zoo present parties excepted
6542516 the main problem that were experiencing in san francisco is a very very basic issue
6542517 and that is can the people that are entrusted with making the laws in san francisco can these people get along and figure out ways to use the legislative process not for personal political reasons not for pay back not for any of that
6542518 but rather to use the legislative authority and power that they have to forward policy in san francisco for the betterment of san franciscans
6542519 i dont think the board of supervisors has been doing that and i want to be elected in order to bring a fresh face to san francisco politics to see if we can figure out ways and solutions you know a lot of supervisors from the far left to the far right have some great ideas
6542520 but these ideas are getting lost in some of the venom and in some of the personal ideologies some of the personalities

6542627 we have obviously also suffered casualties because of the summer offensive
6542628 we have always expected there to be a summer offensive because of the fact that there was very little of a spring offensive
6542629 its a summer offensive of the taliban we will see that happening but in our view our strategy will be to build up the afghan army to build up the rest of afghan society

6542643 wind power projects are set up for different reasons claiming depreciation benefits within first year of operations is one of them

6542709 i knew that there would definitely be an end to donna at the end of the series
6542710 but had that not been the case had it been open ended had there been potential for donna to stay on for another series i must confess that id have said yes like a shot
6542711 could donna come back well in science fiction anything is possible
6542712 theres so much interest in them and whats happening now is people end up paying top price for them anyway
6542713 probably the reverse is now true and they see it as a marketing tactic and it may actually not be a mortgagee property at all
6542714 real estate agents will pick up on anything to get a sale and if they think more and more people are after mortgagee sales theyll call it anything to get a sale theyll use any tactic
6542715 it makes me a wee bit suspicious when theyre passed in are they genuine mortgagee sales
6542716 there could well be the perception that you will get a bargain its not necessarily the case
6542717 i think that would be a very dangerous way to advertise things expectations would be altered
6542718 broadly speaking anything that misleads could possibly be a breach of the act it may be something that were interested in

6542729 the board has asked that i look into the issue and determine if an additional site is necessary or feasible
6542730 they want to take a closer look to make sure its a possibility
6542731 the only thing they have to do is provide the necessary information and the request should be approved we are anticipating a huge turnout and we want everyone to have an opportunity to participate so we are encouraging counties to take advantage of this offer
6542732 if they are offering to pay then well certainly make the effort to open another voting site
6542733 if it will make voting more accessible then well go after it
6542734 i cannot wrap my mind around any public servant that wouldnt be willing to be very very creative in setting up opportunities for citizens to save money and to allow residents more opportunity to express their right to vote and the state is offering to pay i dont understand the hesitation
6542735 but i am in support of looking into the possibility hopefully something will come from it it would make voting easier for a lot of our residents
6542736 anything county governments can do to open more sites or extend hours will be important

6542738 we cant come to terms with what weve gone through
6542739 it feels unreal within a day my wife and i show up at the hospital our daughter is born and declared dead later we find out she is still alive and a few hours later we are told again that she is dead
6542740 i showed up at the intensive care unit and saw that she was dead my wife will suffer from this and well have to deal with it im sure shell need psychological help
6542741 i believe environmental leadership is at the heart of our prosperity as a nation
6542742 i was disappointed that native american foods were not discussed and not even really covered
6542743 its really an inspiring concept to be able to teach native cuisine
6542744 all those foods were not in the dna of native americans for a millennia
6542745 i have always been fascinated by the fact that until 400 years ago there were no tomatoes potatoes corn or vanilla in europe
6542746 we will give the young native american cooks pride in their heritage there are just not enough of them

6542771 planning conducting and reviewing a geographically distributed training exercise involving two coalition forces
6542772 any training exercise or simex which enables junior leaders and soldiers to make tactical decisions based on processing information and events around them allows us to train and develop creative adaptive leaders and units

6542795 there was an altercation involving an unknown male who obviously threw something through a window
6542796 there was a smash it the object must have been alight because it ignited the curtains and the house went up
6542797 i was there eight minutes later and it was just destroyed
6542798 through their heroics they entered there and retrieved one male who was nearly unconscious he was unable to get out on his own
6542799 they went back in to retrieve the woman couldnt find her and they found she gained access to the rear of the premises and was in the back yard
6542800 we wont know what he threw through the window until the forensics get there we dont know if he had some sort of accelerant or if things just went up themselves
6542801 certainly weve done it with lord of the rings weve extended beyond the movies there we did it with james bond for a while i dont know what well do with harry potter itd be fun to i think theres more stories that we can tell

6542803 the technology has moved on so much when we were first making those games we were making it for playstation 1 and now weve got you know the wii i think theres opportunities to revisit stories
6542804 we have to figure out whether anyone wants to buy those or not
6542805 the reality is that were focused on the movie games
6542806 we havent really thought about what were going to do yet but its going to be really exciting
6542807 obviously its a great opportunity to make two games but i want to make sure we make two great games we dont know how close those movies are going to be how far apart theyre going to be and where theyre going to cut them in half

6542843 its a little like looking in someones family photo album
6542844 the pictures might not be all that good looking and representing people at their best but what you are seeing is the real people living in nashville that is pretty much how i get to hear songs when i go out i am usually hearing the person who wrote the songs play them for me personally the way i want to hear music is done by the people who wrote them but maybe thats just because its a way to compare crafts notes and things
6542845 right from the very get go i wanted the song to be from the point of view of the iceberg
6542846 i imagined the iceberg singing this song its your typical love song about the wrong people getting together only in this case it just happens to be an iceberg and a luxury liner

6542856 we may do it again if we feel like it but this time around we wanted people to focus on the music and not the spectacle
6542857 it felt good to be able to go back between then and now on tour and see the reception and acknowledgement of both records not just the first one it allowed us to sort of bear witness to our fans it felt like the bond with the fans solidified this time around
6542858 we have a pretty diversified portfolio but i do believe thats a first for us
6542859 more than just trying to do something new we were trying to do things we didnt get to completely do on the first record
6542860 we went in with a lot more self awareness and certainty this time we knew what we were doing
6542861 its not something thats very introspective its usually a reenactment of whatever experience im addressing its something i survived or something that rings true to me as a common experience its never so personal that it cant pertain to someone elses life if its about pain ultimately pain is pain to everyone
6542862 that was unconscionable to do we didnt even try i think people wouldve been disappointed if we had people might initially miss that theres not a big hit record on there like crazy but if there was any failed attempt at that magnitude of a song again it wouldve spoiled an otherwise solid album
6542863 i was so used to moderacy over my 15 year career so it was surprising
6542864 but at the same time i was poised for it by that point i did feel like it was well earned and deserved and instead of causing me to be frantic or panicked i could be more like steel and just bask in the moment of it
6542865 i was misquoted once saying i didnt like billys version

6542875 the icc is going to cut across some very environmentally sensitive areas
6542876 if youre going to go ahead and build a six lane highway you might as well add a 10 foot bike path to it

6542904 its not the normal championship type effort but you are going to have your good years and your bad years and you have to balance them all out

6542907 once everyone admitted it to themselves that we needed to try a bit harder that was the first step
6542908 theres a lot going on behind the scenes right now
6542909 its a continued effort to find little things here and there
6542910 i dont think its going to be one little thing that puts us back in the mix its hard work commitment and the belief that we can get it done and get back to the top
6542911 my approach was simple when we won the championship it was consistency
6542912 we had nine finishes in the top 10 in the last 10 races and even though its a shorter quick run in the last 10 races its the same mentality and philosophy for 36 races and that is just go out there and get the best finish you can
6542913 you might want to take a few less risks but thats tough for a 24 year old to digest
6542914 cheb do you want to tell johnson how proud you are of her new tooth
6542915 im not a mean person snail i wont be mean to you
6542916 je vais voir aujourdhui il a couru hier d j mais il ne sest m me pas encore entra n avec le groupe il doit au moins le faire une fois pour voir sil est tout fait r tabli

6542921 je pense que la finale sera contre alexey tishchenko champion olympique russe 2004 des plume pass en l ger ndlr tout le monde attend ce combat cuba
6542922 le contexte sera forc ment diff rent de leur dernier combat
6542923 comme il est parti il est capable daller au bout tout est permis avec lui
6542924 most likely it will be old structures quiet and cozy little corners walls with surprising graffiti in a word real moscow which we dont notice in the bustle of everyday life
6542925 the main principle is to seek and find that which is truly interesting to the residents of a mega lopolis
6542926 the main goal of the project is to get people interested in the city environment to seek the beautiful places that are here next to us to share our discoveries with others the city is much more interesting and diverse than it seems at first sight and through this project we want to reveal it to its residents
6542927 we know we are more than just neurons firing or at least we think we are while the neurons are firing
6542928 you train your whole life and you want to win
6542929 if people want to assess the blame to me thats ok i mean i can take whatever it is that people are going to dish out
6542930 we had good chemistry the hand was back there she was there i dont know what happened
6542931 its an amazing thing to have an olympic medal but we had the game like we had it in our grasp and we let it slip away
6542932 on kolomenskaya naberezhnaya in the region of building 18 a motorcyclist riding a foreign made motorcycle hit five pedestrians while going at a high speed as a result four people died before the ambulances arrival
6542933 in addition to employing energy saving light bulbs in the entryways of residential buildings we can install an automatic system of electric lighting in this manner the light will not shine in the entryways all the time but will turn itself on only either when a person enters the area or when it is dark outside
6542934 however currently there are only two special models of cell phones whose sim cards allow writing off the sum equal to the cost of a ride on the metro
6542935 the most effective way to get rid of hogweed is to spray the area with such chemicals as glyphosate and triclopyr another way is to cut down all the hogweed and plant something else in its place so the seeds of the killer plant cant grow back
6542936 if the hogweed venom gets on your skin immediately rinse off the wound with plenty of water after that keep the wounded area away from direct sunlight for as long as a month since some of the venom takes that long to work its way out of your system
6542937 the future of our relations with russia will depend on the concrete actions russia will take
6542938 as long as russian forces are occupying a part of georgia i cannot see a russia nato council convening
6542939 by defending saakashvili they were defending a man who has not only compromised his state but who has compromised nato
6542940 i asked our colleagues in brus sels what would you do in russias place if in the middle of the night an army destroyed over a thousand of your citizens and shoots at your peacekeepers point blank
6542941 they tell me we would have done the same thing everyone understands but western democracy is like a cold wizened snake that hisses but doesnt bite i know that there were states that spoke out for objectivity and moderation in assessing our actions in the caucasus region but publicly they spoke in the same vein as con doleezza rice i would like to personally thank italys foreign minister who was not afraid to say in public what he had said behind closed doors
6542942 there is a very strange attitude in europe towards the cis
6542943 since 1991 we have tried to raise the cis issue with our european partners but today we can easily say that de facto the commonwealth of independent states as an organization is unrecognized by the european union
6542944 the cis had a lot of potential for identification and organization saakashvilis intent to leave it is a blow to the population of georgia on many fronts and i dont rule out that georgia might rethink its decision and take a softer stance in the near future

6542977 always check in the code even if it doesnt work or isnt finished youll still be able to change it later
6542978 perhaps what we need is a model of software accretion start with a tiny fragment of code that does almost nothing look on the bright side code that does nothing cant have many bugs test it and check it in add one more small feature test that feature and check it in add another small feature test that and check it in daily hourly even you always have functional software
6542979 perhaps what we need is a model of software accretion start with a tiny fragment of code that does almost nothing add one more small feature add another small feature
6542980 working out of a directory that is periodicly backed up is all you really need to do for backups
6542981 always check in the code even if it doesnt work or isnt finished youll still be able to change it later
6542982 damn now i really cant afford to throw away all this work
6542983 id much rather have empty stubs and basic api skeletons in place than nothing at all i can integrate my code against stubs i can do code review on stubs i can even help you build out the stubs

6542985 more than once a day regardless of whether you have a useful complete tested feature unit of code
6542986 the same is with centralized version control systems developers are forced to take small steps and work closely with their fellow developers you cant go off in a corner and make a masterpiece of programming art you have to work with everyone everyone sees everything youre doing you cant hide

6542993 two years ago obama bought a mansion on the south side in the kenwood neighborhood from a doctor on the same day antoin tony rezkos wife rita rezko bought the vacant lot next door from the same seller the doctor had listed the properties for sale together he sold the house to obama for 300 000 below the asking price the doctor got his asking price on the lot from rezkos wife
6542994 on the same day obama closed on his house rezkos wife bought the adjacent empty lot meeting the condition of the seller who wanted to sell both properties at the same time
6542995 later the obamas bought a 10 foot by 150 foot piece of the lot for 104 500 an appraisal put the value of the strip at 40 500 a spokesman said but obama considered it fair to pay one sixth of the original price for one sixth of the lot
6542996 a federal jury today convicted developer antoin tony rezko of corruption charges for trading on his clout as a top adviser and fundraiser to gov rod blagojevich rezkos guilty verdict on 16 of 24 corruption counts could have broad repercussions for blagojevich who made rezko a central player in his kitchen cabinet it could also prove a political liability for u s sen barack obama who once counted rezko as a friend and fundraiser as the likely democratic presidential nominee heads into the general election campaign against republican john mccain the jury convicted rezko of wire and mail fraud money laundering and aiding and abetting bribery he was acquitted of attempted extortion
6542997 when obama and his wife michelle a hospital executive decided to move with their two young girls from their hyde park condominium they chose a spacious three story georgian revival home on a tree lined street in the kenwood neighborhood not far from the university of chicago the owner had listed the house nearly 100 years old with four fireplaces and a wine cellar and an adjacent lot as separate parcels
6542998 as a state senator barack obama wrote letters to city and state officials supporting his political patron tony rezkos successful bid to get more than 14 million from taxpayers to build apartments for senior citizens
6542999 obamas letters written nearly nine years ago for the first time show the democratic presidential hopeful did a political favor for rezko a longtime friend campaign fund raiser and client of the law firm where obama worked who was indicted last fall on federal charges that accuse him of demanding kickbacks from companies seeking state business under gov blagojevich
6543000 one of them was sen barack obama d ill who was offered a job by rezko in the early 1990s while a top student at
6543001 this was discussed a lot they wanted to have a good
6543002 for the first time sen barack obama put a figure friday to the amount of campaign contributions that indicted political fund raiser tony rezko raised for the senators campaigns and the number about 250 000 was far more than he previously acknowledged
6543003 wed obama and rezko continue to have lunches or breakfasts wed talk about politics wed talk about family
6543004 in terms of other than lunch or breakfast he and i had socially michelle and i probably had a couple of dinners or two or three dinners with rezko and his wife during the course of this six or seven or eight years

6543010 given the real time news cycle we live in today many important issues and controversies that impact our country simply do not receive the time and examination they deserve we are in this for the long haul and look forward to engaging on a broad range of issues well beyond the campaign
6543011 the launch of our immediate advocacy effort is a direct response to barack obamas rejection of public financing which will allow the liberal 527s and other leftist organizations to dramatically outspend conservatives this election cycle
6543012 i dont regret setting bombs i feel we didnt do enough
6543013 this may be the best researched most thoroughly documented ad in history
6543014 when the american public fully understands the close continuing relationship between their potential president and a remorseless domestic terrorist we believe it will send a chill down their spines
6543015 even more to the point the u s corporate average fleet efficiency cafe standard prescribes a maximum fuel consumption rate for cars sold in the united states the federal government assesses a penalty of us 5 for every 0 1 mile per gallon 0 04 kilometer per liter below 27 5 mi gal 8 55 l 100 km on every car the manufacturer sells a 200 w electrical load accounts for about 0 4 km l in the ftp 75 cycle test so if a manufacturer is delivering 25 mi gal 9 41 l 100 km cars for example it can justify spending more per vehicle on components to improve electrical efficiency

6543021 when the moment comes when youre absolutely desperate and youre pretty sure youre never going to be able to do what youve always wanted to do dont right on schedule
6543022 how i got to this point is kind of a meandering path but ive discovered that many women who go into science dont take a traditional route
6543023 growing up i was very interested in science partially because of my older brother it formed a basis for having something in common my older brother would otherwise ignore me except for the fact that we could talk about science
6543024 by the time i was in middle school i started imagining the kinds of things i would do with my life
6543025 i got a bachelors degree in physics at mit then joined the peace corps in africa when i was a kid listening to kennedy you either wanted to be a peace corps volunteer or an astronaut and so peace corps was always something that had been a dream of mine
6543026 but i also realized once i got my bachelors degree that i didnt know the mechanisms of how graduate school worked things like how it was paid for or whether i needed to go straight into graduate school after my bachelors my family hadnt done phds we hadnt done graduate school so there was a little sense that i was going into uncharted territory
6543027 it has had its occasional difficulties and socially it had its difficulties discount the fact that having an easy social environment helps a lot
6543028 i had one professor who would start every lecture with well boys
6543029 im sure he was unconscious of it on his part but i was a little sensitive to it at the time he probably has no idea that he used to start his lectures that way
6543030 in practical terms it was a bit of a hindrance when i would go into my junior physics lab a classroom of 30 people nearly all of them men and everybody had to team up in pairs
6543031 i had one professor who would start every lecture with well boys
6543032 i think they were just intimidated to actually go up and talk to the one woman in the room but at the time i thought nobody wants me
6543033 the good news is if you want to impact that someone like me is living proof that this is a door that women are allowed to walk through
6543034 thinking back its not so surprising that this old peace corps volunteer has a component her that makes her think she should be giving back to the world
6543035 my students that i taught in africa had very little prospect of ever going to college very little prospect of ever having any material wealth in life
6543036 and so the real reason i do it isnt sociological or anything else its simply to share and to open a door
6543037 i have to admit i am privileged to be able to work on some of the greatest missions of our century
6543038 the first piece of advice i would give to anyone is find out what you love and do it then share that joy of what you love with the people around you
6543039 the second thing ive learned it that when the moment comes where youre absolutely desperate and youre pretty sure youre never going to be able to do what youve always wanted to right on schedule its
6543040 if you feel inadequate youre also right on schedule i struggle with that feeling every day but i prefer to deal with it after im done with work for the day
6543041 it helps if you just broaden your context its bigger than you its bigger than your institution and its bigger than your mission
6543042 if you feel inadequate youre also right on schedule i struggle with that feeling every day but i prefer to deal with it after im done with work for the day
6543043 day to day we get tired but at the end of the day you have to take a much longer view of how hard this day was or how hard this week was or even how hard this mission was think bigger than that
6543044 one of the things that jwst is designed to do is to look at the most distant objects you can see
6543045 if you want to see the earliest objects in the universe first of all you need to realize that theyre going to be faint because theyre so distant so you need to have a big telescope with a big mirror to collect the light the mirror on jwst is 21 feet in diameter
6543046 the second thing you need to realize is that the objects furthest away are moving
6543047 so if i wish to look at the very first galaxies i know that i need a big mirror and an observatory that can see infrared light so the science youre after drives the design once you know what science you want to do you can define the instrument that you need to do it
6543048 one of the most interesting areas of research that the jwst will help us to perform is to look at the origin of life using the light that is shining through a distant planets atmosphere we can actually start to diagnose the atmosphere of the planet but not only could we diagnose the atmosphere with the jwst we could also look for an atmosphere that is potentially carrying signatures of life
6543049 its smith who cant be trusted with our wallets 48 billion for iraqs reconstruction 18 billion in tax breaks for big oil a 9 trillion national debt thats gordon smiths record
6543050 is the one who cant be trusted with oregonians hard earned tax dollars
6543051 portland pollster tim hibbitts said while the ads by the national democrats are a boost to merkleys campaign they also indicate that the democrats are worried that smiths constant hammering on the furniture issue is hurting merkley
6543052 this is the first merkley ad that hits the mark
6543053 it rightly mocks furniture gate and quickly moves on to substantive policy issues where smith has been dead wrong
6543054 well darn it all that ad doesnt attack the harm done with conservative voters it just muddies with water with more negativity
6543055 why cant an ad just go to point and tell the truth the under budget 34 million state capitol project was fiscally conservative going for the long haul with good quality furniture made in the prison industries program the payment then was the legislature taking money out of one pocket and putting it into another pocket in our state e g the prison budget

6543081 i studied adverts in the new york times from 1850 where there were no 99 endings to the 1870s and 1880s where they started to appear although department stores were doing it which would fit with the cash register hypothesis they were advertising discounts but for the regular price they would use a round number

6543083 let us now classify just and unjust actions generally starting from what follows
6543084 god has left all men free nature has made none a slave
6543085 by nature we all equally possess with all respect the same origin both greeks and barbarians
6543086 i came home when the war ended socrates and am now living here
6543087 since we have lost our foreign property and my father left me nothing in attica i am forced to settle down here now and work for my living with my hands i think its better than begging especially as i have no security to offer for a loan
6543088 and how long will you have the strength do you think to earn your living by your work
6543089 but remember when you get old you will have to spend money and nobody will be willing to pay you for your labour
6543090 then it would be better to take up some kind of work at once that will assure you a competence when you get old and to go to somebody who is better off and wants an assistant and get a return for your services by acting as his bailiff helping to get in his crops and looking after his property
6543091 but surely those who control their cities and take charge of public affairs are thought more respectable not more slavish on that account
6543092 briefly socrates i have no inclination to expose myself to any mans censure
6543093 but you see eutherus it is by no means easy to find a post in which one is not liable to censure whatever one does it is difficult to avoid mistakes and it is difficult to escape unfair criticism even if one makes no mistakes i wonder if you find it easy to avoid complaints entirely even from your peasant employers you should try therefore to have no truck with grumblers and to attach yourself to considerate masters to undertake such duties as you can perform and beware of any that are too much for you and whatever you do to give of your best and put your heart into the business in this way i think you are most likely to escape censure find relief from your difficulties live in ease and security and obtain an ample competence for old age
6543094 its not really a war its an attack peoples lives have been devastated

6543100 the most intelligent and enlightened means of regulating any form of consumer good is a two part process the first part is to place responsibility on the producer to make sure that the market is aware and educated on the qualities of its product the second is to place responsibility on the consumer to once thusly informed and educated to use the product responsibly upon acquirement

6543104 this is a serious subject and its a roomful of serious people who have taken it in that manner certainly there are additional discussions that we will have tomorrow
6543105 but for our part we continue to believe that this is a very important initiative and we remain committed to achieving an outcome that is both a net benefit for the non proliferation regime and that meets indias energy needs
6543106 i think there is a lot of support for this internationally and so i remain optimistic that were going to be able to be successful in this process

6543113 my husband is the sweetest nicest person in the whole world
6543114 i ve achieved what i came here for and none can take it away
6543115 that surely takes the pressure off my shoulders and i ll be in a free state of mind tomorrow
6543116 but that does not mean i ll just go through the motions tomorrow it will be the same vigour and the intensity too would remain same i m going for the gold
6543117 he must be considered like jesse owens in the 1930 s
6543118 however he still has to mature he is a young man but he should show more respect for his rivals that would be more in the spirit of the olympic ideal
6543119 he should shake hands with them after the finish line however he is only 21 and he will learn
6543120 i have no problems with his showboating prior to the race but a shake of the hand or a tap on the shoulder immediately after the race would be a good gesture
6543121 it would be good not to have a repeat of the catch me if you can gesture
6543122 bolt set it off after that i just think the jamaican camp went crazy
6543123 if people want to assess the blame to me that s ok i mean i can take whatever it is that people are going to dish out
6543124 we had good chemistry the hand was back there she was there i don t know what happened
6543125 then i went to grab it and there was nothing it s kind of the way it s been happening to me this olympics
6543126 but i know it s my job to get the guy the baton and i didn t do that
6543127 provisionally suspended by the fei further to doping medication control tests that indicated the present of capsaicin in each horse
6543128 we are all very nervous here and it was very difficult to concentrate on the wrestling
6543129 we are all sportsmen here and we do not deal with politics
6543130 definitely you don t want to look up too much because you lose the ball if rain is dropping in your eyes
6543131 i think it s harder to be a fan than a player in the rain this is the reason why we play in bathing suits
6543132 we were relaxed and we delivered our best performance today
6543133 but you can see the us team are very strong they are a lot better than us so to take them close was the best we could do
6543134 they have such a bright future ahead of them i don t think they should be disappointed
6543135 you want to end up on top but to have two china teams on the podium with all the teams we ve had to face they should be very proud of themselves
6543136 the leukemia has taught me to think step by step
6543137 when you are in hospital and feeling so much pain and feeling so tired you don t want to want to think about the next day or week
6543138 it teaches you to be patient when you are lying in a hospital bed and that was almost the same strategy i chose here to wait for my chance in the pack
6543139 it s going to take a while for it to sink in
6543140 i gave it everything and now i have something to show for it it s a once in a lifetime experience
6543141 i was shattered at the finish i just wanted a lie down and have a sleep but before i knew it i was on a stretcher
6543142 i was adament this time last year i wasn t going to do it but i might have a rethink now and i have to work on my tactics a lot more
6543143 i knew maarten finished well so i was trying to stay with him
6543144 i had to battle with the group with 700 metres to go and i lost a lot of strength in the fight to stay in the race that cost me silver but i am happy with bronze

6543166 cifras por todos lados y desgraciadamente no existe una metodolog a que pueda llevar a conocer los verdaderos n meros
6543167 en algunas metodolog as cuando se empiezan a contabilizar los plagios encontramos que llegan a contar un mismo secuestro tres cuatro cinco seis veces entonces tambi n esa supuesta cifra negra se ve inflada por las t cnicas que no son las m s adecuadas para eso

6543180 no one is coming in and scoring 18 touchdowns we dont have the offense to do that anyway a lot of guys in college they havent seen the complex coverages they see in this league

6543182 he has a lot of pride and he puts too much pressure on himself
6543183 if he learns to relax and just play he knows the play but he talks himself out of it so theres always doubt when he knows it he plays real fast and you see the skill when hes not sure he looks like a rookie
6543184 i try to stay away from prepping him so much
6543185 you got to learn a lot on the fly the more things he goes through the more hes starting to open up now and come talk to me about different things hes seeing and how hes adjusting
6543186 he gets so down that he ends up frustrating himself

6543194 the nature of the campaign is changing less than a week before the convention starts
6543195 obama felt he was sitting with dr phil and he was trying not to offend anybody mccain seemed to understand he was running for president his answers were more direct and aimed at the electorate
6543196 the primaries are preseason you can make mistakes but now were into the first game that really counts
6543197 obamas folks are reading their own press clippings too much and theyve got to understand theyre in a dogfight
6543198 the party is very bad at labeling things that provide an umbrella for other positive memories

6543211 i think id rather have my dog have my dog have me try to rescue her than try to eat a puppy
6543212 from the time we were introduced to the puppies to the time we actually started the competition it was about three hours it was about 105 degrees that day in the beginning when bella saw the puppies she went darting toward them she was so excited three hours later she could care less it was so hot no dog wanted to be out there presley got overheated star got overheated
6543213 im so short i couldnt see where she was at all and it was very hard to navigate her and where she was
6543214 soulmate shes part of everything i do shes my muse and my mentor she inspires me daily i dont know where id be in my life without her we rescued each other shes my world
6543215 im funny and goofy but im not a total spaz like that they the producers wanted to make a character i get it
6543216 i take better care of bella than i do myself
6543217 i would hope every person in america reading this would do the same for their dogs because health and nutrition is so important and people take that for granted
6543218 it was completely premeditated on her part to go out there and throw me under the bus
6543219 in no way shape or form was i hurting my dog whatsoever
6543220 those yelps were voiceover yelps thats not even how my dog yelps so they were trying to make a story about it
6543221 some of the best trick dogs on that show sometimes just said im just going to sit here and not listen to you right now
6543222 ive completely come around and i understand the nuances of dogs
6543223 i guess it was our time to go painting was definitely not our thing i dont know how that relates to being the greatest dog
6543224 they were trying to really encourage us to teach our dogs these new things that were so foreign to them in such a short amount of time and he was exhausted
6543225 i went there to have a good time with preston and escape my crazy life in show business
6543226 i really was focused on making the experience fun for him i was so fortunate to have 40 days to hang out with my best friend preston
6543227 to be able to wake up every day and not have to think of anything but is my dog happy and today i get to play with my dog and 11 other incredible animals was just such a joy and i feel so lucky to have that opportunity
6543228 it was difficult to keep some sense of normalcy for your dog and make sure they stayed on their normal feeding schedule
6543229 finding the balance between work and rest and play was really important to me
6543230 is a very thoughtful good human being who has become a very dear friend of mine since we first went on this journey together
6543231 the fact that travis and i are both in los angeles were both in the industry and our dogs both adore each other we had so much fun together
6543232 travis and i are getting to know each other were very close we went to the dog museum the other day we took our dogs surfing we went to a dodgers game and caught a foul ball
6543233 i cant say that were dating but were definitely close
6543234 i felt bad the way it was cut together made it seem like there was a big thing between the two of us everybody had noticed bella had cried out of course she knows her own dog so if she says shes working through her issues its not my position to judge i wasnt the only one who said something to the judges its just the way the show was cut they really tried to play up travis and my alleged showmance and have some big traumatic ending like we hated each other
6543235 my fiance is the stern dad who she likes to play with all the time its unfortunate he couldnt be on the show with us because she listens to everything he says she just likes to be a little brat to me
6543236 when we got home you should have seen how her face lit up
6543237 but shes definitely going to be in all the pictures its going to be beacons day too
6543238 its like having a little child im the mother and hes the father and shes the baby were just a happy family
6543239 i couldnt understand why one of my friends was talking to someone we werent supposed to like
6543240 as far as the other two go i really dont care what they say a lot of things they said to me was the total opposite of everything my trainers have told me like manipulating my dog to sit
6543241 shes really mean shes just conniving and evil thats what i personally think im glad im not in the house any more to have to deal with that i dont even see the need to ever talk to her again she claims she is the

6543338 i didnt quite get there in the end i only got four which is okay there were a couple of bad misses today
6543339 today i nearly got back to my best it took me a while to hit my straps again which is a bit of a pain because its the olympics and its the pinnacle of the hockey calendar
6543340 its obviously not where we wanted to be and we think were a far better side than where we ended up we didnt quite get a couple of results in pool play and weve only have ourselves to blame for that
6543341 but we dont beat pakistan very often theyre quite a good side on their day

6543365 the sudden shutdown of the coos bay line of the corp railroad by railamerica has created great uncertainty for companies in this region
6543366 this uncertainty cannot continue and the answer is that rail service must be restored to do anything less is unfair and unjust for the citizens in this community who rely on this railroad to provide for themselves and their families
6543367 after many attempts by the state to be a partner it is my opinion that the only option for the board at this time is to adopt the port of coos bay feeder line application

6543428 he understands what publishers are challenged with in terms of the business issues related to inventory management and pricing and yield optimization and thats a critical area for us
6543429 the marketplace kind of always pigeonholed us a measurement company
6543430 we believe that the definition of audience data and how its applied has to be completely rethought

6543442 why are there so many people driving around during the day
6543443 we are still operating on the presumption that this young boy is alive said essex district attorney jonathan blodgett whose office along with lynn and massachusetts state police have been leading the search since sunday afternoon
6543444 the company has been very cooperative he said of investigators requests for information about his work duties at the plant
6543445 we do not believe he had a significant other or friend that would be helpful in this regard blodgett said
6543446 it is our duty to keep searching for him he said
6543447 there is a lot of manpower still being spent on this case we are hoping and keeping ourselves optimistic that he is alive somewhere
6543448 it is the greatest challenge for any statesman today to see what is the right priority
6543449 is it iran russia the price of oil terrorism it may in some ways look like the cold war again but the context today is blurred past recognition
6543450 will be forced to react and not only through diplomatic means
6543451 nato is trying to make a victim of an aggressor georgia and whitewash a criminal regime
6543452 the russian federation and the united states are not about to enter a new cold war even if tensions between moscow and washington rise dramatically
6543453 the cold war pitted an ideologically driven soviet union against the free world a conflict where both sides devoted enormous resources to defeat the other
6543454 an ideologically driven notion that the only possible choices these two countries have for relations are total conflict or total agreement neither of which is possible or desirable
6543455 we are stuck in relationships in which major powers are not enemies but not friends
6543456 the un isnt working the new world order and the democracy surplus never came to be but there are networks of capital and cooperation between russia china and the west that werent there before
6543457 a new context of fear rippling through its border regions
6543458 if you take one action it can boomerang and harm something else
6543459 russias strength is made possible by oil at 150 a barrel
6543460 if oil is cut to 60 a barrel russia is sunk russians spend less on research and development than poland they want bank accounts in the west to make millionaires off sales to europe they dont want a big war they want to gain influence and manipulate
6543461 this is about protecting the right of a physician to practice medicine according to his or her moral compass
6543462 there is nothing in this rule that would in any way change a patients right to a legal procedure
6543463 we did not feel it necessary in this rule to define abortion you will find that wording not present
6543464 this regulation is not about contraception it is about abortion and conscience
6543465 hospitals view the web site as a valuable resource for their quality improvement efforts
6543466 we had to talk about it its real we acknowledge it
6543467 we just have to help each other get better for our next opportunity whether its here or somewhere else
6543468 im still competing as hard as i can with the opportunities i get
6543469 these arent very many now but with that being said it is what it is i cant control that part of it thats the coaches decision all i can do is play as hard as i can when i get my opportunities but i understand now i might not get any
6543470 i think i have a pretty good idea right now in my head of where they are
6543471 i think when youre in this business you know that things can happen anytime
6543472 one day youre the guy and the next youre not but at the same time theyre still out there and have a chance to win the job
6543473 i just wanted to let him know this is not going to be his last opportunity
6543474 stay ready to go here and ready to play here because you never know whats going to come again
6543475 if my sister doesnt end up with the nomination ive got to take a look at who im going to vote for
6543476 im not sure im trying to get as much information as i can on both of them i would have loved to see her as president we still have a week to go you never know whats going to happen at the convention
6543477 i was concerned about my overall toning down by my vagina
6543478 its sex and its also for me i just wanted to feel strong down there
6543479 for the pacific islands forum to declare an unequivocal condemnation of bainimarama the interim prime minister of fiji is itself unprecedented
6543480 secondly what was unprecedented was for the first time the forum countries giving definition to special measures that is the inclusion of suspension
6543481 i think this is a direct and deliberate slight a snub to the leaders of the pacific island countries assembled here in niue
6543482 the challenge for us in these meetings is to uphold and stand firmly behind that principle of democracy therefore that means holding to account those who violate that principle
6543483 the interim government has been making excuses all this time simply for the purpose of delaying elections
6543484 were seeing a lot more spread that is concerning to us
6543485 this year we certainly have had parents asking more questions

6543594 chippy is going to help us on both sides of the ball this season
6543595 hes going to be like having a senior for years because of the development of his athleticism and his leadership thats leadership a talent too
6543596 chippy started as a tight end for us his sophomore season
6543597 he caught two touchdowns but he mostly helped us with his outstanding blocking
6543598 we featured washington husky frosh running back david freeman on offense so he didnt get a lot of opportunities
6543599 one of his touchdowns though came against our archrival inglewood calif morningside
6543600 he knows how good he is so he doesnt mind sharing the attention not only that but he can chalk talk with his fellow defensive linemen like he is the facilitator of the meeting
6543601 it is on defense where chippy will probably earn his scholarship
6543602 you see him on offense he makes catches with his soft hands in traffic and just navigates through traffic
6543603 on defense at the usc camp last summer he showed every move possible
6543604 he showed that he can bull rush and he even used the swim move
6543605 environment will be number two thats about all im thinking about regarding colleges right now

6543614 vindicated i feel great i feel amazing i just won a gold medal
6543615 it was hard and this win wasnt just down to my goal
6543616 it was only achievable with the team we have and that we played for each other
6543617 but i feel stronger in the end i know it sounds crazy but im glad i went though it i learned a lot about myself
6543618 i asked two questions do you want to win yes do you need goalkeepers to win yes
6543619 we had to move on and this day you could see that we did it
6543620 this is such a reward for nine months of hard hard work and soul searching after the world cup
6543621 i have no idea why we cant win a final
6543622 its something im gonna keep asking myself for a long time you keep asking what you did wrong
6543623 again we had a chance to win the gold and again we let it slip away its hard to say why that keeps happening to us
6543624 we are not looking at the results but on how we play
6543625 soccer is not a matter of 1 0 or 2 0 its the way to find out the rhythm the match against norway is our key point in the tournament we found out our weak points and improved it thats why we stand here with the gold medal
6543626 i think i was leaning to my left waiting to dive to the left because the whole goal was open
6543627 and she ended up going right and i luckily kept some of my weight on the right
6543628 i dont understand why the ball wouldnt go in in so many games before we were able to score easily but today it wasnt the case
6543629 i just knew that i had to keep it low strike it hard and it went in
6543630 we said dont worry about making mistakes just go out there and play with confidence and be brave you could feel it every minute of that second half and in overtime we felt strong

6543726 a common anterior insula representation of disgust observation experience and imagination shows divergent functional connectivity pathways
6543727 we placed our participants in an fmri scanner to measure their brain activity while we first showed our subject short 3s movie clips of an actor sipping from a cup and then looking disgusted
6543728 later on we asked them to read and imagine short emotional scenarios for instance walking along a street bumping into a reeking drunken man who then starts to retch and realizing that some of his vomit had ended up in your own mouth finally we measured their brain activity while the participants tasted unpleasant solutions in the scanner
6543729 is that in all three cases the same location of the anterior insula lit up the anterior insula is the part of the brain that is the heart of our feeling of disgust what this means is that whether we see a movie or read a story the same thing happens we activate our bodily representations of what it feels like to be disgusted and that is why reading a book and viewing a movie can both make us feel as if we literally feel what the protagonist is going through

6543748 we need a critique of moral values the value of these values themselves must first be called in question and for that there is needed a knowledge of the conditions and circumstances in which they grew under which they evolved and changed

6543750 the wretched alone are the good the poor impotent lowly alone are the good the suffering deprived sick ugly alone are pious alone are blessed by god
6543751 the slave revolt in morality begins when ressentiment itself becomes creative and gives birth to values the ressentiment of natures that are denied the true reaction that of deeds and compensate themselves with an imaginary revenge
6543752 supposing that what is at any rate believed to be the truth really is true and the meaning of all culture is the reduction of the beast of prey man to a tame and civilized animal a domestic animal then one would undoubtedly have to regard all those instincts of reaction and ressentiment through whose aid the noble races and their ideal were finally confounded and overthrown as the actual instruments of culture

6543766 there are no fan clubs nor as much enthusiasm for example for musical comedies not even for dramatic films as a genre as happens with terror and fantastical films
6543767 unleash a gut reaction that does not necessarily have to do with reason but rather with the purest and deepest human condition its fears of dying of the unknown of other dimensions
6543768 im just a little boy who plays with his penis when hes nervous
6543769 its a good start but the problem is more immediate and a three year trial is just too long he said
6543770 a six or 12 month trial would have been enough
6543771 farmers are under a lot of stress and pressure trying to train and retain staff
6543772 guest workers would have given the region stability because backpackers are transient and the unemployed dont want to do farm work
6543773 we have been doing a lot of original reporting and we are going to be doing a lot more
6543774 we get these interviews because we have this global audience of 500 million viewers
6543775 our aim is to reach these bigger names and use our reporting talent to break news we are really going for the kinds of questions that will make news
6543776 we really are paying a lot of attention to what our audience wants
6543777 we see tremendous traffic on politics what is going on around the world and the names that get their interest
6543778 we like to pick people with expertise in the subject matter

6543782 i like sexy intelligent men with a good sense of humor
6543783 i always look at a guys eyes to see if he is looking at me some guys think that if they ignore a girl she will think hes a challenge and go after him but that doesnt work a man should be upfront always and show hes hot for me i like to go to nice dinners the movies and sporting events the perfect day for me would be lingerie shopping followed by a massage great sex and a bubble bath
6543784 my boyfriend really wanted to see this comedian at a comedy club on his last night in town but i forgot to reserve our seats and we got turned away
6543785 on the day i was all set to go pose outdoors for the magazine it rained like crazy
6543786 i wanted to wait till another day but my boyfriend was all jazzed up to do it and he got real disappointed then i had the idea of posing in my bathroom and putting on the skin cream i remembered one time before he had walked in while i was doing it and he got all sexed up for some reason he got all excited when i suggested it so i figured it must be something that guys like to see so i stripped and rubbed the cream all over me and he about orgasmed i dont have a favorite way to have sex yet i like doing it in all sorts of ways and in all sorts of places
6543787 i love to get in the gym and work up a hot sweat
6543788 i usually dont get off when men are pounding hard on my breasts or squeezing or pinching them really hard just do it kindly and nicely to my nipples massage them im kind of sensitive underneath my boobs as well so just moving your hands back and forth under my boobs feels really good lick them but dont bite them and one of the other things is i have a hard time getting off when im on top unless the guy holds my breasts i like to grind when im riding a guys cock i like to move back and forth but the only way i can get off is if he has at least one hand on my boobs its always been like that for me unless im on the bottom in which case i can cum any way i want but when im on top i need to have that kind of sensitivity and stimulation but if he squeezes too hard i lose interest if a guy is nice to me while im riding him then i definitely cum

6543875 trillions for military technology how the pentagon innovates and why it costs so much
6543876 why it takes decades to get them into production even as innovation in the civilian economy becomes ever more frenetic and why some of those weapons dont work very well despite expenditures of many billions of dollars
6543877 the internal politics of the armed services make weapons acquisition almost unmanageable
6543878 were mad as hell and we wont take it anymore

6543894 barack obama is friends with ayers defending him as quote respectable and mainstream
6543895 obamas political career was launched in ayers home and the two served together on a left wing board why would barack obama be friends with someone who bombed the capitol and is proud of it do you know enough to elect barack obama
6543896 mr ayers is a 60 plus year old individual who lives in my neighborhood who did something that i deplore 40 years ago when i was 6 or 7 years old
6543897 by the time i met him he is a professor of education at the university of illinois we served on a board together that had republicans bankers lawyers focused on education

6543910 the legal system has to accept the reality of the situation they are not trusted at all by the victims
6543911 they are held in contempt by the vast majority of the victims
6543912 it doesnt remind me of any circuit ive ever seen before
6543913 its completely different some of its a bit like melbourne some of it a bit like montreal but people keep telling me its similar to monaco and it bears no resemblance to that at all its much faster for one thing the surface looks very dirty now but i think those responsible for building the track have done a very good job
6543914 the only thing i dont like is that police are always telling me to turn right my hotel is a five minute walk away but it takes half an hour to get here because they keep sending me to barcelona and back they are not very well prepared but the situation inside the track is nice
6543915 ive watched one lap of on board footage from the recent formula three race here
6543916 and the team and i have been sitting down to discuss potential problems that might occur we dont know exactly how we should set the car up but weve worked out a starting point and we have an idea which way we might need to go
6543917 but im sure it will be very busy during the weekend
6543918 and i will talk to the other drivers the situation has definitely changed the weekend for me what happened was tragic and i am in shock along with all other spanish people its probably the saddest approach to a race weekend i have known
6543919 were in a beautiful country and i was really sad to hear what happened id like to extend my thoughts to all those who have been affected
6543920 the recent decline in gas petrol prices isnt enough to overcome all the negative momentum thats been building up through the spring and summer
6543921 a few months ago there was some discussion about a second half 2008 economic recovery if theres a second half recovery itll be the second half of 2009
6543922 the dollar has been undermined by renewed concerns over the health of the us financial system
6543923 we might see some further scaling back of already diminished expectations for the federal reserve to raise us interest rates over the next six months
6543924 the message is clearly pretty downbeat with virtually every index below the 50 boom bust line it looks like most sectors and countries in the eurozone are contracting
6543925 we can confirm he has left bangkok for the uk
6543926 god am i happy to be leaving vietnam and that jail i should never have been in there
6543927 no doubt about it that loss was in our heads
6543928 one of the last things we said before walking onto the court as a team was we have waited for two years which we have for us the first test was russia now it continues to the gold medal game
6543929 obviously it was a very tough match we were able to hang with them a little bit through about three quarters which was an accomplishment for us
6543930 when you are playing the united states you just cant make mistakes but we made some mistakes and we missed some shots
6543931 we had a really good start and sort of cranked up the defence on them and took away want they wanted that is how it panned out tonight
6543932 i expect the game to be more physical you know it is the gold medal game we are just as phsyical as they are and we give as much as we get
6543933 you are playing for a lot you are playing for a gold medal and a lot of sacrifices you have made throughout your career
6543934 we are going to have to produce our a game of the tournament without question

6543943 love your peppermint foot lotion it keeps my feet so soft

6543946 however it should be noted that there are facts in this case that are disputed including the findings of the medical examiner and urge that judgment be withheld until the legal proceedings are complete
6543947 when you look at the outside markets and everything in that commodity basket is screaming higher the rally is very hard to ignore
6543948 this rally is definitely dollar related commodity based buying with crude leading the charge
6543949 but the stock markets not under pressure im miffed the stocks arent taking this as bearish
6543950 people are really starting to realize the inflation is a lot more than what the fed has been telling us
6543951 buffy the vampire slayer and some emmy darlings that were completely snubbed no
6543952 it saves the officers from testifying about that day again in an arbitration hearing and it provides a certain ending to a hard time
6543953 a voluntary resignation looks a lot different and a lot better than a termination
6543954 this whole incident has probably left a bitter taste in his mouth we felt we had a good case to have him reinstated obviously the city must have seen that or they wouldnt have looked for a solution with us
6543955 mr reality on line two says its time to wake up now
6543956 i am apologizing to everyone who was embarrassed and humiliated but i do not apologize for the message of internet safety its a very good message

6543959 the lack of visual information on the exact source of any fire is a major problem faced by operators around the world

6544100 overwhelmingly drug detection trial operations resulted in the detection of persons involved in minor possession offences rather than those involved in the supply or trafficking of indictable quantities of drugs mr barbour said the latest trial led to 78 people being issued with a caution for cannabis possession while 60 people were charged after appearing in court one person has been handed a 12 month good behaviour bond and 47 people received fines ranging from 75 to 750 acquisition of live cannabis seeds is illegal in the united states in the tradition of cheech amp chongs up in smoke totally baked promises to be an instant cult classic this hilarious comedy is politically charged insightful and laugh out loud funny in the aftermath of the largest marijuana bust in history medicinal marijuana activists take hostage a college debate team at their 20th reunion prepare to get fired up while comedians and stoners alike join forces in this insanely irreverent comedy their select igh times presents jorge cervantes ultimate grow dvd igh times presents jorge cervantes 2 ultimate grow dvd igh times presents ready set grow dvd igh times presents ready set grow ii dvd i yield homemade hydroponics book 008 high times calendar ods gift poster the marijuana leaf

6544213 what is more scandalous is that it is not the first time that the government has been shown to be completely incapable of protecting the integrity of highly sensitive data rendering them unfit to be charged with protecting our safety

6544229 its a good global strategy and a good example of what a u s based food company ought to be doing in order to maintain balance growth in this pretty turbulent food economy
6544230 i think setting an artificial timetable for withdrawal is a significant mistake it is it sends mixed signals and bad signals to the region and to the iraqi citizens listen the iraqis are wondering whether or not were going to stay to help people in america wonder whether or not theyve got the political will to do the hard work
6544231 and if the congress wants to test my will as to whether or not ill accept the timetable for withdrawal i wont accept one i just dont think its in the interest of our troops i think it im just envisioning what it would be like to be a young soldier in the middle of iraq and realizing that politicians have all of a sudden made military determinations and in my judgment that would put a kid in harms way more so than he or she already is
6544232 the prime minister says what iraq and her people now need is time not a timetable they seek our patience not political posturing they require resolve not our retreat were going to succeed in iraq if given a chance liberty will succeed every time and liberty will help yield the peace we need
6544233 theres a temptation to let the politics at home get in the way with the considered judgment of the commanders thats why i strongly rejected an artificial timetable of withdrawal its kind of like an arbitrary thing you know we will decide in the halls of congress how to conduct our affairs in iraq based upon polls and politics and were going to impose this on people as opposed to listening to our commanders and our diplomats and listening to the iraqis for that matter
6544234 in the area of security cooperation the president and the prime minister agreed that improving conditions should allow for the agreements now under negotiation to include a general time horizon for meeting aspirational goals
6544235 well we have always said that the roles missions and size of the american forces here the coalition forces was based on the conditions on the ground and what is needed we have agreed that some goals some aspirational timetables for how that might unfold are well worth having in in such an agreement and i have to say if i could just make the point the reason we are where we are going talking about this kind of agreement is that the surge worked iraqi forces have demonstrated that they are strong and getting stronger

6544338 qui n puede reivindicar un derecho a recibir el cuerpo de cristo todo es un acto sin medida del amor de dios nuestro se or se hace l mismo disponible en su cuerpo y en su sangre pero no podemos decir jam s que tenemos el derecho de recibirlo en la santa comuni n cada vez que nos acercamos a l debemos hacerlo con una profunda conciencia de nuestra indignidad
6544339 recibir indignamente el cuerpo y la sangre de cristo es un sacrilegio si lo hace deliberadamente en pecado mortal es un sacrilegio
6544340 si tenemos un pecado mortal en la conciencia debemos primero confesarnos de ese pecado y recibir la absoluci n y s lo despu s acercarnos al sacramento eucar stico
6544341 funcionario p blico que con conocimiento y consentimiento sostiene acciones que est n contra la ley moral divina y eterna por ejemplo si apoya p blicamente el aborto procurado que comporta la supresi n de vidas humanas inocentes e indefensas una persona que comete pecado de esta manera debe ser amonestada p blicamente de modo que no reciba la comuni n hasta que no haya reformado la propia vida
6544342 si una persona que ha sido amonestada persiste en un pecado mortal p blico y se acerca a recibir la comuni n el ministro de la eucarist a tiene la obligaci n de neg rsela por qu sobre todo por la salvaci n de la persona misma impidi ndole realizar un sacrilegio
6544343 en primer lugar un esc ndalo referente a nuestra disposici n para recibir la santa comuni n
6544344 se debe evitar que la gente sea inducida a pensar que se puede estar en estado de pecado mortal y acercarse a la eucarist a en segundo lugar podr a existir otra forma de esc ndalo consistente en llevar a la gente a pensar que el acto p blico que esta persona est haciendo que hasta ahora todos cre an que era un pecado serio no lo es tanto si la iglesia le permite recibir la comuni n
6544345 si tenemos una figura p blica que abierta y deliberadamente sostiene los derechos abortistas y que recibe la eucarist a qu terminar pensando la gente com n puede llegar a creer que es correcto hasta cierto punto suprimir una vida inocente en el seno materno
6544346 no tiene ninguna intenci n de interferir en la vida p blica sino en el estado espiritual del pol tico o del funcionario p blico que si es cat lico debe seguir la ley divina tambi n en la esfera p blica
6544347 por tanto es simplemente rid culo y equivocado tratar de silenciar a un pastor acus ndolo de interferir en pol tica para que no pueda hacer el bien al alma de un miembro de su grey

6544430 there has to be an appropriate distribution according to performance

6544463 the ship sent a distress call on tuesday that it was hijacked and the signal was reported to us by another ship
6544464 we have already informed the us led coalition naval forces who have dispatched a warship to the area
6544465 the incident occurred in the gulf of aden between somalia and yemen
6544466 the ship has 39 crew of which 29 are malaysians and 10 filipinos bunga melati dua was fully laden with palm oil and heading towards the dutch port of rotterdam from dumai sumatra indonesia at the time of the incident
6544467 for the safety of the crew we cannot disclose too much but we call on the un and the international community to take urgent steps and stop the worsening security situation in these waters
6544468 we are very concerned with the current situation we have been warning seafarers plying these waters on a regular basis as attacks are escalating

6544474 i have become very concerned with the possibility that this administration may have violated federal law by using the resources of our intelligence agencies to influence domestic policy processes or opinion
6544475 this is not intended to be a mere discussion of violations of law that have occurred

6544511 in this case its sort of embarrassing that it happened to fema themselves fema being a child of dhs with calls going to the middle east
6544512 the whole thing has been a mess from the start ill conceived
6544513 most sales collapse because someone pulls out of the chain not because of any information that is set to be contained in the hip
6544514 the idea of hips has been nine years in the making it was in the labour manifesto of 1997 and the queens speech of 2001
6544515 the length of time and the fact we have had six housing ministers allowed opponents to gather their strength
6544516 estate agents simply did not want anyone meddling in their market and mortgage lenders saw a threat to the fees that they charge buyers for valuing a property
6544517 they will need 7 000 assessors to do the job but i have heard on the grapevine they have 1 000 not enough by a long chalk
6544518 even at a period of high market activity there will only be a need for 3 000 to 4 000 inspectors
6544519 remember hips are being launched in june when the market is traditionally quiet there will be enough inspectors to go round
6544520 local authority searches are only going to remain relevant for a few weeks
6544521 no solicitor worth their salt is going to accept a three or four month old search supplied by the buyer after all they risk being sued if things go wrong
6544522 there is not enough time to test to see if this system is rigorous enough to work
6544523 the house buying system as it stands does not work for buyers and sellers
6544524 one in 4 transactions fail between offer and completion and the length of time taken to complete is excessive and causes huge stress
6544525 most of us think that mortgages are priced off the bank of englands base rate but theyre not
6544526 theyre generally priced off the rate at which banks can borrow money from each other and thats gone up very fast as a result of the credit crunch
6544527 mortgage rates for in particular sub prime borrowers and buy to let borrowers have gone up very fast and that means from here on buy to let investors are going to find things more and more expensive
6544528 it looks like i am going to have to subsidise them for a few years to come
6544529 if the rental yield mortgage comparison becomes more and more tricky and they dont expect capital growth they may be forced to put properties on the market which may effectively accelerate the slow down in house price growth
6544530 typical people are couples that are divorcing that cant stand being in the house with each other also people that are involved in a repossession and actually being forced out of their house by the building society because they havent been paying their mortgage
6544531 its wonderful to see so much interest in art and culture
6544532 these figures reflect the whole market including people who have help from parents those on high salaries and people who have stepped off the ladder for a few years having made money and are buying again all these people bring down the multiple figure
6544533 the big change in the market in recent times has been lenders moving to affordability
6544534 one mortgage firm now looks at how much rent the applicant is paying and lends according to that
6544535 another lender works out how much rental income can be earned from the borrower letting out a spare room and adds this to the amount of money they are willing to lend
6544536 it is certainly true that in many instances the affordability test is really a way of working out a high income multiple
6544537 it is about lenders making the right decision according to the individuals full circumstances not just salary
6544538 after all it is in no ones interest to lend money to people who will struggle to repay it lenders always lose if they have to repossess
6544539 an interest only mortgage can make sense for some say people who plan to move in a couple of years but not for all
6544540 the danger comes when someone goes for interest only purely because it is cheap and puts nothing in place to pay the capital sum back they get to the end of their mortgage term nearing retirement and they still owe a lot of money
6544541 group mortgages are very much of the moment the obvious advantage is the debt deposit and stamp duty is spread between the purchasers
6544542 people can enter what they want from a housemate a bit like a dating website
6544543 buying with friends is normally a last resort buying with strangers is beyond that for many
6544544 if that falls to anybody else its not a goal it was a fantastic goal from him
6544545 fred ended up getting behind our defense and i stepped up to block the shot but jay blocked it he did a great job to block the shot but it fell to moreno its his class he really turned it on in the last 25 minutes you saw him take over the game and it was just a classy finish
6544546 we know in the locker room how good he is but now hes proving himself to the league that he should be a starter on other teams
6544547 its a tough situation to be behind matt because matts the top keeper in the league right now and on top of his game doug has been getting better and better and now its getting close maybe next season or the season after doug needs to be starting somewhere and these are his opportunities to show that hes good enough
6544548 i can almost tell exactly where he is we were back in sync right away
6544549 if he moves up i know exactly where he is and our timing together is just perfect
6544550 i dont know exactly what hes going to do but hes got plenty of opportunities and hes got to think long and hard about what hes going to do
6544551 in the last two or three games hes been lively hes been enthusiastic
6544552 hes used to getting on a bus and going an hour and playing whatever team hes not used to time zones and five hour flights and buses to stadiums and to get to the airport and all kinds of stuff
6544553 you are not responsible for luck but you are for life
6544554 its not reasonable to have heineken on draft in every office but how about a choice of domestic or import for every office good with you

6544559 i really have a problem with this book it shouldnt be on the shortlist let alone win
6544560 college guys talk about what theyre reading what they read in high school and what books are important to them now
6544561 on an economic basis fannie and freddie made no money last year
6544562 dont get me started on the mozzarella stick she said
6544563 uma cota essa eventual lei teria de ser confrontada com o artigo 37 caput da constitui o certamente uma lei desta natureza e n o quero me antecipar a isso poder ser testada perante o supremo tribunal federal e confrontada com esses princ pios que s o exatamente o da moralidade da impessoalidade e da efici ncia s o princ pios basilares da administra o p blica
6544564 n s editamos uma s mula baseada nos precedentes n o inovamos nos ativemos fundamentalmente de forma muito estrita ao que vem sendo decidido pelo plen rio
6544565 sempre imaginei que sobreviveria at os 90 anos mas agora sei que isso n o vai acontecer
6544566 tentarei quimioterapia por seis meses mas se o tratamento se tornar desconfort vel ou inconveniente demais
6544567 tendo vivido por 80 anos eu fiz muita coisa n o tenho motivo para acreditar que a vida me tratou injustamente
6544568 exibiam uma tend ncia a refor ar a quimioterapia nos tr s meses finais de sua vida adotando tratamentos em geral bem mais agressivos sem que isso resultasse em qualquer melhora em suas perspectivas de sobreviv ncia
6544569 nossas observa es sugerem que na presen a de uma doen a que avance rapidamente medidas agressivas de tratamento como novos regimes de quimioterapia no m s final da vida do paciente bem como a administra o de quimioterapia nas duas semanas finais de vida n o est o associados a benef cios em termos de sobreviv ncia
6544570 a quimioterapia paliativa o m todo proposto pela maioria dos oncologistas tem por objetivo reduzir as dimens es do c ncer e melhorar a qualidade bem como ampliar a dura o da vida pelo maior tempo poss vel mas evitando que isso cause excessivo sofrimento ao paciente
6544571 existe uma diferen a entre quimioterapia paliativa aplicada no come o da trajet ria da doen a e perto do final da vida
6544572 o objetivo do tratamento no final da vida deveria ser o de evitar interven es como por exemplo a quimioterapia citot xica que t m grande probabilidade de reduzir a qualidade de vida sem ao mesmo tempo elevar os ndices de sobreviv ncia
6544573 t m pre o elevad ssimo de at us 100 mil por paciente ano
6544574 tratamentos com baixa probabilidade de ajudar e com alta probabilidade de causar danos
6544575 hora de pensar seriamente sobre a manuten o do tratamento
6544576 hora de conversar com os pacientes sobre as metas riscos e benef cios de uma quimioterapia
6544577 exponham tudo por escrito eis o que voc tem o que podemos fazer para tratar o problema o que acontecer com e sem e tratamento de modo a que todos estejam informados
6544578 seria um retrocesso imenso se uma terra ind gena fosse prejudicada por causa de uma decis o do supremo contr ria a todo o per odo de muita luta dos povos ind genas defendemos a demarca o como est e que ela se mantenha de forma cont nua e n o por blocos

6544580 deciziile institutionale nu se iau doar de lideri ci se discuta la nivel de experti iar liderii se intalnesc doar cand lucrurile sunt convenite in cazul unor vizite fulger pregatite peste noapte evident ca nu se decide nimic pot fi doar niste discutii pentru a simti atmosfera si a vedea cum stau lucrurile
6544581 sunt sigur ca nu s au inchis niciun fel de capitole nici acum si nici nu ne putem astepta la asa ceva in viitorul apropiat
6544582 putea fi solutionata aceasta problema de cinci luni incoace sigur ca putea este un semnal mic care arata in continuare ca moldova nu este deschisa spre o buna relatie cu romania iar mae moldovean nu este institutia cu libertate in comunicare si in luarea deciziilor
6544583 insusi presedintele basescu a declarat recent ca e timpul sa se schimbe aceasta conducere la chisinau ar fi sinucigas acum ca tot el sa si revada aceste declaratii si sa autorizeze semnarea unui tratat politic cu comunistii de la chisinau
6544584 presupun ca a fost si o tatonare de teren a pozitiei moldovenesti si poate chiar o incurajare pentru chisinau in ceea ce priveste situatia din georgia si o evaluare a eventualelor consecinte asupra republicii moldova
6544585 in ceea ce priveste dorinta de restructurare a fortelor pacificatoare din georgia si transnistria nu stiu in ce masura presedintele voronin va fi constant in sustinerea acestei idei
6544586 am auzit din nou aceleasi promisiuni ca vor exista surprize placute pentru societatile de pe ambele maluri ale prutului promisiuni facute si prin primavara sunt sceptic ca asa va fi dar totusi as vrea sa cred ca cel putin de data aceasta vom avea ceva mai frumos decat promisiuni
6544587 si cred ca acest lucru a fost resimtit puternic la nivelul politicii externe a romaniei
6544588 pentru mine ar fi important ca relatiile dintre chisinau si bucuresti sa se depersonalizeze si sa nu conteze atat de mult ce persoane stau in fruntea unor institutii relatiile dintre chisinau si bucuresti ar trebui sa se manifeste strategic pe multiple planuri ca sa dea posibilitatea unei multitudini de actori economici sociali culturali sa si creeze propriile poduri de comunicare cu ceilalti de peste prut

6544595 wow a vampire could totally fall in love with her
6544596 the vets who had a look at him were really surprised at how fast hed gone downhill
6544597 hes having difficulties breathing and his flippers were at an unnatural angle
6544598 their advice to us was hes not going to last much longer hes suffering and you should take action
6544599 theyll need to locate it first and the poor little guy could have passed away in the night
6544600 once they figure out whats happened theyll take it from there
6544601 its a really tragic result from an operation that people worked really really hard for
6544602 theres no way that the logistics of feeding that animal by hand or in an aquarium is going to work
6544603 there are too many difficulties with it and the animal first of all has to be convinced to eat out of a tube its got to get to an aquarium and then youve got to find a product for it to eat which you can supply for probably a year
6544604 so i think for humans to try and keep it alive is just going to end up as a disaster
6544605 get it into the vicinity of the other cow and calf and hopefully the cow would take on two calves which would be pretty unusual
6544606 there were four cookie cutter shark bites in it and that has most likely occurred while it was out in the open water its just another thing that compounds the whole problem
6544607 even if they are able to entice the calf out into open water it would face a higher predation pressure from sharks
6544608 our hearts are breaking with whats happening with baby colin
6544609 the key here is hes weakening hes losing the strength to get him fed and to a pod that will care for him
6544610 basically what we do is we take the same back to school supply list the teachers prepare and parents have the opportunity to pre order the supplies for the fall before school lets out back in june
6544611 each box is customized for each school and each grade so fifth grade box at skano elementary would be different than a fifth grade box at boght hill in latham or another school that we work with here locally
6544612 the way it works with traditional back to school shopping the teachers make a list of items that are needed the stores have items on the shelf and its actually up to the parent to find and match up
6544613 we work with some schools that are more rural and they may have to drive 30 to 40 miles one way to a big box store to buy their supplies so that gas up and back can be 10 to 12 dollars the gasoline not to mention the supplies
6544614 weve increased the participation from the parents and they have good things to say about it it really saves them a lot of time and frustration because you have to go to two or three different stores find the assortment of supplies
6544615 no longer can they be kind of i talk to the media i dont talk to anybody else i talk to big donors i dont talk to anybody else increasingly they recognize they have to talk to average people
6544616 well weve established that the vanagon isnt exactly a race car

6544628 although the proportion of crude oil consumption produced in germany is comparatively small at 3 7 million tons domestic production covers just 3 percent of demand in germany any production on ones own doorstep increases supply security
6544629 they can be used to significantly prolong the life of existing older oil fields
6544630 wintershall is willing to invest more in the latest technologies in order to extend the production time of existing older fields
6544631 a higher average price for crude oil certainly has a positive impact on exploration and production activities in germany

6544636 its unlikely that a broadcast network is ever again going to create a megahit like the cosby show which at its mid 80s peak drew as many as 50 million viewers an episode for several years now tvs top event has been foxs american idol last season it drew 28 8 million viewers a week
6544637 in many ways the networks themselves already have specific brand identities they just dont admit it for decades cbs has had the most elderly demographic among the major networks abc specializes in comedies and light dramas with strong female appeal fox with the exception of american idol is largely aimed at guys the fledgling cw is building on gossip girl and americas next top model to chase young women nbcs struggles are not unrelated to the fact that its still trying to be all things to all people
6544638 the average household has its tv on for eight hours and 14 minutes daily thats a record
6544639 the peak levels of commercials dont exceed the peak levels of programming
6544640 but the experience is similar to having a flashbulb go off every now and then versus a spotlight shining in your eyes all the time

6544649 the fires dimming im stirring the coals around to keep it going
6544650 please dont be mad at me im sorry i pretended to be someone else

6544652 i i know but i just dont want to be treated as a kid now im tough and i can do fine on my own if i need to i dont need others giving me things or asking if i need anything
6544653 so i thought that if i changed into someone older someone your age you wouldnt treat me differently and i would be more useful to the group
6544654 if i stayed as myself when we crashed i was sure that i would be a hindrance to the group slowing everyone else down because they would be so worried about me because of my true age
6544655 i first discovered my ability to change when we were trying to escape from tv tokyo

6544671 i mean yeah bro just lost control of my horse for a second nothing to worry about
6544672 and thats how i first discovered my ability to morph into other people
6544673 i see so how why not tell any of us even when you already know that were also mutants
6544674 well i saw it as an advantage i could change into someone older and not have to worry about anyone treating me like a scared little kid
6544675 with all youve been through i think youve proven that you can take care of yourself if you need to
6544676 so how far do your powers go can you only copy peoples appearance
6544677 no ive copied other s m a t girls appearances and found i could also mimic some of their powers but theyre much weaker in comparison
6544678 cool wait so you can change into anyone you see
6544679 yes i can make an even better copy if i make physical contact with the person im copying
6544680 please dont be mad at me im sorry i pretended to be someone else
6544681 this is why i didnt want to be found out
6544682 i i know but i just dont want to be treated as a kid now im tough and i can do fine on my own if i need to i dont need others giving me things or asking if i need anything
6544683 so i thought that if i changed into someone older someone your age you wouldnt treat me differently and i would be more useful to the group
6544684 if i stayed as myself when we crashed i was sure that i would be a hindrance to the group slowing everyone else down because they would be so worried about me because of my true age

6544686 cool wait so you can change into anyone you see
6544687 yes i can make an even better copy if i make physical contact with the person im copying
6544688 hmmm i think i just had a terrific idea that might help us get out of this dire situation
6544689 why is it that every child that comes into contact with him is broken
6544690 so you got these incredible suggestive tainted interviews and who takes over the interviews the woman who has custody of the three children
6544691 milton quarterly volume 36 issue 4 pages 221 239 medieval and renaissance art often portrayed the eating of the forbidden fruit as equivalent to a sexual seduction so skenandore is in good company in his aesthetic rendering of eves dream remarked
6544692 but ill leave that to the art critics to determine
6544693 how well their style represents what makes their clients unique

6544707 at 22 percent of net price customers pay the equivalent of 2x their original license cost over a typical 10 year ownership lifecycle

6544711 most sap customers adopted a single vendor strategy the initial benefits were driven by a fear for complicated integrations desire for process standardization and need to expedite deployments pre y2k this strategy has led to vendor lock in and vulnerability long term apps strategy should consider how to contain future risk in a single sourced erp scenario

6544855 i predict that most companies would stop paying for health care in three to four years
6544856 charlotte and sam do this party every year with power publicist amanda silverman
6544857 the photographers must have caught on because they were outside the hotel sam and lindsay were livid and just left to go do their own thing
6544858 sed perfectos como m padre que est en los cielos es perfecto
6544859 ci accorgemmo che la piccola aveva il gruppo sanguigno 0 mentre sia io che mia moglie siamo 0 allinizio sospettammo che in ospedale si fosse verificato uno scambio di culla e facemmo una serie di analisi poi arrivammo al test del dna e la risposta fu sconvolgente era escluso che io potessi essere il padre di mia figlia
6544860 constat de visu che lo sperma inoculato alla signora era quello del marito
6544861 quindici giorni dopo la fine del tempo regolamentare e tale circostanza e di estremo rilievo dal momento che in caso di inseminazione artificiale le nascite sono sempre premature trattandosi di gravidanze ad alto rischio non possiamo quindi non sospettare che la signora avesse una relazione extraconiugale oppure che allinsaputa del marito si sia sottoposta anche a una inseminazione eterologa che allepoca non era vietata
6544862 sul dispositivo usato per inoculare il seme si sarebbe dovuto trovare traccia del mio dna
6544863 si evidenzia che il materiale biologico presente sul dispositivonon appartiene al signor c m
6544864 siamo noi che sospettiamo che possa essere stato proprio il professor agostini a mettere incinta con il suo seme o con quello di qualcun altro la nostra assistita due motivi il primo che al quinto tentativo il medico non riusciva a far fecondare lovulo della signora p m con gli spermatozoi del marito e sarebbe cos ricorso a una soluzione secondo che alla nostra richiesta di sottoporsi al test del dna per accertare se lui il padre della bimba agostini ha opposto un netto rifiuto
6544865 io in particolare dovr farmi aiutare da uno psicologo perch come far a non dire niente alla bambina e sar giusto e la pubblicit che noi non volevamo sul nostro caso in che modo pregiudicher la sua crescita
6544866 quanti altri bambini generati con seme eterologo iniettato in modo fraudolento siano in circolazione in italia e soprattutto ci si rende conto dello strazio che devono vivere questi genitori sia il padre che la madre sono legatissimi alla bimba ma lui oggi divorato dai dubbi se fra ventanni la figlia venisse a scoprire come stanno le cose potrebbe per legge ripudiare il pap e chiederne n disconoscimento andando alla ricerca del genitore naturale una situazione tragica i cui danni sono incommensurabili
6544867 there were bodies lying everywhere and wounded people soaked in blood were screaming for help
6544868 many of the wounded were either without legs or hands i could see body parts hanging on trees

6544873 the greatest increases since 2004 in the view that churches and other houses of worship should not express themselves on political matters have occurred among less educated republicans and people who say that social issues such as abortion and same sex marriage will be important to their vote for example among people who rate gay marriage as a top voting issue the percentage saying that churches should stay out of politics soared from 25 in 2004 to 50 currently there was little change over this period on this question among people who do not view same sex marriage as a very important issue
6544874 we want to present the best value we can to consumers and to our retail and food service partners but we need to be ultimately able to cover the cost were confronted with
6544875 we are taking aggressive action in food service that included reduced expectations in our full year forecast
6544876 its a good global strategy and a good example of what a u s based food company ought to be doing in order to maintain balance growth in this pretty turbulent food economy
6544877 the devil is here boy the devil himself the demon couldnt do what the devil sent him to do so the devil came himself
6544878 the plane was rocking back and forth until i suspected it was going to fall
6544879 i saw people smoke explosions i think that is what woke me up because i had lost consciousness
6544880 i thought that if help did not arrive soon i would die
6544881 we arrived three minutes late and they let us check in but we did not make it we ended up trying to find a new flight then we discovered the plane we would have been on had crashed
6544882 we had no idea what had happened my mouth dropped open
6544883 one of the most important lessons of the wars in iraq and afghanistan is that military success is not sufficient to win economic development institution building and the rule of law promoting internal reconciliation good governance providing basic services to the people training and equipping indigenous military and police forces strategic communications and more these along with security are essential ingredients for long term success
6544884 however you are very weak you have very little power in you at the moment it will take a few days to build up again to a normal level
6544885 everyone has a path my clan is blessed with the eye to see paths of people
6544886 yes your path is unseen to me everything is possibilities

6544889 i told him that you wouldnt want to go to a hospital and this was the best place to be
6544890 im pretty sure no one else knows what larios is exactly and im pretty sure hes watching the hospitals
6544891 we cant just be sitting here while hes there doing what he did to you
6544892 no this is crap i started this thing and i am going to finish it
6544893 but you had no right to take this stuff while i was knocked out
6544894 if you wish to speak of rank high mage duclan i outrank you
6544895 i let you leave freely with all information about the black mage however
6544896 you will be without the help of the white mage guard since you feel the need to strike out on your own
6544897 no offense but her skills as a mage are not developed as they should be
6544898 robotics shaped by and shaping the world in 2000 2050
6544899 just think this exciting technology that the world needs now more than ever has been developed right here in rochester new york at our facility in honeoye falls

6544901 many people get their information about the outside world from the media and a lot of media portray arabs negatively
6544902 ive learned a lot about tolerance and other peoples views and perceptions
6544903 give you confidence that you can speak in front of people
6544904 how did you know how many respirations the goldfish did
6544905 were getting a lot of preparation we wouldnt normally get
6544906 im getting exposed to professors and im asking them questions once i get to college ill know how to interact with professors
6544907 they are so willing to step up and be challenged
6544908 these presentation skills will help so much with interviewing and the college process
6544909 they picked some hot button issues but this wasnt just sitting around the table talking with their friends they had to back up their opinions with information
6544910 i worked one on one with the students in physics and it was exciting
6544911 i learned a lot about how to teach students at different levels
6544912 they are so willing to step up and be challenged
6544913 figuring out the right number of characters is a lot like chess you need to know the rules well and things need to be balanced properly well see what we end up with
6544914 the first 3 skypephone was about building one of the most popular internet services skype into the heart of the device the 3 skypephone s2 builds on this approach and brings a host of other popular internet services to the front of the device

6544918 his plan and his focus was to make it back this year and obviously he worked extremely hard to put himself in this position
6544919 there are always some crazy things i get flashed quite often luckily mostly from girls
6544920 la polic a tiene otra funci n tiene otro destino otra f rmula de trabajo donde tiene que haber orden tiene que existir disciplina tiene que haber una actitud adecuada aceptar una capacitaci n pero que no tiene nada que ver con militarizarla

6544922 the longer a serious disease goes undiagnosed the harder it is to treat and the further it can spread
6544923 this new test will eliminate a lot of the guesswork
6544924 being able to get such quick results for so many pathogens at once will become critical in case of bioterrorism
6544925 under that scenario every minute counts in providing treatment or preventing disease spread
6544926 prior research has suggested that the trend in strokes was increasing but our study shows declining incidence in stroke for non diabetic men both for first and recurrent stroke and in recurrent strokes in non diabetic women
6544927 the impressive decline in smoking and large decreases in cholesterol levels and to a lesser degree blood pressure levels in the population of northern sweden may have contributed to the declining incidence in both diabetic and non diabetic subjects over the study period
6544928 on the other hand we found more recurrent events among diabetic subjects than non diabetic subjects indicating a need for even more intensive secondary prevention among diabetic patients
6544929 the fact that patients with diabetes to a great extent had favorable time trends similar to those of non diabetics is particularly interesting considering that diabetic patients with heart attack from the same population did not show any positive trends over the 19 year study
6544930 bob reich argued that the government should invest in roads bridges worker training and the like to stimulate the economy and help the middle class on the other side was bob rubin a former goldman sachs executive turned white house aide who favored reducing the deficit to soothe the bond market bring down interest rates and get the economy moving again clinton cast his lot with rubin and to this day the first question about any democrats economic outlook is often where his heart lies with reich or rubin the left or the center the government or the market
6544931 the battle of the bobs may not be completely over but it has certainly been suspended
6544932 far more than many other policy advisers economists believe in the power of markets what tends to distinguish democratic economists is that they set out to uncover imperfections of the market and then come up with incremental market based solutions to these imperfections
6544933 there is plainly a big potential conflict between the university of chicago side of obama and the regulator side
6544934 when reagan was elected in 1980 tax rates on top incomes were so high that even liberal economists now say the economy was suffering there simply wasnt enough of an incentive for rich people to start new companies or expand existing ones because so much of their profits would have gone to the federal government
6544935 it would just go to the opposite end of the cage and freeze
6544936 were focused on this area because there are a lot of different pollutants that run off terrestrial landscapes in storm water and get into fish habitats
6544937 and because the nose is exposed to the environment water pollution can effectively interfere with the normal functioning of the nose
6544938 el capitalismo luce el nombre artistico de economia de mercado
6544939 its been said that google is the new resume truth be told any search engine whether social or traditional is the resume its the wikipedia entry for the rest of us its no longer what we decide to curate onto a piece of paper or onto one traditional one page digital resume it really is moot in a world when anyone can practically piece together your story without the help of a document designed to shape and steer our perception
6544940 back then the shows blog was already in full swing now its even more so with show highlights previews and interaction with the various commenters
6544941 oh well i just landed this job as a photographer based on my porfolio in luei of a degree and all of the travel to europe yep that was research
6544942 yeah i met him at that job i was talking about
6544943 he was married at the time and i knew he would probably never leave his wife i honestly didnt care
6544944 they almost did kill me actually those details they really did those details i almost let them get me they almost took me down
6544945 lets see lost most of my material possessions other than my clothes and some family rubbish that i have been carrying around with me my whole life in the marriage and then i bought some really cool stuff to replace everything i lost and then i sold some of that lost some of that well abused and overused some of that stuff really then i sold off everything else that was left and undestroyed somehow went to rehab and well then i didnt have anything but my clothes and red couch my dog and my cat not forgetting the family rubbish i sold off my old company stock worked out a budget bought a new car with cash yeah its a bmw i deserve it i could tell you stories and stories on how i have done my time and i deserve this oh and i rented this really cool place in the country and i am slowly starting to make it i am slowly starting to build my life build it not rebuild it
6544946 i have a lot of problems with the way this loan was written
6544947 there may be even compensatory issues in relation to these matters as this large tract of land was bought on the basis of the rezoning
6544948 until such time as these works are completed these lands remain as floodplain and at risk of flooding
6544949 therefore to permit development on lands currently functioning as floodplain would not be in the interests of sustainable development
6544950 we know that some people doubted us when we told them that diamond hill was right behind us
6544951 as for the inagh valley you could barely see it in the blanket of cloud and sheets of rain when we were coming through by coach
6544952 we try to avoid using any nails or screws as we make small pieces of furniture from wood and glue
6544953 you have your sauna you jump into the atlantic after
6544954 of the original scheme fortunately only half managed to get through thanks in many instances to appeals by conscientious dublin citizens
6544955 any so called metropole unit that was appealed to the board was shot down 100 per cent
6544956 since then it has become apparent that the scheme is an unmitigated disaster and epitomises what not to do when engaging in urban planning already some of the units have been withdrawn having been blatantly unsafe and manifestly hazardous
6544957 outrageously this scheme has simply been dumped on poorer and working class areas
6544958 no billboards for a southside dual carriageway such as donnybrook yet plenty for north king street and dorset street and also malahide road in coolock
6544959 these units were only removed following complaints from the public and we believe others are a hazard to public safety parnell street being one very obvious example
6544960 a gross irony and disgrace that the first clients have been the department of environment lecturing the public about not despoiling their environment
6544961 implemented an open and transparent process to procure a suitable advertising agency which would provide amenities for the city in a partnership approach
6544962 it was agreed that 450 bicycles would be made available at 50 stations located in the city centre
6544963 dublin city council has exclusive use of all jc decaux advertising panels at no cost for public information campaigns until august 31st
6544964 from september 1st the city council will acquire 38 of these panels also at no cost
6544965 indemnified the city council with regard to public liability claims arising from accidents pertaining to the advertising panels
6544966 maybe feist can make up a new numbers song for a political ad
6544967 1 2 3 4 lost a house right by the shore 5 6 7 8 gotta find it before debates
6544968 while you were out the democrats took over the internet
6544969 the man who gets the most satisfactory results is not always the man with the most brilliant single mind but rather the man who can best coordinate the brains and talents of his associates
6544970 today we recall his passion for public service and the example he set for generations of leaders on our island for the years to come
6544971 thank you so much for contributing to my air conditioning and i wish that maintenance will follow so that we will have air con throughout the whole year
6544972 nous reconnaissons que le gouvernement doit encore tudier cet accord et nous attendrons le temps de ce processus et puis il doit videmment aller au conseil des repr sentants
6544973 ce que nous avons accompli pour ce texte est la version la plus avanc e de tout
6544974 car les n gociateurs am ricains ont montr beaucoup de flexibilit et de compr hension
6544975 nous sommes convenus que certains objectifs certaines aspirations de calendrier concernant le d roulement valent la peine de figurer dans un tel accord

6544977 all persons are by nature free and independent and have certain natural and unalienable rights among which are those of enjoying and defending life and liberty of acquiring possessing and protecting property and of pursuing and obtaining safety and happiness
6544978 it is merely a band aid albeit an enormously expensive and porous band aid the bondholders told podcast feed
6544979 because subsonic generated code i found it unexplainable why i cannot write something like
6544980 that said there have not been issues with those carriers in the past about dropped calls and such because their implementation kept voice calls on the legacy 2 5g network and data fenced into the ev do network channels
6544981 we have watched the launch of cell phones over and over for the last 30 years but this is the first lawsuit i have ever heard of like this one
6544982 this may be the other side of the apple coin so much attention and hype during the last year generates the expectation of perfection
6544983 the single biggest problem in communication is the illusion that it has taken place
6544984 my wife would jump up every time the phone rang in the middle of the night she would wake up afraid and just sit up in bed
6544985 the government is in the habit of losing laptops frequently with personal information
6544986 hey did you know that god made mary well he did and shes like a mother to us now lets ask her to pray for us
6544987 we just have to always remember that what isnt paid by system development charges are paid by the rest of the ratepayers so whatever is delayed by systems development charges could become a burden on the rest of t

6544997 areas that have an abundance of hydroelectricity like the pacific northwest
6544998 will be significantly less impacted by a carbon tax than texas
6544999 theres nothing sympathetic or empathetic about your character its just totally horrible
6545000 no he sounds like me because i came first i was doing me before he existed so he sounds like me
6545001 but alan partridge is a dick how can there be something of you in him
6545002 im nothing like my characters theyre all fucked up and im really really sound and un fucked up
6545003 why dont i play myself as incredibly self centered and ask alfred molina if hell play himself as slightly going off the rails and losing it a bit and pretend his careers in a downward trajectory
6545004 id walk around the room wave my arms talk in a certain way id try different voices out in front of them
6545005 we are thinking clearly and we know that we did not always perform well against bordeaux
6545006 but to win this match showed our combative frame of mind everyone gave a tremendous effort to make up for any errors made by their team mates it was a victory won with the head
6545007 i think that claude mak l l makes us better
6545008 we missed a guy in the middle that would talk and tell us the truth even if it hurt
6545009 it is typical of the player that he is he is a true a leader and a barker on the pitch he brings experience but also a hatred of defeat that pushes everyone forward
6545010 we travel to sochaux with firm intentions to start a positive series of results
6545011 it is important to start well in august if we lose in sochaux and caen we will not have made a good start to the season
6545012 we will try to anchor ourselves into the middle of the table but we ambitions to aim higher we know that our level of play has to improve
6545013 all men can handle adversity for a real test of character give a man power
6545014 it was almost the b stard child of the regular games business
6545015 with innovation comes risk but also reward if you are successful
6545016 they were successful in launching an assembly time management mechanic with their cake mania franchise and introduced casual gamers to the role playing and trading sim game genres via their tradewinds series
6545017 it is good value proposition from the standpoint of an advertiser
6545018 we have a pretty good idea who our customer is and they are a captive audience they are there to play a game
6545019 people are going to know about a handful of developers and handful of games
6545020 and i think the majority of the casual games business is going to be driven around those brands from a company perspective i think we are very well positioned to really be one of those companies that is talked about in that perspective
6545021 if i am not in the trenches with my developers i am not going to know as much
6545022 when enforcing the law school curve i do not believe that students should be grading each others assignments when they have an overwhelming incentive to give low grades to boost their own this invites dishonesty and unfairness i guarantee you that students will not hesitate to slash the grades of others to get ahead keep grading entirely in your own hands
6545023 as we will being ranked in the law school as individuals it is senseless to base grades to any extent whatsoever on the performance of others i understand the pedagogical goals behind group work but those can still be accomplished while grading us as individuals rather than as teams
6545024 i am so absolutely and so sincerely sorry about my message
6545025 ah ha there are no longer any references to this little block of memory ill collect it
6545026 die internationale gemeinschaft kritisiert das vorr cken russischer panzer nach georgien niemand spricht aber ber die trag die von zchinwali als georgien eine schlafende stadt unter beschuss nahm

6545029 with the 2008 fly in under our belt we have a much better idea of how to utilize these excellent facilities and amazing support from the city and the airport
6545030 our focus will be recruiting many more volunteer chairmen to plan and coordinate an expanded roster of activities for next year
6545031 more pilots up and down the east coast are logging suffolk executive airport sfq as their go to fbo for service amenities convenience comfort and value our adjacent festival grounds provide a seamless extension for numerous exhibits and the opportunity for even more camaraderie
6545032 this is outstanding news for those aviation enthusiasts in israel who have sought to have the freedom to build their own aircraft
6545033 eaa members in israel took the initiative to do the painstaking legwork to make this hope a reality they can be rightly proud of their efforts to open the door to this segment of recreational flight
6545034 eaa members in israel and the local ultralight association joined forces to make this possible along with our nations aviation authorities
6545035 eaa members supplied the ideas and the drive while the ultralight groups financial resources made it possible to sustain this effort over the four years necessary to make it happen
6545036 we dont need any new regulations on the 51 rule the faa just needs to enforce the rules it has in place
6545037 our goal first and foremost is to protect the existing rights and privileges of amateur aircraft builders
6545038 the issue is people who are having their aircraft built for them who are not building a true amateur built aircraft
6545039 this new requirement only makes it more difficult for legitimate amateur builders to document compliance
6545040 it would have no effect on those who may currently fraudulently declare that their aircraft was constructed by amateurs
6545041 we are counting on the fact that there wont be any supply disruption
6545042 were not worried because even in the most stressful moments we didnt had problems

6545044 so far we have catalogued 180 facilities most of them are privately owned have low capacity and are destined to hotel services and to a lesser degree power generation
6545045 there are three other relevant desalination projects at different stages of development which involve participation from the private sector
6545046 camelina is a wild growing plant in dry portions of the american west and northwest that is gaining recognition for its potential for conversion to biodiesel

6545071 dateline tbilisi it was back in february that billionaire financier george soros began laying the brickwork for the toppling of georgian president eduard shevardnadze
6545072 that month funds from his open society institute sent a 31 year old tbilisi activist named giga bokeria to serbia to meet with members of the otpor resistance movement and learn how they used street demonstrations to topple dictator slobodan milosevic
6545073 last weekend the liberty institute that mr bokeria helped found was instrumental in organizing the street protests that eventually forced mr shevardnadze to sign his resignation papers

6545131 the camera is an instrument that teaches people how to see without a camera
6545132 photos always seem to exist as sort of stuffy unnecessary antiques that we put in a drawer unless we take them out put them in current dialogue and give them relevance
6545133 what the modern means of reproduction have done is destroy the authority of art and to remove it or rather to remove the images which they reproduce from any preserve for the first time ever images of art have become ephemeral ubiquitous insubstantial available valueless free they surround us the way language surrounds us the art of the past no longer exists as it once did its authority is lost in its place there is a language of images what matters now is who uses that language for what purpose
6545134 p hotographs depend for their meaning on networks of authority the image supplies little in itself what counts is its use and the power to fix a particular interpretation of the events objects or people depicted some people and especially some institutions have much more clout in this processs than others do
6545135 the first question must always be who is using this photograph and to what end
6545136 by contrast almost all writing about photography in our times tends to begin with the alleged nature of the product rather than with its production and use
6545137 review of george lewis a power stronger than itself the aacm and american experimental music
6545138 picturing the public in black amp white working notes inspired by robert westbrooks democratic hope pragmatism amp the politics of truth
6545139 the opinion that art should have nothing to do with politics is itself a political attitude
6545140 can it still be controversial to say that an apparently disengaged poetics may also speak a political language of self enclosed complacency passivity opportunism false neutrality
6545141 those who say that art should not propagate doctrines usually refer to doctrines that are opposed to their own
6545142 hard and fast categories tend to be instruments used by the victors
6545143 my position is that you cannot work towards peace being peaceful if the peace is to be one where everybodys quiet and doesnt open up share whats unspeakable offer unsolicited criticism defend others rights to speak and encourage discourse that peace is worth nothing it reminds me of the kind of peace that was secured in my old country under the communist regime that is the death of democracy that might have consequences as bad as war bloody war and conflict so to prevent the world from bloody conflict we must sustain a certain kind of adversarial life in which we are struggling with our problems in public
6545144 apolitical art and artless politics are the fruit of a divide and conquer strategy that weakens both art and politics ignite each other and need each other
6545145 i am interested in a political art that is to say an art of ambiguity contradiction uncompleted gestures and uncertain endings an art and a politics in which optimism is kept in check and nihilism at bay
6545146 most of all photography is probably an instrument for showing things a device for displaying them
6545147 democracy is a proposal rarely realised about decision making it has little to do with election campaigns
6545148 605 one of the most dangerous ideas for a philosopher is oddly enough that we think with or in our heads 606 the idea of thinking as a process in the head in a completely enclosed space gives him something occult 607 is thinking a specific organic process of the mind so to speak as it were chewing and digesting in the mind can we replace it by an inorganic process that fulfills the same end as it were a prosthetic apparatus for thinking how should we have to imagine a prosthetic organ of thought
6545149 if one takes the view that human mental activity depends for its full expression upon being linked to a cultural tool kit a set of prosthetic devices so to speak then we are well advised when studying mental activity to take into account the tools employed in that activity
6545150 i want to take you higher baby baby baby light my fire
6545151 the questions a photographer raises may be more profound than the answers the medium permits
6545152 because you know the photographs are more a question than a reply
6545153 a picture can be an answer as well as a question but if you cant answer your question try to question your question there are clever questions and stupid answers as well as stupid questions and clever answers there can be questions without answers but no answers without questions
6545154 the best art makes your head spin with questions perhaps this is the fundamental distinction between pure art and pure design while great art makes you wonder great design makes things clear
6545155 i dont think it is the function of art to be pleasing art is not democratic
6545156 we may distinguish between two types of imaginative process the one starts with the word and arrives at the visual image and the one starts with the visual image and arrives at its verbal expression
6545157 there is something embarrassing in the way in which turning suffering into images harsh and uncompromising though they are wounds the shame we feel in the presence of the victims for these victims are used to create something works of art that are thrown to the consumption of a world which destroyed them the so called artistic representation of the sheer physical pain of people beaten to the ground by rifle butts contains however remotely the power to elicit enjoyment out of it the moral of this art not to forget for a single instant slithers into the abyss of its opposite the aesthetic principle of stylization makes an unthinkable fate appear to have had some meaning it is transfigured something of its horror removed this alone does an injustice to the victims yet no art which tried to evade them could confront the claims of justice
6545158 the test of a first rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function one should for example be able to see that things are hopeless and yet be determined to make them otherwise
6545159 a photograph is a moral decision taken in one eighth of a second or one sixteenth or one one hundred and twenty eighth snap your fingers a snapshots faster
6545160 the greatest obstacle to transforming the world is that we lack the clarity and imagination to conceive that it could be different
6545161 another world is not only possible she is on her way on a quiet day i can hear her breathing
6545162 a limited imagination defends itself against recognizing the world as a system of connected vessels it also is incapable of moving beyond the familiar
6545163 great numbers however cause particular difficulties for our imagination as if we observe humanity in a way that is not permitted for humans and allowed only to gods in other words they can think in categories of masses a million people more a million less what difference does it make
6545164 politics depends to a great extent on judging what is actual relative to what is possible however we have an inherently weak grasp of what is possible and most societies are not set up so as naturally to improve this or to make us aware of possibilities we may have ignored or taken with insufficient seriousness
6545165 be still be calm be quiet now my precious boy dont struggle like that or i will only love you more for its much too late to get away or turn on the light the spiderman is having you for dinner tonight

6545205 i dont think its a contradiction of our message to work with people who also support senator obama
6545206 i think senator obama likes a big tent and were going to have an organization that helps us win philadelphia decisively
6545207 i remember when bill clinton came and he went out on 52nd and market he has to do that just to reassure his voters that he cares about their vote
6545208 i think youll see senator obama in the state frequently i think youll see him in philadelphia as well

6545236 our parents association is second to none theyve been marvelous
6545237 its made up of members from each of the three schools and theyve been so eager to dive into this and they all put their childrens catholic education first
6545238 i didnt have a problem when we heard the news of the merger but then again im not originally from port richmond
6545239 but for a lot of the parents who went to nativity bvm as kids and now send their own kids there this hit them hard
6545240 maybe older grades will have a this is my turf attitude
6545241 but the younger grades will all get along because this is so new to them but im hoping for the best we all have to come together for our kids to get the best catholic education and stay in this community
6545242 i would have liked for it to be blessed trinity to incorporate the three schools
6545243 i know a lot of kids from the other school
6545244 i play soccer softball and basketball and i cant wait to go out for the team at the new school
6545245 right away i told myself that could never happen nobody wants their school to close
6545246 but when the decision was made i had mixed emotions
6545247 port richmond is still a very close knit tight neighborhood and the kids all hang around and play together
6545248 i think all the schools after the shock all want to come together for the good of a quality catholic education unity is strength
6545249 once i realized that port richmond had a chapel on the river called our lady of port richmond for all the sailors and dock workers it all made sense and it was a good fit

6545258 mental models are deeply ingrained assumptions generalizations or even pictures or images that influence how we understand the world and how we take action very often we are not consciously aware of our mental models or the effects they have on our behavior
6545259 as a leadership capability sensemaking closely resembles map making at the mit leadership center dialogue on sensemaking academics and practitioners spoke of places observations and directions of where we are where and why we are going and what we should look for as we go like cartographers sensemakers create consequences with their maps the way they understand and then describe an environment has ramifications because this understanding guides future action

6545268 fda concludes that irradiation of iceberg lettuce and spinach conducted in accordance with good manufacturing practices will reduce or eliminate bacterial populations
6545269 i hope we will see a reduction in the number of food borne illnesses
6545270 it gives the industry another tool to increase food safety
6545271 there is no reason to suspect a toxicological hazard due to consumption of an irradiated food
6545272 the treatment of food with ionizing radiation can produce a wide variety of beneficial effects
6545273 however it should be clear that irradiation is not a remedy for unsatisfactory production practices
6545274 it is unlikely that irradiation will have significant nutritional impact on a balanced diet of raw canned and ready to eat fruits and vegetables
6545275 we dont have much concern about the safety of irradiated foods

6545279 la ocasi n es propicia para realizar tres se alamientos le hemos hecho seguimiento en el estado miranda pero puede repetirse en todo el pa s el consejo nacional electoral est dedicado a montar estructuras paralelas a las establecidas por la ley ahora montaron el ome oficinas municipales electorales tratando de burlar lo que la ley dice sobre las juntas electorales municipales figura que rige el proceso en los municipios
6545280 no conforme con eso usan el frente francisco de miranda para colocar como coordinadores de los centros electorales a militantes de psuv a esto se le suma la presencia de las milicias que tambi n son afectos del oficialismo tenemos una situaci n donde debemos estar alertas
6545281 estamos en una escalada donde el actual gobierno mediante maniobras de toda naturaleza busca controlar el proceso electoral se les ha dado orden a los activistas del psuv para que traten de controlar las presidencias de las mesas electorales
6545282 tratamos de averiguar el trasfondo de estas acciones y del inter s por controlar los cuadernos de votaci n les pido a las fuerzas opositoras permanecer con los ojos bien abiertos les hago un llamado a todas aquellas personas que han sido preseleccionadas como miembros de mesa a cumplir con este deber no renuncien a esta posibilidad
6545283 were seeing a lot more spread that is concerning to us
6545284 this year we certainly have had parents asking more questions
6545285 this is a guy who lived in one house for five and a half years in prison
6545286 these findings shed light on why in listening environments such as noisy parties or restaurants it is more difficult to follow a conversation involving many people where the relevant talker often and unexpectedly changes locations than to focus on one talker at one location exclusively
6545287 in addition these results may have implications for visual attention in tasks where object formation and target segmentation is challenging or where the identity of a visual object depends upon continuity of visual features over time
6545288 but the point is you want to be able to communicate in your native language
6545289 they also cost more we dont think its fair for someone whos deaf to have to pay more for his or her cell phone than someone whos hearing
6545290 initially scanning electron microscopy sem conducted at another laboratory showed high silicon and oxygen signals that led them to conclude that the spores were a weaponized form says kotula
6545291 the possible misinterpretation of the sem results arose because microanalysis in the sem is not a surface sensitive tool
6545292 because a spore body can be 1 5 to 2 microns wide by 1 micron long a sem cannot localize the elemental signal from whole spore bodies
6545293 lacked that fuzzy outer coating that would indicate that theyd been weaponized
6545294 the research raises the perception both of how common these events are and specifically where they may occur
6545295 today with so many more buildings and people a magnitude 5 centered below the city would be extremely attention getting
6545296 wed see billions in damage with some brick buildings falling people would probably be killed
6545297 we need to step backward from the simple old model where you worry about one large obvious fault like they do in california
6545298 the problem here comes from many subtle faults we now see there is earthquake activity on them each one is small but when you add them up they are probably more dangerous than we thought we need to take a very close look
6545299 the probability is not zero and the damage could be great
6545300 it could be like something out of a greek myth
6545301 indian point is situated at the intersection of the two most striking linear features marking the seismicity and also in the midst of a large population that is at risk in case of an accident
6545302 this is clearly one of the least favorable sites in our study area from an earthquake hazard and risk perspective
6545303 new data developed in the last 20 years disclose a substantially higher likelihood of significant earthquake activity in the vicinity of indian point that could exceed the earthquake design for the facility
6545304 nothing happens for a while then it goes with a bang
6545305 is a major substantiation of a feature that bears on the long term earthquake risk of the northeastern united states
6545306 it gives us the best possible evidence that we have an earthquake hazard here that should be a factor in any planning decision it crystallizes the argument that this hazard is not random there is a structure to the location and timing of the earthquakes this enables us to contemplate risk in an entirely different way and since we are able to do that we should be required to do that
6545307 new york is not as prone to earthquakes as california and japan but they do happen this study takes a more realistic look at the possibility of larger ones and why earthquakes concentrate in certain places to understand risk you have to multiply hazard by assets and vulnerability when you factor that in our risk is high too much attention has been paid to the level of hazard and not enough to the risk earthquake hazard is about the same today as in 1609 when henry hudson sailed up the river but earthquake risk is much much higher today since the number of people assets and their vulnerability are so much greater
6545308 we think that the intersection of these two features being so close to indian point makes it a place of greater risk than most other points on the map
6545309 most people underestimate the hazard here any conservative approach will look at geologically similar environments if you do that we are similar to bhuj india where a 2001 magnitude 7 quake killed over 15 000 people there was no obvious sign of strain there there is a mystery here to be solved and we better step back and do our homework
6545310 once you accept that one fault in a family is active you better consider that all the faults in that family could be active we need to adapt our structures with that in mind
6545311 you could debate whether a magnitude 6 or 7 is possible but weve already had three magnitude fives so that is very realistic there is no one now alive now to remember that last one so people tend to forget and having only a partial 300 year history we may not have seen everything we could see there could be surprises things bigger than we have ever seen
6545312 we advise investors to stay on the sidelines given our concerns regarding salesforces potentially weak bookings growth
6545313 investors could extrapolate that bookings have been weak given lower than expected deferred revenue growth
6545314 slightly below 4q08 total deferred revenue of 480 9 million
6545315 backlog along with deferred revenue grew 60 in q2 meaning the off balance sheet component grew much faster than deferred revenue
6545316 salesforce com is experiencing greater seasonality as it closes larger deals which have also lead to higher backlog
6545317 it could be a cyst or a benign tumor or
6545318 i knew yesterday but i thought i would give you one more normal day
6545319 barack obamas ad is ridiculous because of john mccain corruption was exposed and people like jack abramoff went to jail
6545320 however if barack obama wants to have a discussion about truly questionable associations lets start with his relationship with the unrepentant terrorist william ayers at whose home obamas political career was reportedly launched
6545321 the question now is will barack obama immediately call on the university of illinois to release all of the records they are currently withholding to shed further light on senator obamas relationship with this unrepentant terrorist
6545322 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses does a guy who worries about the price of arugula and thinks regular people cling to guns and religion in the face of economic hardship really want to have a debate about whos in touch with regular americans
6545323 the reality is that barack obamas plans to raise taxes and opposition to producing more energy here at home as gas prices skyrocket show hes completely out of touch with the concerns of average americans
6545324 were delighted to have a real estate debate with barack obama
6545325 its a frickin mansion he doesnt tell people that you have a mansion you bought in a shady deal with a convicted felon
6545326 you are going to see more of that now that this issue has been joined youll see more of the rezko matter from us

6545333 i was able to steer us around and pick up vietnamese boat people at a time when they were being kidnapped for ransom by pirates well not literally pirates but guys who were on the high seas sometimes it would be oil tankers or somebody would pick them up and bring them back to the vietnamese government and get paid for it
6545334 gene upshaw did everything with great dignity pride and conviction
6545335 he was the rare individual who earned his place in the both for his accomplishments on the field and for his leadership of the players off the field he fought hard for the players and always kept his focus on what was best for the game his leadership played a crucial role in taking the nfl and its players to new heights
6545336 he was and will remain a part of the fabric of our lives and of the raider mystique and legacy
6545337 we loved him and he loved us we will miss him
6545338 the reality of life for all the guys who played in the nfl including gene is that we have a short life span its just the way it is
6545339 i have sympathy for his family i have sympathy for his wife and children
6545340 in both careers if you hit him in the head he could hit you back twice as hard but he didnt always do so
6545341 he was very tough but also a good listener he never lost sight of the interests of the game and the big picture
6545342 i cant imagine a world without genes larger than life presence
6545343 im not going to sell the players on a cap again
6545344 once we go through the cap why should we agree to it again
6545345 gene and i developed a close friendship that remained strong through the good times and some of the nfls most difficult challenges
6545346 we worked very closely on key issues that allowed the nfl to maintain unprecedented labor peace his biggest asset was his understanding of the business of the game and you always knew that his concern for the games best interests guided his actions
6545347 gene was a true pioneer as one of the few african american leaders of a major union
6545348 he was the equal of owners in negotiations and made the league a better place for all players playing alongside of gene was an honor and a privilege he was a pillar of strength and leadership for our great raider teams
6545349 delay doesnt work as a tactic i want them to come in quickly and resolve this expeditiously
6545350 the main point is the timing of how quickly they offer the buy backs to the investors
6545351 we want that done quickly and they had a voluntary time frame that was not acceptable

6545360 liverpool was in poet allen ginsbergs words the center of the creative universe
6545361 we now seem to be on the cusp of moving into a great period of cultural and creative industries around our 800th anniversary and being the european capital of culture
6545362 beginning to feed and clothe itself on the black market
6545363 tell us a lot i think about contemporary culture and character as history
6545364 in the current exercise in urban renaissance were seeing something very different from what has been tried earlier on earlier on culture had simply been the magnet trying to attract what really mattered to industrial investment proper jobs now culture itself is hailed as the economic driver as the best means of enhancing graduate retention
6545365 the best means of reversing the talent and brain drain away from liverpool
6545366 and there are tremendous optimistic predictions of what might happen now that we are capital of culture
6545367 i wonder whether we really have found a sustainable way forward for liverpool by putting all the eggs in the cultural and creative industries
6545368 the current cultural rebranding seems to me to be reinforcing perhaps rather too dramatically the city center focus of the regeneration agenda and thats markedly different from what we were talking about in the 1950s
6545369 at redefining and reviving rebranding liverpool from a policy of outlying industrial diversification
6545370 designer chic now prevails in a city propelled by culturally creative industries tourism consumption and city center living
6545371 were going to end up with a rapidly regenerating and gentrifying urban core surrounded by a ring of intensely disadvantaged residential areas
6545372 one wonders whether this cosmetic makeover of the city center is at the cost of its distinct identity that otherness about liverpool that has been so cherished in the past
6545373 love is a four letter word youre in this prison
6545374 thats not the smartest thing to do right now because

6545393 the whole world is a mess and i just want to rule it
6545394 people who sort of even know me in real life sometimes express disbelief until the people who really do know me confirm to them that its all true people who dont know me at all usually think i make all this crap up the funniest part of this to me is that there is so much that i actually dont write about that is about a hundred times crazier than the stuff i actually do write about if you all only knew thats all i have to say if yall only knew
6545395 decisions decisions just roll the dice fate is going to do with you what she will anyway

6545397 theres no rule that says you have to be fulfilled doing a particular socially acceptable thing
6545398 its a strange thing to discover when youre an adult that youve been somewhat misadjusted to the world your entire life and didnt know it
6545399 if you can get past the occasional imbecile induced bike folly and the fact that davis seems to perpetually be in the path of some giant bipolar tornado you may come to realize that this city is a great place to live
6545400 i see a bookshelf filled with different books from different authors all acting as portals to different worlds and different times the author may give them birth but its the readers who keep them alive
6545401 some books contain the machinery required to create and sustain universes
6545402 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
6545403 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me
6545404 i found that writing for me was a thing of the hands hands need to produce art and whether its written or made it feeds the need to produce art
6545405 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
6545406 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
6545407 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
6545408 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking
6545409 why does my job exist it exists because i willed it into existence when the day goes badly i can remind myself that i have asked for this job by name and thought to create this for myself and i can only blame myself for the whole thing
6545410 dude i was a nerd from the day i was born i was reading in kindergarten i got humungous glasses that covered half of my face in second grade ive been living the nerd life ever since
6545411 people with happy families dont become spies a bad childhood is the perfect background for covert ops you dont trust anyone youre used to getting smacked around and you never get homesick
6545412 i sometimes think god is a shit and he wouldnt be worth it otherwise hes much more interesting when hes a shit
6545413 sometimes though you dont get to choose what kinda fame youre gonna get or how much itll cost ya
6545414 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
6545415 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother
6545416 when you are young passion and hope are so strong thats its almost impossible to stop loving someone after youve been kicked around by life however you start to have a dual response to handsome con men wow and arrrrrrgh it takes not will power but painful experience to make us wise
6545417 be of service go where you can help if youre an artist be of service to your art dont have it the other way around you have to put aside your dreams of being a hotshot and learn to be useful you step up everyday get a nice clean hit and youre done
6545418 oh honey you just need to meet the right man
6545419 whenever youre called on to make up your mind and youre hampered by not having any the simplest way to solve the dilemma youll find is simply by flipping a penny no not so that chance shall decide the affair as youre passively standing there moping but as soon as the penny is up in the air youll suddenly know what youre hoping
6545420 im not normal by conventional social standards and ill never be so maybe i should stop worrying and just embrace the insanity a bit

6545423 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really
6545424 oddly enough she can handle having a lesbian daughter much better than one who is still single at 30
6545425 as you know some research published in the last 5 years has suggested that there is no residual spirituality within contemporary culture
6545426 living within the event that is testified to in christianity is more important than the affirmation that one is a christian or in other words the event contained in the affirmation of god is more important than the belief in god

6545455 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo
6545456 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
6545457 y d nde est el famoso estado de derecho sirve acaso para algo
6545458 estamos ante un hecho delictual o m s bien pol tico
6545459 claramente se trata de un simple hecho delictual lo peor ser a darle un cariz pol tico a estas acciones vand licas repudiadas por la ciudadania
6545460 extra o hecho delictual donde los malhechores no roban nada y lo que parecieran visibilizar m s bien son consignas
6545461 quien no entiende a la buena entender con toda la fuerza del derecho
6545462 estamos ante un hecho delictual y perseguiremos crimin lmente a los responsables
6545463 seremos m s severos en la represi n no se va a tolerar ning n tipo de impunidad
6545464 62 hect reas una yunta de bueyes una vaca parida semillas y madera
6545465 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
6545466 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
6545467 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano
6545468 desmiento cualquier vinculaci n con patria roja no hemos recibido ninguna llamada del congresista isla no tenemos nada que ver con hugo ch vez no tenemos nada que ver con ning n partido pol tico porque stos lejos de solucionarnos los problemas nos traen m s
6545469 ellos paran la movilizaci n y nosotros reiniciamos el di logo
6545470 existe una soluci n en el fondo del problema que un ente arbitral como el tc puede resolver sobre la nulidad o no de estas normas lo que ah tenemos es una luz sin que esto impida que se extiendan con mayor profundidad los mecanismos de concertaci n y di logo
6545471 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
6545472 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
6545473 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
6545474 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
6545475 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6545476 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6545477 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
6545478 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
6545479 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
6545480 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
6545481 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
6545482 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
6545483 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
6545484 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
6545485 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
6545486 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
6545487 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
6545488 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
6545489 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
6545490 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
6545491 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
6545492 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
6545493 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos
6545494 god is a culture maker and we are created in this creative image
6545495 these improvements mark continued progress toward eliminating threats to our waters and the health of our families from the discharge of untreated sewage
6545496 we must continue to make the necessary financial and resource investments in michigans future until all untreated sewer overflows are eliminated
6545497 sewage contamination continues to pose a serious threat to the great lakes and the people who depend on them yet congress and the president have slashed funding to help local communities modernize their wastewater infrastructure and reduce sewage contamination
6545498 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
6545499 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
6545500 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
6545501 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
6545502 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
6545503 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica
6545504 pertenencia a la historia del pa s como grupo humano que adem s es depositario de buena parte de la memoria hist rica
6545505 como sujetos activos y no como meros objetos de estudio
6545506 rescatar la memoria hist rica de nuestros pueblos originarios para darles la m s amplia difusi n posible
6545507 participamos del debate educativo y congreso nacional de educaci n donde fueron recogidas muchas de nuestras reivindicaciones continuamos nuestra larga lucha para que estos insumos sean recogidos por la nueva ley de educaci n y permitan la permanencia de nuestra cultura
6545508 i think he should show more respect for his competitors and shake hands give a tap on the shoulder to the other ones immediately after the finish and not make gestures like the one he made in the 100 metres
6545509 what they wanted to do with me is to take my livelihood away and everything else
6545510 i dont think thats constructive to somebody whos struggling to take their passion away from them i feel very strongly about that
6545511 thats what i feel is the biggest lesson to be learned everybody does deserve a second chance or a third chance or whatever if you believe that they can actually come back and do some good
6545512 ive been through a really rough time in my life and i think it made me the person that i am today and made me dive like this
6545513 of all the forms of inequity injustice in healthcare is the most shocking and inhumane
6545514 well thank you but really i want to talk about healthcare
6545515 i am going to do this and this is how i am going to do it
6545516 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
6545517 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
6545518 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana
6545519 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso
6545520 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
6545521 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
6545522 eu acho que a gente tinha que ter tido mais paci ncia mas algumas meninas a gente via que estavam estressadas querendo resolver sozinhas acho que o time perdeu a cabe a e agora acabou
6545523 o que d i que tivemos outra chance de ganhar o ouro e desperdi amos eu estou me perguntando o que acontece
6545524 a gente joga os jogos todos bem tem vezes que a gente faz gol superf cil e hoje a gente tentava e a bola n o entrava n o sei o que acontece com o time em finais
6545525 callate la boca no hables m s esta es la ltima la pr xima vez sos boleta
6545526 por su vida y la de su n cleo familiar
6545527 esperamos que las autoridades de gobierno se abstengan de seguir interviniendo a favor del citado proyecto para que pueda ser evaluado correctamente
6545528 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
6545529 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
6545530 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
6545531 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
6545532 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto
6545533 aporte potencial de energ as renovables no convencionales y eficiencia energ tica a la matriz el ctrica 2008 2025
6545534 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
6545535 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
6545536 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
6545537 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
6545538 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
6545539 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
6545540 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
6545541 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
6545542 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
6545543 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
6545544 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
6545545 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
6545546 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
6545547 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
6545548 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
6545549 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
6545550 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
6545551 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
6545552 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
6545553 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
6545554 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
6545555 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
6545556 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
6545557 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
6545558 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
6545559 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
6545560 first how does this political choice play out for the marginalized second how does this political choice support global peace how did it come to be that we evangelicals have become the chief advocates of war of any demographic in the country we christians ought to be the hardest to convince we ought to require the highest burden of proof we ought to demand the most evidence before we support any military action the church is always a peace movement
6545561 whats she not telling you about her health care plan it forces everyone to buy insurance even if you cant afford it
6545562 i dont want to wake up four years from now and discover that we still have more young black men in prison than in college
6545563 say it obama say that when she and her husband were having marital difficulties regarding monica lewinsky who did she and bill bring to the white house for spiritual counseling
6545564 whats she not telling you about her health care plan it forces everyone to buy insurance even if you cant afford it
6545565 barack obama believes that we can do more to help autistic americans and their families understand and live with autism
6545566 i just accepted a dare to go spend 90 days in jail if i can do it the guy who dared me says hell pay me a nice wad of cash
6545567 i just accepted a dare to go spend 90 days in jail if i can do it the guy who dared me says hell pay me a nice wad of cash
6545568 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
6545569 india is very likely to get the exemption at the nsg that its seeking there is some scepticism new zealand ireland is frequently named the netherlands has come up before they are all sceptical and worried about the implications of the deal but when push comes to shove they are very unlikely to vote against the deal
6545570 the circumstances are quite favourable for this to go through its mostly a matter of implementation whether this goes through before bush leaves office is mostly a technical issue but im very optimistic that this will happen
6545571 i think its more likely that they will raise questions about this deal and ask for those questions to be adequately answered before they are willing to go along with the deal so in their minds it wouldnt be stopping it it would be simply seeking additional information
6545572 quit f ing around with the pic sizes im pretty sure if the pic is 2 big i want it like that
6545573 no nada fue cancelado se pospuso hay propuestas que valen la pena esperar estoy tranquila
6545574 no hay dinero en el mundo que me haga trabajar alg n d a con simon cowell
6545575 no s c mo se pone la cabeza a trav s de los agujeros en sus camisetas porque son realmente ajustadas
6545576 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
6545577 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
6545578 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
6545579 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
6545580 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
6545581 yeah i think ill be ready for training camp but i still think well take it slow because theres no reason to push it in training camp i think coach is going to want me to be in shape so i think ill do a lot of off the court things to try to keep my wind up but at the same time i like to play just to get my rhythm i think ill be back before training camp but i i may not do as much ill just try to build it slowly
6545582 fifth in the nba chuckle usa today had that wow laughs
6545583 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
6545584 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
6545585 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
6545586 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
6545587 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
6545588 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
6545589 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
6545590 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
6545591 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
6545592 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6545593 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6545594 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
6545595 were delighted to have a real estate debate with barack obama
6545596 its a frickin mansion he doesnt tell people that you have a mansion you bought in a shady deal with a convicted felon
6545597 you are going to see more of that now that this issue has been joined youll see more of the rezko matter from us
6545598 attention iowa democrats please organize a search party for dlc chairman harold ford thank you

6545600 paging john edwards and barack obama your republican talking points are calling
6545601 ted kennedy endorsed obama to preserve jfks civil rights legacy what legacy
6545602 se valorar n los derechos de ciudad del reencuentro de abordar caracas para la reconciliaci n y la prosperidad dejar de ser trinchera para el odio ahora habr prosperidad y alegr a no vamos a escoger un mago vamos a escoger una entidad que va a facilitar el cambio
6545603 el tema no es si un partido tiene muchos o pocos candidatos o cual ha sido el trabajo lo importante es cu l candidato tiene la posibilidad de darle a caracas y al pueblo lo que necesita para recuperar la alcald a metropolitana
6545604 sol a tocar el clarinete con la banda de jaipur he visto el mandato brit nico y a tres soberanos reinando en jaipur
6545605 this dog which isnt chained runs after passersby to bite them and this is the reason for the conflict between rajkumari and jagdish das
6545606 my neighbours want to grab my property their every attempt was foiled by chhotu and so they want to get rid of him
6545607 had the charge that he bites passersby been true chhotu wouldve bitten people on the court premises
6545608 theres more to the case against him than meets the eye
6545609 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
6545610 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
6545611 for all the talk about changing the electoral map the core of it is still the same right here
6545612 mccain is looking at the nature of the electorate and has a reasonable chance to cherry pick some voters
6545613 these are the kinds of voters who were reluctant to vote for obama in the primary and the republicans think they can make inroads with them

6545615 our dealers are asking for many more cobalts than we can build
6545616 our goal is for the chevrolet cruze to lead in fuel economy in this very competitive car segment
6545617 we havent been out since tuesday because of the bad driving
6545618 it was hard to see because of all of the rain but we have plenty of canned food
6545619 as far as we know we cant leave our condominiums to get to highway a1a because the police are blocking it
6545620 im up here im not unfortunate i can cook a hamburger ive got power i feel very blessed
6545621 ive lived here 43 years and ive never seen anything like it
6545622 wreckage was strewn for about a mile down the beach
6545623 we dont live in a flood zone but it just came in and came in and came in
6545624 there will be no buffer zones we will never live with any buffer zones well never allow anything like this
6545625 i can see 21 t 72 tanks moving towards the roki tunnel in the direction of russia
6545626 i can also see four grad artillery launchers several armoured personnel carriers and heavy trucks ready to move into the tunnel
6545627 they dont show any sign that they want to give up control
6545628 it looks like the word withdrawal is understood in different ways by different people
6545629 go hard is what we doing to survive in this world this anthem is timeless there are so many hip hop quotables on this record
6545630 we arrived three minutes late and they let us check in but we did not make it we ended up trying to find a new flight then we discovered the plane we would have been on had crashed
6545631 we had no idea what had happened my mouth dropped open
6545632 we have to fly to the canary islands were from there and that about sums it up
6545633 this dog which isnt chained runs after passersby to bite them and this is the reason for the conflict between rajkumari and jagdish das
6545634 my neighbours want to grab my property their every attempt was foiled by chhotu and so they want to get rid of him
6545635 had the charge that he bites passersby been true chhotu wouldve bitten people on the court premises
6545636 theres more to the case against him than meets the eye
6545637 he keeps talking about being a prisoner of war back in vietnam great the economy stinks tell me his plan
6545638 this is not an easy land for any candidate and you might say a black one has more trouble than most
6545639 somebody asked john mccain how many houses do you have
6545640 now think about that i guess if you think that being rich means you gotta make 5 million and if you dont know how many houses you have then its not surprising that you might think the economy is fundamentally strong
6545641 but if youre like me and youve got one house or you were like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so that they dont lose their home you might have a different perspective
6545642 what people are going through every single day here in america
6545643 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
6545644 does a guy who worries about the price of arugula and thinks regular people cling to guns and religion in the face of economic hardship really want to have a debate about whos in touch with regular americans
6545645 the reality is that barack obamas plans to raise taxes and opposition to producing more energy here at home as gas prices skyrocket show hes completely out of touch with the concerns of average americans
6545646 maybe youre struggling just to pay the mortgage on your home
6545647 then again that same day when asked how many houses he owns mccain lost track he couldnt remember well its seven seven houses
6545648 and heres one house america cant afford to let john mccain move into
6545649 from my perspective obama needs to introduce a game changer and fast before public opinion starts to gel around the notion that he is a phenom who deserves great respect but is not seasoned enough and would be too much of a risk in the oval office
6545650 after irans first attempt to launch a satellite on sunday fell noticeably
6545651 yes were enriching nuclear material but we promise its not to make warheads
6545652 yes were employing nuclear scientists but we promise its not to make warheads
6545653 yes were creating nuclear production facilities but we promise its not to make warheads
6545654 yes were developing a missle for our space program but we promise its not to deliver warheads
6545655 after irans first attempt to launch a satellite on sunday fell noticeably short of the earths atmosphere
6545656 our cosmonauts have reported to have seen from space that italy looks like the boot of allah striking the zionist regime soon we will harvest the moon for cheese and will no longer rely on the vile cartoon drawing danish
6545657 uh this is going to be a quagmire its going to be incredibly expensive and the justification for this war is thin to the point of not even being there
6545658 to halt international military cooperation events between russia and nato countries until further instructions
6545659 for all practical purposes military to military cooperation had really already been ended with the russians
6545660 i cant imagine a circumstance right now that we would engage in military cooperation with the russians until the situation in georgia is resolved
6545661 we still have some very important issues that we need to work with russia on
6545662 leading alliance members came to us and whispered in our ears hoping that we do not halt cooperation with nato on afghanistan
6545663 were seeing a lot more spread that is concerning to us
6545664 this year we certainly have had parents asking more questions
6545665 were trimming 22 lower branches off the redwood and two other oak trees were doing this because students begin moving into dorms this saturday and police will be needed elsewhere
6545666 police are convinced that trimming the branches will confine the four protestors to a single tree and will make it impossible for others to join the protest
6545667 oh baby baby how was i supposed to know that something wasnt ri e i ight
6545668 i want to welcome you to a world where anything can happen

6545675 this is our reply for the killing of women and children in bajaur near the afghan border by pakistan army bombs

6545677 me and v december 07 this is my favorite shot of us i was feeling terribly vulnerable at the time and needed to capture the emotion i showed the photo to a friend who said
6545678 the vets who had a look at him were really surprised at how fast hed gone downhill
6545679 hes having difficulties breathing and his flippers were at an unnatural angle
6545680 their advice to us was hes not going to last much longer hes suffering and you should take action
6545681 theyll need to locate it first and the poor little guy could have passed away in the night
6545682 once they figure out whats happened theyll take it from there
6545683 its a really tragic result from an operation that people worked really really hard for
6545684 theres no way that the logistics of feeding that animal by hand or in an aquarium is going to work
6545685 there are too many difficulties with it and the animal first of all has to be convinced to eat out of a tube its got to get to an aquarium and then youve got to find a product for it to eat which you can supply for probably a year
6545686 so i think for humans to try and keep it alive is just going to end up as a disaster
6545687 get it into the vicinity of the other cow and calf and hopefully the cow would take on two calves which would be pretty unusual
6545688 there were four cookie cutter shark bites in it and that has most likely occurred while it was out in the open water its just another thing that compounds the whole problem
6545689 even if they are able to entice the calf out into open water it would face a higher predation pressure from sharks
6545690 our hearts are breaking with whats happening with baby colin
6545691 the key here is hes weakening hes losing the strength to get him fed and to a pod that will care for him

6545710 ma am let me say that i don t disagree with anything you said
6545711 one this is the best military weve ever had and its just not big enough two there has never been a draft that i have ever heard of since world war ii that was fair what weve done is we find rich people find a way out and lower income people are the ones that serve so the thing if you could design i might consider it i dont think its necessary i might consider it if you could design a draft where everybody equally would serve
6545712 we are aware of the media reports and therefore we have to look into it
6545713 if somebody had a crime that the president had committed that would be a different story
6545714 president bush is committed to a strong pakistan that continues its efforts to strengthen democracy and fight terror president bush appreciates president musharrafs efforts in the democratic transition of pakistan as well as his commitment to fighting al qaeda and extremist groups pakistans government has started the process of choosing a new president bilawal bhutto zardari the son of assassinated former pakistani prime minister benazir bhutto said musharrafs resignation is good for the country bilawal bhutto zardari i see that the biggest hurdle in the way of democracy has been removed and i am sure we can get on with solving all the issues of our country the pakistan peoples party is wants to have an independent judiciary and is firm behind that stance and im sure well move forward with that issue as well
6545715 musharrafs quitting was in the air for a long time he has met the fate of all dictators he ruled pakistan for over eight years and i can say that he has not been particularly friendly towards india during this period many of the problems in our bilateral relationship were entirely because of him so his quitting should generally be regarded a good news for india and south asia
6545716 if anyone thinks that they can kill our citizens and escape unpunished we will never allow this if anyone tries this again we will come out with a crushing response and we have all the resources at our disposal for such a response economic political and military

6545723 there can be no business as usual with russia under present circumstances and the future of our relations will depend on the concrete actions russia will take to honor the words of president medvedev to abide by the six point peace plan which is not happening at the moment which is not happening as we speak he signed together with the president of georgia and which was brokered by the european union presidency france
6545724 it seems like nato is trying to make a victim of an aggressor and whitewash a criminal regime it is trying to save a collapsing regime and is taking a path to the rearmament of the current leaders in georgia
6545725 this is a system that is defensive and is not aimed at anyone it is nonetheless a system that establishes firmly again and reaffirms the strategic cooperation relationship and friendship between poland and the united states

6545742 this was something id been hoping to do for quite some time when i left espn i wanted to do tv with keith eventually again
6545743 bob will do fewer highlights but he is not ever opposed to having more people around if it makes the show better
6545744 costas never has counted lines in his life he was pushing for this idea more than 15 months ago
6545745 when keith left i said youll never get this again
6545746 we never tried to understand why it worked it just did he was a great team player we challenged each other
6545747 there was an intent by him to crack me up or me to crack him up as long we kept that undercurrent going we knew it would be entertaining for the audience nobody was as competitive as dan was in that area he cannot be topped when we worked together we were as good as any five people in the business
6545748 my major concern was we didnt have enough people on the show last year
6545749 highlights will be dan and keith they will do the highlights straight through from 7 15 p m until 8 with the exception of one package that bob and cris do there will be nobody going to the locker room during the show all the mikes will be left open

6545755 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
6545756 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
6545757 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
6545758 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
6545759 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
6545760 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
6545761 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6545762 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6545763 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
6545764 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
6545765 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6545766 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6545767 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6545768 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
6545769 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6545770 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
6545771 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
6545772 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
6545773 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
6545774 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
6545775 what a high school teacher might call a young woman of poise
6545776 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6545777 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
6545778 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6545779 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6545780 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6545781 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6545782 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6545783 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6545784 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6545785 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6545786 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6545787 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
6545788 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6545789 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6545790 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6545791 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6545792 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6545793 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6545794 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6545795 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6545796 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
6545797 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
6545798 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6545799 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6545800 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6545801 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
6545802 se actu seg n los procedimientos establecidos en los manuales
6545803 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6545804 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6545805 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6545806 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6545807 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6545808 associations next using open business models to create new value
6545809 we know that the reality of the 21st century is what we all refer to as the global economy
6545810 that means we must continually explore international linkages that will help prepare our students for the world that awaits them after graduation formalizing a relationship with a leading communications institute in india creates wonderful opportunities for students and faculty from both institutions to participate in this global economy
6545811 more importantly its extremely research driven which adds to creation of knowledge
6545812 there are clearly benefits that we will derive with leading educational institutes in the united states and siu is certainly one such university within the communications domain
6545813 we are very excited to be entering into this memorandum of understanding with mica
6545814 we see benefits in the future for our students and faculty as well as for students from mica we will be exploring a variety of exchange and cooperative opportunities as our relationship develops we are most grateful to professor tandan for traveling to siuc to formally inaugurate this venture and we look forward to a strong relationship with mica
6545815 for extremely educated young people who want to integrate themselves with the international community
6545816 under active discussions and we are more than certain it will occur
6545817 one of the opportunities that this collaboration advances is the opportunity for siuc advertising students to obtain an international perspective on the field
6545818 it seems to me that any students graduating now will during their working lives need to have international interaction
6545819 the opportunity to be immersed in a creative environment with the head of micas crafting creative communications program in september will strengthen their graphic approaches used in resolving advertising problems im really excited about this opportunity
6545820 just as they will be doing when they graduate into that real global community out there

6545847 graduation from college is a wonderful achievement for students and parents but these days its often a stressful experience as well todays students come face to face with the prospect of repaying their student loan debt at a time when theyre just discovering the realities of independent living on an entry level salary
6545848 when a student complicates matters by taking on more credit card debt than they can properly manage theyre also pushing back the clock on buying a home and starting a family the traditional benchmarks of the american dream

6545850 it is unfortunate that the forum is considering this decision and it goes to show how vulnerable we are in times like this
6545851 we cannot afford not to have membership with the pacific forum because we play an integral part in the pacific and them to us so its disturbing if the leaders are thinking of terminating our membership just because of some foolish decisions
6545852 they are concerned for the well being of the people of the nation and thats why they are trying to suspend fiji from the forum to remind the interim government that they are serious about this

6545857 note however that if we start with dna from a crime scene and then go search the arizona database for matches we arent doing 2 billion searches we are doing
6545858 what i find interesting about this article and these calculations is that they show how the same sets of basic statistical relationships can appear much more or less convincing depending on how they are portrayed when we hear that there are 112 matches out of 65 000 people it seems like dna fingerprinting is not nearly as good as we think but that is largely because we arent thinking about the fact that 65 000 people imply 2 billion pairs of people

6545863 thats where i get my news except of course for the mercury news
6545864 how did you know my one problem with junk food is cheez its
6545865 my mother loved them and i have to stay away from them im not tempted by chocolates or anything sweet but i have to watch out
6545866 my brother and i used to watch all the shows and we had all the action figures growing up we used to dress up like the wrestlers for halloween so its something that weve always enjoyed watching
6545867 my guilty pleasure is ebay the most comprehensive museum ever imagined
6545868 i try to find at least one item there for each show just check out the 1960s rolodex file in our production of doubt center stage on sister aloysius desk i love the idea that the perfect detail is actually available somewhere and i can search the entire country to find it
6545869 on the weekend i like to let my hair down what little i have left of it
6545870 and just be a regular guy blend in with the crowd im a relaxed rider where you put your leather jacket on and sit back its definitely freedom you feel like its just you and the elements its refreshing
6545871 thats a secret pleasure for me i dont even know exactly why i like it so much except that is has dench and she could gargle and id love it
6545872 my foodie friends would not be pleased but whenever i need a little lift maybe every three months or so i eat an entire tub of frozen cool whip its soothing its cold and i love it
6545873 if i can hit the gym between 12 and 1 my guilty pleasure is to reward myself for sweating by watching the e news and then the daily ten on the e channel at least i can honestly say ive never watched it just sitting down
6545874 ill eat anything kraft macaroni amp cheese im old school i like the kind with the powder i also like liverwurst or fried bologna sandwiches because my dad used to make them hes german but honestly i am surrounded by the other stuff at work so when i get home i like to keep it simple
6545875 no not the unwanted messages you get in your e mail the spam luncheon meat that comes in the rectangular blue can i grew up eating it spam and eggs spam and rice spam musubi with sushi rice wrapped in seaweed i prefer not to create anything too complicated like the spam sandwiches suggested on its container id rather have pure unadulterated spam next time youre feeling a bit under the weather try this spam with macaroni peas and chicken broth yum
6545876 i love horror films not just because i crave the goose bump factor of a good evisceration but also because horror is one of the most metaphorically rich genres of the postmodern age
6545877 horror is an allegory for existence teeth takes a bite out of sexism in society the last winter fast forwards to the rising tide of global warming even the granddaddy of modern monster movies jaws indicts the pettiness of business interests determined to keep the beaches open no matter whats in the water horror intimately reflects who we are what we want and what scares the capri pants off us from hamlet to hostel horror is as fundamental to human existence as comedy and tragedy its like beckett only with disemboweling whats not to love
6545878 this is a serious subject and its a roomful of serious people who have taken it in that manner certainly there are additional discussions that we will have tomorrow
6545879 but for our part we continue to believe that this is a very important initiative and we remain committed to achieving an outcome that is both a net benefit for the non proliferation regime and that meets indias energy needs

6545887 i want to be just like my mom and dad
6545888 coming back to cousins was like putting on an old sweater even though you havent worn it in a while you still remember exactly how it feels and smells
6545889 its what my family talked about around the dinner table my entire life its part of who i am and to reintroduce something of that magnitude back into my life was a great feeling
6545890 this was not a plan laid out upon my arrival by any means but so many things that happened over the past year specifically jims death brought these concerns to the surface
6545891 it was a very serendipitous occurrence yet i am confident that ill do right by my family and make the next 30 years just as if not more exciting for cousins than the previous 30
6545892 we arent just expanding for the sake of expansion we want to make sure we have the right people in place
6545893 in many systems if you can breathe and write a check you can own a franchise cousins has always had an excellent screening process but now were being even more judicious about everything from cultural and social compatibility to real estate we could have 350 locations right now but we have 150 because we have been so selective it may create more challenges and take us a little longer to reach our goals but this strategy will make our system stronger overall thats whats most important to me
6545894 instead of just having our potential franchisees sit through presentation after presentation we want them to get in there and get their hands dirty
6545895 we want them to know what a lunch rush is like and how it feels to start work at 6 a m and close at 10 p m we want to know right away if this relationship is going to benefit all involved a one sided commitment just wont cut it
6545896 there are high expectations for the closing ceremony after the amazing spectacle we saw at the opening ceremony

6545925 our findings may someday allow doctors to screen for and diagnose skin cancers at very early stages
6545926 chemical biomarkers may eventually serve as objective clinical markers of disease if effective sensor technology can be developed
6545927 our findings suggest that msc therapy could become a useful treatment for inflammatory bowel disease
6545928 several previous studies have observed these cells ability to inhibit specific subsets of t cells and relieve symptoms in particular autoimmune disorders but this is the first demonstration of their ability to suppress a broad based autoimmune reaction and protect gastrointestinal tissue
6545929 i think we now have very convincing evidence that prdm16 can turn cells into brown fat cells with the possibility of combating obesity
6545930 take us a step closer to the ultimate goal of promoting the brown fat lineage as a potential way of counteracting obesity
6545931 our methods have the potential of providing early warning signs for cartilage disorders like osteoarthritis thus potentially avoiding surgery and physical therapy later on
6545932 also the effectiveness of early preventative drug therapies can be better assessed with these methods

6546041 this isnt about what evangelicals think its about what theyll be told to do if they thought for themselves they wouldnt be evangelicals
6546042 evangelicals who are politically or socially active especially conservatives seem to be increasingly upwardly mobile suburban highly educated and with above average incomes contrary to many popular stereotypes
6546043 many in the christian right tend to get their information
6546044 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
6546045 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
6546046 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
6546047 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous

6546056 chucks argument was that some like murray who attempted to develop a

6546059 the cold war by other means and sometimes by the same means
6546060 i looked the man in the eye i was able to get a sense of his soul
6546061 i think it is obvious that nato expansion does not have any relation with the modernization of the alliance itself or with ensuring security in europe
6546062 on the contrary it represents a serious provocation against whom is this expansion intended
6546063 obama is doing very well with women voters but there is the other side
6546064 someone else more than half of clintons supporters are still not on board with obama the holdouts tend to like mccain more than obama and have more confidence in mccains ability to be commander in chief
6546065 i know john mccain i know his love of country he will choose the best person and if that person happens to be among other things pro choice the party will support that
6546066 we suffer from a fiscal cancer it is growing inside us
6546067 our country would need 53 trillion invested today which is about 175 000 per person to deliver on the governments obligations and promises how much of this 53 trillion do we have zip
6546068 stupak identified goldman sachs and morgan stanley as firms whose oil trading activities warranted closer review
6546069 were not investigating goldman sachs or anybody were looking at the macro picture not the micro
6546070 all those speculators getting the blame for driving up the price these days just who are they
6546071 your pension fund manager may be using your retirement money to drive up the price of oil
6546072 what would happen if pension fund managers decided to increase their commodity investment by another 20 fold
6546073 clear similarity between the speculators and arbitragers of today and smiths corn merchants
6546074 hedged its oil bets locking in 70 percent of its fuel at 51 a barrel today the airline pays about 2 a gallon for jet fuel
6546075 right now wall street traders are raising gas prices with nothing more than the click of a mouse
6546076 their trading is speculative and not for the legitimate business needs of a user or producer

6546078 hardly anybody had heard of him prior to his appearance before congress beginning may 20 to sing songs democrats wanted to hear
6546079 there are so many holes in this argument i scarcely know where to start
6546080 when the futures contracts for june near maturity the investment bank will sell them to a commercial user and use the money to buy july contacts
6546081 by making consumers feel the inconveniences of a dearth somewhat earlier than they might otherwise do he prevents their feeling them afterwards so severely as they certainly would do if the cheapness of price encouraged them to consume faster than suited the real scarcity of the season
6546082 michigan is for the most part a red state and its up to detroit and the
6546083 and unless we have someone out front whos able to speak and carry obamas message well its critical
6546084 we have a number of people who can stand with sen obama as a surrogate
6546085 shortly after the convention were going to have a come to jesus meeting to decide who are going to be the individuals to carry that message and carry obama around the state and around detroit
6546086 right now i think thats going to be a big challenge to make sure detroiters turn out
6546087 if we use their tactics well lose the moral high ground
6546088 a general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor
6546089 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
6546090 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
6546091 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
6546092 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
6546093 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
6546094 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
6546095 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
6546096 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
6546097 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
6546098 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
6546099 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
6546100 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
6546101 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
6546102 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
6546103 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
6546104 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
6546105 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
6546106 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
6546107 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
6546108 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
6546109 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
6546110 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
6546111 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
6546112 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
6546113 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
6546114 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
6546115 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
6546116 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
6546117 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
6546118 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
6546119 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
6546120 i guess if you think being rich means youve got to make 5 million and if you dont know how many houses you have its not surprising you might think the economy is fundamentally strong
6546121 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses does a guy who worries about the price of arugula and thinks regular people cling to guns and religion in the face of economic hardship really want to have a debate about whos in touch with regular americans
6546122 i think if you are just talking about income how about 5 million
6546123 but seriously i dont think you can i dont think seriously that the point is that im trying to make here seriously and im sure that comment will be distorted but the point is that we want to keep peoples taxes low and increase revenues
6546124 healthcorps educates american youth about the workings and wonders of their bodies through in school seminars on diet nutrition and exercise healthcorps empowers children to become educated consumers and to make shifts in behavior that can be measured by changes in rates of obesity and physical fitness as well as mental resilience and self esteem
6546125 i never wanted to be a front man like harding or nixon taking the rap shaking hands and making speeches all day family reunions once a year who in his right mind would want a job like that as commissioner of sewers i would not be called upon to pet babies make speeches shake hands have lunch with the queen in fact the fewer voters who knew of my existence the better let kings and presidents keep the limelight
6546126 saddam hussein must not be allowed to threaten his neighbors or the world with nuclear arms poison gas or biological weapons other countries possess weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles with saddam there is one big difference he has used them not once but repeatedly i have no doubt today that left unchecked saddam hussein will use these terrible weapons again
6546127 you allow someone like saddam hussein to get nuclear weapons ballistic missiles chemical weapons biological weapons how many people is he going to kill with such weapons we are not going to allow him to succeed
6546128 threat posed by iraqs refusal to end its wmd programs
6546129 every nation has to be either for us or against us those who harbor terrorists or who finance them are going to pay a price
6546130 iraq continues to be a safe haven transit point or operational node for groups and individuals who direct violence against the united states saddams intelligence service supported financially ansar al islam whose members were being trained in al qaeda camps in afghanistan
6546131 husseins vigorous pursuit of biological chemical and nuclear weapons and his present and potential future support for terrorist acts and organizations make him a terrible danger to the people of the united states
6546132 my position is very clear the time has come for decisive action to eliminate the threat posed by saddam husseins wmds
6546133 every day saddam gets closer to his long term goal of nuclear capability
6546134 theres no question that saddam hussein is a threat to the u s and our allies
6546135 to defend the national security of the united states against the continuing threat posed by iraq
6546136 saddam is in material breach the legitimacy of the security council is at stake and if the security council does not call for the use of force i think we have little option but to act with a larger group of willing nations if possible and alone if we must
6546137 yes saddam has chemical weapons he has biological weapons he is trying to get nuclear weapons
6546138 the world is far safer with the removal of saddam
6546139 i really didnt want to be one of those guys
6546140 i think when dana was working on his special he kind of fell in love with stand up again
6546141 before he was kind of walking through it and now hes really passionate about it and it shows hes just on his game and thats how he was before he got saturday night live
6546142 i saw a movie and i had him for a day and i lost him it just hits you or it doesnt
6546143 o amor sonha com a pureza 04 de agosto de 2008
6546144 the second way to control growth is by surrounding the plant or grove with a physical barrier this method is very detrimental to ornamental bamboo as the bamboo within quickly becomes rootbound showing all the signs of any unhappy containerized plant symptoms include rhizomes escaping over the top down underneath and bursting the barrier the bamboo within generally deteriorates in quality as fewer and fewer culms grow each year culms live shorter periods new culm diameter decreases fewer leaves grow on the culms and leaves turn yellow as the unnaturally contained rootmass quickly depletes the soil of nutrients and curling leaves as the condensed roots cannot collect the water they need to sustain the foliage
6546145 eu sei que n o sou uma boa pessoa quando o assunto uso dessas subst ncias
6546146 barr conceivably could be to john mccain what ralph nader was to al gore in 2000 ruinous
6546147 you have in ralph naders candidacy a genuine arab american who has a lot of notoriety and publicity it would be detrimental to obamas candidacy
6546148 obama cannot take the peace vote for granted there are peace candidates running from across the political spectrum
6546149 on the right are bob barr and chuck baldwin on the left are cynthia mckinney and ralph nader he needs to earn the vote of americans opposed to further war
6546150 the purpose of study 2 was to replicate and expand upon study 1 by examining whether we find the same results with a larger sample we were particularly interested in examining whether neuroticism would significantly predict blogging if the sample size were increased
6546151 data for some of our bloggers were lost so the percentages reported here represent the data for 24 of the 44 bloggers despite the loss in data the results generally replicate our findings from study 1
6546152 the results of study 2 replicated the results of study 1 and demonstrated that as expected in a larger sample neuroticism does predict blogging

6546155 an alternately amusing and alarming primer on americas off the charts fiscal irresponsibility
6546156 if the democrats truly wish to distinguish themselves from the republicans and offer a new direction for america as representative ackerman claims on his web site they must draft a new resolution one that demands not threats of violence but diplomacy not blockade but face to face negotiations with no preconditions not sanctions but the exchange of ambassadors not embargo but the opening of embassies not covert operations intended at inciting unrest ethnic conflict and regime change but a nonaggression pact all with the condition of course that both nations abide by the terms of the nuclear nonproliferation treaty npt that is in return for an iranian guarantee that its nuclear program is intended only for peaceful purposes and its cooperation in ensuring scrupulous inspections the united states must end its bellicose posturing sanctions and embargo and abide by articles i ii and vi of the npt and reduce its nuclear arsenal cease its development of a new generation of tactical nuclear weapons and end its deployment of nuclear weapons around the world this is the change we hope for this is the new direction for america we must demand
6546157 my electrical meter should be standing still or going backwards
6546158 the system will offset their electrical bill by about 80 percent
6546159 it will stabilize their bill and shield them from the unknown of future edison rate increases
6546160 it will offset 537 000 miles driven by the average car
6546161 thats about eliminating 21 500 miles driven per year its like taking 1 7 cars off the road for 25 years and planting 2 8 acres of trees
6546162 stole the marginal votes gore may have needed to clearly carry florida and the election
6546163 they dont want to look themselves in the mirror for betraying their finest progressive traditions and so they have to lash out at someone
6546164 theyre not going to blame themselves for selling out again and again and again
6546165 they make mistake after mistake after mistake because theyve lost their self respect they dont know who they are anymore theyve lost their identity
6546166 theyre basically appealing to the public by saying do you know how bad the republicans are people say they dont think that much of the democratic party but do you know how bad the republicans are if you define yourself by the worst instead of the best you can be theres something wrong with your psychological makeup as a party
6546167 gore is to the right of bradley on almost every important issue
6546168 he had at various times in his political career been a neoliberal tough on crime and communism a new agey environmentalist and techno futurist and an old fashioned bible thumping populist gores response to problems said a long time aide was to consult five pollsters
6546169 thats basically trying to be like the republicans but not quite like the republicans and still have a democratic image
6546170 gore advisers say naders appeal will dim as the election draws closer
6546171 theyre also counting on reform party candidate pat buchanan to nab would be bush votes
6546172 yeah what they should have said is hey the green party is for this this and this
6546173 its not my job to elect al gore or george bush
6546174 i think its an ego trip and people have lost sight of what the goals are
6546175 why didnt the democrats stop bush on iraq why did they surrender their declaration of war powers authority under the constitution and send it up pennsylvania avenue to the white house
6546176 it got so bad that everything bush did i was blamed for until i ended up saying gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
6546177 they created him why dont you go back to the origins
6546178 he had called me and i think reached out to my campaign my sense is that mr nader is somebody who if youre dont listen and adopt all of his policies thinks youre not substantive he seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work
6546179 ralph nader is trying to get attention he has become the perennial political candidate
6546180 i think its a shame because if you look at his legacy in terms of consumer protections its an extraordinary one but at this point hes somebody whos trying to get attention and his campaign hasnt gotten any traction
6546181 when i saw him at a book signing last year in a downtown bookstore i stood in line with 300 people
6546182 in new york we dont think of alternative power as something that we just import from other parts of the nation
6546183 self how long am i going to keep doing this
6546184 zomg this is my life and i failed therefore i must quit everything and try harder

6546192 because of this new government the economy is out of control everything has become so expensive
6546193 when suddenly not only are you feeling more insecure with your job you cant get rising wages or rising incomes and the cost of everything from gas to food to healthcare to trying to send your children to college keeps on skyrocketing
6546194 when you find out that you lost your healthcare your pension or you never had it it turns out youre not the only one
6546195 millions of americans have been going through that same loss of security
6546196 these tend to be folks that relocate here they tend to be younger voters also folks who obviously based on their lifestyle would be open to the prescription for change sen obama is offering
6546197 barack obama can spend all the money in the world in some of these republican leaning states but he will still be the most inexperienced presidential candidate in the modern era and he will still have the most liberal record in the united states senate
6546198 he is more liberal than a lot of the state
6546199 its going to be a very difficult race for him in north carolina
6546200 he cant make any promises that are going to help us tomorrow
6546201 its going to be a long time coming out of this
6546202 americans across our country are hurting because of the cost of energy
6546203 its time for america to get serious about energy independence and that means we need to start drilling offshore at advanced oil rigs like this
6546204 everyone says america is the land of opportunity for renewables
6546205 why in the world couldnt we have landslided this bumbling governor from texas with the terrible record
6546206 hey the green party is for this this and this did you know that the democratic party is also for this this and this why should you vote for the green party vote for us
6546207 oh now were going to have a lean and mean military budget
6546208 how do you think they are on the redirections of the country that people care about
6546209 you know they have half the market wed better look like them
6546210 what are you doing competing dont you know its a two party game a two major party game what are you doing competing
6546211 now you only have two on the ballot to choose from
6546212 gee you know what was kerrys excuse why didnt he win
6546213 gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
6546214 barbara and george bush they created him why dont you go back to the origins why dont you go back to ann richards who could have easily defeated him when he ran
6546215 oh i see so hes doing all this to win the election and then hell be different
6546216 well lets start with my disagreeing with barack obama disagreeing with himself
6546217 if i had my way and if i could single payer but i cant unilaterally so ill do this
6546218 oh well you know the republicans are filibustering or something
6546219 oh weve got more important things we have to do
6546220 i have always believed that the second amendment protects the right of individuals to bear arms
6546221 but i also identify with the need for crime ravaged communities to save their children from the violence that plagues our streets through common sense effective safety measures
6546222 a career legacy politician who fell hook line and sinker for the administrations case for a disastrous war and dragged much of our party with him
6546223 the most inexperienced ticket in the history of the world
6546224 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
6546225 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
6546226 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
6546227 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
6546228 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
6546229 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
6546230 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
6546231 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
6546232 the times are too serious for this kind of politics
6546233 behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president
6546234 cannot quite bring himself to admit his own failure in judgment
6546235 senator mccain now argues that despite these costly strategic errors his judgment has been vindicated due to the results of the surge
6546236 in iraq gains have been made in lowering the level of violence thanks to the outstanding efforts of our military the increasing capability of iraqs security forces the cease fire of shiite militias and the decision taken by sunni tribes to take the fight to al qaeda
6546237 understand what the essential argument was about before the surge i argued that the long term solution in iraq is political the iraqi government must reconcile its differences and take responsibility for its future that holds true today
6546238 he is a man who has served this nation honorably and he correctly stated that one of the chief criteria for the american people in this election is going to be who can exercise the best judgment as commander in chief
6546239 but instead of just offering policy answers he turned to a typical laundry list of political attacks he said that i have changed my position on iraq when i have not he said that i am for a path of retreat and failure and he declared that behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president suggesting as he has many times before that i put personal ambition before my country
6546240 if we think that we can use the same partisan playbook where we just challenge our opponents patriotism to win an election then the american people will lose
6546241 the times are too serious for this kind of politics the calamity left behind by the last eight years is too great
6546242 for all of his talk about following osama bin laden to the gates of hell senator mccain refused to join my call to take out bin laden across the afghan border
6546243 instead he spent years backing a dictator in pakistan who failed to serve the interests of his own people
6546244 if you are making more than 250 000 then you are in the top 3 4 percent of this country you are doing well
6546245 i think if youre just talking about income how about 5 million
6546246 a week in john mccains shoes his 520 ferragamo loafers that is
6546247 lots of reasons it would be a bit pointless to explain
6546248 unfortunately not all of us will be doing musical things
6546249 ill be lending guitar skills to my good friends 28 costumes www myspace com 28costumes for basically as long as theyll have me or until musically im no longer an eligible bachelor there are already some exciting wheels in motion on that front ill be sure to keep anyone interested well informed also for the fucking hell of it i thought might do a where are they now type of article in the future just for the nostalgic amongst you who come back to our myspace page every now and again as always ill do my very best to keep up to date with any messages you might send us all of us are eternally grateful for your support over the last year it feels like years
6546250 despite all the hype over obamas religious outreach a new pew survey indicates obama actually has slightly less support from evangelicals than john kerry had at this point four years ago
6546251 it is hopeless this one is like the other one they are all the same nothing will change dont expect change
6546252 hell have to be good to israel if not he wont be re elected to a second term
6546253 will remain the capital of israel and it must remain undivided
6546254 the arabs need america to be straight and unbiased but anyway we feel that american policy will not be changed too much
6546255 one day he is with the palestinian cause one day hes with israel we have a saying here whats better a black dog or a white dog its all the same for us nothing will change
6546256 we rooted for this and that and nothing happened its deja vu
6546257 unless the americans realize that they really have to change and become more evenhanded and apply justice in the region things will be the same
6546258 obama is excellent he is direct he is like the successor to jfk
6546259 yes they are all bad but still obama might be a little less bad
6546260 for me it doesnt matter that hes black or his name is hussein
6546261 hes an american and so i disagree with most of what he says about the arab world i mean condoleezza rice was black and poor and she still invaded iraq
6546262 i think its very impressive that someone can start very poor and reach the top like this
6546263 for a lot of people who have health insurance they are paying more for health care but it may not show up as concretely as paying 70 to fill their gas tank
6546264 college costs health care costs and energy costs are up and income is down
6546265 any one of those subjects touches a raw nerve for the middle class in this country im seeing it in race after race
6546266 the issue of health care may be getting less attention than it deserves from the media but its still a top concern for voters and among the top issues that sen obama talks about on the campaign trail
6546267 there is a stark contrast in the way both candidates would address the issue because the views on providing affordability accessibility and portability of health care are so divergent it could hardly escape the conversation each candidate will have with voters
6546268 if people had to pass that many signs that announced how much health care costs you can bet it would be at the top of the agenda
6546269 it is strikingly different from 2000 when gore spent 60 percent of the time at most events talking about health care
6546270 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
6546271 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
6546272 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
6546273 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
6546274 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
6546275 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
6546276 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
6546277 were doing jokes about people in his orbit not really about him
6546278 people have a tendency to react as far as their ideology allows them
6546279 i think some of us were maybe too quick to caricature al gore and john kerry and theres maybe some reluctance to do the same thing to him
6546280 anything that has even a whiff of being racist no one is going to laugh
6546281 the audience is not going to allow anyone to do that
6546282 most readers will see it as tasteless and offensive and we agree
6546283 totally inappropriate and frankly i understand if sen obama and his supporters would find it offensive
6546284 we put people in a crazy box they might be truly offended by it but the reaction is part of the standard digestive process bill maher who is host of a politically oriented late night show on hbo said if you cant do irony on the cover of the new yorker where can you do it one issue that clearly has some impact on writing jokes about obama is a consistency among the big late night shows not only are all the hosts white the vast majority of their audiences are white i think white audiences get a little self conscious if race comes up sweeney of obriens show said things might be somewhat different if even one late night host was black black comics are not having any trouble joking about obama said david alan grier a comedian who starting in october will have a satirical news magazine show on comedy central chocolate news i tell jokes on stage about him grier said reciting a few that would not ever get onto a network late night show nor into the new york times but he said of the late night hosts those guys really cant go there its just like the gay comic can do gay material it comes with the territory
6546285 no way theyve had 200 years of presidential jokes its our time jimmy kimmel the host of the abc late night talk show jimmy kimmel live
6546286 theres a weird reverse racism going on you cant joke about him because hes half white its silly i think its more a problem because hes so polished he doesnt seem to have any flaws maher said that being sensitive to obama was in no way interfering with his commentary though on hbo he has more freedom about content than other comedians theres been this question about whether hes black enough
6546287 i have this joke what does he have to do dunk he bowled a 37 to me thats black enough kimmel said i think his ears should be the focus of the jokes mostly the late night shows seem to be in a similar position were just waiting
6546288 there hasnt been a lot of frame of reference about obama yet not like hillary or mccain but there will be
6546289 the movie revolves around a singular day when jimmy page the edge and jack white first met and sat down together to share their stories teach and play
6546290 captures the guitarists as each explains and demonstrates how he changed the sound of the electric guitar to suit his own distinctive musical style
6546291 george smith made it very tough for us in perth but weve been working very hard at getting numbers to the breakdown you cant just arrive in ones or twos like we did last week
6546292 we went through our game plan and specified exactly who is going to be cleaning out all our guys know the game plan and exactly where we want to play from so i cant say this was the problem last week but we have placed more emphasis on the specific roles of each player
6546293 plumtrees had a massive impact since joining the sharks and you can see that by how well the sharks loose forwards have played this season theyve been especially good on the cleanout so weve gained a lot of positive input from plum
6546294 ive come a long way 50 hours until the navy seal fitness challenge
6546295 when suddenly not only are you feeling more insecure with your job you cant get rising wages or rising incomes and the cost of everything from gas to food to healthcare to trying to send your children to college keeps on skyrocketing
6546296 when you find out that you lost your healthcare your pension or you never had it it turns out youre not the only one
6546297 millions of americans have been going through that same loss of security
6546298 these tend to be folks that relocate here they tend to be younger voters also folks who obviously based on their lifestyle would be open to the prescription for change sen obama is offering
6546299 barack obama can spend all the money in the world in some of these republican leaning states but he will still be the most inexperienced presidential candidate in the modern era and he will still have the most liberal record in the united states senate
6546300 he is more liberal than a lot of the state
6546301 its going to be a very difficult race for him in north carolina
6546302 he cant make any promises that are going to help us tomorrow
6546303 its going to be a long time coming out of this
6546304 we will further strive to become the worlds most advanced it power to realize this goal we will push ahead with our e government initiative develop the software and content industries and educate the public to make them the most computer literate citizens in the world
6546305 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
6546306 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
6546307 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
6546308 para ter sua foto ao lado de seu coment rio preciso ter cadastro no site
6546309 trying so hard to be perfect that it is stultifying
6546310 if obama gets elected and there is nothing funny about him it wont be the economy thats depressed it will be the rest of us
6546311 trying to make excuses or to yell about my articles
6546312 americans end up getting bad information and supporting bad decisions and strategies
6546313 i think when you get so distant from the facts as as guys like limbaugh and sean hannity do yeah i think that tends to corrupt the dialogue
6546314 defend and explain one example where i said something that was so false
6546315 youre not listening susan youve got to learn something he saddam had weapons of mass destruction he promised to disclose them and he didnt do it you would have let him go free we decided to hold him accountable
6546316 and kay had also not discovered any chemical or biological weapons
6546317 colin powell just had a great piece that he had in the paper today he was there in iraq he said things couldnt have been better
6546318 iraq has come very far but serious problems remain starting with security american commanders and troops told me of the many threats they face from leftover loyalists who want to return iraq to the dark days of saddam from criminals who were set loose on iraqi society when saddam emptied the jails and increasingly from outside terrorists who have come to iraq to open a new front in their campaign against the civilized world
6546319 and in northern iraq today this very day al qaeda is operating camps there and they are attacking the kurds in the north and this has been well documented and well chronicled now if youre going to go after al qaeda in every aspect and obviously they have the support of saddam or were not
6546320 kay also called a speech where cheney made the claim there was a link to al qaeda
6546321 after 9 11 liberal democrats at first showed little interest in the investigation of the roots of this massive intelligence failure bush and his team made it clear that determining the causes of americas security failures and finding and remedying its weak points would be central to their mission
6546322 president bush took a few minutes during his trip to europe thursday to voice his opposition to establishing a special commission to probe how the government dealt with terror warnings before sept 11
6546323 first of all this president you know and i know and everybody knows inherited a recession it was by every definition a recession
6546324 the recession officially began in 2001 months after bush was sworn in according to the universally acknowledged arbiter of such things the national bureau of economic research and president bush at other times has also said so himself
6546325 the hispanic community got to know him bush in texas they went almost overwhelming for him he more than quadrupled the hispanic vote that he got in that state
6546326 look weve had these reports very disturbing reports and i have actually spoken to people that have confirmed a lot of the reports about the trashing of the white house when the clintons left the white house pornographic materials left in the printers they cut the phone lines lewd and crude messages on phone machines stripping of anything that was not bolted down on air force one 200 000 in furniture taken out
6546327 is it you hate this president or that you hate america
6546328 governor why wouldnt anyone want to say the pledge of allegiance unless they detested their own country or were ignorant of its greatness
6546329 you could explain something about your magazine the nation lisa featherstone writing about the hate america march the anti war march that took place over the weekend
6546330 i hate america this is the extreme left there is a portion of the left not everybody whos left that does hate this country and blame this country for the ills of the world
6546331 you dont like this country do you you think this is an evil country by your description of it right here you think its a bad country
6546332 it doesnt say anywhere in the constitution this idea of the separation of church and state
6546333 congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof
6546334 the senators and representatives before mentioned and the members of the several state legislatures and all executive and judicial officers both of the united states and of the several states shall be bound by oath or affirmation to support this constitution but no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the united states
6546335 you want to refer to some liberal activist judge thats fine but im going to go directly to the source the author of the bill of rights james madison hired the first chaplain in 1789 and i gotta tell ya somethin i think the author of the bill of rights knows more about the original intent no offense to you and your liberal atheist activism knows more about it than you do
6546336 is the appointment of chaplains to the two houses of congress consistent with the constitution and with the pure principle of religious freedom in strictness the answer on both points must be in the negative
6546337 but the alabama constitution which chief justice roy moore is sworn to uphold clearly it says as a matter of fact that the recognition of god is the foundation of that states constitution
6546338 that no religion shall be established by law that no preference shall be given by law to any religious sect society denomination or mode of worship that no one shall be compelled by law to attend any place of worship nor to pay any tithes taxes or other rate for building or repairing any place of worship or for maintaining any minister or ministry that no religious test shall be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under this state and that the civil rights privileges and capacities of any citizen shall not be in any manner affected by his religious principles
6546339 betsy theyre not going to lose it public housing because if you work less than 30 hours a week if you work more than 30 hours a week you dont have to do it if youre between the ages of 18 and 62 and youre not legally disabled and you have free housing in other words
6546340 no wait a second sean let me correct you most people in public housing are not receiving free housing many of them are paying almost market rates
6546341 betsy that is so ridiculous and so false its hardly even worth spending the time
6546342 but he senator kerry wanted to cancel every major weapons system specific votes that he would have canceled the weapons systems we now use
6546343 in 1991 kerry opposed an amendment to impose an arbitrary 2 percent cut in the military budget in 1992 he opposed an amendment to cut pentagon intelligence programs by 1 billion in 1994 he voted against a motion to cut 30 5 billion from the defense budget over the next five years and to redistribute the money to programs for education and the disabled that same year he opposed an amendment to postpone construction of a new aircraft carrier in 1996 he opposed a motion to cut six f 18 jet fighters from the budget in 1999 he voted against a motion to terminate the trident ii missile
6546344 if he kerry had his way and the cia would almost be nonexistent
6546345 half of dems nationwide agree that hillarys act of putting her name in nomination you know that heinous scheming act at the heart of hillarys plot to steal the convention for herself think it will help unify the party only 28 disagree
6546346 i believe her testimony could have changed the course of history now others believed that she would hurt anita hill

6546354 to serve as a bar to a petition a contract must contain substantial terms and conditions of employment deemed sufficient to stabilize the bargaining relationship and must be signed by the parties
6546355 an agreement of more than 3 years duration is treated for contract bar purposes as expiring on its third anniversary date
6546356 1 a new agreement which embodies new terms and conditions or incorporates by reference the terms and conditions of the long term contract or 2 a written amendment which expressly reaffirms the long term agreement and indicates a clear intent on the part of the contracting parties to be bound for a specific period
6546357 clear that the parties did not intend for the mou to be a new agreement embodying new terms and conditions
6546358 does not have a readily discernible effective date or expiration date
6546359 third parties would be unable to determine the appropriate time for filing a petition
6546360 are limited to certain supplemental payments for drivers training for drivers and warehousemen and the reclassification of drivers and affect only a minority 30 of unit employees
6546361 does not incorporate the terms and conditions of employment of that contract
6546362 indicates that it was written for the narrow purpose of addressing the employers proposed implementation of the new distribution method which primarily affects drivers only
6546363 all this has done has put the tigers in a better position to contend with us
6546364 but it appears that the democratic party at the top is hopelessly in the grip of corporate interests that favor war free market nostrums and corporate welfare

6546371 festivalul peninsula a avut succes iar feedback ul pe care l am primit de la participanti a fost ca evenimentul este foarte bine organizat si serviciile sunt de asemenea mai bune
6546372 avem speranta ca vor veni oameni si in ultima zi ca sa depasim cifra de 40 000 de persoane in plus avem promisiuni de sponsorizari din ungaria iar daca acestea se valorifica vom finaliza partea financiara pe zero
6546373 cu cat un festival este mai puternic cu atat isi doresc artistii mai mult sa poata participa eu cred ca pe partea aceasta trebuie sa insistam
6546374 dar sper ca nu va luati dupa politica antiromaneasca nu
6546375 es ist unzumutbar dass eine organisation die als verfassungsfeindlich eingestuft wird an der gesetzgebung im hessischen parlament beteiligt ist
6546376 wir halten die reaktionen der cdu f r berzogen und hysterisch

6546378 its a massive club i went to bournemouth on loan in 2007 and i know quite a few of the lads here already i know they have the potential to succeed i want to basically play as many games as i can and want to help saints do well chelsea sent me on loan because its a fantastic learning opportunity and i just hope i can play a role as soon as possible i spoke to frank arnesen chelseas director of youth development and he told me that southampton would be the best place for me to come hopefully i can fit in well at southampton
6546379 because ive got championship experience scunthorpe were a little unlucky to go down and i thought we could have got some results against a few more teams this is a massive club and its got a great set up now i just cant wait to get started
6546380 jetzt werden die innenminister sich untereinander nicht mehr trauen k nnen
6546381 w hrend der vergangenen herbstkonferenz der innenminister wurde zwischen senator ehrhart k rting und dem damaligen hamburger amtskollegen nagel die absprache getroffen kollegen nach berlin zur ckholen zu wollen
6546382 man darf bei der diskussion nicht au er acht lassen dass die vom land berlin ausgebildeten 502 beamten von hamburg als vollwertige vollzugsbeamte bernommen wurden ohne dass die hansestadt sich wenigstens anteilig an den kosten f r diese ausbildung beteiligt h tte dass herr glietsch sich jetzt auch vielleicht gegen die meinung einzelner mitarbeiter f r das anschreiben entschlossen hat ist aufgrund dieser grundlage durchaus nachvollziehbar
6546383 es gibt bereits ger chte wonach ein bestimmtes bundesland einer vielzahl von bewerbern f r den gehobenen dienst empfohlen hat sich mangels eigener ausbildungsm glichkeiten in berlin zum polizisten schulen zu lassen um nach erfolgreichem durchlauf der ausbildung in das eigene land zur ckzukehren
6546384 somit w rde das finanzielle ruinierte berlin die polizeiausbildung anderer bundesl nder finanzieren ohne selbst davon profitieren zu k nnen
6546385 polizeipr sident glietsch kann auch nur die stellen besetzen und die geh lter zahlen die ihm von der politik bewilligt werden das land hamburg hat davon profitiert dass wir keine freien stellen hatten die hansestadt hat 500 gute beamte quasi auf dem silbertablett serviert bekommen
6546386 wenn hamburg uns nun davon nur sieben zur ckgeben will ist es nur clever vom pr sidenten weitere zu k dern zumal es sich bei den 21 betroffenen um kollegen handelt die ernste gr nde f r eine r ckkehr haben

6546390 were delighted with the new faces weve brought in weve been working hard to significantly improve the squad
6546391 the signing of djibril shows how far this club has moved on since the end of last season
6546392 his experience will bring a lot to the squad and he will hopefully add some goals to the side he is known for scoring them as well as creating them
6546393 im really pleased to join a good club with good players sunderland is a club i think is going to achieve things they have big ambitions thats why i chose to come here i liked what the club had to say to me
6546394 the settlement will provide thousands of merrill lynch clients with access to billions of dollars in funds that have been frozen in the ars market
6546395 no doubt about it that loss was in our heads
6546396 one of the last things we said before walking onto the court as a team was we have waited for two years which we have for us the first test was russia now it continues to the gold medal game
6546397 obviously it was a very tough match we were able to hang with them a little bit through about three quarters which was an accomplishment for us
6546398 when you are playing the united states you just cant make mistakes but we made some mistakes and we missed some shots
6546399 we had a really good start and sort of cranked up the defence on them and took away want they wanted that is how it panned out tonight
6546400 i expect the game to be more physical you know it is the gold medal game we are just as phsyical as they are and we give as much as we get
6546401 you are playing for a lot you are playing for a gold medal and a lot of sacrifices you have made throughout your career
6546402 we are going to have to produce our a game of the tournament without question
6546403 it was hard and this win wasnt just down to my goal
6546404 its the greatest feeling its my first olympics and my first olympic gold medal
6546405 the more minutes together the better we played and ive been working for nine months now with this team and it was about finding the rhythm and in the way we believed in attack
6546406 it is a hard moment i dont know what to say
6546407 it was not a lack of opportunities but rather it was a lack of patience on the one shot the usa had they scored and whoever scores the goal wins we lost focus after the americans scored
6546408 if this doesnt make people forgive me and stop talking about all that i dont know what will
6546409 hotel in rome near the station and a vista of the coliseum
6546410 i want to take you to les mis at the hollywood bowl its playing this friday
6546411 i guess ill work on the assumption that the magic is dead best of luck to you
6546412 thanks for your phone call its good to hear from you
6546413 we need to come to the table in september at the senior official level to test the seriousness of going forward to bring forward new ideas to overcome some of the problems that we encountered in july that we were not able to overcome at that time and quite frankly to stop the deterioration and the erosion of what was on the table in july
6546414 clear the way conceivably for another round of ministerial engagement
6546415 i usually fare well at the us open but ill have my hands full thats for sure
6546416 i am extremely honored and humbled by this recognition from my alma mater this is a very emotional personal experience for me
6546417 we have been doing a lot of original reporting and we are going to be doing a lot more
6546418 we get these interviews because we have this global audience of 500 million viewers
6546419 our aim is to reach these bigger names and use our reporting talent to break news we are really going for the kinds of questions that will make news
6546420 we really are paying a lot of attention to what our audience wants
6546421 we see tremendous traffic on politics what is going on around the world and the names that get their interest
6546422 we like to pick people with expertise in the subject matter
6546423 aarons father fought in the korean war and he has tons of experience in reporting
6546424 we are really going for places we feel we can have an impact and cover them in ways that are slightly different
6546425 while we would hope that all ohio businesses would make paid sick days available to their employees whenever possible we believe that this initiative is unworkable unwieldy and would be detrimental to ohios economy and we will be opposing it and asking ohioans to oppose it as a result
6546426 speak more clearly and specifically about the kitchen table naugblog
6546427 stephanie tubbs jones was one of the most compassionate most dedicated and most talented the next major city we drove through on our trip was nashville tennessee i actually lived outside of nasvhille for a brief period but i was only 3
6546428 it is with deep sadness that we inform you of the passing of congresswoman stephanie tubbs jones beloved mother to mervyn jones ii sister
6546429 this election is about change changing our nation our workplace and our government so it works for working people once again
6546430 the seven unions of change to win will spend tens of millions of dollars and commit thousands of volunteer hours to contact members at their worksites and in their communities every day between now and november 4th to make sure barack obama is elected president and pro worker majorities are put in the united states congress change to win is dedicated to building a new american dream for working families and providing a better future for the next generation
6546431 really early in his presidential campaign when i got the opportunity to listen intently to his ideas and his platforms i immediately said this is beyond belief
6546432 i joined the effort and it became clear to me that i was better able to work in my community in a broad way and support this outstanding candidate as a democrat
6546433 my goal here is that african americans who have voted democratic their entire lives will begin to at least consider a republican candidate
6546434 and then ill move to the second goal of registration but it is a slow process
6546435 its a funny thing about obama but when i see him speak and see him on the stage i dont see him as a black man i just see a man he symbolizes hope and we surely need hope
6546436 if he obama stays eight years and then jeb bush says im running im with jeb
6546437 weve been trying to see how we could bridge the gap between normal star formation and star formation in this kind of environment
6546438 the mechanism we present should be able to provide a variety of possible properties which will definitely encompass the ones we observe in our galaxy
6546439 as satisfying as the new results are the case for disk fragmentation as the origin for the disk stars remains unproven
6546440 we do not know whether the initial conditions assumed by bonnell and rice are realized in the galactic center
6546441 supermassive black holes like the one in our galactic center are fairly common in galaxies
6546442 though our black hole is not as big as the black holes in other galaxies which could be thousands of times more massive
6546443 the occ is essentially saying that if banks cant trick or cheat consumers they wont be able to offer credit
6546444 it is outrageous that the federal regulator overseeing the banking industry is so out of step with the needs of millions of americans unfairly trapped in debt by abusive credit card practices
6546445 better disclosure of unfair practices is not real consumer protection
6546446 consumers should have the confidence of knowing that their interest rates wont skyrocket if the bill or payment gets lost in the mail
6546447 the occs argument that credit will dry up unless banks can engage in questionable lending practices sounds eerily similar to the arguments made by the mortgage industry right before the current foreclosure crisis
6546448 the mortgage meltdown demonstrates the importance of ending abusive lending practices when warning signs arise we urge the federal reserve board to adopt these critical protections against unfair credit card practices
6546449 this is unbelievable i simply cant believe it its a dream come true
6546450 i simply started playing flw fantasy fishing because i love fishing and because it was fun we have a lot of dreams and this will help us make many of them come true
6546451 when we launched flw outdoors i dreamed about the biggest payday in pro bass fishing when the champion of the forrest wood cup could claim the first 1 million prize in pro bass fishing
6546452 fifteen years later we achieved my personal goal of awarding 1 million to our forrest wood cup champion not once but as of last sunday two years in a row
6546453 a 1 million prize for pro fishing seemed unbelievable 15 years ago thats why todays 1 million flw fantasy fishing grand prize is so incredible imagine winning a million dollars with the click of a mouse from the comfort of your living room
6546454 with the excitement that flw fantasy fishing has created all over the world in the past year i have no doubt there will be many more like michael thompson who will become flw fantasy fishing millionaires in the years to come
6546455 flw fantasy fishing has been the single best thing that ever happened to professional and recreational bass fishing
6546456 its setting a new benchmark and attracting record numbers of new fans to our sport
6546457 this is absolutely great i love ranger bass boats and it will be great not to have a monthly boat payment anymore
6546458 playing flw fantasy fishing has been a lot of fun and i cant wait until the start of next season
6546459 our methods have the potential of providing early warning signs for cartilage disorders like osteoarthritis thus potentially avoiding surgery and physical therapy later on
6546460 also the effectiveness of early preventative drug therapies can be better assessed with these methods
6546461 it has all these painful consequences and makes it difficult to move it results in a severe loss of quality of life for those who are affected by it
6546462 never vote for a junior senator running for president regardless of who he she might be
6546463 start of a new day in america under obama start to loose freedom start to loose liberty keep growing government bigger and bigger start of socialism in the american government
6546464 as a lifelong democrat who will be voting for mccain this fall
6546465 they were a combat engineer reconnaissance team and they were at that point in time conducting a routine reconnaissance
6546466 they were on their way to the site where they were going to do the reconnaissance of a route thats going to be used for a future operation
6546467 what the fuck man i see this kinda shit everyday
6546468 after a few months patients that had to be shackled were being allowed to walk freely
6546469 others who had to be heavily medicated were getting off their medications and those who had no chance of ever being released were being freed
6546470 but the staff began to enjoy coming to work absenteeism and turnover disappeared we ended up with more staff than we needed because patients were being released and all the staff was showing up to work today that ward is closed
6546471 what were you doing within yourself that caused those people to change
6546472 i was simply healing the part of me that created them
6546473 i just kept saying im sorry and i love you over and over again
6546474 what about the books that are already sold and out there
6546475 i hope people wake up and emotionally engage in issues
6546476 its about the issues that everyones talking about but theres a lot of hope
6546477 at this moment in my life writing about anything else would be uninteresting and impossible because i feel such urgency
6546478 ive always thought it seemed a bit unlikely but im not going to tell you it hadnt been fun
6546479 im going to let the campaign take from here theyre going to reveal what they want to reveal when they want to reveal it
6546480 its been nice to be mentioned but im going to let them do the heavy lifting at this point
6546481 we are proud to continue the support we have provided to the armys acquisition executive for the past 15 years
6546482 our institutional knowledge combined with our unique acquisition and logistics capabilities will help us assist the army in getting warfighters what they need when they need it
6546483 we understand that people are keen to quantify the support the shareholders will offer on top of the equity they already have in the company
6546484 however it would be inappropriate to pre empt this while the company follows through due process with the trustees and their advisers
6546485 will have tens of millions of dollars more from them supporting the business as we go through the recovery plan
6546486 meaning that debenture investors get paid out before any of this money is accessible to shareholders
6546487 we can confirm he has left bangkok for the uk
6546488 god am i happy to be leaving vietnam and that jail i should never have been in there
6546489 yeah well ok we want to like create a greener mode of transport right so i know yeah why dont we like take one of the most carbon friendly modes of transport yeah and like make it electric cuz thatll be like waaaay less polluting than petrol oh and lets lob an x in there somewhere
6546490 its been hard to wait for almost two years for these kids to get on campus classes started wednesday and fall practice will be here before we know it
6546491 our findings may someday allow doctors to screen for and diagnose skin cancers at very early stages
6546492 chemical biomarkers may eventually serve as objective clinical markers of disease if effective sensor technology can be developed
6546493 sponges have one of the most ancient lineages and dont have nerve cells
6546494 so we are pretty confident it was after the sponges split from trunk of the tree of life and sponges went one way and animals developed from the other that nerves started to form
6546495 what we found in sponges though were the building blocks for nerves something we never expected to find
6546496 what we have done is try to find the molecular building blocks of nerves or what may be called the nerves ancestor the proto neuron
6546497 we found sets of these genes in sponges when we really didnt expect it
6546498 with nearly half of all infants in north america being delivered by caesarean section or after episiotomy there is clearly a requirement for pain relief for mothers
6546499 however our study confirms that codeine as a treatment for pain may be unsuitable and cannot be considered safe for all breastfed infants
6546500 the good news is that those breastfeeding children who were exposed to these high levels of morphine showed dramatic improvement once they were taken off the morphine tainted breast milk
6546501 by removing the exposure most children will demonstrate a complete reversal of symptoms and show no long term adverse effects
6546502 the significance of our study is that it identifies smurf1 as the signaling partner through which tnf does damage in ra related bone loss
6546503 that has enabled researchers to begin designing small molecule drugs to shut down the action of smurf 1 and its relatives furthermore since mice engineered to have less smurf1 expression develop thicker bones future drugs that shut down smurf1 may be also useful against more common forms of osteoporosis simply by changing the dose of course this is early stage work with many obstacles ahead but it is exciting nonetheless
6546504 republic of ireland assistant team manager liam brady remains in a stable and comfortable condition in the coronary care unit of beaumont hospital
6546505 he was admitted there following an episode of back and chest pain this morning
6546506 his condition is stable and his medical investigations are ongoing
6546507 liam will remain under observation overnight in beaumont hospital we all wish liam a full and speedy recovery
6546508 youve got to get on craigslist man you dont have time for all that myspace shit
6546509 oh youre leaving because some man told you to go home is that it
6546510 our findings provide a basis for opening up new therapeutic approaches to protect neurons from inflammation and toxicity induced neurodegeneration
6546511 selective cox 2 inhibitors were thought to be a promising medicine in treating neurodegenerative diseases stroke cancers and inflammation related diseases like arthritis however the occurrence of a series of cardiovascular complications in patients receiving cox 2 inhibitors has led to their recent withdrawal from the market and limits on their usages our research has shown that the use of endogenous cannabinoid 2 ag may avoid such side effects therefore elevation of endogenous 2 ag levels by facilitating its production inhibiting its decomposition or directly supplying 2 ag may result in treatment advances to prevent the devastation of disorders like stroke alzheimers and traumatic brain injury
6546512 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
6546513 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
6546514 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
6546515 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
6546516 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
6546517 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
6546518 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
6546519 let me be clear there is no question that obamas energy plan is better than mccains and a very big improvement over bush but i am convinced by my close reading of his energy plan that it is essential that efforts like the 1sky campaign need to keep ramping up the pressure for a truly science based program to deal with the climate crisis we have an extremely short time frame in which to do so obama and mccain needs to be pushed now and pushed if he is elected to revise a number of elements of his program
6546520 we need to look at completely changing how we live how we generate revenue how we provide food and clothing for ourselves etc etc etc
6546521 while hboc 201 may not replace allogenic blood transfusions it may serve to allow critically ill patients to be resuscitated in the field or hospital setting until either regeneration of red cell occurs or a transfusion is available
6546522 television viewing is related to consumption of fast food and foods and beverages that are advertised on television
6546523 viewing cartoons with embedded food commercials can increase choice of the advertised item in preschoolers and researchers installed monitoring devices in the tvs of 70 overweight children between the ages of four and seven
6546524 our findings suggest that msc therapy could become a useful treatment for inflammatory bowel disease
6546525 several previous studies have observed these cells ability to inhibit specific subsets of t cells and relieve symptoms in particular autoimmune disorders but this is the first demonstration of their ability to suppress a broad based autoimmune reaction and protect gastrointestinal tissue
6546526 the great deluge hurricane katrina new orleans and the mississippi gulf coast
6546527 we believe this is a clear case of infringement designed to take advantage of the herbal essences business and its consumer loyalty
6546528 this is a serious case of intellectual property infringement and we are asking the court to stop the distribution of these products to protect the equity of herbal essences
6546529 the potentially favorable profile of these compounds was achieved through the use of our trap r computational drug discovery technology
6546530 we are currently conducting activities necessary to select a potential development candidate
6546531 it was always going to be an optimistic programme but we were confident we could achieve it this in no way reflects on the work undertaken by the technical team and our partners as it was due to circumstances beyond their control i also want to thank all our technical partners for their support during our intensive testing programme and especially ferrari for the supply of engines
6546532 we now have to concentrate on what we have ahead of us rather than behind we still have some great announcements to make in the near future we shall be able to announce our full race calendar as well as some deals that will enhance the overall package we are presenting to our fans for season four
6546533 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
6546534 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
6546535 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
6546536 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
6546537 thanks for the necklace if you want we can go to penneys and get you some shoes for v day
6546538 history is proud to recognize the outstanding work of all of our grant recipients these save our history projects exemplify the dedication and creativity needed to preserve our communities pasts these students teachers and organizations are saving history not just for today but for the future as well involving new generations in the importance of history and preservation is the key
6546539 well theyre going to do it anyway may as well make sure theyre doing it safely where i can watch them
6546540 i can do this because im the parent and you cant because youre the kid
6546541 at what age would you let your kids drink illegally as long as you were watching
6546542 how many more times am i going to keep saying i or me its not about me theres bigger things out there and yet it comes down to her
6546543 i think we now have very convincing evidence that prdm16 can turn cells into brown fat cells with the possibility of combating obesity
6546544 take us a step closer to the ultimate goal of promoting the brown fat lineage as a potential way of counteracting obesity
6546545 we are pleased to have delivered solid fiscal year growth of 32 percent over last year and to have ended our fiscal year with record fourth quarter revenue that grew by 10 percent sequentially
6546546 we enter fiscal 2009 with a very strong foundation for growth our unified communications platform is acknowledged as the best in the industry and we have strengthened our distribution channel significantly during the year particularly with the addition of two key national partners
6546547 scarred on mtv a few years ago i fell while rollerblading and my arm looked like something off that show its still kinda crooked to this day
6546548 ah the pigeons figures always suspected they were smarter than they let on john
6546549 i feel compelled to point out that there was a controversial finding a few years ago that pigeons
6546550 http tineye com login redire ct faq if this is as good as it looks its a great advance in image
6546551 when youre talking about a professional network quality is so important
6546552 delay doesnt work as a tactic i want them to come in quickly and resolve this expeditiously
6546553 the main point is the timing of how quickly they offer the buy backs to the investors
6546554 we want that done quickly and they had a voluntary time frame that was not acceptable
6546555 our computational trap r technology enabled us to combine and process information on the properties of single target molecules resulting in compounds with the desired dual target mechanism of action
6546556 the ability to inhibit two targets may reduce the ability of cancer cells to evade the inhibition of one target alone and results in a better outcome
6546557 that depends on how big fannie and freddie blow up
6546558 some hit is going to come from existing preferred shareholders
6546559 theres not protection for shareholders of common or preferred shares
6546560 while some companies will probably have some writedowns i dont think theres a widespread effect on the whole industry
6546561 we have five people in finance its been a very stable group and its been five years since our last termination heidi left why did she go did we not offer promotional opportunities
6546562 we have five people in finance we hired three people last year and two have quit why are they leaving is the leader of the group not an effective manager are we not paying enough what about work life balance issues
6546563 social media jason pontin in short is a function of my business life i know that this identity is inauthentic because there is so much about which i do not post or blog do other habitual users of social media whose social identities are as carefully constructed to attract attention but who blog and post about everything and thus feel no alienation not know that those identities are inauthentic bemused by the difference between themselves and their social media selves are they mere copies cast from a few popular molds endlessly reproduced among false friends
6546564 im sorry sir we closed at 8 00pm and its already 8 30

6546566 losing ground how the loss of adequate health insurance is burdening working families
6546567 it was an individual directing his aggression toward another individual not the school or the students inside the school
6546568 he got shot and started walking and he was holding his chest there was blood everywhere and then he fell and his arm hit me
6546569 i took off running and ran outside and called my mom
6546570 everybody started running out real fast saying he got shot
6546571 gene upshaw was a friend and someone i will miss dearly
6546572 few men have made more contributions to the national football league
6546573 i dont know if i want to send flowers they didnt do that for me when i was sick
6546574 americas oil crisis banner like we werent in a crisis yesterday but we are again today
6546575 he shot and killed and he had his subordinate marines shoot and kill
6546576 the defense is here to tell you the acts that the government described did not occur as described here
6546577 what the government is asking you to do is to dictate to every young man
6546578 youd better be right youd better be absolutely certain or we are going to second guess you
6546579 we had no idea that once you get married you have to eat off of one plate it also cuts the doing dishes time in half being married is great
6546580 we posed for this picture before dinner and then we got stuck like that for half an hour im never wearing that much hairspray again
6546581 we go back and forth i dont know if its our immediate future its something we talk about every few months
6546582 its something we would never take lightly and just say that would be fun its a lot of work and we recognize that in a way we want to be selfish because we love our life but we know how much that adds to it
6546583 i like the way he leans forward in his chair until his nose almost touches the screen
6546584 the cancellation of the memorandum of agreement is a painful step in our collective effort to come to an agreement with the milf
6546585 will seek a new agreement within the boundaries of law set within the constitution
6546586 furthermore the president will not allow adventurism by milf forces to pressure the government to sign any agreement even if it is for peace
6546587 we have already initialed the memorandum of agreement on the ancestral domain we will not revisit or renegotiate the agreement
6546588 they surrendered because they could no longer take the inhuman instructions and atrocities committed by commander bravo
6546589 special fireworks my favorite rides hanging out with friends and ill even get to sing a couple songs
6546590 he failed to do what he was educated to do
6546591 i am going to ask you to have honor courage and commitment by convicting nazario
6546592 the high moral ground that distinguishes the marines from the insurgents
6546593 there really is only one rule in combat we keep each other alive
6546594 theyre not going to be able to prove anybody was killed in the house

6546597 freedom of conscience is not to be surrendered upon issuance of a medical degree
6546598 this nation was built on a foundation of free speech the first principle of free speech is protected conscience
6546599 womens ability to manage their own health care is at risk of being compromised by politics and ideology
6546600 planned parenthood continues to be concerned that the bush administrations proposed regulation poses a serious threat to womens health care by limiting the rights of patients to receive complete and accurate health information and services
6546601 nothing in the new regulation in any way changes a patients right to any legal procedure
6546602 its about abortion and conscience it is very closely focused on abortion and physicians conscience
6546603 this regulation does not limit patient access to health care but rather protects any individual health care provider or institution from being compelled to participate in or from being punished for refusal to participate in a service that for example violates their conscience

6546605 arrest in taped mugging of 85 year old nyc woman
6546606 in joy we live celebrating swami kriyanandas 60 years of discipleship and anandas 40th anniversary
6546607 we see that even the olympic games happening right now we see many many of our advertisers are not spending money during the olympics because for those non olympic sponsors they are waiting for doing that to catch up with their advertising budget so we see some big strong demand for those advertising doing advertising business with us after olympics thats why we feel that we have received some answers from our sales team so we do believe that well have a strong growth in the post olympics for our business
6546608 most of the advertisers now during the olympic games is the sponsors of the olympic but just this these advertisers are a small percentage among all the advertisers so weve got the information that those unsponsored advertisers wanting to not want to spend money now just not noisy enough among this lot of the sponsors so after olympics those non sponsors will spend money after that so we see that will be the growth for the next the second half of the year
6546609 the earthquake is in effect overall noted by region only small we have a couple of cities affected but in terms of revenue its small its effect overall because some of as we said before some advertisers are spending money on donations instead of the marketing budget so that will affect the overall whole city the whole country in terms of the overall effect for that i dont think we had such experiences where each certain region we did not get affected most only maybe chengdu but thats a small portion in terms of our overall revenue for countrywide we did close down shut down of some of our advertising because of the government requirement during that week so we do not have any specific region that was affected most from this
6546610 the cities affected are very limited its just sichuan chengdu and chongqing so they do have a few days the network got very affected by the earthquake very significantly so the third quarter we do expect as we said in the second quarter we had national mourning day and during three day period the commercial location network was shut down nationwide so we do expect that well have a few days extra in q3 as you pointed out
6546611 we gave the reason that during the national mourning period our commercial location network was closed for three days so those are impacts so i really we also experienced a significant impact in may in our revenue but june the business has rebound very quickly so it moved back relatively speaking to normal levels so i think i would encourage you to look at the guidance we have provided rather than go back to look at what if theres no earthquake what are you going to do nobody can predict that
6546612 overall the whole market in china is i think its about a 200 billion rmb market in advertising market in china next year if in the situation if this market i say if really the economy is slowing down those people will concern on the effectiveness for overall market of china focus media only spend a small percentage on the overall budget advertising budget so our effectiveness will show signs show some strong demand for those advertisers i do believe when the market has a good time they will spend on advertising everywhere when the market and economy is not good they have to be cautious they have to find the right way to spend their money and we are the best effective way for them to advertising that is why weve received some comments from the advertising side that if one example is that lately on the automobile industry they when their competition getting heat up when the pricing is a issue then they were looking for us because we are helping them to save money to do business thats one thing i see and that is one comment that we received from our sales force
6546613 for the outdoor led business its a new business right now its still not a material factor in our commercial location business and given the beijing network is just being initiated we dont have a particular number for you for this for the potential outlook of this market but we do believe well focus on continued expanding our led network in the key cities were not looking at less important cities were only looking at the key tier i cities to expand this business once it becomes a relatively meaningful number then we will provide you a better outlook
6546614 again the led business is relatively small where it is a small portion a small number insignificant to the overall numbers thats one second is that we are still in the process of evaluating whether this business will be a long term business for us therefore we cannot give the details for this we have some test spots we have in beijing and in shanghai but they are just really too small to talk about
6546615 i think we in china there are regulations which restrict outdoor billboard business so as you are aware during the last few years there were a large amount of inventory in the outdoor billboard business those are really more traditional billboard business i think jason has said before on the calls that even of course the restriction of the billboard business makes sense it happens in every single country even in the u s but digital billboard does actually add to the landscape actually if they are non intrusive and they are effective it actually we do believe the government will support it if you look at during the last 12 months in shanghai there are actually many more digital billboards get set up in shanghai and those basically indicate really is for the digital side theres not necessarily basically a reduction of inventory effort by the government
6546616 based on sec regulations the company cannot buyback shares after quarter end before earnings announcement due to inside information and also we cannot file our 10b 5 during that particular period so the company has announced a few weeks ago we will start a buyback program up to 100 million we have already appointed a dealer to help us to set up this particular program were starting this program right after the earnings announcement when the window opens so thats where we are
6546617 commencement notices are down and planning applications are down and the credit crunch is affecting everyone the banks could be leaning on some developers to go through the planning process so they can realise the market value of land theyve acquired it some cases it could be purely a financial exercise

6546626 aunque pachuca pasa por un mal momento en el torneo este fin de semana ser complicado sin embargo nosotros que estaremos de locales debemos aprovechar el paso que lleva en el torneo para mantener los resultados de local como hasta ahora
6546627 lo veo bastante bien a pesar de que no ha podido anotar en estas cuatro fechas disputadas del torneo l est tranquilo y con la confianza de que en cualquier momento lo podr hacer esperemos que se le d la oportunidad contra pachuca y de nuestra parte lo apoyaremos durante todo el partido

6546629 businesses want the control and savings that windows mobile affords in an innovative and elegant package that keeps their users happy thats where palm comes in
6546630 everything about treo pro from the hardware design to the packaging and accessories embodies the elegant and simplified end to end experience that our customers expect from palm
6546631 this is a serious subject and its a roomful of serious people who have taken it in that manner certainly there are additional discussions that we will have tomorrow
6546632 but for our part we continue to believe that this is a very important initiative and we remain committed to achieving an outcome that is both a net benefit for the non proliferation regime and that meets indias energy needs
6546633 i think there is a lot of support for this internationally and so i remain optimistic that were going to be able to be successful in this process
6546634 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
6546635 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
6546636 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
6546637 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
6546638 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
6546639 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
6546640 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
6546641 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
6546642 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best

6546650 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
6546651 with the passing of congresswoman stephanie tubbs jones we have lost a fierce champion and a dear friend her opposition to dont ask dont tell was just one example of her strong commitment to building a more just america and insisting upon equality for all
6546652 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
6546653 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
6546654 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community

6546659 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
6546660 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
6546661 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them

6546669 this meme originated over an idea that was prompted by the book written by larry smith amp rachel fershleiser
6546670 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
6546671 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
6546672 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
6546673 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
6546674 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
6546675 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
6546676 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
6546677 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
6546678 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
6546679 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
6546680 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
6546681 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
6546682 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
6546683 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
6546684 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
6546685 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
6546686 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
6546687 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
6546688 this is a planning took where all things are going
6546689 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
6546690 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
6546691 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
6546692 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
6546693 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
6546694 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
6546695 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
6546696 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
6546697 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
6546698 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
6546699 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
6546700 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
6546701 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
6546702 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
6546703 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
6546704 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
6546705 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
6546706 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
6546707 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
6546708 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
6546709 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
6546710 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
6546711 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
6546712 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
6546713 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
6546714 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
6546715 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
6546716 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
6546717 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
6546718 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
6546719 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
6546720 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
6546721 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
6546722 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
6546723 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
6546724 i work out in the gym everyday to look at my muscles
6546725 when we think they might be dying out or merely surviving they are actually thriving
6546726 they are moving into new states and settling or establishing new settlements in communities where local officials arent acquainted with them that creates some misunderstanding on zoning issues or other unique factors in amish practice
6546727 as they live their lives they really do not become very involved with government
6546728 one family doesnt go there is a group of them that goes like two or three or four
6546729 they can continue to let people know were here come visit us how the land is the orchards do great or whatever
6546730 an amish woman said we joke among ourselves if we keep growing at this rate soon half the world will be amish and the other half will be taxi drivers
6546731 the strength of the constitution lies entirely in the determination of each citizen to defend it only if every single citizen feels duty bound to do his share in this defense are the constitutional rights secure
6546732 todays supreme court decision is yet another stinging rebuke of the bush administrations extreme views on executive power time after time the supreme court has rebuffed the administrations attempts to undermine the constitution from its rasul and hamdi decisions in 2004 to its hamdan decision in 2006 it is a testament to our system of government that the court has rejected the habeas stripping provisions of the military commissions act and reaffirmed that the government does not have the power to detain people indefinitely and arbitrarily without judicial review the writ of habeas corpus provides one of the most significant protections of human freedom against arbitrary government action ever created we can and must fight terrorists without abandoning the principles on which our country was founded
6546733 the constitution only gives people the right to pursue happiness you have to catch it yourself
6546734 the constitution is not an instrument for the government to restrain the people it is an instrument for the people to restrain the government lest it come to dominate our lives and interests
6546735 no provision in our constitution ought to be dearer to man than that which protects the rights of conscience against the enterprises of the civil authority
6546736 we the people are the rightful masters of both congress and the courts not to overthrow the constitution but to overthrow the men who pervert the constitution
6546737 dont interfere with anything in the constitution that must be maintained for it is the only safeguard of our liberties
6546738 i prefer a man who will burn the flag and then wrap himself in the constitution to a man who will burn the constitution and then wrap himself in the flag
6546739 the nurses primary commitment is to the patient whether an individual family group or community
6546740 we treat each and every detainee in our custody with the same high level of quality professional care possible

6546744 hemos mantenido conversaciones para clarear el mal ambiente ha sido una charla positiva y ahora avanzaremos juntos hacia adelante
6546745 los legisladores dijeron que no la ve an como una figura econ mico financiera sustentable una vez que sea superado el ejercicio en curso
6546746 los fondos y los ingresos provinciales se van a resentir
6546747 para el a o que viene no hay dado ning n aumento
6546748 se sigue tirando de una manta corta tratando de ir resolviendo las situaciones salariales con la incidencia de la inflaci n pero los incrementos de la masa salarial que se fueron otorgando este a o tiene que ver con acuerdo homologados en el ministerio de trabajo en noviembre y diciembre del a o pasado por lo que no fueron aumentos generados en sta gesti n
6546749 pero muchos de esos aumentos estaban homologado en el ejercicio anterior
6546750 esto merece an lisis y cr ticas diversas porque no creo que haya muchos lugares en el mundo que se administran recursos que tengan comprometido el 90 del presupuesto en la masa salarial
6546751 con la idea de achicar las brechas posturales que tanto el legislativo como el ejecutivo toman y esto tiene que ver con lo que se habl en su momento de la no aprobaci n del proyecto 2008 sobre lo cual hab amos propuesta trabajar y avanzar para que el d a que tomamos las decisiones o elevamos el presupuesto a la legislatura no tengamos la distancia que nos encontramos sistem ticamente a trav s de los sucesivos ejercicios

6546770 they are not exactly the most high class group of women
6546771 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
6546772 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
6546773 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
6546774 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
6546775 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
6546776 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
6546777 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
6546778 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
6546779 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
6546780 youre lucky its us guarding you a few more hours and this big guy will take over
6546781 it was an individual directing his aggression toward another individual not the school or the students inside the school
6546782 he got shot and started walking and he was holding his chest there was blood everywhere and then he fell and his arm hit me

6546803 the traditional artificial hip is based on a mans anatomy women are built differently than men
6546804 women tend to be shorter than men more petite and have smaller bones and shorter hips
6546805 knee implants have been functioning very well for men and women but we wanted to meet womens unique needs by making knee replacements that feel fit and function even better
6546806 the implant is the best of both worlds its based on the current implant we use a highly successful implant with great mechanics and 10 years of clinical success only the shape of this new implant is different to make it feel more natural
6546807 the availability of implants in a wide variety of shapes and sizes will help us provide a more patient specific approach for all patients
6546808 its my first music video shoot for my very own song its really exciting
6546809 i wanted to let you know ive been doing well
6546810 i love to write songs because its a way to express yourself its cool
6546811 but i dont know if any of my songs will be on the album that would be cool if any of them did make it but its a matter of finding the best songs i definitely want to just write more and see if there are any songs that are suitable for it
6546812 im just going to go the pop route and find a nice balance between young stuff and those songs i can be expressive with and connect with well
6546813 the shoots been going great and its been a lot of fun as well
6546814 i cant wait for you guys to see it too

6546816 certainly weve done it with lord of the rings weve extended beyond the movies there we did it with james bond for a while i dont know what well do with harry potter itd be fun to i think theres more stories that we can tell
6546817 theres an opportunity to go back to the original movie
6546818 the technology has moved on so much when we were first making those games we were making it for playstation 1 and now weve got you know the wii i think theres opportunities to revisit stories
6546819 we have to figure out whether anyone wants to buy those or not
6546820 the reality is that were focused on the movie games
6546821 we havent really thought about what were going to do yet but its going to be really exciting
6546822 obviously its a great opportunity to make two games but i want to make sure we make two great games we dont know how close those movies are going to be how far apart theyre going to be and where theyre going to cut them in half
6546823 they will require around 10 days to leave their current positions

6546837 i opened up my pack and i couldnt believe it
6546838 were committed to downtown and were trying to be a partner we want those businesses to stay open
6546839 i was just hanging in and just covering the bills not making any profit
6546840 in most cases market rate is 14 to 17 per square foot in downtown
6546841 i was going to have at least double if not triple the rents
6546842 the economy is so bad and people are getting hit from the left and right so badly i dont want to have to go up in prices on anybody
6546843 we wanted to keep it as low as we could if we stay wed have to go way up and would lose half our customers probably if we went up
6546844 it would have been nice if wed had notice or at least a graduated increase
6546845 we expect those first floor storefronts to be retail thats very important to downtown if something cant be worked out with this property owner maybe something could be worked out with another property owner so they could stay
6546846 herring said explaining that at say 15 a square foot on a 1 000 square foot space the annual rent would be 15 000 divided by the 12 months the monthly rent would be 1 500
6546847 the new rent rates stem from an ownership change on the building that houses the four businesses
6546848 what she is dreading doing is possibly raising prices to pay for the increased rent a haircut at clippership costs 13 00
6546849 at the moment i am speaking to you i have never been so aware of what the solitude of a head of state could be in the face of the decisions he has to take
6546850 i want to ensure your colleagues are never in such a situation i want all the lessons to be drawn from what happened
6546851 drawing the consequences in terms of equipment on the military escorting of our operations and of the missions that are conducted in
6546852 we do not have the right to lose over there we do not have the right to give up on defending our values we do not have the right to let the barbarians triumph because defeat at the other end of the world will come at the cost of a defeat on the territory of the french republic
6546853 the economys not that bad were not in a recession

6547116 wish he hadnt taken up with hailey shes one of my best waitresses but she has brothers who want to back trevor when he sings
6547117 we just want something to be done to prevent this from happening again
6547118 ive been dreaming about it since i was a kid
6547119 6 billion of us come together to stand and cheer and celebrate as one
6547120 nobody should avoid taking a statin because of concerns about cancer
6547121 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
6547122 we are looking at something verging on the incredibly bizarre
6547123 as she gets bigger she is reduced to little more than a giant gelatinous blob
6547124 i cant imagine an animal like this jetting itself around the water at any great speed
6547125 its not sitting down there sipping on cups of tea or anything like that
6547126 its got this arsenal of beaks and hooks which at some stage in its life cycle it would have used
6547127 i still dont want to be in the water with it

6547135 evidentemente el gran riesgo el eterno riesgo es el cambio sexenal que ha sido la peste de la historia mexicana yo creo que los medios tienen una responsabilidad hay que ser hipercr ticos con todos pero cr ticos en el sentido m s inteligente de la palabra es decir argumentar en favor o en contra por lo que los proyectos que tienen profundidad y solidez social de base hay que apoyarlos estimularlos
6547136 francamente liberador responsable no invita al sexo como parranda sino como una relaci n profunda

6547143 just a month ago i was interviewed by chicago magazine where the reporter asked me what blogs i read i gave her mudville mike yon acute politics and his blog post that he had a friend post after his death is wonderful alex tabarrok

6547146 major andrew olmsted died doing a job that he loved leading his soldiers
6547147 i n keeping with his final requests i have posted some videos wilco sir
6547148 above everything he was an american and he served this nation to his end
6547149 because we read olmsted we knew him if ever so slightly he was unique as all of us are unique there will never in the wide spaces of time ever be another andrew olmsted
6547150 he was as expert an observer as there is concerning the war on terror we mourn his loss
6547151 i didnt know andrew personally but i was familiar with his writing and i feel like a hole has been punched into the world
6547152 if i would ask you in response to the same question how fast the american forces can leave iraq for example the answer would be as soon as we have august 19 2008
6547153 i do find a substantial probability in the evidence that the defendant committed the murder
6547154 this is a case of manual strangulation of a child a particularly violent act
6547155 whats the big deal about linux isnt it at heart just a pc based version of unix the 70s hit operating system which has outlived the predictions of its demise throughout the 90s

6547162 costs related to the massachusetts commonwealths 2007 health care reforms are increasing far more rapidly than initially projected
6547163 while this represents success in terms of increased enrollment of previously uninsured residents in health care plans the costs are rising at an unsustainable pace
6547164 the audience has to be motivated to get out and vote
6547165 nominations are now open for the antonio pizzigati prize for software in the public interest the winner could be someone you know or microsoft is profiting from linux
6547166 as microsoft is set to pump up to 100 million more in novell for linux its important to note that microsoft is not paying off linux amd overdrive on linux
6547167 when it comes to ati hardware one of the features we have been after for the longest time on linux has been any overclocking find the dvd containing those files with vvv

6547171 robert wiseman sabres chief technology officer said the southlake texas based company began using red hat and other open source software about 2004
6547172 one of the great things about the double barrel open source software and fee based subscription support strategy that commercial specsavers sees clear benefits in open source
6547173 mike banahan chief technology officer of openforum europe once described the uk as a third world country compared with the rest of mozilla may hold the clues to the future of commercial open sour

6547185 there are no secret piles of money that the companys somehow magically making
6547186 i havent been paid in almost two months and ive been putting money out to try and get people taken care of thats the flip side
6547187 it probably goes against popular belief but just because we all used to work at blizzard doesnt mean that were all millionaires although that sure would have been great
6547188 hellgate came out and it wasnt as good as it should have been theres a myriad of reasons for that some of them were just bad timing in the pc market the pc market was lousy last year
6547189 some of it was the fact that we were an independent studio we didnt have unlimited money and we had to ship when we had to ship part of it was because we overreached and that was a design problem that was totally our fault we tried to do too much
6547190 we tried to be a standalone game and a free play game and an mmo and an rpg and a shooter we were trying to be something for everybody and ended up really not pleasing many people at all i think we should have picked one or the other

6547192 our income this quarter was approximately as expected while our expenses were higher compared to the same period in 2007 mainly due to the continued devaluation of the u
6547193 based on our current backlog and pipeline and as indicated in our first quarter release we expect higher revenues during the second half of 2008 resulting in an increase in 2008 revenues in comparison to 2007

6547201 initially scanning electron microscopy sem conducted at another laboratory showed high silicon and oxygen signals that led them to conclude that the spores were a weaponized form says kotula
6547202 the possible misinterpretation of the sem results arose because microanalysis in the sem is not a surface sensitive tool
6547203 because a spore body can be 1 5 to 2 microns wide by 1 micron long a sem cannot localize the elemental signal from whole spore bodies
6547204 lacked that fuzzy outer coating that would indicate that theyd been weaponized
6547205 and the first change we are going to make is to open up the process so that every voter can compare and contrast the candidates who purport to represent them for 16 years john doolittle denied voters that opportunity
6547206 this race is shaping up to be among the most closely watched in america this year
6547207 we are committed to partnering with community organizations and media outlets across the sacramento chico and reno markets to ensure every voter is able to access every debate
6547208 too often candidates skirt complex policy questions with empty partisan sound bytes
6547209 thats why so many of the problems we are facing in this election year arent new and its also why so many have gotten worse
6547210 the stakes are too high in this election for more politics as usual
6547211 thats why we want to give ample time to each policy area and why our first debate must cover the highest priority of the federal government our nations security
6547212 we realize that ca 04 is a much smaller pond than mcclintocks prior campaigns in los angeles and across the state of california
6547213 on behalf of charlie brown and everyone who is proud to call this region their home we hope mcclintock will accept our offer
6547214 radioactive waste is a big problem facing the united states and the entire world
6547215 we need new innovative technology and i think supercritical fluid is one such technology that will play an important role in the very near future
6547216 there is no solvent used and so no solvent left behind
6547217 this agreement and technology is something idaho should be very proud of
6547218 we have developed something special and to me that something is important to idaho and to the u s particularly as we look for alternate energy sources in the future
6547219 this process has been extremely one of those that you just love
6547220 its going to be a great deal that will benefit the university of idaho areva and the entire world
6547221 to me accomplishing that is important to idaho and to the united states particularly as we look for alternate energy sources in the future
6547222 i believe nuclear energy will play a very large role and that it can be done in a very environmentally safe and sustainable way

6547232 we are pleased to have delivered solid fiscal year growth of 32 percent over last year and to have ended our fiscal year with record fourth quarter revenue that grew by 10 percent sequentially
6547233 we enter fiscal 2009 with a very strong foundation for growth our unified communications platform is acknowledged as the best in the industry and we have strengthened our distribution channel significantly during the year particularly with the addition of two key national partners
6547234 one is obviously the origins stories the other is the return to biowares roots and the other one is the origins of the franchise of the series
6547235 from the ground up to be something we can base a lot of entertainment product in and dragon age origins is really just the beginning
6547236 well you know the response we got from that accidental announcement was very interesting ill have to leave it at that for now
6547237 exciting when youve been inside a publisher for six years
6547238 shopping for projects or investigating our network to see whats out there
6547239 if things work out this could well be a really really interesting and positive move for massive

6547244 the rewards are in your head the reward is invisible its what you like to do
6547245 we had dreams that computers would improve education and improve communication and help us achieve a lot of tasks a lot of us in our group understood it
6547246 what we were doing was not figuring out how build a computer it was how you get a computer that fits into the home price looks a lot of that stuff it gave us more passion we used the word revolution all over the place
6547247 i was doing really advanced computer designs when i was 10
6547248 i just loved computers and what they were and ones and zeros and the logic and how they added
6547249 sometimes when youre short of resources it forces you to do better work
6547250 i couldnt afford an online timeshare computer system i had to write down ones and zeros and simulate the computers operations it was all done by hand never once on a computer
6547251 some of the tricks were so weird i knew youd never find them in a book
6547252 i got a job a hewlett packard designing handheld calculators i was very lucky because i could design they interviewed and hired me but i didnt have a degree
6547253 i did go back to college i got my degree under a fake name rocky raccoon clark
6547254 i wanted my kids to see they had a dad who had a college degree i went back 10 years after i finished my third year
6547255 i would not sell something for money without my employer getting a cut of it
6547256 i was never going to leave hp for life thats where i wanted to be forever
6547257 steve jobs got all my friends and relatives to call me
6547258 steve wants to be this guy who wants to change the world every time wed create something great hed have the idea to sell it
6547259 the speed of the computer isnt enough you need a good approach and good thinking
6547260 sometimes i go into an apple store and say im an employee i get a discount
6547261 these press guys who write stuff like that they get seated first in the prime seats
6547262 now were in the age of blogs opinions get replicated facts dont come into play much
6547263 i dont like any articles that put people down like steve jobs because it sells everybody likes to see heroes beat up
6547264 chris carney obviously thinks hes a washington big shot now first he abandoned his promise to represent pennsylvania values by voting with nancy pelosi and the liberals 90 percent of the time now he refuses to even show enough respect for voters to defend his record in open and honest debates carney is a sorry excuse for a congressman trying to win an election behind negative attacks instead of debates
6547265 he really thinks he has a chance at the short straw
6547266 lost in this analysis though is a crucial fact many of clintons primary season supporters are not necessarily loyal democratic presidential election voters

6547271 i think ill have my staff get to you its condominiums where ill have them get to you
6547272 given that sen mccain doesnt know how many homes he owns its no surprise that he also doesnt have a plan to provide relief to the millions of american families struggling to afford the homes they have
6547273 i really think its funny that senator obama wants to get into a debate on housing he is not exactly poor either
6547274 senator mccain is working hard and has put forward bold proposals to help people get out of the mortgage crisis including a plan to keep between 200 000 and 400 000 families from losing their home
6547275 senator mccain is also against raising taxes so people can keep their home while obama wants to increase the corporate tax which is the second highest in the world and reverse the bush tax cuts so that someone who makes 32 000 a year will have to pay more
6547276 my speculation is sen mccain will choose mitt romney based on romneys broad appeal to a broad conservative base romney is who he will choose
6547277 the pullback of russian forces is taking place at such a tempo that by the end of aug 22 they will be in the zones of responsibility of russian peacekeepers

6547279 as far as percentage of issuance ginnie mae has been on decline for over a decade so this really has been a turn of events
6547280 but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship with one another and the blood of jesus his son
6547281 therefore jesus also that he might sanctify the people through his own blood suffered outside the gate
6547282 since we have now been justified by his blood how much more shall we be saved from gods wrath through him
6547283 it is simply wrong to exploit a publicly owned service like the fire department to solicit money
6547284 first the department i am assured has a strict policy against using fire rigs on non essential business using the rigs as a transport vehicle clearly violates department policy secondly taking twelve fire personnel away from much needed rest could and may endanger public safety lastly leveraging the good reputation of the department to collect charitable money while at the same time trying to enhance their own image is at best unethical
6547285 were planning to have another great fbr open again next year

6547289 ohhh hes british right is that the guy who does mr bean
6547290 i wouldnt like to launch myself as the guy who just does funny characters
6547291 i want to do funny interesting films play funny interesting roles and work with funny interesting people
6547292 i wanted to do something that was just a broadly funny movie
6547293 something that was laugh out loud funny but not brainless and those are hard to find
6547294 there is no final agreement but we are very close
6547295 everything has been addressed tomorrow is a very important day
6547296 obviously the american forces are here coalition forces are here at the invitation of the iraqi government
6547297 what were trying to do is put together an agreement that protects our people respects iraqs sovereignty
6547298 time is of the essence we are redoubling our efforts to bring this to a successful conclusion
6547299 we are continuing to work to make sure that any timelines that are in the agreement really do reflect what we believe can be done whats feasible
6547300 nobody wants to get to the withdrawal point prematurely where the iraqis cant handle it but were close on all these issues
6547301 a consideration of the applicability of the fair use doctrine simply is part of that initial review
6547302 having reviewed the video we acknowledge that its inclusion in the take down notice was an error and the error however was completely unintentional
6547303 viacom has no alternative accept to repeatedly search the entire youtube library
6547304 and send take down notices this is a massive effort we have manually reviewed over 1 7 million clips on youtube and have identified more than 187 000 pirated clips of our copyrighted content in an effort of this scale some inadvertent error is inevitable
6547305 if that doesnt prove that viacom knew my film wasnt their material i dont know what can
6547306 universal said she infringed on her copyright and sent a take down notice she then has an opportunity to appeal to youtube counter notification remedy which is what she sought and the video was restored
6547307 the dmca streamlined the process but the law also tried to balance it
6547308 i do think we are going to see attacks i think we have been seeing attacks already going on in the field
6547309 were doing everything we can to mitigate and reduce its incidence
6547310 there are other scenarios that i cant unfortunately get into
6547311 indicating that the online underworld is poised to launch targeted attacks in coming weeks
6547312 the most important thing for people to patch are the name servers that back up their mail servers
6547313 the good news is that there are hundreds of millions of users protected against these attacks the bad news is its not everybody
6547314 he has been approached by panathinaikos and most recently by english clubs
6547315 he has been allowed to move clubs and discussions are in progress
6547316 im hopeful his situation will be sorted by the end of the week or maybe at the start of next week
6547317 the plane was rocking back and forth until i suspected it was going to fall
6547318 i saw people smoke explosions i think that is what woke me up because i had lost consciousness
6547319 i thought that if help did not arrive soon i would die
6547320 the plane would not fail to the point of causing a tragedy
6547321 most likely whatever the malfunction of the probe was it is probably not related to what happened
6547322 one being a growing interest in advertising plays that capitalize on indias emerging infrastructure and growing internet usage the other being an increase in second round deals
6547323 hope im not hurting your hand dan sometimes i shake like a street fighter

6547346 this is unbelievable i simply cant believe it its a dream come true
6547347 i simply started playing flw fantasy fishing because i love fishing and because it was fun we have a lot of dreams and this will help us make many of them come true
6547348 when we launched flw outdoors i dreamed about the biggest payday in pro bass fishing when the champion of the forrest wood cup could claim the first 1 million prize in pro bass fishing
6547349 fifteen years later we achieved my personal goal of awarding 1 million to our forrest wood cup champion not once but as of last sunday two years in a row
6547350 a 1 million prize for pro fishing seemed unbelievable 15 years ago thats why todays 1 million flw fantasy fishing grand prize is so incredible imagine winning a million dollars with the click of a mouse from the comfort of your living room
6547351 with the excitement that flw fantasy fishing has created all over the world in the past year i have no doubt there will be many more like michael thompson who will become flw fantasy fishing millionaires in the years to come
6547352 flw fantasy fishing has been the single best thing that ever happened to professional and recreational bass fishing
6547353 its setting a new benchmark and attracting record numbers of new fans to our sport
6547354 this is absolutely great i love ranger bass boats and it will be great not to have a monthly boat payment anymore

6547760 what we have accomplished in this agreement is the most advanced version of any
6547761 because the u s negotiators indeed showed a great deal of flexibility and understanding
6547762 we recognize that the government still has to review this agreement and well await that process and then it obviously has to go to the council of representatives

6547837 notorious for his efforts to control all uses of his material on and off the internet
6547838 the dmca already requires copyright owners to make an initial review of the potentially infringing material prior to sending a takedown notice

6547855 of course dance music is pop music im always faithful to my community but this album also has big quality pop melodies its the best album ive produced im really happy and proud of it
6547856 when you make a track for the club it is the repetitiveness that makes it work best so it becomes hypnotic like a trance but when you listen at home you look for music with a lot of changes because that is what gives it emotion and i love emotion so i have to have both
6547857 for me it is all about sharing my passion with people
6547858 that is why i am a dj a lot of producers they dont think its cool to play for people but even in the studio i love to play for my friends when i dj i play for the party because i love to share my music

6547881 the national football league is deeply saddened by the loss of gene upshaw
6547882 very very saddened by that i had a couple of conversations with him got to know him a little bit he was a great person
6547883 at the end of the day i think he had the best interest for players he looked healthy to me i mean 63 is a young age its scary you got to respect what he did as the president of the players association and what he did as a player
6547884 he certainly has been a rock for us from a players standpoint we were deeply saddened to hear abut his passing and certainly our hearts go out to his family and his former teammates and friends and co workers
6547885 it would be disrespectful to even to discuss any of those issues right now the most important think right now is honoring gene for his life and what he stood for and giving that respect to his family
6547886 i had heard he had some sort of an ailment there was never any verification of it certainly had no idea it was to this degree or even this life threatening
6547887 i can t say i knew him extremely well personally but having worked with him i know hes a man who was very well respected for a lot of reasons

6547893 i expressed my amazement to a few fellow scribes saturday night emphasizing that n y traded for an all time great quarterback not a broken down one and they gave varying reasons for the poor turnout like its the middle of vacation month for new yorkers and its a preseason game horsefeathers if you really love your team and you have season tickets you should have been at that game unless you were in tibet ridiculous
6547894 goodell is not the first commissioner who knew there was something wrong with asking the customers to pay regular season prices for these stupid games
6547895 paul tagliabue also found it increasingly hard to take trying to get fans fired up for the regular season by making them watch backup players in half empty stadiums when season ticket holders couldnt even give the seats away football fever catch it

6547910 thats an example of how the media makes things so crazy
6547911 kind of my big shining moment looking down the barrel of a camera and knowing 40 million people were watching me

6547981 chrysotile asbestos meets every criteria for listing under the convention but in an unprecedented show of complete disregard for human health the harper government continues to block consensus and veto attempts to restrict chrysotile asbestos the green party denounces this behaviour in the strongest possible terms
6547982 why the prime minister continues to prop up the dying asbestos industry is simply incomprehensible

6548030 they always bring up michigan it kind of gets annoying
6548031 we didnt win a ring off of michigan after that we went through a whole season luckily we had our heads on straight
6548032 armanti right now is seeing so many more things down the field than he did a year ago
6548033 these guys out here theyve got the system down pretty well
6548034 theyre running around flying to the ball and in the right place
6548035 hes been a lot of help to me ever since he went down
6548036 hes definitely on my back all the time its starting to get annoying hes in my ear more than secondary coach dave campo
6548037 that shows a lot of class a lot of guys wouldnt do that
6548038 the day he went down he came back to practice from doing treatment and he has stayed on me ever since then
6548039 he has great feet good technique its all about going out getting a feel getting some reps and having himself feel comfortable out there
6548040 it shows a lot of people are believing in me he said
6548041 i learned after the game when i got schooled on that in the end zone that once the quarterback rolls out of the pocket i can pretty much steer the receiver where i want to
6548042 in college you cant touch the receiver past 5 yards
6548043 in this particular case the rule violation was serious and was attempting to interfere with our ability to conduct an accurate post race competitive analysis
6548044 in 17 years we have never had any representative of joe gibbs racing knowingly act outside of nascars rules and that is something we consider essential to how we operate on a daily basis
6548045 the prime minister of jamaica told me everybody is in the streets ive written history im just real proud
6548046 im looking forward to going to bed waking up and realizing im a double gold medalist ive been dreaming of breaking the 200 meter record since i was yea high
6548047 hes five to seven years from his prime if he stays healthy focused and motivated were going to see some of the most incredible things weve ever seen in sports
6548048 i could see him running the 400 meters i could see him running the 800 in six seven years his talent is virtually untapped
6548049 i dont compare myself a lot im just trying to be me he revolutionized the sport i just changed it a little bit
6548050 continue to do what we were already going to do organizationally and financially

6548055 we wanted to get a number of really good teams together in a pool play bracket tournament the first week of the season and we had a good turnout with good competition
6548056 weve been flying under the radar and not getting much recognition so far but this is a big time event
6548057 there were some good teams here and it gave us an opportunity to experiment and do some different things
6548058 on the one hand i guess i understand why people make a big deal out of it
6548059 but for golfers its really not a big thing its the rule and its just what you are supposed to do golfers learn that early on in a case like this if you dont call a penalty on yourself youre really cheating the rest of the field
6548060 its kind of why golf is like life in general
6548061 you are expected to do or should do the right thing
6548062 these are legitimate questions and we are aware of the concerns
6548063 the age question is one thing residency can be difficult to prove where is somebodys real permanent residence that can get tough
6548064 its nice to be with the rest of the sportsmen of the world said
6548065 i have enjoyed talking to so many people from different sports that you dont know much about there is lots of respect going both ways
6548066 im having a blast in the athletes village ive gotten to know the german handball team and the mens and womens field hockey teams and our table tennis and track athletes
6548067 its such a more interesting experience than staying in a hotel
6548068 it sure beats our experience in athens when we were docked on a ship
6548069 weve mingled weve been sightseeing weve attended a bunch of other events we really feel a part of something bigger here
6548070 were 101 in the country last year in total defense so weve got a long way to go to get to that no 1 and we want to continue to make sure that we get ourselves there
6548071 i never expected this i knew this was a fast track but i didnt think this was possible
6548072 i am shocked i am still shocked i have been aspiring to the world record for so long
6548073 oh lord they say wallace spearmon stepped out the second place guy stepped out well hopefully usain stepped out too so that means ill go home with the gold
6548074 not the way i wanted to go home with it but if two people stepped out hey thats a gold medal for me
6548075 starting to do 400 hurdles i hated it i totally despised it
6548076 i know that i deserved that gold medal and the ncaa they took it
6548077 i was devastated and i didnt let it go until today
6548078 but i came out with the gold and the record i dont believe theres a happier woman on earth than i am right now
6548079 i think the credit goes to the fact we start out competing so young
6548080 i was on a track team when i was 7 years old in jamaica it starts young in jamaica
6548081 usc played one of their best matches of the year its like the ncaa basketball tournament you have to be able to raise the level of your play when youre up against a team having its career night
6548082 thats our motto start here end here were going to end in nebraska knock on wood
6548083 tells it straight some recruiters can be shady and promise you playing time hes not he tells you straight
6548084 you never want to get injured but i think in the games ive played ive showed that im a top player
6548085 i dont think there is any pressure on him since we play different positions
6548086 he does what he does and i did what i did
6548087 i finished off the olympic games with to me the most perfect ending ever
6548088 to finally get the gold medal on my very last routine meant the world to me
6548089 we went out there and showed we are the best going 1 2 in the all around thats never been done by the united states the americans have never had 1 2 on beam before either and 2 3 on floor isnt too bad
6548090 i would never trade one of my silvers johnson said
6548091 i knew it wasnt quite my best routine but im really happy for shawn three silvers is kind of hard to take i couldnt be more proud of her
6548092 i mean you can never really get a full or a great assessment just by playing a few plays here a quarter
6548093 once the preseason is over i think its almost like another switch is turned off and another one is turned on
6548094 we cant really gauge by how the season may go just by the way the preseason goes
6548095 my goal is different we cant win a super bowl without winning a playoff game so my thinking is lets win a playoff game
6548096 if you go back and watch that game i felt like i could have done more
6548097 i just tried to make the best of the opportunities that were thrown at me
6548098 it was just like when i played in the super bowl with the eagles i told the coach if i am on the field treat me as if i am 100 percent i dont think the cowboys did that
6548099 i won this for her for friends and family but mostly for her
6548100 this is an opportunity ive wanted since i started wrestling at 5 25 years ago and its pretty sour to have on me
6548101 it happened so quick its just kind of a shock to me and its something ill deal with
6548102 i tried to hold them off and i just couldnt and im just so disappointed ive never had anything like that happen i was totally out of control on the straightaway i was all over the lane and christine ohuruogu was just really strong coming home
6548103 the hurdles were just coming up too fast and i just couldnt maintain control so i just crashed and burned
6548104 last season i wouldnt wish it on my worst enemy
6548105 my hamstring really let me down and i feel like ive worked so hard in vain
6548106 i know for sure im in 48 second shape so hopefully ill get a chance to go for gold on the relay
6548107 what i like most about coaching is the competition and the relationships ive built with the players
6548108 i even like practice you cant become great if you dont have practice
6548109 they pick and sing every other week he loves it bob could always sing and he taught himself how to play guitar i guess for accompaniment
6548110 he might be more laid back now but he can still get in your face if he needs to thats what i liked about him
6548111 he is an easy man to talk to and one that everyone has respect for and that says a lot about the person he is
6548112 finally my mother told reilly to make sure his grandfather really had a penny in one of his hands
6548113 as it turned out the penny was in his pocket and he was just dying from laughing so hard
6548114 my dad has the prettiest basketball shot youve ever seen
6548115 i coached against him many times and it wasnt fun
6548116 simply put he enjoys coaching and the relationships he has with coaches kids parents ex players teachers and game officials on friday nights
6548117 in our last dialogue on retiring bob said why would i want to do that

6548122 i plan on doing more things in the future to bring poker to women in south america
6548123 some of them were in middle school when i was a high school senior
6548124 i cant believe how many young guys weve got running around here but we need them because we dont have a lot of returning experience
6548125 we mentioned earlier that we have to have some of the young receivers come on
6548126 im really pleased with malcolm williams hes having a heck of a camp it goes without saying that quan and jordan are doing well but malcolm is doing really well dan buckner has had a very productive camp and james kirkendoll has done the same
6548127 you never know how theyre going to play when they get out in front of 98 000 people
6548128 we have our scrimmages in the stadium and everything and i catch them looking around and just wondering
6548129 we make our comments and get them ready for it i think theyre going to do fine theyre playmakers and theyre ready
6548130 we really dont know we havent played a game yet
6548131 we have a lot of guys that are making plays for us showing up and getting better the coaches will decide who plays and when they do im confident in whoever they pick
6548132 its only because they dont have the experience in the gold medal game
6548133 i hope this will send a message of peace to my country after 30 years of war
6548134 when i saw that he won i jumped up and hugged and kissed my son
6548135 do unto others as you would have done unto you
6548136 you should never feel pressured to add anyone to your blogroll likewise you should never feel guilty about removing someone

6548139 you dont want to do it so now i dont want you to dont do it

6548146 there are hardly any personal films today most are linear stories from a to b lindays films were not stories they were characters driven through period events they caught the flavor of what was going on
6548147 all you have to get is that youre in a closed society which is a metaphor for whats going in society in general terms

6548167 there was a bear in front of it so i stopped too and started taking pictures
6548168 i saw it take a hubcap off the car then start walking towards us i locked all the doors quickly we didnt know what it would do
6548169 it put the hubcap down and then banged on the window as if it was trying to get my attention
6548170 it was almost like it wanted to give me the wheel cap
6548171 my little boy was crying but my daughter was enjoying it she was saying oh my god mummy look what hes doing
6548172 quite soon after a park warden came along and shooed the bear away
6548173 she asked me whose the hubcap was so it could be returned to the car in front
6548174 it was very strange i dont know what the bear was doing
6548175 in a funny way i thought oh no maybe even animals are starting to take hubcaps as well as people

6548206 one reason i refuse to bother with the whole security circus is that i think it glorifies and thus encourages the wrong behavior it makes heroes out of security people as if the people who dont just fix normal bugs arent as important in fact all the boring normal bugs are way more important just because theres a lot more of them

6548334 most teachers hold themselves accountable they didnt go into teaching to make money they dont have seven houses
6548335 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
6548336 does a guy who worries about the price of arugula and thinks regular people cling to guns and religion in the face of economic hardship really want to have a debate about whos in touch with regular americans

6548338 but seriously i dont think you can i dont think seriously that the point is that im trying to make here seriously and im sure that comment will be distorted but the point is that we want to keep peoples taxes low and increase revenues

6548346 it becomes difficult to find some that are neutral but have some style

6548376 studies have shown that up to 85 of bleeding complications in patients undergoing pci are related to the access site and we know that bleeding in and of itself is associated with an increased risk of mortality and morbidity
6548377 if you take the access site out of the equation we have the potential to substantially reduce bleeding complications which is what the clinical trials of radial vs femoral have shown in the past
6548378 the traditional approach has been to say here is a patient that would be good for the radial approach
6548379 people who do a lot of radial pci actually look for an excuse not to do it the radial route should be the default approach now with the availability of equipment and now the data showing that you dont sacrifice anything when you do the radial approach
6548380 the learning curve with the radial approach is variable and it depends on how tactile clinicians are with catheter manipulation
6548381 i can tell you that while there is a learning curve its really not that much harder its one of those situations where if you do a few of them you really get the hang of it weve encouraged our fellows to learn it during training so that when they get out theyll already have the techniques in the back of their mind
6548382 they could not meet requirements in terms of trained personnel on site
6548383 due to their large storage capacity these sites pose a greater potential for harm than others should an incident occur
6548384 from a risk point of view we thought that was the most appropriate route to follow

6548399 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
6548400 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
6548401 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
6548402 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
6548403 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
6548404 who are open to doing something on the production side
6548405 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
6548406 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
6548407 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
6548408 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
6548409 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
6548410 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
6548411 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal

6548416 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
6548417 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
6548418 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
6548419 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
6548420 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
6548421 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
6548422 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
6548423 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
6548424 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
6548425 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
6548426 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
6548427 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
6548428 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
6548429 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
6548430 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
6548431 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
6548432 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
6548433 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
6548434 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
6548435 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
6548436 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
6548437 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
6548438 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
6548439 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
6548440 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
6548441 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
6548442 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
6548443 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
6548444 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
6548445 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
6548446 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
6548447 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
6548448 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
6548449 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
6548450 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
6548451 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
6548452 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
6548453 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
6548454 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
6548455 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
6548456 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
6548457 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
6548458 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
6548459 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
6548460 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
6548461 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
6548462 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
6548463 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
6548464 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
6548465 providing security regime for maritime in the eastern part of the black sea
6548466 there is no need to further reinforce it the fleet
6548467 to assess the current humanitarian situation and make recommendations on continued humanitarian support to senior military leadership
6548468 the eucom team will conduct a deliberate and focused assessment encompassing variables such as transportation infrastructure manpower and many other life support considerations
6548469 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
6548470 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
6548471 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
6548472 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
6548473 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
6548474 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
6548475 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
6548476 the top companies in america are not looking for a piece of paper or a cobbled together degree they are looking for bright eager young people with a global good education impressive employees who have the ability to work hard work smart and behave ethically

6548481 i want to take this public opportunity to say to you mayor antonio villaraigosa that you were first but oakland is going to be second so dont slow down
6548482 we must maintain the integrity of good jobs for our migrant truck drivers who need to have a real living not a false wage that continues to perpetuate poverty and pollution
6548483 this idea of good jobs and clean air it is based in the values of that made america great
6548484 today we stand together to demand clean air and good jobs because we wont get one without the other
6548485 this campaign is about the fundamental right of our families to decency hope and opportunity thats why we stick together and thats why well win
6548486 for far too long we have suffered from the ill effects of port truck pollution cancer and asthma is devastating our community
6548487 the coalition for clean amp safe ports plan will lower public health risks associated with port truck pollution and bring economic opportunity to a neighborhood that has chronic high unemployment
6548488 its important for the health of everybody especially truck drivers
6548489 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
6548490 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
6548491 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
6548492 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
6548493 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
6548494 in theory we should beat a team like guatemala the reality is playing in guatemala becomes very difficult and they use all the other factors besides soccer and talent on the field to their advantage so the atmosphere the crowd the travel that we go through the field the temperatures there those can all become excuses for us and benefit to them
6548495 with carlos you expect that he is dirty i wish i could say it otherwise but hes played mls for five years and ive seen him
6548496 the referee today expelled gustavo cabrera as a way to level the game after expelling cherundolo
6548497 it was a very hard fought game and for us a hard earned three points we have played some tough games in the last year but none of them are qualifiers to experience it and to win in that fashion is good for the group
6548498 mccain frequently forgets key elements of policies gets countries names wrong forgets things hes said only hours or days before and is frequently just confused
6548499 he was against offshore drilling before he was for it
6548500 i didnt think it likely that a member of the un security council and the osce would react like this

6548506 for two or three of his researches he deserves the highest honor a scientific man can obtain but the sum of his work is absolutely overwhelming had he never lived the aspect of chemistry would be very different from that it is now
6548507 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
6548508 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
6548509 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
6548510 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation

6548515 the new system wont cost the taxpayer any more money
6548516 students first have to complete a minimum two year degree or diploma course and then have to work for a year on a temporary resident visa before they can apply so for an applicant to show that kind of commitment must mean they really do want to enter canada
6548517 the points system assesses the quality of newcomers education but does not necessarily get their credentials recognized and this was a big problem under the previous system
6548518 this has now been eliminated through the fcro program through which prospective immigrants can continue to work in their home countries while pursuing their credentials upgradation before arriving here they can also evaluate their prospects better and so budget better to pursue any upgrades they might need
6548519 we have already had three budgets and two economic updates pass while continuing to stay the course in afghanistan and pushing through the immigration bill
6548520 in the next little while we are also poised to become the longest running minority government
6548521 choosing newcomers based on knowledge of our labour market and experience within canadian society would make canada a more attractive destination for skilled individuals from around the world
6548522 international students and skilled workers would be more likely to choose canada if they knew their time in canada and contribution to canadian society would assist in their eligibility to apply to stay permanently
6548523 by restricting this benefit to only professional technical and skilled occupations the government is setting up a permanent underclass of unskilled temporary foreign workers who will be deprived of the rights to citizenship being extended only to elite workers
6548524 the great majority of temporary foreign workers in alberta do not fall into the privileged o a and b designated occupations
6548525 what mcgowan doesnt understand is the federal government is constipated
6548526 there are about 900 000 people waiting for admission to canada for landed immigrant status this is a six year backlog the system needs a laxative

6548704 how can this trait be made in one gender and not the other
6548705 males and females basically have the same set of genes so how do you specifically modify the activity of a males genes but not a females genes
6548706 the flies did not need new genes to make a new pattern
6548707 they just changed how males and females use a common set of genes
6548708 the switch existed for tens of millions of years because it had a different job
6548709 but it got remodeled evolution is a cumulative process you have this machinery and its easy to add a bell or a whistle with this particular trait it evolved by exploiting genetic information that was already there to make male bodies different from female bodies
6548710 we have enough evidence to believe this evolved in a male specific way

6548741 nothing in the new regulation in any way changes a patients right to any legal procedure
6548742 its about abortion and conscience it is very closely focused on abortion and physicians conscience
6548743 this regulation does not limit patient access to health care but rather protects any individual health care provider or institution from being compelled to participate in or from being punished for refusal to participate in a service that for example violates their conscience

6548776 obamas political career was launched in ayers home and the two served together on a left wing board why would barack obama be friends with someone who bombed the capitol and is proud of it do you know enough to elect barack obama
6548777 mr ayers is a 60 plus year old individual who lives in my neighborhood who did something that i deplore 40 years ago when i was 6 or 7 years old

6548809 public figures like michael phelps exert a major influence over our youngsters
6548810 mr phelps is a superior athlete by any measure but his judgment regarding the mcdonalds and kelloggs frosted flakes endorsements was either 1 ill advised by his handlers 2 the irrational product of too much blood sugar or 3 a sad triumph of greed over good ciof believes that celebrities should think twice before choosing to endorse or encourage the consumption of any product which is inherently unhealthful to children especially if that product is correlated to obesity diabetes and a myriad of dangerous conditions
6548811 octagon sports agent peter carlisle is making a strategic branding mistake by aligning michael phelps to kelloggs frosted flakes and mcdonalds in this era of escalating child obesity and diabetes the last association michael phelps wants is that of junk food pusher
6548812 while michael phelps may consume thousands of calories a day and burn them off through olympic training americas kids arent so lucky theyre fat sickly and have little hope of accomplishing a single sit up much less olympic gold kids are watching and michael phelps going for the quick cash of pushing junk food at the expense of children tarnishes his image similar to an association with cigarettes or alcohol would national action against obesity and the childrens international obesity foundation implore michael phelps and all celebrities and athletes to reject offers to push more sugar fat and hazardous calories onto americas kids
6548813 as we set out to look at the causes of obesity in our film
6548814 this is unconscionable and we hope that michael phelps reconsiders his endorsement contracts
6548815 because children under five deserve environments full of healthy options not marketing venues for junk food producers

6548823 gary fifteen years later and youre still to the rescue more acute and heroic than ever
6548824 gary miller who started kvm and is as good a blogger as exists has not wavered in his criticism of zogbys methodology
6548825 despite the fact that you have taken a few petty and gratuitous shots at me i want to quote your web site great point on the federalist papers
6548826 smart folks are already following kennedy vs the machine for news of that us senate race
6548827 new local blogs for candidates have cropped up drawing national sized audiences like kennedy vs the machine
6548828 minnesotas conservative blog community spawned kennedy vs the machine which pushes senate candidate mark kennedy by bashing state and national democrats
6548829 from national issues to state issues to fun facts that help to personalize public figures kvm informs and educates in an insightful and often amusing way
6548830 miller as you can tell by the name of his blog is a party sycophant

6548844 our goal is for the chevrolet cruze to lead in fuel economy in this very competitive car segment
6548845 our dealers are asking for many more cobalts than we can build
6548846 the first one is christianity now youve made no doubt about your faith in jesus christ what does that mean to you what does that mean to you to trust in christ what does that mean on a daily basis i mean what does that really look like
6548847 well as a starting point it means i believe that jesus christ died for my sins and that i am redeemed through him
6548848 it means im saved and forgiven and were talking about the world our faith encompasses not just the united states of america but the world can i tell you another story real quick the vietnamese kept us imprisoned in conditions of solitary confinement or two or three to a cell they did that because they knew they could break down our resistance one of the techniques that they used to get information was to take ropes and tie them around your biceps pull your biceps behind you loop the rope around your head pull your head down between your knees and leave you in that position you can imagine it was very uncomfortable one night i was being punished in that fashion all of a sudden the door of the cell opened and the guard came in a guy who was just what we called a gun guard he just walked around the camp with a gun on his shoulder he went like this and then he loosened the ropes he came back about four hours later he tightened them up again and left the following christmas because it was christmas day we were allowed to stand outside of our cell for a few minutes in those days we were not allowed to see or communicate with each other although we certainly did and i was standing outside for my few minutes outside of my cell he came walking up he stood there for a minute and with his sandal on the dirt in the courtyard he drew a cross and he stood there and a minute later he rubbed it out and walked away for a minute there there was just two christians worshiping together ill never forget that moment
6548849 okay now lets deal with abortion forty million abortions since roe v wade you know as a pastor i have to deal with this all the time all of the pain and all of the conflicts i know this is a very complex issue forty million abortions at what point does a baby get human rights in your view
6548850 well i think that whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity you know is above my pay grade
6548851 at the moment of conception i have a 25 year pro life record in the congress in the senate and as president of the united states i will be a pro life president and this presidency will have pro life policies thats my commitment thats my commitment to you
6548852 i believe that marriage is the union between a man and a woman now for me as a christian its also a sacred union you know gods in the mix i would you support a constitutional amendment with that definition because historically we have not defined marriage in our constitution its been a matter of state law that has been our tradition now i mean lets break it down the reason that people think there needs to be a constitutional amendment some people believe is because of the concern about same sex marriage i am not somebody who promotes same sex marriage but i do believe in civil unions i do believe that we should not that for gay partners to want to visit each other in a hospital for the state to say you know what thats all right i dont think in any way inhibits my core beliefs about what marriage are i think my faith is strong enough and my marriage is strong enough that i can afford those civil rights to others even if i have a different perspective or a different view
6548853 a union a union between man and woman between one man and one woman thats my definition of marriage i believe the judges in the california supreme court were wrong and i strongly support preserving the unique status of marriage between man and woman and im a federalist i believe that states should make those decisions in my state i hope we will make that decision in other states they have to recognize the unique status of marriage between man and woman and that means that doesnt mean that people cant enter into legal agreements that doesnt mean that they dont have the rights of all citizens im not saying that i am saying that we should preserve the unique status of marriage between one man and one woman and if a federal court if a federal court decided that my state of arizona had to observe what the state of massachusetts decided then i would favor a constitutional amendment until then i believe the states should make the decisions within their own states
6548854 okay how about this what about stem cells now weve had this scientific breakthrough of creating these pluripotent stem cells in adult cells do we still need federal funding for research would you still support that for embryo stem cells
6548855 well keep in mind the way the stem cell legislation that was vetoed by the president was structured what it said was you could only use embryos that were about to be discarded that had been created as a consequence of attempts at in vitro fertilization so there were very tightly circumscribed mechanisms that were permitted i think that that is a legitimate moral approach to take if were going to discard those embryos and we know that theres potential research that could lead to curing debilitating diseases alzheimers lou gehrigs disease you know if that possibility presents itself then i think that we should in a careful way go ahead and pursue that research now if in fact adult stem cell lines are working just as well then of course we should try to avoid any kind of moral arguments that may be in place but i want to make a broader point pastor rick on an issue like stem cell research i mean its not like people who are in favor of stem cell research are going around thinking to themselves you know boy lets go destroy some embryos right i mean thats not the perspective that i think people come to that issue on i think what they say is we would not tolerate a situation in which you know were encouraging human cloning or in some ways diminishing the sacredness of human life and what it means to be human but that in narrow circumstances you know there is nothing inappropriate with us pursuing scientific research that could lead to cures so long as you know were not designing embryos for that purpose
6548856 for those of us in the pro life community this has been a great struggle and a terrible dilemma because were also taught other obligations that we have as well ive come down on the side of stem cell research but i am wildly optimistic that skin cell research which is coming more and more into focus and practicability will make this debate an academic one
6548857 does evil exist and if it does do we ignore it do we negotiate with it do we contain it do we defeat it
6548858 evil does exist i mean i think we see evil all the time we see evil in darfur we see evil sadly on the streets of our cities we see evil in parents who viciously abuse their children and i think it has to be confronted it has to be confronted squarely and one of the things that i strongly believe is that you know we are not going to as individuals be able to erase evil from the world that is gods task but we can be soldiers in that process and we can confront it when we see it now the one thing that i think is very important is for us to have some humility in how we approach the issue of confronting evil because you know a lot of evil has been perpetrated based on the claim that we were trying to confront evil and i think you know one thing thats very important is having some humility in recognizing that you know just because we think our intentions are good doesnt always mean that were going to be doing good
6548859 defeat it a couple of points one if im president of the united states my friends if i have to follow him to the gates of hell i will get osama bin laden and bring him to justice i will do that and i know how to do it i will get that guy no one no one should be allowed to take thousands of american innocent american lives of course evil must be defeated my friends we are facing the transcendent challenge of the 21st century radical islamic extremism not long ago in baghdad al qaeda took two young women who were mentally disabled and put suicide vests on them sent them into a marketplace and by remote control detonated those suicide vests if that isnt evil you have to tell me what is and were going to defeat this evil and the central battleground according to david petraeus and osama bin laden is the battle is baghdad mosul basra and iraq and we are winning and we are succeeding and our troops will come home with honor and with victory and not in defeat and thats whats happening and we have and we face this threat throughout the world its not just in iraq its not just in afghanistan our intelligence people tell us al qaeda continues to try to establish cells here in the united states of america my friends we must face this challenge we can face this challenge and we must totally defeat it and were in a long struggle but when im around the young men and women who are serving us in uniform i have no doubt none
6548860 the courts let me ask it this way which existing supreme court justice would you not have nominated
6548861 i would not have nominated clarence thomas applause i dont think that he was a strong enough jurist or legal thinker at the time for that elevation setting aside the fact that i profoundly disagree with his interpretations of a lot of the constitution i would not nominate justice scalia although i dont think theres any doubt about his intellectual brilliance because he and i just disagree you know he taught at the university of chicago as did i in the law school john roberts i have to say was a tougher question only because i find him to be a very compelling person you know in conversation individually hes clearly smart very thoughtful i will tell you that how ive seen him operate since he went to the bench confirms the suspicions that i had and the reason that i voted against him and ill give you one very specific instance and this is not a stump speech i think one of the most important jobs of i believe the supreme court is to guard against the encroachment of the executive branch on the power of the other branches and i think that he has been a little bit too willing and eager to give an administration whether its mine or george bushs more power than i think the constitution originally intended
6548862 with all due respect justice ginsberg justice breyer justice souter and justice stevens well i think that the president of the united states has incredible responsibility in nominating people to the united states supreme court they are lifetime positions as well as the federal bench there will be two or maybe three vacancies this nomination should be based on the criteria of proven record of strictly adhering to the constitution of the united states of america and not legislating from the bench some of the worst damage has been done by legislating from the bench and by the way justices alito and roberts are two of my most recent favorites by the way they really are theyre very fine and im proud of president bush for nominating them
6548863 the role of faith based organizations a recent poll says 80 percent of americans think faith based organizations do a better job at community services than the government helping addictions you know prisoner reentry you know all the different homeless poverty things like this and the civil rights act of 64 says that faith based organizations have a right to hire people who believe like they do would you insist that faith based organizations forfeit that right to access federal funds
6548864 well first of all i think youre aware pastor rick that i gave a speech earlier this summer promoting faith based initiatives i think that we should have an all hands on deck approach when it comes to issues like poverty and substance abuse and as somebody who got my start out of college working with churches who were trying to deal with the devastation of steel plants closing on the south side of chicago i know the power of faith based institutions to get stuff done what i have said is that when it comes first of all to funding faith based organizations they are always free to hire whoever they want when it comes to their own mission who their pastor is various ministries that they want to set up and this has been a long standing rule when it comes to the programs that are federally funded then we do have to be careful to make sure that we are not creating a situation where people are being discriminated against using federal money thats not new thats a concept that was true under the clinton administration that was true under the bush administration there are in 95 percent of the circumstances its not an issue because people are careful about how they use the funds there are some tough issues 5 percent of the situations where people might say you know i want to hire somebody of my faith for a program that is fully funded by the federal government and were offering services to the public well you know its one of those situations where the devil is in the details i think generally speaking faith based organizations should not be advantaged or disadvantaged when it comes to getting federal funds by virtue of the fact that they are faith based organizations they just want a level playing field but what we do want to make sure of is that as a general principle were not using federal funding to discriminate but that is only when it comes to the narrow program that is being funded by the federal government that does not affect any of the other ministries that are taking place
6548865 absolutely not and if you did it would mean a severe crippling of faith based organizations and their abilities to do the things that they have done so successfully life is full of anecdotes and im sorry to tell you so many anecdotes but i went to new orleans after katrina the resurrection baptist church was doing tremendous work with thousands of volunteers im sure probably from here at saddleback coordinating the efforts of thousands of volunteers including my own church the north phoenix baptist church who came from all over america and various authorities off the record told me off the record that they were doing so much more good than the government organizations said it was incredible and new orleans could not have been on the path theyve got a long way to go on the path to recovery if it hadnt been for the faith based organizations who are still operating in new orleans much to their great credit thank god
6548866 okay lets go to education america right now ranks 19th in high school graduations were first in incarcerations eighty percent of americans a recent poll said they believe in merit pay for teachers now im not asking do you think all teachers should get a raise do you think better teachers should be paid better they should be paid more than poor teachers
6548867 i think that we should and ive said this publicly that we should set up a system of performance pay for teachers negotiated with teachers worked with the teachers to figure out the assessments so that they feel like theyre being judged fairly that its not at the whim of the principal that its not simply based on a single high stakes standardized test but the basic notion that teaching is a profession that teachers are underpaid so we need to pay them all more and create a higher baseline but then we should also reward excellence i think that is a concept that all of us should invest in
6548868 yes yes and find bad teachers another line of work choice and competition choice and competition home schooling charter schools vouchers all the choice and competition i want look i want every american family to have the same choice that cindy and i made and senator obama and mrs obama made as well and that was we wanted to send our children to the school of our choice and charter schools work my friends home schooling works vouchers in our nations capital works weve got thousands of people in washington d c that are applying for a voucher system new york city is reforming i go back to new orleans they were as we know the tragedy devastated them they now have over 30 charter schools in the city of new orleans and guess what its all coming up its all coming up its a simple principle but its going to take dedicated men and women particularly in the teaching profession to make it happen and by the way here in i wont go any further but the point is its all based and its being proven that choice and competition for every american family and it is the civil rights issue of the 21st century because every citizens child now has an opportunity go to school but what kind of opportunity is it if you send them to a failing school thats why weve got to give everybody the same opportunity and choice
6548869 look heres how i think about it heres how i think about it and this is reflected in my tax plan if you are making 150 000 a year or less as a family then youre middle class or you may be poor but 150 thousand dollars down youre basically middle class obviously it depends on region and where youre living i would argue that if youre making more than 250 000 dollars then youre in the top 3 4 percent of this country youre doing well now these things are all relative and im not suggesting that everybody who is making over 250 000 dollars is living on easy street but the question that i think we have to ask ourselves is if we believe in good schools if we believe in good roads if we want to make sure that kids can go to college if we dont want to leave a mountain of debt for the next generation then weve got to pay for these things they dont come for free and it is irresponsible i believe it is irresponsible intergenerationally for us to invest or for us to spend 10 billion a month on a war and not have a way of paying for it that i think is unacceptable so nobody likes to pay taxes i havent sold 25 million books but ive been selling some books lately so i write a pretty big check to uncle sam nobody likes it what i can say is is that under the approach im taking if you make 150 000 or less you will see a tax cut if youre making 250 000 a year or more youre going to see a modest increase what im trying to do is create a sense of balance and fairness in our tax code one thing i think we can all agree on is that it should be simpler so that you dont have all these loopholes and big stacks of stuff that youve got to comb through which wastes a huge amount of money and allows special interests to take advantage of things that ordinary people cannot take advantage of
6548870 some of the richest people ive ever known in my life are the most unhappy i think that rich should be defined by a home a good job an education and the ability to hand to our children a more prosperous and safer world than the one that we inherited
6548871 in a minute tell me in a minute why you want to be president
6548872 you know i remember what my mother used to tell me i was talking to somebody a while back and i said the one time that shed get really angry with me is if she ever thought that i was being mean to somebody or unfair to somebody she said imagine standing in their shoes imagine looking through their eyes that basic idea of empathy and that i think is whats made america special is that notion that everybodys got a shot if we see somebody down and out if we see a kid who cant afford college that we care for them too and i want to be president because thats the america i believe in and i feel like that american dream is slipping away i think we are at a critical juncture economically i think we are at a critical juncture internationally weve got to make some big decisions not just for us but for the next generation and we keep on putting it off and unfortunately our politics is so broken and washington is so broken that we cant seem to bring together people of good will to solve these common problems i think i have the ability to build bridges across partisan lines racial regional lines to get people to work on some common sense solutions to critical issues and i hope that i have the opportunity to do that
6548873 i want to inspire a generation of americans to serve a cause greater than their self interest i believe that americas best days are ahead of us but i also believe that we face enormous challenges both national security and domestic as we have found out in the last few days in the case of georgia and i want to be make sure that everybody understands that this is a time for us to come together throughout my life from the time i was 17 and raised my hand and was sworn in as a midshipman at the united states naval academy ive always put my country first i put my country first when i had the honor of serving in the military and i had the honor of putting my country first as a member of the house of representatives and then the united states senate america wants hope america wants optimism america wants us to sit down together i have a record of reaching across the aisle and working with the other party and i want to do that and i believe as i said that americans feel its time for us to put our country first and we may disagree on a specific issue and i wont review them now but i want every american to know that when i go to gees bend alabama and meet the african american women there who are so wonderful and lovely in an experience ill never forget and when i go to places where i know they probably wont vote for me i know that my job is to tell them that ill be the president of every american and ill always put my country first

6548920 designed to deliver programs tailored to educational excellence and the needs of the communities they serve
6548921 no other factor in life will have more of an effect on a childs life than the family and home schooling enables the family to play its important role more actively

6548997 the thought of his being president sends a cold chill down my spine
6548998 adds an inappropriate level of review which unnecessarily limits the governors discretion to decide the parole of a convicted murderer based on what is in the best interest of public safety
6548999 a cold premeditated murder carried out in an especially cruel manner and committed for an incredibly petty reason
6549000 indeed it is not the circumstance that the crime is particularly egregious that makes a prisoner unsuitable for parole
6549001 it is the implication concerning future dangerousness that derives from the prisoner having committed that crime
6549002 upon the inmates current dangerousness should not produce a wave of reversals of decisions denying parole
6549003 the awesome responsibility of deciding whether to release a convicted murderer on parole lies with the executive branch not the judicial branch
6549004 gov schwarzenegger will continue to consider each of these lifer cases individually and based on the entirety of their record including original crime and time in prison will decide whether or not a lifer inmate poses an unreasonable safety risk to our communities if released

6549025 no es cuesti n de cargar sobre las espaldas de los ciudadanos toda la responsabilidad en las emisiones que se generan en la producci n y consumo de bienes o en la de energ a es m s que yo pueda ir andando al trabajo o en un transporte p blico no contaminante y as reduzca la huella de carbono no depende s lo de m sino de administraciones y empresas que deben poner los medios para que lo pueda hacer
6549026 detr s de cada gramo de emisi n por habitante hay una el ctrica una cementera un fabricante de piensos una papelera o una empresa ganadera si stos redujeran su huella de carbono permitir an que la del ciudadano fueran menor
6549027 la energ a que se consume en una gran ciudad depende en gran medida de c mo est dise ada en cuanto al reparto del suelo entre distintas actividades y funciones cuando se toman decisiones urban sticas desde un ayuntamiento hay que ser muy consciente de sus efectos energ ticos
6549028 hay que ir directamente a una regulaci n obligatoria del sector para que se compruebe y verifique todo el sistema de compensaciones
6549029 estamos en un periodo de prueba y error por lo cual hasta que no exista un sistema fiable de verificaci n nosotros recomendamos siempre reducir y si no queda m s remedio se estudia la compensaci n
6549030 una de las preguntas m s frecuentes est relacionada con el vuelo que van a hacer cuando salen de vacaciones que es donde m s emisiones se generan en corto espacio de tiempo y c mo pueden compensar esa huella

6549040 there are still some issues to work out but its very premature at this point to say that we have an agreement
6549041 the reason we are where we are today talking about this kind of agreement is that the surge worked iraqi forces have demonstrated that they are strong and getting stronger and we are making progress together in the defeat of iraqs enemies of all stripes
6549042 and we can look forward to an agreement or we can look forward to a set of circumstances in which we know what is needed in the future in terms of roles responsibilities numbers

6549222 no one is coming in and scoring 18 touchdowns we dont have the offense to do that anyway a lot of guys in college they havent seen the complex coverages they see in this league

6549224 he has a lot of pride and he puts too much pressure on himself
6549225 if he learns to relax and just play he knows the play but he talks himself out of it so theres always doubt when he knows it he plays real fast and you see the skill when hes not sure he looks like a rookie
6549226 i try to stay away from prepping him so much
6549227 you got to learn a lot on the fly the more things he goes through the more hes starting to open up now and come talk to me about different things hes seeing and how hes adjusting
6549228 he gets so down that he ends up frustrating himself

6549241 i wouldnt bother to learn how to imitate somebody i wasnt a fan of
6549242 from what ive heard and read on line austin thinks its funny and entertaining if he gets it i wish some fans would lighten up and realize what im doing is not meant as an insult in any way its more of a tribute

6549249 so many times ive imagined killing him and then killing myself
6549250 a young innocent boy who turned into a monster and a country so full of promise transformed into a concentration camp
6549251 without ever boasting that he was the son of the great leader
6549252 to this day i know nothing of the details of their deaths of whether they blamed me as they perished
6549253 they were sent away to different uninhabited islands in an attempt to end their substandard genes from repeating in a new generation left for dead none of the people made it back home

6549259 right through the motivational campaign theme they were doing everything right
6549260 the political mind why you cant understand 21st century american politics with an 18th century brain

6549262 obama felt he was sitting with dr phil and he was trying not to offend anybody mccain seemed to understand he was running for president his answers were more direct and aimed at the electorate

6549264 obamas folks are reading their own press clippings too much and theyve got to understand theyre in a dogfight

6549271 they can continue to let people know were here come visit us how the land is the orchards do great or whatever
6549272 an amish woman said we joke among ourselves if we keep growing at this rate soon half the world will be amish and the other half will be taxi drivers
6549273 we also recognize it is important to make clear our thoughts on important public policy issues and today are announcing that we cannot support the paid sick day ballot initiative while we would hope that all ohio businesses would make paid sick days available to their employees whenever possible we believe that this initiative is unworkable unwieldy and would be detrimental to ohios economy and we will be opposing it and asking ohioans to oppose it as a result
6549274 weve rarely seen a vehicle go in the wrong direction and get a worse rating after it has been redesigned

6549296 im sorry she felt she had to play politics with this
6549297 if this was intended to be political i would have hoped to know about it before
6549298 this wasnt something that was part of any campaign plan
6549299 when you have a public official who will try to use something like that to enhance their own political campaign

6549318 the concern of this court is that in these lawsuits potentially meritorious legal and factual defenses are not being litigated and instead the federal judiciary is being used as a hammer by a small group of plaintiffs to pound settlements out of unrepresented defendants
6549319 rule 11 b 3 requires that a representation in a pleading have evidentiary support and one wonders if the plaintiffs are intentionally flouting that requirement in order to make their discovery efforts more convenient or to avoid paying the proper filing fees in my view the court would be well within its power to direct the plaintiffs to show cause why they have not violated rule 11 b with their allegations respecting joinder i t is difficult to ignore the kind of gamesmanship that is going on here these plaintiffs have devised a clever scheme to obtain court authorized discovery prior to the service of complaints but it troubles me that they do so with impunity and at the expense of the requirements of rule 11 b 3 because they have no good faith evidentiary basis to believe the cases should be joined
6549320 by sale or other transfer of ownership or by rental lease or lending
6549321 i nfringement of the distribution right requires an actual dissemination of either copies or phonorecords 2 nimmer on copyright 8 11 a at 8 124 1
6549322 p laintiffs unreasonably rejected or sought to suppress evidence to the extent it tended to exonerate defendant
6549323 n either the parties submissions nor the courts own research has revealed any case holding the mere owner of an internet account contributorily or vicariously liable for the infringing activities of third persons
6549324 i see no reason for the court to take immediate action in this case as there is no evidence that records are about to be destroyed
6549325 if the owner of the shared folder simply provides a member of the public with access to the work and the means to make an unauthorized copy the owner is not liable as a primary infringer of the distribution right but rather is potentially liable as a secondary infringer of the reproduction right
6549326 t he inducement rule is a sensible one for copyright we adopt it here holding that one who distributes a device with the object of promoting its use to infringe copyright as shown by clear expression or other affirmative steps taken to foster infringement is liable for the resulting acts of infringement by third parties one infringes contributorily by intentionally inducing or encouraging direct infringement
6549327 plaintiff must present at least some facts to show the plausibility of their allegations of copyright infringement however plaintiffs have presented no facts that would indicate that this allegation is anything more than speculation
6549328 plaintiffs are ordered to file any future cases of this nature against one defendant at a time and may not join defendants for their convenience
6549329 a n overwhelming majority of cases brought by recording companies against individuals are resolved without so much as an appearance by the defendant usually through default judgment or stipulated dismissal the defendant does cannot question the propriety of joinder if they do not set foot in the courthouse
6549330 n either floridas litigation privilege nor the noerr pennington doctrine serves as a shield for sham litigation
6549331 the court is unaware of any other authority that authorizes the ex parte subpoena requested by plaintiffs
6549332 plaintiffs contend that unless the court allows ex parte immediate discovery they will be irreparably harmed
6549333 p laintiffs can cite to no case foreclosing the applicability of the due process clause to the aggregation of minimum statutory damages proscribed under the copyright act on the other hand lindor cites to case law and to law review articles suggesting that in a proper case a court may extend its current due process jurisprudence prohibiting grossly excessive punitive jury awards to prohibit the award of statutory damages mandated under the copyright act if they are grossly in excess of the actual damages suffered
6549334 d istributing unlawful copies of a copyrighted work does violate the copyright owners distribution right and as a result constitutes copyright infringement
6549335 t his court finds that defendants use of the same isp and p2p networks to allegedly commit copyright infringement is without more insufficient for permissive joinder under rule 20 this court will sever not only the moving defendants from this action but all other doe defendants except doe 2

6549341 when youre talking about this kind of money a lot of people cant really understand why would you turn your back on a contract business is business

6549369 there was an altercation involving an unknown male who obviously threw something through a window
6549370 there was a smash it the object must have been alight because it ignited the curtains and the house went up
6549371 i was there eight minutes later and it was just destroyed
6549372 through their heroics they entered there and retrieved one male who was nearly unconscious he was unable to get out on his own
6549373 they went back in to retrieve the woman couldnt find her and they found she gained access to the rear of the premises and was in the back yard
6549374 we wont know what he threw through the window until the forensics get there we dont know if he had some sort of accelerant or if things just went up themselves
6549375 we have been doing a lot of original reporting and we are going to be doing a lot more
6549376 we get these interviews because we have this global audience of 500 million viewers
6549377 our aim is to reach these bigger names and use our reporting talent to break news we are really going for the kinds of questions that will make news
6549378 we really are paying a lot of attention to what our audience wants
6549379 we see tremendous traffic on politics what is going on around the world and the names that get their interest
6549380 we like to pick people with expertise in the subject matter
6549381 aarons father fought in the korean war and he has tons of experience in reporting
6549382 we are really going for places we feel we can have an impact and cover them in ways that are slightly different
6549383 we want to be the number one independent news source on the internet
6549384 its not something that is a burden to them its not something to this group because they havent been part of every step along the way
6549385 this is a unique gathering of players and were just looking to the opportunity that we have so the past doesnt become an anchor for us in fact its probably more of a stimulant than anything
6549386 its the ultimate rugby experience its the ultimate rugby nation this is the place you come to test yourself and we know that well be tested seriously tested on the weekend
6549387 but we hope to do some testing of our own
6549388 i think the intensity and everyones mindsets are in good places so i think thats positive really positive
6549389 obviously its about building that intensity getting that mental build up right and then bringing it out on saturday in the test match
6549390 i think we found that certainly playing in the last test match a couple of weeks ago against new zealand that we knew they were going to come out to us with a fair bit of intensity and thats exactly what they brought
6549391 unfortunately we didnt match it so for us we feel that thats probably going to be the case again this time
6549392 hopefully we will match it i think thats the challenge thats in front of us

6549395 the greatest increases in survival were seen in the 50 to 69 year age range
6549396 this was due at least in part to screening programs
6549397 the findings reflect the effectiveness of early detection and advances in chemotherapy radiation therapy and surgery which are extending the lives of people diagnosed with a range of cancers
6549398 with 655 000 australians either living with an invasive cancer or as a long term cancer survivor we have to pull together as a community to support individuals and their families through the many difficulties of a cancer diagnosis
6549399 this is an opportunity to discuss issues with the irb face to face
6549400 there are a number of technical matters wed like to raise but there are two issues we want to straighten out
6549401 wed like to discuss our request to meet referees in the company of opposition coaches before test matches and correct the suggestions that we have failed in our duties to provide refereeing reports to the irb
6549402 we have enormous sympathy for referees who in some cases have had to manage blowing as many as five different sets of laws this season
6549403 its only natural that wed want to talk to them about interpretations in such a complex environment
6549404 it travelling will always favour them australia and new zealand
6549405 they gain a day but we lose a day when we fly there then you also have to play for financial reasons on consecutive saturdays
6549406 we know we need to win both games with bonus points but again we wont be throwing the ball around all over in the game
6549407 its about being structured in what we want to achieve and i believe then we can get the tries

6549417 the plane was rocking back and forth until i suspected it was going to fall
6549418 i saw people smoke explosions i think that is what woke me up because i had lost consciousness

6549435 i looked at him and that messed my race up
6549436 its just when jeremy passed me it threw me off a little bit i was at least expecting him to catch me at the 200 mark he caught me before that i didnt expect that they say he went out in 20 4 thats jeremy
6549437 i met new people made friends met the best people in the world
6549438 hes a great talent and i cant wait till next season
6549439 the coach from lsu was talking to him texas a amp m seem to be in the running right now florida state is knocking kentucky is knocking
6549440 its up to him right now which school hes going to be comfortable with hell definitely be an ncaa finalist it would be good if he could win it one year

6549444 it helps speed up recovery and cools down the central nervous system and helps you stabilize
6549445 they are getting laser treatment they are on specialized machines which take knots out so theres a lot of modern technology a lot of money a lot of expense
6549446 natural talent only gets you so far at this level it has to be some kind of science of course it has to be legal but theres definitely a lot of science involved in the recovery side
6549447 i think the presentations were well received and they probably never received anything like that before
6549448 it demonstrated a simple fact that when people help you you show your appreciation by giving little tokens it also shows that with a vibrant national olympic committee we can achieve more with a vibrant and dynamic noc we should be able to get all the federations active and with active federations there are a number of benefits
6549449 one some money is brought into the economy two our athletes officers officials trainers and managers would be better prepared and three in the long run it puts us in the position where we can host meaningful activities
6549450 the reason were putting in such a large culvert is that we want to plan for the future
6549451 i would hate to have the port authority left holding the bag come january

6549456 i hope that sometime on friday during session we will find an amicable way to address the needs of the executive and weigh them against the interest of the body

6549458 we dont want to rob peter to pay paul but peter is the man on fixed income who is not making any money

6549461 we made the decision in light of the governments needs to prevent a financial shortfall
6549462 we have tried to get a directive from the court
6549463 the executive branch cannot sit down and let a few taxpayers bring the government to a grinding halt
6549464 everyones a little surprised that the government would just thumb its nose at judge gomez and the court without asking
6549465 i did my best but unfortunately i was disappointed with my time and performance my coach and husband and i came up with a reason that happened i trained hard competed hard overseas and that played a big role in my performance here at the beijing olympic games
6549466 track is my job and when i go overseas im guaranteed money which i need to pay my bills of course everyone trains to go to the olympics or make a team fortunately i dont have to go to trials so im overseas trying to get myself right for the olympics unfortunately it had a negative effect on me
6549467 i was disappointed but i got up dusted off my shoulders and said you know what laverne you had one of the best seasons you ever had in your whole track career because you were very consistent and youve never been so consistent
6549468 i dont have fear anymore because we are all humans and when i go out there its a battle a war catch me if you can and may the best one win i run i dont run scared

6549509 wait no harry potter could not have dyspraxia hes so good at quidditch
6549510 the first part of this course was very tricky but weve come out of it rather well prior to setting out from hong kong the most optimistic forecasts gave us 8 days to reach the sunda strait in the end we covered the 2 000 miles of this initial section in 6 days 16 hours its very satisfying particularly as the weather didnt really favour us dishing out what felt like some rather interminable days sailing close hauled and a rather long passage across the equator
6549511 the sely tradewinds are well and truly here weve got 22 to 25 knots of breeze which is enabling us to drive gitana 13 at speeds close to 25 30 knots the seas are building gradually and the atmosphere is wetter on deck now the sailors on watch have swapped their t shirts for foulies which are better suited to these new sailing conditions everything seems to be in place to enable us to pass the reunion islands at a steady pace some big surf awaits
6549512 the sely tradewinds are well established in the indian ocean these highly favourable winds will enable lionel lemonchois and his crew to maintain an average speed of around 25 knots throughout the first half of this ocean crossing this regular tradewind air flow is currently being produced by two vast zones of high pressure the first close to australia and the second close to africa these two systems are shifting slightly eastwards as they fill in and the second zone of high pressure will settle between the kerguelen and reunion islands and stretch right across the breadth of the indian ocean on saturday 23rd august a fine and slightly favourable ssely swell is accompanying the maxi catamaran so gitana 13 should make fairly rapid progress over the next four days following on from that theyll have to line themselves up nicely in order to negotiate several passages of fronts to the south of madagascar prior to reaching the cape of good hope the second half of the crossing wont be as direct and close hauled sailing will prevail once more in increasingly big seas as they approach the african continent

6549584 the final statement was arrived at externally considered through protracted and violent controversies during the course of which every conceivable construction of the biblical data had been exploited weighed and its elements of truth sifted out and preserved while the elements of error which deformed it were burned up as chaff in the fires of the strife out of the continuous controversy of a century there issued a balanced statement in which all the elements of the biblical representation were taken up and combined work so done is done for all time and it is capable of ever repeated demonstration that in the developed doctrine of the two natures and in it alone all the biblical data are brought together in a harmonious statement in which each receives full recognition and out of which each may derive its sympathetic exposition this key unlocks the treasures of the biblical instruction on the person of christ as none other can and enables the reader as he currently scans the sacred pages to take up their declarations as they meet him one after the other into an intelligently consistent conception of his lord

6549627 that he should indulge in sharp practices may have taken many in the legal fraternity by surprise

6549642 i do think we are going to see attacks i think we have been seeing attacks already going on in the field
6549643 were doing everything we can to mitigate and reduce its incidence
6549644 there are other scenarios that i cant unfortunately get into
6549645 indicating that the online underworld is poised to launch targeted attacks in coming weeks
6549646 the most important thing for people to patch are the name servers that back up their mail servers
6549647 the good news is that there are hundreds of millions of users protected against these attacks the bad news is its not everybody
6549648 its a slow technology to evolve with just five to ten percent improvement per year
6549649 manufacturers have tried to make better ones but barring the development of a tiny nuclear power generator for mobile devices there isnt much they can do
6549650 theres the periodic table and just so many elements and weve done about as much as can do with that aspect
6549651 ive been working on this for ten years and there are a lot of issues such as the need to get oxygen into the cell and get created water vapor out of the device but its a very compelling option
6549652 rim has done a really good job at optimizing its systems to get very good battery efficiency and their battery is a hallmark in that sense
6549653 you can access the web watch television and movies listen to music and do so many wonderful things but if the battery is dead when you need to make a call you are in trouble
6549654 battery life should have improved during the last several years
6549655 it hasnt this is one area that has seemed to be ignored
6549656 batteries have always been lacking and always behind the device evolution
6549657 people want the larger displays they want the 3g radio connectivity and that all demands power
6549658 some groups are looking at using mirrored light and even solar energy in reducing the power drain with displays
6549659 are spending a lot of research and development money with partners on improving battery life
6549660 its the double edge sword in that users want things but there are trade offs
6549661 nirvana would be a device staying powered for days that would be a huge success story in this industry
6549662 consider that four or five years ago you could charge a cell phone and it would stay powered for a week

6549671 we find ourselves at a critical place with kids eating and physical activity habits
6549672 our hope is that once schools receive the successful students school designation they will use the feedback from the scorecard to continue to make positive changes in these areas we have two and three times more overweight and obese kids in our state today than we did 20 years ago and its not going to get better unless we all work together families schools and communities to make sure kids get plenty of activity and eat balanced diets
6549673 they need to be active and eat well while they are there so they can feel good and do well in school studies show this to be true it just makes sense we all need to work to make sure this happens
6549674 un tempo in una citt vivevano un re e una regina che avevano tre bellissime figlie le due pi grandi per quanto molto belle potevano essere degnamente celebrate con lodi umane ma la bellezza della pi giovane era cos straordinaria e cos incomparabile che qualsiasi parola umana si rivelava insufficiente a descriverla e tanto meno a esaltarla
6549675 insomma sia quelli della citt che i forestieri attratti in gran numero dalla fama di tanto prodigio restavano attoniti dinanzi a un simile miracolo di bellezza portavano la mano destra alle labbra accostavano lindice al pollice e la adoravano con religioso rispetto come se fosse stata venere in persona
6549676 anzi nelle vicine citt e nelle terre confinanti si era sparsa la voce che la dea nata dai profondi abissi del mare e allevata dalla spuma dei flutti volendo elargire la grazia della sua divina presenza era discesa fra gli uomini o anche che da un nuovo seme di stille celesti non il mare ma la terra aveva sbocciato unaltra venere anchessa bellissima nella sua grazia virginale
6549677 di giorno in giorno una simile credenza si rafforzava sempre pi e la voce cominci a diffondersi nelle isole vicine e poi pi lontano in molte regioni del continente
6549678 folle di pellegrini sempre pi numerose facevano lunghi viaggi attraversavano mari profondi per vedere quella straordinaria meraviglia del secolo
6549679 nessuno andava pi a pafo o a cnido o a citera per visitare i santuari di venere alla dea non si facevano pi sacrifici i suoi templi erano lasciati nellabbandono i suoi sacri cuscini calpestati le cerimonie trascurate le sue statue restavano disadorne vuoti i suoi altari e ingombri di cenere spenta
6549680 alla fanciulla si innalzavano preghiere e si placava il nume di una dea potente come venere adorando un volto umano
6549681 questo eccessivo tributo di onori divini a una fanciulla mortale suscit lo sdegno violento della venere vera che scuotendo fieramente il capo e malcelando la collera cos cominci a ragionare
6549682 ecco che io lantica madre della natura lorigine prima degli elementi la venere che d vita allintero universo sono ridotta a dividere con una fanciulla mortale gli onori dovuti alla mia maest e a veder profanato dalle miserie terrene il mio nome celebrato nei cieli
6549683 ti prego gli diceva in nome dellaffetto che mi porti per le dolci ferite delle tue frecce per le soavi scottature delle tue torce fa che tua madre abbia piena vendetta punisci senza piet questa bellezza insolente
6549684 cos gli parl stringendosi forte al seno quel suo figliuolo e baciandoselo a lungo
6549685 un tal seguito scortava il viaggio di venere verso loceano
6549686 ma intanto psiche bellissima comera non ricavava alcun frutto dalla sua grazia
6549687 un giorno le due sorelle pi grandi la cui bellezza modesta era passata inosservata al gran pubblico si fidanzarono con principi del sangue e celebrarono nozze felici mentre psiche rimasta vergine sola nella vuota casa piangeva il suo triste abbandono e sofferente e intristita fin per odiare la sua stessa bellezza che pure tutti ammiravano
6549688 e cos linfelice padre della sventurata fanciulla temendo una maledizione celeste e la collera degli dei interrog lantichissimo oracolo del dio milesio e con preghiere e con vittime chiese a questa potente divinit per la vergine negletta nozze e marito
6549689 come a nozze di morte vesti la tua fanciulla ed esponila o re su unalta cima brulla non aspettarti un genero da umana stirpe nato ma un feroce terribile malvagio drago alato che volando per laria ogni cosa funesta e col ferro e col fuoco ogni essere molesta
6549690 il re che un tempo era stato felice sentito il sacro responso fece ritorno a casa collanimo colmo di tristezza e rifer alla moglie i comandi del funesto oracolo per pi giorni non fecero che piangere gemere lamentarsi
6549691 ormai alla povera psiche non restava che obbedire al volere celeste e sottomettersi al supplizio cui era stata destinata
6549692 terminati nella pi profonda tristezza tutti i solenni preparativi di quel funesto matrimonio una gran folla di popolo segu le esequie di un vivo e psiche in lacrime fu accompagnata non a nozze ma al suo funerale
6549693 i poveri genitori colpiti da una sventura cos grande esitavano a compiere un cos orribile crimine ma era la stessa figliola ad esortarli perch diceva volete angustiare ancor pi la vostra infelice vecchiaia
6549694 conducetemi dunque in cima alla rupe che la sorte mi ha destinata e lasciatemi l desidero ormai celebrare presto queste nozze felici voglio vederlo subito questo mio nobile sposo perch indugiare perch differire lincontro con costui che nato per la rovina dellintero universo
6549695 cos disse la vergine e poi tacque e con passo deciso savvi tra la folla che la segu in corteo
6549696 giunsero cos alla rupe destinata su in alto in cima a un monte a strapiombo e l lasciarono la fanciulla sola l lasciarono le fiaccole spente con le loro lacrime con cui seran fatti lume e a capo chino rientrarono alle loro case
6549697 i poveri genitori distrutti da tanta sciagura si chiusero nellombra pi fitta delle loro stanze votandosi a una notte senza fine
6549698 psiche intanto spaurita e tremante l in cima alla rupe si struggeva in lacrime quandecco lalito mite di zefiro che mollemente spirava e in un vortice lieve le ventilava le vesti dolcemente la sollev da terra e sostenendola col suo soffio leggero gi gi lungo il pendio del monte la depose nel cavo di una valle in grembo allerbe e ai fiori
6549699 psiche dolcemente adagiata su un morbido prato in un letto di rugiadosa erbetta sent lanimo suo liberarsi di tutta langoscia e placidamente saddorment
6549700 dopo aver riposato abbastanza si lev pi tranquilla e vide un boschetto fitto di alberi alti e frondosi e una sorgente dacque cristalline e proprio in mezzo al bosco non lontana da quella fonte vide una reggia costruita non dalla mano delluomo ma per arte divina
6549701 il soffitto a cassettoni finemente intarsiati di cedro e davorio era sostenuto da colonne doro le pareti tutte rivestite da bassorilievi dargento raffiguranti belve e altri animali nellatto di balzare su chi entrava
6549702 un uomo certamente straordinario un semidio forse anzi un dio di sicuro chi aveva con unarte cos magistrale animato tutto quellargento
6549703 beati oh s veramente beati quelli che avrebbero potuto camminare su quelle gemme e su quei gioielli
6549704 daltronde anche il resto della casa in lungo e in largo
6549705 tutte le altre cose erano perfettamente intonate alla magnificenza regale di quella casa s che veramente sembrava che quel divino palazzo fosse stato costruito per il sommo giove come sua dimora terrena
6549706 attratta dallincanto del luogo psiche savanz poi fattasi coraggio varc la soglia e presa dalla curiosit di quella mirabile visione si mise a osservare attentamente ogni cosa
6549707 ma la cosa pi straordinaria pi ancora di tutte quelle meraviglie era che nessuna chiave nessun cancello nessun custode difendeva quelle ricchezze
6549708 mentre con sommo piacere ella contemplava tutto questo sent una voce misteriosa che le disse signora perch stupisci di fronte a tanta ricchezza
6549709 psiche comprese che tutta quella grazia era un segno della divina provvidenza e seguendo le indicazioni delle voci misteriose prima con il sonno poi con un bagno si liber della stanchezza
6549710 fu allora che vide poco discosta una tavola semicircolare gi apparecchiata per il pranzo e pensando si trattasse del suo volentieri sedette
6549711 allistante senza che nessuno servisse ma come spinti da un soffio le vennero recati vini pregiati svariate pietanze
6549712 dopo quel pranzo squisito un essere invisibile entr e cominci a cantare e un altro ad accompagnarlo sulla cetra ma psiche non riusc a vedere nemmeno questa poi le giunse allorecchio un concerto di voci si trattava di un coro ma anche questa volta la fanciulla non vide nessuno
6549713 quando queste delizie cessarono lora tarda invit al sonno psiche
6549714 ma nel cuor della notte un rumore leggero le giunse allorecchio ella era sola col suo pudore di vergine e trasal cominci a tremare di paura a temere lignoto che la circondava pi che un pericolo reale
6549715 accorsero allora prontamente le voci che vigilavano nella stanza e porsero alla novella sposa le loro cure per la violata verginit
6549716 questo si ripet per molto tempo e come di solito accade labitudine fin col rendere piacevole a psiche questa sua nuova esistenza e il suono di quelle voci misteriose col consolare la sua solitudine
6549717 nel frattempo i suoi genitori invecchiavano in un dolore e in un lutto inconsolabili
6549718 tristi e angosciate esse avevano lasciate le loro case e in fretta e furia erano corse a consolare i loro genitori
6549719 quella notte stessa lo sposo disse alla sua psiche infatti bench invisibile lei poteva udirlo toccarlo come un marito in carne e ossa psiche mia dolcissima e amata sposa il destino crudele ti minaccia di un terribile pericolo per cui ti prego d essere molto prudente
6549720 assent psiche e promise che avrebbe fatto come il suo sposo diceva ma quando egli con la notte si dilegu per tutto il giorno la poverina non fece che struggersi in lacrime allora son proprio morta si ripeteva tra i lamenti prigioniera in questo carcere doro senza poter corrispondere con esseri umani senza nemmeno poter consolare le mie sorelle che mi piangono morta senza neppure poterle vedere
6549721 cos quando il suo sposo pi presto del solito le si distese al fianco e stringendola fra le braccia sent che piangeva sono queste le disse le tue promesse psiche
6549722 ma ella con mille preghiere minacciando perfino che si sarebbe data la morte strapp al suo sposo il permesso di vedere le sorelle di consolare il loro dolore di trattenersi un poco a parlare con loro
6549723 ella ringrazi lo sposo e tutta contenta lo rassicur che avrebbe preferito cento volte morire piuttosto che non fare pi allamore con lui che lo amava ardentemente chiunque fosse che le era caro come la vita e che lo preferiva perfino allo stesso cupido ma ti prego gli diceva tra i baci concedimi ancora questo comanda al tuo servo zefiro di portar qui le mie sorelle al modo stesso che lo fui io e gli sussurr mille dolci paroline e si avvinghi al suo corpo quasi a costringerlo continuandogli a ripetere fra le carezze gioia mia sposo mio diletto dolce anima della tua psiche
6549724 suo malgrado lo sposo cedette alla forza e alla seduzione di quei sussurri damore e promise che avrebbe fatto quello che lei voleva poi appressandosi lalba si sciolse dagli amplessi della sposa a svan
6549725 frattanto le sorelle saputo il posto in cima alla montagna dovera stata abbandonata psiche lo raggiunsero senza indugio e qui cominciarono a piangere e a battersi il petto tanto che rocce e dirupi echeggiarono presto dei loro gemiti
6549726 poi si misero a chiamare per nome la povera sorella finch psiche a quei dolorosi lamenti che si spandevano tuttintorno gi gi fino a valle trepidante e fuori di s si precipit dal palazzo esclamando
6549727 baci e abbracci a non finire si scambiarono le tre sorelle e le lacrime a stento poco prima represse tornarono a spuntare ma questa volta furono lacrime di gioia
6549728 suvvia entrate rallegratevi questa la mia casa bando alle malinconie ora che siete con la vostra psiche
6549729 e cos dicendo mostr alle sorelle tutti i tesori di quel palazzo dorato e fece sentire anche a loro le innumerevoli voci che la servivano
6549730 poi le ristor con un magnifico bagno e con un pranzo che fu tutto una delizia degno degli dei tanto che dopo essersi rimpinzate di ogni ben di dio le due sorelle cominciarono a covare in cuor loro un senso di invidia
6549731 a un certo punto una delle due cominci a far la curiosa e a chiedere con insistenza chi fosse il padrone di tutte quelle meraviglie chi era suo marito e che aspetto avesse
6549732 ma psiche a nessun costo avrebbe tradito il giuramento fatto allo sposo e infatti non svel i suoi segreti
6549733 ma quello che non si dissero rientrando a casa le due rispettabili sorelle divorate comerano dallinvidia e dalla bile
6549734 guarda me invece disgraziata che sono m capitato un marito pi vecchio di mio padre per giunta pi calvo di una zucca pi timido dun ragazzino e che tiene tutta la casa sotto chiave e catena
6549735 ed io fece di rimando laltra che mi devo sopportare un marito tutto rattrappito e sciancato dai reumatismi e che in fatto damore quindi mi fa fare lunghe astinenze
6549736 prova a ricordarti con quanta superbia e arroganza ci ha trattate e come si vantava davanti a noi e come si compiaceva dentro di s
6549737 in fondo in fondo poi che cosa ci ha dato
6549738 perci se anche tu come dovresti ti senti bruciare da questaffronto vediamo in due di tirar fuori qualche progettino efficace
6549739 per prima cosa silenzio con tutti genitori compresi per quanto riguarda i doni che ci siamo portati via anzi dobbiamo dire di non aver saputo nulla di lei se sia ancora viva o meno
6549740 per fare infatti meno felice qualcuno sufficiente che nessuno conosca la sua fortuna
6549741 ora per torniamo dai nostri mariti alle nostre case povere quanto vuoi ma ospitali ci penseremo su con tutta calma e ponderazione e ritorneremo pi risolute e decise a punire tanta superbia
6549742 questa malvagia risoluzione parve buona alle perfide sorelle che nascosti tutti quei doni cos preziosi cominciarono a strapparsi le chiome a graffiarsi il viso se lo sarebbero meritato e a versare false lacrime
6549743 poi gonfie di rabbia dopo aver rinnovato il dolore nei loro genitori sbigottiti di furia fecero ritorno alle loro case per macchinare un inganno scellerato anzi un vero e proprio delitto nei riguardi della sorella innocente
6549744 intanto il misterioso sposo ripeteva a psiche i soliti avvertimenti nei suoi colloqui notturni ma non vedi quale pericolo ti sovrasta
6549745 presto non saremo pi in due perch questo tuo grembo fino a ieri ancora di bambina porta gi in s per noi una creatura un dio se tu saprai custodire il nostro segreto un essere mortale se invece lo violerai
6549746 a quella notizia psiche sillumin di gioia il consolante pensiero di una prole divina la rallegrava era orgogliosa del futuro rampollo ed esultava della sua nuova dignit di madre
6549747 ansiosa contava i giorni che si succedevano i mesi che passavano e nella sua innocenza si stupiva di quello strano peso e di quel ventre che per una piccola trafittura le era tanto cresciuto
6549748 ma intanto quei flagelli quelle orribili furie gonfie di veleno come vipere avevano rotto gli indugi e preso il mare rapide si appressavano spinte dalla loro stessa malvagit
6549749 e allora quello sposo sempre fuggente ancora una volta ammon la sua psiche
6549750 ma psiche con parole soffocate dai singhiozzi da tempo credo hai avuto le prove della mia fedelt e della mia discrezione tuttavia voglio nuovamente di mostrarti la fermezza del mio animo
6549751 stregato da queste parole e dalle carezze lascive lo sposo asciugandole le lacrime con i capelli promise che lavrebbe esaudita poi rapido si dilegu prima che sorgesse il nuovo giorno
6549752 le due sorelle unite nella congiura senza neppure far visita ai genitori lasciata la nave si diressero di filato verso la rupe e non aspettarono nemmeno che il vento si sollevasse a raccoglierle ma con folle temerariet si precipitarono gi dallalto
6549753 ma zefiro che ricordava lordine del suo signore sebbene malvolentieri le raccolse nel grembo del suo soffio e le depose al suolo
6549754 psiche ma tu non sei pi la bimba di prima eccoti gi madre
6549755 cos simulando affetto a poco a poco si cattivarono lanimo della sorella la quale premurosamente le fece sedere perch si riposassero del viaggio le ristor con un bel bagno caldo le intrattenne nel triclinio lasciando che si servissero loro piacere di quelle sue pietanze squisite e raffinate
6549756 eppure la malvagit di quelle femmine scellerate non si quiet nemmeno alla dolcezza di quel canto anzi avviando il discorso in direzione della trappola gi predisposta facendo finta di nulla cominciarono a chiedere a psiche comera quel suo marito dovera nato e da quale famiglia discendesse
6549757 e quella ingenua comera e non ricordando ci che aveva detto la volta prima invent una nuova storia cio che il suo sposo era nativo della vicina provincia che aveva un grosso giro di affari che era di mezza et e gi con qualche capello bianco
6549758 poi senza indugiare troppo su questo discorso le colm nuovamente di ricchi doni e le affid al vento perch le riportasse via
6549759 ma quelle mentre tornavano a casa sollevate dal soffio tranquillo di zefiro cos cominciarono a discutere che ne pensi sorella della grossolana menzogna di quella stupida
6549760 comunque nellun caso o nellaltro limportante tirarla gi da tutte le sue ricchezze
6549761 sta certa che se quella l non sia mai passer per la madre di un fanciullo divino io mi appender a una corda e subito
6549762 ma per adesso torniamo dai nostri genitori e prendendo lo spunto da questo discorso continuiamo a tessere inganni quanto pi verosimili
6549763 cos divorate dallira rivolsero appena un saluto sgarbato ai genitori e dopo una notte insonne al mattino tornarono di furia alla rupe e di li si calarono gi con laiuto del solito vento
6549764 strofinandosi le palpebre riuscirono a strizzare qualche lacrima e poi si rivolsero alla fanciulla con queste astute parole beata te che te ne stai tranquilla ignara di un fatto terribile incurante del pericolo che ti sovrasta ma noi che stiamo sveglie la notte preoccupate del tuo caso siamo angosciate al pensiero delle
6549765 ora ricordati delloracolo che ti predisse che avresti sposato unorribile bestia molti contadini e quelli che vengono a caccia da queste parti e parecchi abitanti dei dintorni lo hanno visto allimbrunire tornare dalla pastura e nuotare nelle acque del fiume qui vicino
6549766 e tutti dicono che non ti colmer per molto tempo di tutte queste delizie ma che appena la tua gravidanza si sar compiuta ti divorer insieme con il ricco frutto del tuo ventre
6549767 stando cos le cose tu devi decidere o ascoltare le tue sorelle cos sollecite della tua vita e scampando alla morte vivere con noi fuori di ogni pericolo oppure finire nelle viscere di un mostro orrendo
6549768 se poi ti piace questa solitudine risonante di voci se ti piace giacere con un fetido furtivo e pericoloso amante accoppiarti con un velenoso serpente noi le tue buone sorelle avremo almeno fatto il nostro dovere
6549769 la povera psiche ingenua e di cuor semplice comera a quelle parole cos terribili fu assalita dal terrore
6549770 tremante sbiancata in volto livida con un filo di voce balbett parole rotte
6549771 sorelle carissime a fare quel che fate vi spinge il vostro affetto verso di me ed anche giusto che sia cos ma anche quelli che vi han detto queste cose orribili purtroppo mi sa che non se le sono inventate
6549772 sapete poi come si spaventa se io gli chiedo di volerlo conoscere e di quali disastri mi minaccia se gli dico che sono curiosa di sapere almeno com il suo volto
6549773 perci se voi volete effettivamente soccorrere questa vostra sorella infelice fatelo subito qualsiasi indugio renderebbe vano il beneficio che gi mi avete recato con il vostro tempestivo intervento
6549774 allora quelle due scellerate ebbero via libera nellanimo ormai indifeso della sorella e messa da parte la tattica sottile dellintrigo sconvolsero i trepidi pensieri dellingenua fanciulla con le armi palesi della frode
6549775 e cos la seconda incalz poich il vincolo di sangue che ci lega ci induce pur di salvarti a non tener conto del pericolo noi ti indicheremo dopo averci pensato e ripensato lunica via che pu portarti a salvamento
6549776 non ti mancher il nostro aiuto perch appena tu lavrai ucciso e sarai salva noi accorreremo prontamente e ti aiuteremo a portar via in fretta tutte queste ricchezze e poi ti faremo sposare secondo il tuo desiderio ma con un uomo dal momento che sei una creatura umana
6549777 con queste parole di fuoco infiammarono lanimo della sorella che gi divampava poi la lasciarono in asso temendo esse stesse di restare pi oltre sul luogo di tanto misfatto e fattesi portare in alto fino alla rupe dal solito soffio di vento via di gran corsa fino alle navi per poi fuggire lontano
6549778 ma psiche rimasta sola anche se sola non era perch tormentata da furie ostili si sentiva turbata e sconvolta come un mare in tempesta e bench risoluta e ferma nel suo proposito bench gi sul punto di consumare il misfatto provava una certa esitazione e nella sua sventura era combattuta da sentimenti diversi
6549779 tuttavia mentre scendevano le prime ombre della sera trepidante e in gran fretta ella dispose ogni cosa per il delitto venne la notte e giunse anche lo sposo che dopo essersi un po cimentato in qualche schermaglia amorosa cadde in un sonno profondo
6549780 allora a psiche vennero meno le forze e lanimo ma a sostenerla a ridarle vigore fu il suo stesso implacabile destino and a prendere la lucerna afferr il rasoio e sent che il coraggio aveva trasformato la sua natura di donna
6549781 ma non appena il lume rischiar lintimit del letto nuziale agli occhi di lei apparve la pi dolce e la pi mite di tutte le fiere cupido in carne e ossa il bellissimo iddio che soavemente dormiva e dinanzi al quale la stessa luce della lampada brill pi viva e la lama del sacrilego rasoio dette un barbaglio di luce
6549782 a quella visione psiche impaurita fuori di s sbiancata in viso e tremante sent le ginocchia piegarsi e fece per nascondere la lama nel proprio petto e lavrebbe certamente fatto se larma stessa quasi inorridendo di un cos grave misfatto sfuggendo a quelle mani temerarie non fosse andata a cadere lontano
6549783 eppure bench spossata e priva di sentimento a contemplare la meraviglia di quel volto divino ella sent rianimarsi
6549784 vide la testa bionda e la bella chioma stillante ambrosia e il candido collo e le rosee guance i bei riccioli sparsi sul petto e sulle spalle al cui abbagliante splendore il lume stesso della lucerna impallidiva sulle spalle dellalato iddio il candore smagliante delle penne umide di rugiada e bench lali fossero immote le ultime piume le pi leggere e morbide vibravano irrequiete come percorse da un palpito
6549785 tutto il resto del corpo era cos liscio e lucente cos bello che venere non poteva davvero pentirsi daverlo generato ai piedi del letto erano larco la faretra e le frecce le armi benigne di cos grande dio
6549786 psiche non la smetteva pi di guardare le armi dello sposo con insaziabile curiosit le toccava le ammirava tolse perfino una freccia dalla faretra per provarne sul pollice lacutezza ma per la pressione un po troppo brusca della mano tremante la punta penetr in profondit e piccole gocce di roseo sangue apparvero a fior di pelle
6549787 ma mentre lanima sua innamorata sabbandonava a quel piacere la lucerna maligna e invidiosa quasi volesse toccare e baciare anchessa quel corpo cos bello lasci cadere dallorlo del lucignolo sulla spalla destra del dio una goccia dolio ardente
6549788 balz su il dio sentendosi scottare e vedendo oltraggiata e tradita la sua fiducia senza dire parola dun volo si sottrasse ai baci e alle carezze dellinfelicissima sposa
6549789 psiche per nellattimo in cui egli spicc il volo riusc ad afferrarsi con tutte e due le mani alla sua gamba destra e a restarvi attaccata inerte peso compagna del suo altissimo volo fra le nubi finch stremata non si lasci cadere al suolo
6549790 ma il dio innamorato non ebbe cuore di lasciarla cos distesa a terra e vol su un vicino cipresso e dal ramo pi alto con voce grave e turbata cos le parl
6549791 eppure quante volte ti ho detto di stare in guardia con che cuore ti ho sempre ammonita ma quelle tue brave consigliere presto faranno i conti con me per i loro suggerimenti funesti quanto a te baster la mia fuga a punirti e con queste parole aperse le ali e si lev nel cielo
6549792 da terra ove giaceva psiche segu il volo dello sposo finch pot vederlo e intanto si sfogava in gemiti angosciosi ma quando nel suo rapido volo egli si fu sottratto alla vista di lei perdendosi lontano nello spazio ella corse alla riva del fiume pi vicino e a capofitto vi si gett ma il buon fiume devoto al dio che suole accendere damore anche le acque e temendo per s senza farle alcun male la sollev su unonda e la depose sulla riva fiorita
6549793 per fortuna che pan il dio dei campi se ne stava seduto proprio l sulla sponda del fiume con eco fra le braccia la dea dei monti e le insegnava a cantare le melodie pi varie mentre le capre qua e l lungo la riva saltando brucavano lerba che la corrente lambiva
6549794 figliola cara cominci a dirle io non sono che un villano un rozzo pastore per di esperienza ne ho tanta dato che sono vecchio ormai
6549795 psiche non rispose al dio pastore che le aveva parlato e riverente al nume soccorritore si mise in cammino
6549796 a lungo err per strade sconosciute tra molti stenti finch giunse con le prime ombre della sera ad una citt dove era re il marito di una delle sue sorelle
6549797 ricordi i consigli che mi deste quando mi persuadeste ad uccidere con un affilato rasoio il mostro che mi dormiva accanto sotto il mentito nome di marito prima che fosse lui a divorar me poveretta
6549798 ebbene quando la complice luce della lampada come sera daccordo mi rivel il suo volto oh che spettacolo meraviglioso addirittura divino videro i miei occhi il figlio stesso di venere cupido in persona ti dico era l che riposava tranquillo
6549799 infame via dal mio letto subito fa fagotto tua sorella
6549800 psiche non aveva ancora finito di parlare che quella eccitata dagli stimoli di una pazza libidine e da una malvagia invidia cos su due piedi invent al marito una panzana che facesse al caso cio che aveva saputo della morte di uno dei suoi genitori e di furia prese la nave e si rec direttamente alla nota rupe
6549801 ma il vento che soffiava ora era vento diverso tuttavia protesa in una folle speranza quella cominci a invocare cupido prendimi sono io la sposa degna di te e tu zefiro accogli la tua padrona e con un gran salto si butt gi
6549802 ma nemmeno morta pot giungere l dove voleva perch il suo corpo si sfracell sulle rocce aguzze e per gli uccelli rapaci e le fiere quelle membra straziate furono un pasto abbondante
6549803 intanto mentre psiche andava di paese in paese cercando amore questi dolorante ancora per la scottatura della lucerna sera rifugiato nello stesso letto della madre e si lagnava
6549804 allora il candido uccello che sfiora con le sue ali le onde del mare il gabbiano velocissimo si tuff nel profondo grembo delloceano e avvicinatosi a venere che tranquillamente stava facendo il bagno e nuotava le rifer che il figlio sera scottato che si lamentava per il dolore acuto della piaga e che giaceva a letto in grave stato infine che la famiglia di venere ormai era sulla bocca di tutti e sul suo conto correvano dicerie e malignit a non finire per esempio che il figlio sera appartato tra i monti per godersi i favori di una sgualdrina e che lei la madre se ne stava sempre in mare a nuotare e che perci gli uomini non sapevano pi cosera il piacere la gentilezza la grazia e tutto era diventato rozzo selvaggio volgare e non si celebravano pi matrimoni non cerano pi relazioni amichevoli fra gli uomini e anche lamore per i figli si stava allentando e cera solo un gran disordine e come un fastidio per ogni sorta di legami del resto sempre meno sentiti
6549805 questo cicalava quelluccello petulante e pettegolo allorecchio di venere calunniandole il figlio
6549806 e luccello chiacchierone non tacque non lo so mia signora credo per che egli sia innamorato cotto di una fanciulla mortale se ben ricordo si chiama psiche
6549807 venere salt su infuriata e cominci a gridare ah psiche che ama la mia rivale in bellezza quella che voleva usurpare il mio nome sta a vedere che il ragazzo mi avr presa per una ruffiana e s pensato che io gli abbia mostrato la fanciulla perch ci andasse assieme
6549808 e usc dal mare strillando per precipitarsi di furia al suo talamo doro dove come le era stato riferito trov il giovanotto infortunato belle cose mi fai sentire cominci a tuonargli dal limite della porta
6549809 la verit che tu sin da piccolo eri un poco di buono e hai sempre avuto le grinfie lunghe
6549810 s ma ora che devo fare dal momento che sono stata beffata
6549811 daltro canto mi vengono i brividi al pensiero di dover parlare a quella cafona miserabile comunque la soddisfazione che d la vendetta non cosa da buttar via da qualunque parte venga e quindi proprio di lei e di nessunaltra mi posso servire per dare a questo pagliaccio una solenne lezione spaccargli la faretra spuntargli le frecce allentargli larco spengergli la fiaccola insomma adottare rimedi estremi per farlo rigar dritto
6549812 cos parl la dea e usc a precipizio dalla stanza adirata e furente come sapeva esserlo soltanto lei
6549813 ma ecco che cerere e giunone le corsero dietro e vedendola tutta sconvolta le chiesero il perch di quel truce cipiglio che toglieva incanto e fulgore ai suoi occhi
6549814 siete proprio giunte a proposito le interruppe ho la rabbia in corpo e voi mi darete la soddisfazione che cerco
6549815 quelle allora conoscendo i fatti si misero ad ammansire la dea ma che cosa ha poi fatto di tanto male tuo figlio che gli togli tutti gli spassi e addirittura vuoi a tutti i costi la rovina della fanciulla che ama
6549816 nessun dio nessun uomo potrebbe darti ragione se tu continui a spargere il seme del desiderio tra le genti e poi a causa tua pretendi che amore faccia astinenza e chiudi la scuola dove sinsegnano certi vizietti che piacciono alle donne
6549817 cos quelle due dee per paura delle sue frecce e per propiziarselo di loro iniziativa presero le difese di cupido bench questi non fosse presente
6549818 ma venere indispettita perch le offese che aveva ricevute venivano prese poco sul serio volt loro le spalle e tutta risentita a rapidi passi prese la via del mare
6549819 intanto psiche vagava di qua e di l cercando con lanimo in pena giorno e notte il suo sposo
6549820 chiss che il mio signore non abiti l pens quando scorse un tempio sulla cima di unalta montagna
6549821 psiche con gran cura cominci a dividere e a mettere in ordine pensando giustamente che ella non dovesse trascurare nessun tempio e pratica religiosa ma anzi invocare la misericordia e la benevolenza di tutti gli dei
6549822 mentre tutta sollecita psiche era intenta a questo lavoro sopraggiunse cerere oh povera psiche esclam da lontano
6549823 allora psiche prostrandosi dinanzi alla dea e bagnando con copiose lacrime i suoi piedi e spazzando con i capelli la terra cominci a pregarla in mille modi a invocarne il soccorso
6549824 lascia chio mi nasconda fra questi covoni di spighe per pochi giorni soltanto finch non si plachi col tempo la collera terribile di una dea cos potente o almeno fino a quando io non riprenda con una breve sosta un po di forze sfinita come sono dopo un cos lungo peregrinare
6549825 mi commuovono le tue lacrime e le tue preghiere le rispose cerere e vorrei proprio aiutarti
6549826 cos contro ogni sua speranza psiche si vide respinta e delusa sent raddoppiare dentro langoscia
6549827 psiche cadde allora in ginocchio e asciugandosi gli occhi e abbracciando laltare ancora tepido cos preg
6549828 o sorella e sposa del grande giove sia che tu abiti nellantico santuario di samo la sola che pu vantarsi dei tuoi natali di aver sentito per prima i tuoi vagiti e daverti allevata o sia che tu ti indugi nella beata dimora delleccelsa cartagine che venera te vergine trascorrente nel cielo sul dorso di un leone o sia che tu protegga le mura di argo presso le rive dellinaco che da sempre ti chiama sposa del tonante e regina di tutte le dee tu che tutto loriente venera col nome di zigia e tutto loccidente con quello di lucina sii nella mia estrema sventura veramente giunone salvatrice e me sfinita da tutte le sofferenze patite libera dalla paura del pericolo che mi sovrasta
6549829 cos supplicava psiche e a un tratto le comparve davanti giunone in persona in tutta laugusta maest del suo nume
6549830 per la seconda volta psiche vide cos naufragare le sue speranze
6549831 quali altre strade mi restano incominci a pensare fra s quali rimedi ai miei mali se neppure delle dee hanno potuto aiutarmi nonostante le loro migliori intenzioni
6549832 cos pronta a una resa le cui conseguenze erano incerte o meglio portavano a una sicura rovina psiche rifletteva tra s come incominciare la supplica
6549833 intanto venere rinunciando a valersi per le sue ricerche di mezzi terreni decise di tornarsene in cielo e ordin che le fosse allestito il cocchio che vulcano lorafo insigne le aveva fabbricato con arte raffinata per offrirglielo come dono di nozze alla vigilia della prima notte
6549834 in corteo dietro il carro folleggiavano i passeri in lieta gazzarra e gli altri uccelli con canti modulati e con dolci gorgheggi annunziavano il suo arrivo
6549835 ella si diresse difilato al gran palazzo di giove e senza mezze misure chiese che per un suo progetto le fosse messo a disposizione mercurio il dio banditore
6549836 il nero sopracciglio di giove le disse di s e venere tutta trionfante lasci il cielo rivolgendosi con gran premura a mercurio che la seguiva
6549837 un bando come questo gridato da mercurio e il desiderio di guadagnarsi un premio simile eccit ogni uomo e tutti gareggiarono in zelo e questo tolse a psiche ogni ulteriore incertezza
6549838 mentre ella si avvicinava al palazzo di venere le venne incontro la consuetudine una delle schiave della dea che con tutta la voce che aveva in corpo cominci a investirla finalmente hai cominciato a capire che hai una padrona serva duna malora
6549839 e afferratala bruscamente per i capelli cominci a strascinarla senza che quella poveretta potesse minimamente reagire
6549840 quando venere se la vide portare davanti sbott in una sonora sghignazzata e scuotendo la testa come di solito fa chi ribolle dentro dalla rabbia e grattandosi lorecchio destro finalmente le grid ti sei degnata di venire a salutare tua suocera
6549841 e cos dicendo le si precipit addosso e cominci a lacerarle in mille brandelli la veste a strapparle i capelli a scuoterla per il capo a colpirla furiosamente
6549842 poi si fece portare dei chicchi di frumento dorzo di miglio semi di papavero ceci lenticchie e fave le mescol ne fece un gran mucchio e le disse sei una schiava cos brutta che a me pare tu non possa farti in alcun modo degli amanti se non a prezzo di un diligente servizio
6549843 psiche non ci prov nemmeno a metter mano in quel confuso inestricabile cumulo ma costernata dallenormit di quellordine se ne rimase in silenzio come imbambolata
6549844 sul far della notte venere torn dal banchetto un po brilla ma odorosa di balsami e con il corpo tutto inghirlandato di rose meravigliose
6549845 cupido intanto era stato isolato in una stanza tutta doro la pi interna del palazzo e tenuto sotto chiave sia perch con la sua sfrenata libidine non aggravasse la ferita sia perch non si incontrasse con la sua amata
6549846 ma quando laurora spinse innanzi i suoi cavalli venere chiamata psiche cos le ordin vedi quel bosco laggi che si stende fin sugli argini del fiume e i cui rami pi bassi quasi toccano lacqua e vi si specchiano
6549847 savvi di buon grado psiche non gi per eseguire quellordine ma per trovare rimedio ai suoi triboli precipitandosi da una rupe gi nel fiume ma dalla sponda una verde canna di quelle da cui si posson trarre le melodie pi soavi quasi fosse ispirata da un dio cos le parl nel lieve murmure della brezza leggera
6549848 cos quellumile canna umanamente indicava alla povera psiche la via della salvezza e questa non si pent di averle dato ascolto n indugi a seguire a puntino ogni istruzione tanto che le fu facile compiere il furto e tornare da venere addirittura con il grembo colmo di soffice lana doro
6549849 ma nemmeno questa seconda prova cos rischiosa per giunta le valse a cattivarsi il favore della sua padrona la quale aggrottando la fronte e sorridendo amaro cos le disse non che io non sappia chi sia stato lautore furfantesco anche di questa impresa ma voglio metterti ancora alla prova proprio per vedere se hai veramente tanta forza danimo e tanta saggezza
6549850 e psiche a rapidi passi e tutta in ansia si diresse alla cima del monte sicura che lass almeno avesse termine la sua infelicissima vita
6549851 a destra e a sinistra tra gli anfratti rocciosi orribili draghi strisciavano e rizzavano i lunghi colli sentinelle vigilanti dagli occhi sempre aperti dalle pupille eternamente spalancate alla luce
6549852 del resto quelle acque che erano parlanti da se stesse provvedevano alla loro difesa vattene
6549853 cos psiche rimase come impietrita nella sua impotenza presente col corpo ma lontana coi sensi schiacciata dallenormit di un pericolo senza via duscita e non le restava nemmeno lestremo conforto del pianto
6549854 ma le tribolazioni di quellanima innocente non sfuggirono allocchio attento della buona provvidenza
6549855 psiche con gioia prese lanforetta colma dacqua e di corsa la porta a venere
6549856 allora psiche comprese che per lei era davvero finita e si rese chiaramente conto che ormai la si voleva mandare a morte sicura
6549857 ascoltami poco lontano di qui c sparta la celebre citt della acaia cerca il promontorio del tenaro che non le distante anche se situato un po fuori mano
6549858 poco dopo arriverai al fiume dei morti a cui sta a guardia caronte il quale per traghettare sulla sua barca rattoppata quelli che vanno allaltra riva si fa pagare il pedaggio
6549859 a quel sordido vecchio darai per il pedaggio una delle monete che hai portato con te ma lascia che sia egli stesso con le sue mani a prenderla dalla tua bocca
6549860 attraversato il fiume poco pi oltre delle vecchie intente a tessere una tela ti pregheranno di dar loro una mano ma tu non farlo non toccare quella tela perch uninsidia di venere come tutto il resto per farti cadere dalla mano una delle due ciambelle
6549861 tu tienilo a bada gettandogli una delle due ciambelle cos potrai facilmente passare e giungere fino a proserpina che ti accoglier con cortesia e con benevolenza e ti inviter a sedere a tuo agio e a consumare un lauto pasto
6549862 tu per siederai per terra e chiederai soltanto un tozzo di pane e mangerai di quello poi le dirai il motivo della tua venuta e preso quanto ti verr dato tornerai indietro placherai la ferocia del cane con laltra ciambella darai allavaro nocchiero la monetina che avrai conservato e oltrepassato nuovamente il fiume ricalcherai le tue orme per rivedere questo nostro cielo con il suo coro di stelle
6549863 ma soprattutto ti raccomando una cosa non aprire la scatola che porterai con te non guardare dentro non essere curiosa non curarti di quel tesoro di divina bellezza che essa nasconde
6549864 cos quella torre provvidenziale assolse il suo profetico incarico e psiche non indugi raggiunse il promontorio del tenaro prese con s le monete e le ciambelle secondo le istruzioni ricevute discese lungo la strada infernale oltrepass senza dir parola lasinaio zoppo diede al nocchiero la moneta per il traghetto fu sorda al desiderio del morto che galleggiava non si cur delle insidiose preghiere delle tessitrici plac con la ciambella la rabbia spaventosa del cane e infine giunse alla dimora di proserpina
6549865 qui rifiut il morbido sedile e il cibo squisito che lospite le offerse ma sedette umilmente ai suoi piedi si content di un pane scuro poi rifer lambasciata di venere
6549866 e senza indugio prese la scatola in gran segreto riempita e sigillata fece tacere le bocche latranti del cane con linganno della seconda ciambella consegn al nocchiero la moneta che le era rimasta e risal dallinferno con passo assai pi leggero
6549867 ma dopo aver rivista e adorata questa candida luce bench avesse fretta di portare a buon fine il suo mandato fu assalita da unimprudente curiosit sono proprio una sciocca si disse porto con me la divina bellezza e non ne prendo nemmeno un pocolino non fossaltro per piacere di pi al mio bellissimo amante e detto fatto apr la scatola
6549868 ma dentro non vera nulla nessuna bellezza ma solo del sonno un letargo di morte che simpadron di lei non appena ella sollev il coperchio e che si diffuse per tutte le sue membra in una pesante nebbia di sopore facendola cadere addormentata proprio dove si trovava l sul sentiero
6549869 e psiche giacque immobile nel suo sonno profondo come morta
6549870 intanto cupido guarito ormai dalla ferita che sera rimarginata non sopportando pi a lungo la lontananza di psiche era fuggito da unaltissima finestra della stanza dove lo tenevano rinchiuso e volando pi veloce del solito sulle ali rinvigorite dal lungo riposo accorse dalla sua psiche
6549871 cupido dal canto suo divorato comera dalla passione e tutto preoccupato per quellimprovvisa castigatezza di sua madre che lo angosciava pens bene di ricorrere ai suoi espedienti e salito con le sue ali veloci sulla sommit del cielo si mise a supplicare il grande giove e a esporgli la sua situazione
6549872 ci detto ordin a mercurio di convocare subito tutti gli dei in assemblea e di avvisare che se qualcuno fosse mancato avrebbe pagato una multa di diecimila sesterzi
6549873 a tale minaccia il teatro celeste fu subito al completo e giove dallalto del suo seggio cos parl o dei iscritti nellalbo delle muse voi tutti certamente sapete che questo ragazzo lho cresciuto io stesso con le mie mani
6549874 weve got to send a clear message to russia and unify our allies
6549875 they cant charge into other countries of course it helps if we are leading by example on that point
6549876 the simplest and most necessary truths are often the last believed

6549879 epa should be evaluating the risks to bees before approving new pesticides but now refuses to tell the public what it knows pesticide restrictions might be at the heart of the solution to this growing crisis so why hide the information they should be using to make those decisions
6549880 the plane was rocking back and forth until i suspected it was going to fall
6549881 i saw people smoke explosions i think that is what woke me up because i had lost consciousness
6549882 i thought that if help did not arrive soon i would die
6549883 the plane would not fail to the point of causing a tragedy
6549884 most likely whatever the malfunction of the probe was it is probably not related to what happened
6549885 its not something that is a burden to them its not something to this group because they havent been part of every step along the way
6549886 this is a unique gathering of players and were just looking to the opportunity that we have so the past doesnt become an anchor for us in fact its probably more of a stimulant than anything
6549887 its the ultimate rugby experience its the ultimate rugby nation this is the place you come to test yourself and we know that well be tested seriously tested on the weekend
6549888 but we hope to do some testing of our own
6549889 i think the intensity and everyones mindsets are in good places so i think thats positive really positive
6549890 obviously its about building that intensity getting that mental build up right and then bringing it out on saturday in the test match
6549891 i think we found that certainly playing in the last test match a couple of weeks ago against new zealand that we knew they were going to come out to us with a fair bit of intensity and thats exactly what they brought
6549892 unfortunately we didnt match it so for us we feel that thats probably going to be the case again this time
6549893 they were a combat engineer reconnaissance team and they were at that point in time conducting a routine reconnaissance
6549894 they were on their way to the site where they were going to do the reconnaissance of a route thats going to be used for a future operation
6549895 i usually fare well at the us open but ill have my hands full thats for sure
6549896 this is an opportunity to discuss issues with the irb face to face
6549897 there are a number of technical matters wed like to raise but there are two issues we want to straighten out
6549898 wed like to discuss our request to meet referees in the company of opposition coaches before test matches and correct the suggestions that we have failed in our duties to provide refereeing reports to the irb
6549899 we have enormous sympathy for referees who in some cases have had to manage blowing as many as five different sets of laws this season
6549900 its only natural that wed want to talk to them about interpretations in such a complex environment
6549901 it travelling will always favour them australia and new zealand
6549902 they gain a day but we lose a day when we fly there then you also have to play for financial reasons on consecutive saturdays
6549903 we know we need to win both games with bonus points but again we wont be throwing the ball around all over in the game
6549904 as per the order of the supreme head of the armed forces on friday august 22 at 6am local time 1200 aest all russian forces will begin their withdrawal from georgian territory to south ossetia
