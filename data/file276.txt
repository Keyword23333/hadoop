2760005 what does ephialtes have to do with my father and why would leonidas choose him and eurytus to lead spartan troops we both know he was not a leader and had no ability to think beyond agression
2760006 youre right leonidas had no intention of seeing kirtanian and eurytus leading any spartan forces but he knew eurytus was ambitious and he liked the idea of being a leader as for your father he was the most spartan of spartans he would follow the orders and laws of sparta and his king even if it meant risking his life or his own personal glory he listened to leonidas because he was given orders and as a good soldier decided to respect them when i spoke to him later he knew he had been deceived and used by leonidas and he was abandoned and condemned by the same laws and orders he had always respected in the end his death at plataea was his way of saying he refused all spartan laws since sparta and his love and respect for its laws had branded him a trembler and had outcast him he was bitter but he died thumbing his nose at spartan rules
2760007 but why did eurytus turn back my father arrived in sparta alone and did not die with his companion why
2760008 there the story becomes a tale of two distinct visions of sparta that then entered into conflict
2760009 corydallus waited for my wound to mend and when i was recovered he asked me to join him beneath an olive tree to rest and to talk about my father
2760010 i was a young foolish man at the time i did not realize that true heroism is not doing what others expect of you but standing for someone or something despite the fact that it against the opinion of the majority your father did not deserve to suffer a year alone and he did not have to die in such a valiant but foolhardy way
2760011 all your talk is poetic and profound old man but my father is dead and he was labelled a
2760012 your father was not a great man i am not trying to say that he had many shortcomings and had a terrible temper but he was not the coward you think of him or sparta recalls he was betrayed by those he considered to be his companions and friends
2760013 it does not seem right for you to slander those who are no longer here to defend themselves we all know that my fathers dearest friend and companion eurytus walked back to the battlefield blind and was struck down he rather die than to return to sparta pantites hanged himself why did kirtanian such a mighty warrior decide to walk back as a coward to sparta
2760014 besides i am dorieus i have proved my valour more times than i care to remember kirtanian was my father yes but he was not a man i could admire and he has been a curse for me as you should know old man
2760015 your father returned because he was told to and as a good spartan he followed his orders leonidas had pity on him and eurytus because he knew that their eye infection was no infection at all pantites had your father and eurytus poisoned
2760016 what madness is this pantites was also sent off by leonidas to thessaly if i am not mistaken
2760017 yes he was but it was to punish him and rob him of the opportunity of dying amongst the men leonidas admired and upheld he had knowledge of pantites hatred of your father as a physician i can confirm that your father had been poisoned his strength saved him from death and total blindess like poor eurytus
2760018 i know that my father and pantites were rivals but it seems harsh that he would try to kill my father and eurytus before a battle they surely knew they all would die but even if that was true since i know that pantites had never forgotten my mother and had sworn to avenge himself in front of a multitude of spartans when kirtanian had beaten him in a wrestling match why did he return to sparta
2760019 because leonidas had given him a message to give to the council and to queen gorgo
2760020 a message but why did eurytus not return with my father to vouch for his story
2760021 before i can answer id like to tell you what your father told me of the final moments of the 300 spartans at thermopylae
2760022 they fought bravely and could have beaten ares himself with the inspiration of leonidas but leonidas heart was extremely heavy he had always trusted your father and eurytus and asked them to join him for a conversation a bit removed from the camp both companions were suffering from the effects of the poison and leonidas told him that he had punished pantites in the most horrific way he could imagine sending him far off far away from the battle and the chance to die as a true spartan
2760023 he then asked them to return to sparta which they of course refused leonidas asked a second time but did not intend it to be a request but a direct order they would return to sparta because leonidas wanted to remind the council that sparta had the obligation to lead the greek forces to victory over the persians and would not tolerate another humiliation like the battle of marathon where athens achieved an incredible victory when spartan troops were not sent to face the persians leonidas did not care for oracles or prophecies he had chosen his fate to achieve honor and glory for the spartans and to prove their valour to the athenians leonidas despised athens its democracy and its values he had to prove the superiority of spartan society and military culture but at that moment he felt ashamed because he had decided the fate of 300 men who would follow him to hades if commanded to achieve a political statement and despite his heroic spirit to appease his own vanity and pride
2760024 leonidas wanted the council to hurry its preparations to launch the spartan war machine into the battlefield before athens could achieve another victory over the medes he seemed to understand that the great athenian strategian themistocles would achieve another stunning victory like he did in marathon and leonidas was right the battle of salamis proved his point he also wanted the council to allow kirtanian to command a part of the spartan forces along with eurytus in any battle before athens could organize its defenses against the barbarian hordes
2760025 the message to queen gorgo your father never revealed to me because it was meant only for her ears unfortunately he never was able to talk to her since he was prohibited to talk to any spartan man woman or child the council was bitterly disappointed by leonidas criticism and his arrogance he wanted to determine spartan strategies despite the fact he had decided to martyr himself and his small force for in a sense his own selfish desires he had died a hero so the council could not affront him in front of the city but he was as guilty of not following the laws and the order of spartan life as much as kirtanian was on the day he died at plataea
2760026 this is an outrageous story corydallus even if what my father told you was true it still does not explain why he returned to sparta alone
2760027 there was an unforeseen event that changed the tide of the battle and the story of your fathers life the chance meeting with ephialtes the traitor

2760102 people associate food security with food production but im sure most of you arent growing your own food
2760103 youre travelling to the shops you need to have money to buy the food you need to have a fridge
2760104 food production is important but it also needs to be distributed and exchanged its also about affordability and the ability to buy food
2760105 but if we look at the details well see we cant make those kinds of assumptions
2760106 household one van schalks farm is actually quite vulnerable if you look at the fact that theyre a new fruit farm and they depend on exporting for their profitability so as the exchange rate changes their access to income changes as well
2760107 has no access to land but they have three family members working in the non farm services sector so can actually buy enough food to get by
2760108 might not be food insecure this year but next if there is a severe drought they might become highly food insecure
2760109 i heard a few weeks ago that five children die of malnutrition a day in south africa
2760110 with a huge impact on agriculture because thats where our maize basket is
2760111 in the next few weeks i will be taking to cabinet the long term mitigation scenario study which has been completed then it will be up to our cabinet to take some very necessary decisions
2760112 within two years of today we will be able to put on the table a regulatory a fiscal and a legislative package it will include a timetable for a rollout a policy as well as legislation i believe its possible
2760113 that said south africa feels very strongly that we have to do more we have to demonstrate integrity and we have to commit to building a low carbon economy its a huge ship to turn with huge economic implications but we believe we can do it its achievable
2760114 i believe our government will take the right decision and come that red letter day in 2009 south africa will be able to go to those negotiations with a credible case and an argument that will leave very little space for developed countries not to shoulder their historical responsibilities
2760115 we have just seen some new research that indicates a serious serious decline in the number of soil moisture days in south africa the days there is enough moisture and the temperature in the soil is ready for plant growth
2760116 the timing of the rainfall in relation to plant growth
2760117 we will see challenges to the way we manage health if we dont act decisively at a huge cost we will see an increase in malaria as an example moving into areas where we never had it before
2760118 we recently published research showing that if we have as is more than a possibility a rise in temperature of between 2 5 c and 3 c in mpumalanga the kruger national park we run the risk of seeing an extinction of two thirds of the animal species in the park
2760119 the changes will not only be in agriculture in health and protected areas management but also the way we construct roads bridges and buildings those are all challenges we have to address
2760120 that price gap is the challenge for us as a developing country and that is where we will have to make progress with more investment and the right kind of policy decisions
2760121 i believe the way to approach climate change is not to stoke fear but share with people what the challenges will be and also to tell people what possible solutions are available to us
2760122 what we are willing to commit ourselves to just as an example is to change that energy mix to push nuclear and renewables up to at least 27 percent of that energy mix
2760123 if your house is washed away and you have no insurance its very hard to rebuild your house and find the assets you had before you might need to spend money you might have spent on nutritious food on trying to find some shelter
2760124 unfortunately the poorer people usually spend a greater proportion of their income on the food basket so if prices rise theyll have even less to spend on things like education and health services people might also be more likely to go out and search for wild foods

2760126 when people think of an electric vehicle most think of a milk truck which is not exactly a high performance vehicle
2760127 took conventional ideas and turned them on their head if you look at every other hydrogen vehicle thats produced the size of the fuel cell is at least four times larger and the cost of the fuel cell is between 30 000 and 40 000 whereas ours is coming in at between 5 000 and 10 000
2760128 this has been a very interesting development as it was industry led
2760129 hopefully that doesnt look like a milk truck any more
2760130 less than one percent of the energy of the fuel is used to transport a person that gives you an idea of how much room youve got to improve things
2760131 the beauty of this one is that you can take an existing vehicle and do a very simple retrofit
2760132 the pressure of our numbers the abundance of our inventions the blind forces of our desires are generating a heat a hot brake on our civilisation how can we begin to restrain ourselves
2760133 pessimism is intellectually delicious even thrilling but the matter before us is too serious for mere self pleasuring
2760134 on our side we have rationality which finds its finest expression in good science and we have a talent for working together when it suits us are we at the beginning of an unprecedented era of international co operation or are we living in an edwardian dream of reckless denial
2760135 is this the beginning or the beginning of the end

2760147 truth honour and loyalty were not mere words to josh but the unspoken creed which he lived his life by
2760148 josh would be there for his friends at any time to lend a hand or to give them honest advice sometimes it was not the advice they wanted to hear but it was always the advice they needed
2760149 he was the kind guy that we would describe as the soldiers soldier

2760151 an investigation is being conducted to determine the details surrounding this incident
2760152 if you look at how much time kids spend watching television and movies versus how much time they spend outdoors or in the classroom concentrating on wildlife and nature nobody should be really surprised by the survey results
2760153 the message is just to get out and see wildlife its all around us
2760154 were trying to get people to understand that its not that complicated
2760155 we get our kicks from sitting in front of a screen rather than actually feeling something
2760156 its an illusion that we can replace real experiences with vicarious ones nature shows are great but they certainly cant replace spending time outside
2760157 wherever they go they rely a lot on the entertainment being provided for their kids
2760158 its intimidating for parents to go into an area where they may not be knowledgeable about the things they might see they dont want to look bad in front of their kids and where they need to create some of their own entertainment
2760159 current policies to tackle hiv aids in africa emphasise individual behaviour such as the abc approach to prevention abstain be faithful condomise however these measures require that people have hope for the future and goals to aim for and if wider economic and social circumstances are so poor that people lack hope for the future then these current policies will have limited success
2760160 hope is quite straightforward to measure via questionnaires and surveys can help to identify high risk environments
2760161 although there is not a great deal of experience in developing programmes to increase hope policies such as cash support for children microfinance for small businesses womens education reduced discriminations against sexual minorities and health system reform will improve the wider environment and with more to live for interventions to encourage individuals to change their behaviour are more likely to succeed
2760162 avoid the times when there have been really rancorous debates in the confirmation process
2760163 absolutely theres a lot of truth to what the president said and in terms of wall street there was too much leverage in the system and more leverage than was appropriate and more than people recognized because the leverage came into the system in the form of highly complex structured products which were difficult to understand
2760164 there is no question about it wall street got drunk
2760165 thats one reason i asked you to turn off your tv cameras
2760166 the question is how long will it take to sober up and not try to do all these fancy financial instruments
2760167 we have of course one priority getting through this period with as little damage as little negative impact as possible on the economy but the second part is to take steps to reduce the likelihood of these sorts of things happening in the future
2760168 we sized that program to say how could we do something that will be meaningful this year but not so big that it would jeopardize some of our long term priorities and our fiscal priorities and balancing the budget so again my view would be lets see how this program works in the third quarter
2760169 the attack near the georgian capital city came after a day of intense fighting in the former soviet republic with dozens of russian warplanes bombing civilian and military targets in georgia on saturday

2760246 jetzt wollen wir die griechen besiegen und dann schauen wir mal was passiert

2760270 i know our program manager is ranking captains on landing with less fuel i dont care to be ranked i think this is a safety problem and i believe fuel is your friend
2760271 looking back i would have liked more gas yesterday and i was already carrying tanker fuel if i wouldnt have had this extra there would have been real problems
2760272 far below my comfort zone and probably less than the minimum fuel required by the fars federal aviation regulations
2760273 our fuel situation had not become critical yet but had we had any delay i would have had to declare a fuel emergency
2760274 i am not sure if the flight plan as given to me by my company was a real flight plan or if they were just telling me it was so that i would continue to jfk thus saving them time and expense in the future if such a situation presents itself again i will divert to my initial destination regardless of what my company says i can do the safety of my crew far outweighs any financial burden to the company
2760275 this was probably the new fuel saving initiative by the company management to save money

2760310 i would hate to see our teachers and classrooms lose out on money because the state doesnt have enough revenue
2760311 i understand why legislators want to give people a break because the economy is down and people are hurting and cant afford the things they want to buy
2760312 but they arent taking into account what that revenue could later buy for the states
2760313 weve given them the benefit of the doubt for a long time

2760322 the amount a senior can borrow through a reverse mortgage has been increased to 417 000 nationally however that limit could be pushed to 625 000 if the borrower lives in a high housing cost area currently the amount a senior can borrow varies by county the range now is 200 160 to 362 790
2760323 the law reduces fees on this type of loan it cuts the origination fee to 2 percent of the first 200 000 borrowed and 1 percent for any amount after that the maximum origination fee cant exceed 6 000 the fee is currently capped at 2 percent of the loan limit or of the homes value the law does allow for the cap to adjust based on the annual percentage increase in the consumer price index
2760324 except for title hazard flood or other such insurance products
2760325 lenders are prohibited from requiring borrowers to purchase insurance annuities or other similar products as a condition for a reverse mortgage
2760326 the housing act includes a provision for reverse mortgages partly because of concerns that seniors were inappropriately and sometimes fraudulently being sold other financial products

2760343 we dont want to dwell on the skills where mistakes were done because it may create a mental problem
2760344 we will do the routines that we have prepared for and then reinforce and try to build more confidence
2760345 we had kind of a sigh of relief like we didnt die its all good

2760357 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2760358 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2760359 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2760360 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2760361 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2760362 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2760363 this has nothing to do with the preparations for the games
2760364 there is nothing funny in whats happening it is very sad whats going on in the world
2760365 i am a manager i am responsible for the games
2760366 personally i am rather optimistic that things will be solved
2760367 we are totally confident they are going to make magnificent games
2760368 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2760369 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2760370 upon receiving the recommendations of the iocs disciplinary commission the executive board has declared miss thanou ineligible to participate in the 2008 beijing olympic games
2760371 to send a firm signal of the iocs moral consideration that this case has brought the olympic movement very much into disrepute
2760372 this was the last act of a pre arranged decision a planned effort to stop me from competing and winning a medal for my country
2760373 this is an illegal decision that goes against any concept of equality equity and legality in the civilized world
2760374 it is these totalitarian practices and decisions that bring the sporting spirit and the olympic ideal that my country gave birth to into disrepute
2760375 this is an ioc ruling based on its olympic charter
2760376 there was a whole string of events that took place in this sorry tale they really resulted in what the ioc sees as a scandalous saga
2760377 the attacker resigned from his job he was jobless before he committed the crime
2760378 please accept my profound sympathy to you mr president and the family members of the victims the chinese side takes this unfortunate incident very seriously
2760379 the solution to the problem rests solely with the mauritanians we are going to help them to reach an agreement

2760384 we will offer a resolution today that makes clear that the russian actions in georgia are unacceptable to the international community and we condemn this military assault
2760385 well see whats in there then well know what to do
2760386 its too bad that the russians didnt leave the shooting to the olympic competition yesterday in which the russians and the
2760387 how much does it pain my heart and my soul to announce to the palestinian people the arab and islamic world and to everyone who loves peace and freedom the passing of the star of palestine
2760388 will leave a great void in our cultural political and national life
2760389 the whole world knew palestine by two names or two symbolic figures yasser arafat and mahmud darwish
2760390 now palestine is without a symbolic figure it has been orphaned just as poetry itself has today been orphaned by the passing of our poet
2760391 before anything mahmud darwish was a great poet who possessed real poetic power
2760392 he quickly became the national palestinian poet the poet of the exile and of the refugees
2760393 deprives the palestinians and all the arabs of one of their most noted representatives for contemporary poetry and culture
2760394 with his poetry darwish transcended all the frontiers and broke the chains of narrow patriotism in order to become the voice of palestine
2760395 his poetic masterpieces advocated the just cause of the palestinian people and expressed their aspirations
2760396 my big dream is to have unity among the bolivian people
2760397 i am feeling good happy because this is going to let us accelerate even more our process for autonomy

2760404 im not sure that christianity can be regarded as being responsible for the abolition of slavery or under age chimney sweeps christianity was popular way before the latter of those examples slavery is morally reprehensible to anyone with an ounce of empathy religion has nothing to do with it
2760405 also with the young earth thing its not that she refused to say why she believed the earth is 4k years old we all know why people think that it was her denial of carbon dating that made me chuckle
2760406 it seems to me that there are several possible to understanding bells throw away lines one is that he is theologically ignorant which i doubt two these really are throw away lines and bell does not realise what he is saying but his work is too well crafted for that thirdly and most likely bell is trying to reinvent the historic language of the christian faith
2760407 georgia expresses its readiness to immediately start negotiations with the russian federation on cease fire and termination of hostilities

2760426 the emergence of order on a global scale through interactions on a local scale
2760427 there is a population of actors and the interactions always entail a number of actors that is considerably smaller than the total number of actors in the population this is what is meant by interaction on a local scale
2760428 behaviour that cannot be predicted directly from the behaviours of indvidual actors in a system but is caused by interaction between actors and or their environment is referred to as emergent behaviour or emergence
2760429 when emergent behaviour involves many indviduals and results in regulat collective behaviour then it is referred to as self organising
2760430 for self organising to happen there must be positive feedback between the behaviour of individuals small fluctuations in individuals must be amplified and adopted by other individuals for a pattern to spread through the population
2760431 emergent phenomena arise in social systems as a consequence of self reinforcing effects which imply that if an event takes place it increases the likelihood that it will happen again
2760432 in animal societies collective decisions and patterns emerge thorugh self organised processes from a variety of interactions among indviduals the rules specifying these interactions are executed using only local information without reference to the global pattern therefore collective decisions can be made that at the individual level require omnly limited cognitive abilities and partial knowledge of the environment
2760433 most self organised decisions and patterns arise as a result of a competition between different sources of information that are amplified trhough positive feedback

2760439 jeez kevin calling you an asshole would be a huge understatement wouldnt it
2760440 you are beautiful just as you are dont be afraid
2760441 i was shocked they were so cool and so proud of being native canadians
2760442 i realized that i have a beautiful culture and strong roots i decided that i should be a proud ainu and express that in my life
2760443 they felt that backwardness had been mapped onto their bodies
2760444 these young people are trying to overcome nasty historical baggage by creating positive self images through music and dance
2760445 young people are more aware of japans multicultural makeup but its still pretty shallow
2760446 japan is behind other nations in this way even though it claims to be an advanced economic power
2760447 being indigenous cant be cut off from issues related to the land
2760448 some people say you can have an identity as ainu but we japanese dont know what we can be proud of
2760449 there is a growing acceptance that farming and rural development is the key if africans are to break free from hunger and poverty
2760450 up to 80 per cent of africans rely on agriculture for their livelihoods it must be at the heart of what we do
2760451 at self help africa we are committed to providing communities across the continent with the skills and the very basic resources so that they can adapt to these challenges
2760452 in a lot of different ways i think theres been an awakening perception
2760453 i want to investigate the possibility of re naming the luas bridge after seamus and see what procedures are involved
2760454 seamus built up dundrum to what it is today and he also had a massive influence on the luas project and transport infrastructure in general across dublin and the rest of the country
2760455 in fact seamuss resting place in st naghis cemetery near his home in dundrum is fittingly overlooked by the bridge
2760456 seamus was a doer and was never afraid to roll up his sleeves
2760457 seamus was a co galway native but he made dundrum his home and he was very proud of the local community and its achievements
2760458 they brought me in for a private meeting of about 40 minutes and the taoiseach was very understanding of my situation as a family man
2760459 they couldnt make a specific commitment that i would find a school to take casey but they said they would try to do something for me in the five weeks left before schools open
2760460 i am a bit more hopeful now that i know the head of the government might be able to push some buttons but it shouldnt take bringing a placard to an official function to be making progress if schools were properly resourced to deal with kids like casey there would be no problem
2760461 it was upsetting for casey being with me last week when i bought a new uniform for his brother because hes wondering if hes ever going back to school himself and then he worries if hell make friends at any new school he does finally get into
2760462 miche l martin told me this would get the go ahead at the earliest
2760463 the problem was first noticed by the teachers union of ireland who had received some startling feedback from their members concerning the fashions of their students with whom they are in touch with on a daily basis of course
2760464 as the problem worsened we knew we would have to step in we hope this report and campaign will change things but we all know kids just do the opposite of everything we say so probably what well have to do is ban the mullet altogether thus giving the garda more power to harass youngsters who adopt it well just let the guards beat the shit out of the kids and then cut their hair down at the station
2760465 we basically set up a group whose job it was to fund comedians to tell jokes about the mullet david letterman jay leno all used their shows as a platform to diss the mullet while we also commissioned thousands of books to be printed showcasing the variety and stupidity of the haircut
2760466 we also found great success after we hired rap group the beastie boys to record a song mullethead further mocking the style the unrelenting black propaganda campaign against the mullet had the effect of wiping out the hairstyle in the north and western states particularly in urban areas we just managed to push the mullet back to the south once we got it confined to those states it was no longer a national problem
2760467 cowens rickety leadership future is hanging on by a thread
2760468 goresbridge lost its secondary school three years ago and the local community have worked diligently since then on a voluntary basis in planning a major community sports facility on the site of that school
2760469 the local community was prepared to co fund this project along with gov
2760470 this government has devoted a lot of time to talking about community volunteerism here we had a fine example of community volunteerism at its best and the government simply gives them a slap in the face
2760471 i am very disappointed that a voluntary project of this size and importance to the local community re ceived absolutely nothing in last weeks allocation one would have to ask why has fianna fail ignored goresbridge
2760472 it was particularly dis appointing that gaa clubs like skeoughvosteen and glenmore were also ignored
2760473 these clubs like all sports clubs are doing tremendous work for their communities
2760474 goresbridge has to be given priority in order to fight back after losing its only secondary school
2760475 so much for the political influence of the four government tds in carlow kilkenny
2760476 especially in difficult times we should remember the great value of the arts to society but also to employment to our communities to education to the economy and in particular to tourism
2760477 kevin whelan reminds us that the artist undertakes important work on our behalf generating new ideas and imagining ways in which the world can be different new realities for example innovation in the sciences social improvements or positive political change have to exist first in the imagination the artist creates these imaginative possibilities for us
2760478 if you dont have art you dont have a pathway from the past and the current to the future
2760479 the fusion of memory and art makes us heirs of the past and its utopian possibilities the promise of a historical event is always more than what actually happened there is more in the past than what happened at any given point in time multiple trajectories toward the future were open
2760480 art can restore this openness to the past and thereby nourish the utopian instinct by restoring lost opportunities and redeeming betrayed possibilities
2760481 the fundamental task of the artist is the retrieval of traces the rescuing of voices the expansion of the archive the artist is ultimately a witness who provides testimony and whose ethical position depends on trust trust in the word of another
2760482 to play the world number two in the world in your first game in the olympics and come away with a 2 2 draw we are to a degree satisfied
2760483 we knew that we had to bring our best game and we thought after defending so well on the penalty corners that argentina were getting maybe we couldve caused an upset yes i will take the point but we have some work to do
2760484 we knew coming in we were going to have to be on our game from the beginning
2760485 i think we were a little on the back foot to start and argentina made us pay for that
2760486 our team is known to persist and persist throughout the game regardless of the time i think we dug deep
2760487 i think once we got into the flow of the game and the speed and the intensity we were able to string some passes together
2760488 we missed some opportunities on the attacking end but overall with our persistence we knew we were able to get to a higher level and once we were at that point we executed
2760489 but i think the moment of her hundredth game and her first game in the olympics and knowing shes worked extremely hard to get to this point its come to fruition today
2760490 we had it won five minutes before the end of the match
2760491 the number of penalty corners and penetration into the attacking circle we had more than the usa thats why im not happy we made some mistakes in the defense
2760492 das war ein guter auftakt aber auch ein pflichtsieg wenn wir ins viertelfinale kommen wollen
2760493 jetzt wollen wir die griechen besiegen und dann schauen wir mal was passiert
2760494 das war berragend einfach super vor allem was chris unter den k rben veranstaltet hat
2760495 es ist doch ein ganz anderes gef hl bei der gr ten sportveranstaltung der welt dabei zu sein
2760496 i would rather entertain and hope that people learned something than educate people and hope they were entertained
2760497 the skunk was developed as part of polices efforts to develop non lethal means and avoid irreversible physical damage
2760498 if sharon had stood trial there would have been no disengagement
2760499 if russia is serious about its peacekeeping role in the region it will do no more than push georgian forces out of south ossetia and attempt to return to the status quo before fighting broke out last week
2760500 it could bar russian navy ships from returning to their base in the crimea
2760501 ukraine reserves the right to bar ships which may take part in these actions from returning to the ukrainian territory until the conflict is solved
2760502 the ukrainian government which has been enthusiastically arming georgian troops from top to bottom was in fact encouraging georgia to attack and carry out ethnic cleansing in south ossetia
2760503 bukannya islam benarkan kronisme apatah lagi untuk mempertikaikan apa yang dikatakan

2760508 whats most interesting about the article is that warner bros executives either arent talking much about creating original content for the internet the reporter didnt ask or the info simply didnt wind up in the story instead it sounds like warner bros is mainly focused on using the internet to distribute movies and tv shows theyre also a bit obsessed like all studios with stopping digital piracy
2760509 what about new ways of creating content while the dark knight is going to be one of the biggest big budget hits of all time there
2760510 so how do you get your movie sold on itunes its not easy and apple doesnt make things any easier by supplying official information to filmmakers whod like to sell their work on itunes by contrast heres createspaces of how to sell your work on amazon unbox the best non itunes option that exists today heres the scoop apples strategy thus far has been to only work with aggregators or services that will collect a number of indie films and then deliver them to itunes they dont want to work directly with filmmakers but there is no aggregator yet that will take just any finished film and deliver it to itunes in the same way createspace which is owned by amazon will take any finished film and sell it on amazon unbox
2760511 the very essence of islam is there is only one god and that god is god
2760512 i always believed that and muhammad is the messenger the very last messenger
2760513 when you choose that word its equivalent is saying no church or no synagogue
2760514 when they chose to use that word its hard to feel that there wasnt some kind of prejudice
2760515 im amazed that you can think were doing anything less than noble

2760517 dah mama amp baba i know my limits how dare you joke
2760518 mama is tired she needs a time out meaning time by myself
2760519 baba had a bad day today i heard him on the phone with work
2760520 i think the trend in stocks is up i do feel that july 15 represented the bottom for stocks and we are going to move higher
2760521 i really feel that what investors are looking for right here is signs that the economy is starting to pick up right now
2760522 it looks like we are finally getting the break weve been waiting for in terms of slowing down the inflation spiral that has been taking place
2760523 you have a tremendous rise in the dollar and thats putting pressure on crude oil which is helping to buoy u s equity markets
2760524 clearly the economy is still weak some of the stimulus from the tax rebates is
2760525 once you go above 6 percent the concerns about recession will go up
2760526 look at the prices of food around the world its unfair to look at just the price of oil as the leading indicator of where inflation trends may be
2760527 theres strong likelihood that the fed is going to have to start to raise interest rates to control inflation
2760528 for a long term investor id advocate slowly going back into commodities right now gold will be my favorite recommendation
2760529 no no definitely there has to be a very clear timeline
2760530 the talks are still ongoing theres been a great deal of progress the deal is very close it is about to be closed
2760531 absolutely theres a lot of truth to what the president said and in terms of wall street there was too much leverage in the system and more leverage than was appropriate and more than people recognized because the leverage came into the system in the form of highly complex structured products which were difficult to understand
2760532 there is no question about it wall street got drunk
2760533 thats one reason i asked you to turn off your tv cameras
2760534 the question is how long will it take to sober up and not try to do all these fancy financial instruments
2760535 we have of course one priority getting through this period with as little damage as little negative impact as possible on the economy but the second part is to take steps to reduce the likelihood of these sorts of things happening in the future
2760536 we sized that program to say how could we do something that will be meaningful this year but not so big that it would jeopardize some of our long term priorities and our fiscal priorities and balancing the budget so again my view would be lets see how this program works in the third quarter
2760537 ill salut to that buddy we dont have to worry about you at all

2760541 things not going as i had planned and thus it was not as fun as i had hoped
2760542 the children you abuse today could become the monsters of tomorrow
2760543 how did george w bush go from alcoholic bum to the most powerful figure in the world
2760544 his saying he is going to be fair to bush is like donald trump saying he is going to be modest
2760545 if i remember correctly you didnt like the sporting goods job working in the investment firm wasnt for you either or the oil rig job you didnt exactly finish up with flying colours in the air national guard junior what are you cut out for partying chasing tail driving drunk what do you think you are a kennedy youre a bush act like one
2760546 history is going to be very tough on bush that doesnt mean he isnt a great story its almost capra esque the story of a guy who had limited talents in life except for the ability to sell himself the fact that he had to overcome the shadow of his father and the weight of his family name you have to admire his tenacity

2760554 id like to stuff a plate of freedom fries down that slick piece of shits throat
2760555 it leaves you with the impression that the white house is run as a fraternity house with no reverence for hierarchy the office itself or the implications of policy
2760556 everybody calling everybody else nicknames and chatting about going to war as if they were chatting about how to bet on a football game the notion that his schedule is driven by whats on espn the cable sports channel is ridiculous
2760557 jfk was a case to be proven nixon was a penetrating biography of a complex and dark man but im not bound by those strictures any more bush is not a complex and dark man so its different this movie can be funnier because bush is funny hes awkward and goofy and makes faces all the time hes not your average president so lets have some fun with it what are they going to do discredit me again
2760558 as a symbol of the things we are fighting to preserve free thought and free expression of a free people

2760638 ive worked on a federal judge a heart surgeon and police from time to time
2760639 a few years ago i could look at a persons tattoo and tell you who did it
2760640 anymore its hard to tell some of the best artists in the country are in rapid city
2760641 actually ive worked in shops that change their hours and work seven days a week
2760642 that just makes it no fun i ride and enjoy the rally
2760643 theres a guy from california who walked in last year and couldnt get in so he booked in may this year
2760644 we like people to come and visit i think they get a better tattoo when the artist has time to think how theyre going to approach the piece
2760645 i just like to focus on what im good at i dont have an ego that would prevent me from sending them to another artist that would enjoy it more than i would
2760646 it seems that locals want tattoos during the rally because of the atmosphere
2760647 you never know when theyre going to show up part of the lifestyle i guess
2760648 anything the customer wants if its not a challenge ill make it a challenge
2760649 therere too many variables you can sit around all day and say i wont do this or that but then the right person comes in i dont want to go back on what i said
2760650 we plan our meals here so were not driving around in the day
2760651 if you want to survive youve got to do good work
2760652 theres big names in this industry but theres kids in small towns everywhere that could tattoo circles around them
2760653 any smaller venue youre going to have better artists in a big city its easier to hide in the crowd
2760654 you bring your lunch and you work your ass all day
2760655 precipitous decline in the fruition of the company and the conscious destruction of its entrepreneurial culture
2760656 uh oh someone washed their hands doctors wash their hands nicole is the mole
2760657 ok audience n20 is a gas that doctors sometimes use during delivery of a baby so this means our whiney doctor
2760658 you have to admit all camps have had a tough time tying everything in the journal back to their mole pick
2760659 omg craig is so cute well his favorite color is red his life goal is to run his own business he doesnt like grapes

2760665 one distinguishing feature of seals is that is often overlooked is that he was great at both rhythm and lead guitar

2760669 renowned palestinian poet mahmoud darwishs family would like to see him laid to rest in the western galilee village of al jadida family members told ynet sunday
2760670 the first time he hit me on the cup and then there was another blow after that in around the same place
2760671 with the crowd all around me it felt like i was getting smaller and smaller
2760672 eventually i could feel myself coming around the bout and getting back into it
2760673 i would hate to see our teachers and classrooms lose out on money because the state doesnt have enough revenue
2760674 i understand why legislators want to give people a break because the economy is down and people are hurting and cant afford the things they want to buy
2760675 but they arent taking into account what that revenue could later buy for the states
2760676 weve given them the benefit of the doubt for a long time
2760677 a sales tax free weekend will be welcomed more than ever in this tough economy especially with the high prices of food and fuel
2760678 it is certainly worth it when you consider the positive impact on retail sales and consumer confidence
2760679 theres just something about a sales tax holiday thats different from a regular sale
2760680 there are a lot of families out there struggling to make ends meet and theyre having to stretch their dollars
2760681 while the 5 percent or so savings doesnt sound like a lot that could be a make or break
2760682 its the same sort of family that collects coupons for the grocery store that waits for tax holidays to shop
2760683 the sales tax holiday is really more of a political gimmick than good economic policy
2760684 removing lead ammunition is not only right for condors it is right for other scavengers and it is right for hunters and their families
2760685 that one might argue that they constitute little more than outdoor zoo populations
2760686 poisoning from ingestion of spent ammunition in carcasses is so severe and chronic
2760687 that condor recovery cannot be achieved so long as such lead exposure continues
2760688 vision boards are the perfect technique in your law of attraction tool kit to use in life planning business creation and to strengthen the ties of family and love relationships
2760689 everyone thinks theyre going to get the photograph of the century
2760690 the bad guys are getting exceptionally good at automating those attacks
2760691 well have to see if we played technique really really well
2760692 i think we flew around and had a lot of energy and enthusiasm
2760693 the major thing is that this year i had to come back and prove i can be a guy we can go to big plays jump balls running after the catch
2760694 so far i have shown the coaches i can do that
2760695 if you dont feel that you played well as a unit typically youre not dominating people up front
2760696 we came out a little shaky the first couple of series
2760697 we were kind of looking at each other like were better than this we knew what we were doing we werent confused by anything we just werent getting it done
2760698 three oss from corporate kings in their towers of glass
2760699 if you dont have pedicures at least every two weeks dont talk to me if you dont floss every night and morning and brush at least twice a day dont talk to me if you dont spend money on you hair and get great cuts and color dont talk to me if you are heavy dont talk to me if you dont shower every morning and take a nice bubble bath every night dont talk to me if you dont have a loved one in your arms dont talk to me if you dont keep an immaculate house dont talk to me if you dont work dont talk to me
2760700 no man in history including jesus christ has directly revealed to the world the satanic weapon used to enslave mankind intellectual thought
2760701 they thought i was fair game i was an instrument of purpose to achieve their desires and not 100 percent real and also that they had me by the short curlies because i thought that the world revolved around them and therefore i think that i am fair game and rightly so if they want to play dirty i get to too its not a one way street i will use the physcial strength that i have over them my superior 4
2760702 you would no longer be here if i were to stop praying for you
2760703 you should see what she he and tattoo have been saying in alt music michael jackson for years now granted some of those turds over there deserve it like justin pugh and pam whatshername but roofie and tattoovamp have zero room to be name calling and throwing stones they both live in the same glass condominium i and brandy live in
2760704 but now the end is near now mark foley comes along and is making
2760705 in fact jesus said something about that i do believe
2760706 knock it off already with the warmongering and the hating of each other and lets all get some wine and party like its 2012
2760707 i am the only one who has outer filthed ward
2760708 if you write a letter to the editor attacking bush you could be deemed as purposefully and materially supporting hostilities against the united states if you organize or join a public demonstration against iraq or against the administration the same designation could befall you one dark comedy aspect of the legislation is that senators or house members who publicly disagree with bush criticize him or organize investigations into his dealings could be placed under the same designation in effect congress just gave bush the power to lock them up
2760709 when i told abbie hoffman that he was the first one who made me laugh
2760710 a demonstration should turn you on not turn you off
2760711 and thats another mistake on your part your playing games on usenet and im not playing it has nothing to do with impressing you it has more to do with making sure you have the education youll need to debate the debate is no fun for me if you are mentally incapable of it im giving you an opportunity to educate yourself thats all
2760712 we are most nearly ourselves when we achieve the seriousness of the child at play
2760713 no man ever steps in the same river twice for its not the same river and hes not the same man
2760714 immorality the morality of those who are having a better time
2760715 my own opinion even speaking as a woman is that no more female input should be allowed in establishing and enforcing the rules and regulations of a men group if this is to be a haven for men to discuss mens issues then women shouldnt be designing the room and painting it pink and putting up lace curtains and a lot of frilly doilies jmo
2760716 f ck moderation free speech is a masculinist proverb and thats what
2760717 the more you think the more you remain unaware confused
2760718 dustin is filth in my opinion and not for any reason other than posting rhondas personal info

2760723 its hard to conceive that it would take more forces to provide stability in post saddam iraq than it would take to conduct the war itself
2760724 the oil revenue of that country could bring between 50 and 100 billion dollars over the course of the next two or three years were dealing with a country that could really finance its own reconstruction and relatively soon
2760725 i expect we will get a lot of mitigation but it will be easier after the fact than before the fact
2760726 to assume were going to pay for it all is just wrong
2760727 a global art project using art to heal the world found art is a community of members who believe creative sharing is a way of sharing souls found art has been inspired by the idea of random acts of kindness
2760728 a united world is a we the world pass it on website filled with innovative unique fundraising programs that were designed by wtw volunteer mentors and wtw charity consultants all of these fundraising for a better world programs are run by volunteers financing their own pass it on programs to help others
2760729 an online group of men women and children who joined together from all corners of the earth to make the internet a better place they send cards sign guestbooks amp send little notes of encouragement to others in an attempt to show a little kindness
2760730 the mission of the wkm is to inspire individuals towards greater kindness and to connect nations to create a kinder world
2760731 its a pain to play without the symbol on the shirt because it imposes respect were five times champions of the world and we carry that on our chest
2760732 i would hate to see our teachers and classrooms lose out on money because the state doesnt have enough revenue
2760733 i understand why legislators want to give people a break because the economy is down and people are hurting and cant afford the things they want to buy
2760734 but they arent taking into account what that revenue could later buy for the states
2760735 weve given them the benefit of the doubt for a long time
2760736 a sales tax free weekend will be welcomed more than ever in this tough economy especially with the high prices of food and fuel
2760737 it is certainly worth it when you consider the positive impact on retail sales and consumer confidence
2760738 theres just something about a sales tax holiday thats different from a regular sale
2760739 there are a lot of families out there struggling to make ends meet and theyre having to stretch their dollars
2760740 while the 5 percent or so savings doesnt sound like a lot that could be a make or break
2760741 its the same sort of family that collects coupons for the grocery store that waits for tax holidays to shop
2760742 the sales tax holiday is really more of a political gimmick than good economic policy
2760743 absolutely theres a lot of truth to what the president said and in terms of wall street there was too much leverage in the system and more leverage than was appropriate and more than people recognized because the leverage came into the system in the form of highly complex structured products which were difficult to understand
2760744 there is no question about it wall street got drunk
2760745 thats one reason i asked you to turn off your tv cameras
2760746 the question is how long will it take to sober up and not try to do all these fancy financial instruments
2760747 we have of course one priority getting through this period with as little damage as little negative impact as possible on the economy but the second part is to take steps to reduce the likelihood of these sorts of things happening in the future
2760748 we sized that program to say how could we do something that will be meaningful this year but not so big that it would jeopardize some of our long term priorities and our fiscal priorities and balancing the budget so again my view would be lets see how this program works in the third quarter
2760749 a whirlwind of moods and thoughts captured by some of the biggest talents on the essay and blog beat another fresh collection of exemplary essays from a wide range of authors and sources
2760750 we are the last domestic manufacturer of our type of product
2760751 its been said new york has barneys and denver has rockmount
2760752 we feel we exemplify whats special about denver and we get visitors from all over the world
2760753 he does what he likes and he loves what he does
2760754 i liken my grandfather to shirts what henry ford is to cars
2760755 iraq and china are keen to show their cooperation by finalizing an agreement on developing the ahdab oil field
2760756 im well aware of the argument about singling out oil companies rather than soda pop manufacturers
2760757 i think oil companies are amoral they want to make as much money as they can for their shareholders which is what corporations do
2760758 the difference is the nature of the kind of outsized profits they make that may have no relationship to their investments or their production the fact for example the shortage of refinery capacity could actually increase their profits so the less they invest the more they make indicates that you are not dealing with someone making widgets out there
2760759 o brasil errou muito principalmente nos contra ataques teremos que melhorar para as pr ximas partidas

2760761 o ronaldinho merece ele um craque e uma grande pessoa
2760762 o ronaldinho sempre foi o meu dolo e de repente me vi dividindo o apartamento com ele na sele o brasileira fiquei impressionado com a sua simplicidade n o parecia que ele era o maior jogador do mundo
2760763 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
2760764 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
2760765 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
2760766 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
2760767 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
2760768 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
2760769 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
2760770 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
2760771 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
2760772 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
2760773 liberals want illegal aliens and felons to vote they benefit from such rampant fraud
2760774 theres a line between you know true reality and reality thats entertaining
2760775 were using things said at different times put together to imply a statement or observation that may not have been succinctly demonstrated
2760776 shows dont want to call the writers writers because they want to maintain the illusion that it is reality
2760777 as soon as you start pulling those seconds out you change the reality some people on the show when all is said and done will say they werent fairly represented and thats a truth of this format this is not reality this is entertainment
2760778 if youve created a response beforehand or given them a script of how to respond that would probably be crossing the line the fundamental compact with viewers is youre watching people behaving spontaneously
2760779 reality tvs staying power renders an investigation of its relationship to truth and authenticity even more urgent
2760780 its going to be in the orchards and its going to bear some wonderful fruit

2760790 senator mccain continues to be stubbornly committed to the bush administration position of an indefinite military presence in iraq despite the fact that the iraqi government is calling for a timeline despite the fact that the iraqis are sitting on tens of billions in oil surplus while our economy is struggling at home despite the impact on our troops and despite the deteriorating situation in afghanistan
2760791 not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure
2760792 it will be notional and aspirational dates but it will be based on conditions i know that

2760800 in the first minute of an invasion by the enemy 11 000 rockets and cannons would be fired at enemy bases
2760801 we will develop missile technology including completely new strategic nuclear complexes the work is continuing and continuing successfully

2760805 god is with you all day every day all the way
2760806 theres nothing to worry about when god is what its all about
2760807 there is true freedom in christ free to live free to love free to sing free to dance
2760808 rules say you have to love says you want to
2760809 there are two types of christians those who are sold out those who are hold outs
2760810 its not about the place or the race but about god who bestows his grace
2760811 yeah we get knocked down but we dont get knocked out
2760812 stop looking down and worrying about the details look up
2760813 god doesnt need perfection just a devoted heart striving in his direction
2760814 a long term missionary family was coming back after many years serving god in a warzone
2760815 why dont we get a welcome home parade weve been out there just as long as they have
2760816 david sees what others dont and refuses to see what they do
2760817 he sees the giant mind you he just sees god more so

2760915 portlands tone wrangler aaron davis aka acre has been blasting the world with his massive but barely there feedback swells for quite some time with releases on black horizons jk and more his first lp offering brings about the acre essence quite well massive walls of shoe gazed feedback are some how tamed into smooth quintessential drones this is not the sound of synthesizers or keyboards but a single tone being modified and replicated into a monolithic piece stasis so strong it is hard to realize the power of these two side long tracks until they end forcing silence back upon the listener direct hypnosis and transcendental zoning

2760950 of course the president bears the ultimate responsibility but he was very badly served by both the vice president and most of all the secretary of defense
2760951 look weve got to get everybody on board in order to get progress made in this country im not going to you know take retaliation or retribution against anybody whether theyre democrats or republicans
2760952 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
2760953 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
2760954 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
2760955 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
2760956 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
2760957 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
2760958 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
2760959 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
2760960 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
2760961 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
2760962 liberals want illegal aliens and felons to vote they benefit from such rampant fraud
2760963 why dont we split this book into 2 or more smaller books

2761003 the coolpix p6000 looks like a very sweet camera the advanced controls the built in gps and the ethernet port are just the features im looking for in an advanced compact but if nikon is arrogant enough to not let me access my own camera raw data except through a system that makes me a hostage of both nikon bad and microsoft worse i think ill pass on this one
2761004 personally im disappointed in nikons coolpix efforts since the 8800 and the p6000 actually increases that disappointment my advice is to look at the ricoh gx 200 and the panasonic lx 3 if you want a quality compact camera in the near term both have true raw support both are excellent photographer centric cameras and with care using raw conversion both produce fine results at low iso values looks like i need a new coolpix bumper sticker to add to my collection skip the p6000

2761020 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
2761021 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
2761022 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
2761023 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
2761024 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
2761025 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
2761026 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
2761027 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
2761028 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
2761029 liberals want illegal aliens and felons to vote they benefit from such rampant fraud
2761030 board leadership should pursue the best interest of the state and not pursue their own personal agenda
2761031 avoid the times when there have been really rancorous debates in the confirmation process

2761037 there are red button issues and im daring enough to touch them if youre sexist or homophobic you will passionately hate my vision
2761038 the roman catholic family can be described today as dysfunctional toxic or abusive
2761039 for decades we have allowed the men who claim to be our shepherds to abuse us
2761040 theyre concerned about the path of the church and where hes leading them
2761041 a lot of the old parishioners dont consider the new ones parishioners at all
2761042 our fight was about property but never about religion the people who have come here since then are here for different reasons where are they taking this church
2761043 theres a group of parishioners who have been there a long time and who dont like change
2761044 they are not very fond of us who are not polish
2761045 to break the rules important to them but not stand up for the ideals and beliefs he has himself
2761046 if you hire someone who doesnt follow along the dotted line
2761047 you cant expect him to follow it when you want him to
2761048 i think its worth it to keep him there because who else are we going to get as a priest
2761049 we dont have six other priests knocking on our door asking to get in there
2761050 we need food to eat cars to drive places to live
2761051 if the hypothetical happens and if the people elect a bishop and thats the way it should be done then whomever is asked by the people to be bishop should do it

2761082 we arent bothering them we are simply trying to vote and these people are breaking missouri state statutes preventing us from voting
2761083 look you are breaking their rules if you dont get out of here we are going to arrest you

2761088 uhhh with all due respect officer i feel that if i did so i would be betraying my own conscience and setting a bad precedent for all those citizens who share my right to vote

2761094 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2761095 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2761096 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2761097 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2761098 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2761111 we were very close to being in the quarterfinals and now we are very far
2761112 before the game nobody gave us a chance and i think we played pretty good you can look at his as half empty or half full
2761113 when i scored that goal we went and picked it up
2761114 when i came in they said they werent sure and so i said ill take it
2761115 you just blast it on goal and see where it lands
2761116 beijing is a safe city but unfortunately we are not immune to violent acts

2761120 we really felt the loss as one of our own
2761121 maybe thats why it hurts so much it hit so close

2761124 i would be very direct with russian president vladimir putin that these actions will have consequences long term in terms of our relationship with russia and it is in violation of the norms of international conduct

2761134 the linux os in the form of moblin limo and maemo looks ready to take the lions share of the mid market
2761135 and is set to capture unit volumes of 50 millions units per annum in 2013
2761136 the concept of a single os that covers mids smartphones and mid tier devices is very attractive indeed
2761137 in reality only limo and potentially moblin hold the possibility of achieving this
2761138 after that russia has sent its paratroopers but the attack was again repelled and about 60 troopers have been killed
2761139 the technology is becoming easier and cheaper and anybody can do it and at the same time theres more incentive now to do it

2761144 this whole affair has been a moving feast from the time it was first mentioned but there is a potential impact from all this on 15 other counties not just kent
2761145 we are only in the firing line so to speak because we managed to reach the final but any other of the first class counties could be going through this and instead of us facing up to the implications of what appear to be pretty major inconsistencies
2761146 the matter is not yet closed as far as we are concerned we are in constant touch with the ecb who are sympathetic to our case and we are still trying to salvage something for kent cricket out of it all
2761147 it was a herculean effort by the merry boys staff to pull off a victory without a home ground
2761148 our sponsorship is not just an investment in cricket but in the development of the youth of our nation we must acknowledge them achieving significant growth and recognition in the sphere of sports

2761375 i am delighted to open a contemporary vietnamese restaurant in new york city however i didnt want to open a traditional vietnamese restaurant either in terms of d cor or menus michael and i designed a stylish exotic restaurant combining the traditional with the modern i work in the dining room and enjoy meeting new customers and greeting repeat guests i want them to feel comfortable and enjoy a unique vietnamese culinary experience i am frequently at the restaurant and enjoy being there i love introducing the customers to a modern updated version of vietnamese cuisine my desire is to make vietnamese cooking well known in a modern way using global ingredients
2761376 the cooking of vietnam is sophisticated and flavorful yet simple and earthy i grew up in vietnam so that my culinary roots are based there however i have traveled extensively for business and been inspired by the ingredients from around the world naturally my childhood memories lingered on throughout my years as a chef and as the owner of a restaurant and clothing business in saigon however i also enjoy creating new vietnamese dishes alongside the classic ones i work directly with my cooks by teaching them new dishes and updating traditional ones my philosophy is to bring the past into the future and bring my food to a new dimension
2761377 at b n i have created a sophisticated yet comfortable environment with friendly and attentive service professional and unobtrusive yet warm and welcoming treating each diner as an individual i want my customers to come and relax most people like simplicity consistency and warm comfortable surroundings it is my pleasure providing this special hospitality which is a part of my cultural heritage
2761378 b ns global wine list offers a select choice of wines from around the world i work closely with both small and large estate vineyards to create a unique selection of wines to complement the menus it is my belief that by removing an intimidating edge to the presentation selection and service of wine my guests can relax have fun and become more familiar with an exciting choice of international wines however i also offer a wide selection of premium liquors and am continually creating new specialty cocktails
2761379 b n first and foremost celebrates the union of fine global wine authentic vietnamese dishes with global ingredients personalized service and a stylish modern atmosphere although i have created a sophisticated dining experience at b n i want my customers to feel comfortable and enjoy themselves there is no attitude or pretense here

2761472 e questo un tipico prodotto dellattuale cosiddetta societ del benessere che per colmare un vuoto interiore e la noia che lo accompagna induce a tentare esperienze nuove pi emozionanti pi estreme
2761473 anche le vacanze ricorda il papa rischiano cos di dissiparsi in un vano inseguire miraggi di piacere
2761474 mi sono riferito ai giovani perch sono i pi assetati di vita e di esperienze nuove e perci anche i pi a rischio ma la riflessione vale per tutti la persona umana si rigenera veramente solo nel rapporto con dio e dio lo si incontra imparando ad ascoltare la sua voce nella quiete interiore e nel silenzio
2761475 in una societ in cui si va sempre di corsa le vacanze siano giorni di vera distensione
2761476 profonda angustia per i tragici avvenimenti che si stanno verificando in georgia e che a partire dalla regione dellossezia meridionale gi hanno causato molte vittime innocenti e costretto un gran numero di civili a lasciare le proprie case
2761477 e mio vivo auspicio che cessino immediatamente le azioni militari e che ci si astenga anche in nome della comune eredit cristiana da ulteriori confronti e ritorsioni violente che possono degenerare in un conflitto di ancor pi vasta portata si riprenda invece risolutamente il cammino del negoziato e del dialogo rispettoso e costruttivo evitando cos ulteriori laceranti sofferenze a quelle care popolazioni
2761478 invito altres la comunit internazionale e i paesi pi influenti nellattuale situazione a compiere ogni sforzo per sostenere e promuovere iniziative volte a raggiungere una soluzione pacifica e duratura in favore di una convivenza aperta e rispettosa

2761480 a male entered the video store and there was some sort of dispute in relation to that matter
2761481 he then climbed over the counter of the video store and took an amount of cash and a pack of cigarettes from behind the counter and then departed the store and went inbound towards the inner city area
2761482 it could have been far worse but it wasnt and that is what we are thankful for that everyone is okay and everything is good
2761483 they did exactly what is expected of them in that situation and handled it very well i am very proud of them
2761484 i thought it would be interesting to go for a walk in the mall to see if the guy whos not that bright would still be around
2761485 i took the photos from the security camera and i jumped into the lift with my wife
2761486 as soon as the lift opened this guy walked in the guy i was holding the photos of
2761487 i had been studying his photos and now here he was right in front of me i couldnt believe it
2761488 he asked some lame question about something in the building and i couldnt even get a word out because i was shocked
2761489 it was tempting to bail him up right there because he was stuck in the lift with nowhere to go
2761490 i was going to hand him the photos and ask do you know this guy
2761491 he cant be too bright to try something like this
2761492 he was happy to pose for the cameras at one moment and then put his hood up so his face was obscured
2761493 this poor guy needs to find a new job this is not the career for him
2761494 all the cupboards were open which was odd the cash tin was on the floor with receipts everywhere and the filing cabinet was open
2761495 we are a software development company gearing up for launch trying to put our first product on the market
2761496 money is tight were being very careful about every dollar we spend
2761497 we dont need idiots to come in and walk off with equipment like this
2761498 police investigations so far indicate it was a single vehicle
2761499 a motorcyclist was travelling inbound and we believe speed may be a contributing factor
2761500 he has approached the intersection and went about too quickly and lost control and hes hit a traffic sign causing some massive injuries
2761501 we are aware that he is a male he is in roughly his late teens early 20s and at this time we believe he is a townsville resident
2761502 you shake your head and just wonder what we have to tell people to make them slow down
2761503 i just dont understand why people and not just young people it is older people as well who speed
2761504 we keep telling the media we keep telling people about slowing down and observing the speed and traffic conditions but for whatever reason they continue to exceed the speed limit and disobey the traffic regulations
2761505 we do have witnesses that have advised us what possibly may have happened leading up to the accident
2761506 but we are calling forward anyone who has any information or witnessed it to call crime stoppers or their local police station and well take it from there
2761507 only a small group of people will benefit from this project but the rest of the community stands to lose a lot
2761508 its not too late to save cape pallarenda we call upon the rudd government to honour their commitment and buy back the land
2761509 i dont think anyone in the community begrudges the way laurence has this
2761510 the environment minister was not with the former government which opted to sell the land nor the former council that twice said it had no problems with the sale proceeding
2761511 that said the environment minister has the ability to make things right and buy back the land
2761512 its regrettable that this land was sold by the previous government but an assessment of the conservation value of the land demonstrated that while there are some local and regional values bushland in other regions rates more highly
2761513 an application could be made for the purchase of the cape pallarenda property under the caring for our country initiative and such a proposal would need to address natural system criteria

2761522 an immediate cessation of hostilities the full respect of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia
2761523 this reminds me all too much of other recent conflicts that have torn our continent apart particularly in the balkans
2761524 the russians despite the size of the forces that have entered georgia have failed to defeat our troops but we have to be realistic it is going to be very difficult to face up to them
2761525 we can only hope they will be able to put pressure on the russians
2761526 if one of the protagonists which appears to be the case commits to a ceasefire the other one must do the same
2761527 russia doubtless feels isolated even encircled given the transformation of its immediate environment
2761528 that is no reason we have told her russia so and we say so again not to respect the independence of its neighbours
2761529 that said i remain convinced that the european union needs to find a new language a new mode of cooperation in its relations with moscow
2761530 the strategic nature of this region is a secret for no one

2761535 war is an ugly thing but not the ugliest of things the decayed and degraded state of moral and patriotic feeling which thinks that nothing is worth war is much worse
2761536 in a lot of different ways i think theres been an awakening perception
2761537 o ur time our energy should be spent in educating agitating organizing our fellow citizens in the workplace in the neighborhood in the schools our objective should be to build painstakingly patiently but energetically a movement that when it reaches a certain critical mass would shake whoever is in the white house in congress into changing national policy on matters of war and social justice
2761538 true religion will not let us fall asleep in the comfort of our freedom love thy neighbor is not a piece of advice its a command god my friends is with the poor and god is with us if we are with them this is not a burden this is an adventure

2761540 my late friend jim mckay the great host of all those olympics on abc used to remind me bob the olympics arent just a sports event theyre also a travelogue well look around and take note were live on this sunday morning in beijing from tiananmen square
2761541 he is set up for these games much better than he was in athens four years ago
2761542 i wish hed be breathing hard right now to make it look like he worked hard
2761543 the great ones always find a way youve watched tiger woods
2761544 i would never even think of being able to compete on a world class level
2761545 she is literally and figuratively stretching the notions of her sport and maybe for that matter any sport
2761546 team usa has taken on an us versus the world mentality which in the olympics is fairly appropriate
2761547 a brilliant response on a day in which the entire american volleyball community is affected by sadness and tragedy
2761548 even the greatest swimmer thats ever been has to learn to handle the nerves here
2761549 jenny lang ping is absolutely an icon and hero here in china
2761550 a brilliant response on a day in which the entire american volleyball community is affected by sadness and tragedy

2761552 the 17 000 here at the cube recognize a bit of history here as phelps begins his quest to become the greatest olympic champion of all time
2761553 even the greatest swimmer thats ever been has to learn to handle the nerves here
2761554 this is the group of death with north korea brazil germany and nigeria very difficult group to advance out of but important to place first
2761555 marta is the most special player in the womens game
2761556 this game is going to be played down to the final whistle especially by north korea
2761557 one of the best players in the world she is one of those players and it might be wrong to say it this way who plays like a guy
2761558 i do believe that it is still a compliment to say that a woman plays like a guy
2761559 im thankful for my opportunity and i live my life and play basketball for god first people and country second this door came open to me and i just walked through it im just happy to be here thankful to be a part of it and excited to quit talking about it and play basketball i love my country im proud to be an american and this is a basketball game its not life or death

2761565 georgian authorities said sunday morning that they expect russian attacks to come on three fronts from gali and zugdidi two spots on the abkhazian border and from ossetia
2761566 they also expect more bombing on the kodori gorge the only part of abkhazia that remains under georgian control
2761567 we dont intend to take the initiative to escalate the conflict at this time

2761570 es wird eine wirklich gro e schlacht werden daran besteht kein zweifel wir sind absolut sicher dass es bis zum bitteren ende andauern wird
2761571 es wird mit sicherheit nicht so einfach sein wie vergangenes jahr und das jahr zuvor als wir die markenmeisterschaft gewonnen haben
2761572 ich bin einfach nur gl cklich und entz ckt ber die art und weise wie das team und unsere fahrer auftreten mit den zwei j ngsten kerlen in der weltmeisterschaft in dieser position zu sein und das championat anzuf hren ist etwas ganz besonderes
2761573 wir hatten schon immer das gef hl dass mikko die tolle arbeit fortsetzen kann als marcus gr nholm anm d red noch dabei war nat rlich war es f r ihn ein gro er schritt diese f hrungsposition einzunehmen und es war eine ganz spezielle art und weise wie er sich an diese aufgabe angepasst hat
2761574 wenn man bedenkt was er alles auf seinen schultern tr gt ist es noch h her einzusch tzen wenn man sein alter und seine erfahrung mitber cksichtigt
2761575 bei jari matti wissen wir dass er den speed besitzt und er schon immer schnell war er hat in schweden gewonnen und das hat seinem selbstbewusstsein seinen gewaltigen schub gegeben danach hatte er einige r ckschl ge zu verdauen aber wenn man sich den saisonlauf in der t rkei ansieht hat er dort mikko hervorragend unterst tzt
2761576 in der zweiten saisonh lfte sollte alles besser funktionieren ich hoffe einfach dass sie die zweite jahresh lfte mit einem klaren kopf starten k nnen und aus allen fehlern die sie gemacht haben gelernt haben ich bin sicher dass wir am ende der saison in einer guten position sein werden
2761577 ok es gibt keine frage dass es ein paar events gibt die wir h tten gewinnen m ssen mangelnde erfahrung und zugegeben merkw rdige fehler von unserer seite haben dazu gef hrt dass wir auf manchen strecken nicht so gut unterwegs waren wie wir zu sein geglaubt haben aber ich habe es schon immer gesagt dass zwei junge piloten sich in der zweiten saisonh lfte besser darstellen werden als in der ersten
2761578 ok ich wei dass noch drei asphalt rallyes auf uns warten und dass niemand au er s bastien loeb anm d red diese rallyes in den vergangenen vier oder f nf jahren gewonnen hat
2761579 es warten aber auch ein paar sehr gute schotter wertungspr fungen und die haben wir vergangenes jahr entweder mit mikko oder marcus alle gewonnen
2761580 insgesamt sind wir in einer tollen lage und wir wollen versuchen beide meisterschaften zu gewinnen wir wissen dass dies aufgrund der asphalt rallyes schwieriger sein wird als vergangenes jahr wir haben andererseits aber das gef hl dass wir zwei exzellente fahrer haben welche eine sehr starke herausforderung f r s bastien darstellen werden
2761581 well get scholarships and loans or how about your rich aunt
2761582 well what will she do make you go to a certain college
2761583 my girlfriend wants to break up with me and doesnt even have the courage to say so
2761584 wow this confirms it george is also trying to control where i attend school
2761585 do not fear to be eccentric in opinion for every opinion now accepted was once eccentric
2761586 i just feel that the mayor came into office with a lot of promise a lot of potential some very unique gifts to help detroit be better
2761587 i think that what we have over the city now is this abyss of darkness that prevents us from moving forward and so i think the time has come for the mayor to resign

2761590 on the plan ride over i was kind of thumbing through it looking through it just trying to remember it
2761591 one thing we have to get straight is this chad thing
2761592 were going to have to call him rook or call me c p or something
2761593 i dont know he looks a little thin he needs to eat some chicken wings or something
2761594 hes cool though ive played against him so many times he owes me some money though because i get all those personal fouls against him every year so i might take his shoes or something and maybe hell give me a ransom
2761595 its going to be a lot of fun im looking forward to it i really do
2761596 i dont have revenge on my mind or anything like that i have one thing on my mind and thats a victory period
2761597 i think when youre in this business you know that things can happen anytime
2761598 being in it now this being my second year ive seen things happen throughout the season the last year where hey its just the way this business goes its the nfl and you have to be ready to live with whatever happens it went down
2761599 they said over and over again theyre going to do what they have to do to help this team win
2761600 ive been there before i know what its all about i think it brings out the best in all of us and i think it makes our team better so im no stranger to that i welcome the challenge and i look forward to it

2761679 i think the population is able to differentiate between what the money is going for and what some of the leaders are doing a bit out of the way i really think we have not been affected that way because we have been very clear that every bit of money we have we give out to charity so it has not been an issue
2761680 i suspect it will have an effect on singapore minds when you have charitable organizations subject to scrutiny and investigations people will tend to be a bit cautious
2761681 but we see also in the case of nkf national kidney foundation scandal people are now coming round responding to it because people know there are a lot of people needing help needing that touch of mercy needing that touch of graciousness

2761697 iraq and china are keen to show their cooperation by finalizing an agreement on developing the ahdab oil field
2761698 absolutely theres a lot of truth to what the president said and in terms of wall street there was too much leverage in the system and more leverage than was appropriate and more than people recognized because the leverage came into the system in the form of highly complex structured products which were difficult to understand
2761699 there is no question about it wall street got drunk
2761700 thats one reason i asked you to turn off your tv cameras
2761701 the question is how long will it take to sober up and not try to do all these fancy financial instruments
2761702 we have of course one priority getting through this period with as little damage as little negative impact as possible on the economy but the second part is to take steps to reduce the likelihood of these sorts of things happening in the future
2761703 we sized that program to say how could we do something that will be meaningful this year but not so big that it would jeopardize some of our long term priorities and our fiscal priorities and balancing the budget so again my view would be lets see how this program works in the third quarter

2761710 the commercial i saw had a kris and then there were other women on the ballot i didnt know anything about them so i skipped it
2761711 she voted for the incumbents in several local judicial races
2761712 i told her that while shes seen hendersons name on the ballot plenty of times hes never been elected before i also let her know the real incumbent in the family court seat she referenced was lisa kent not her opponent jamie kent
2761713 she said she thought the caucuses in january were totally unrelated to the presidential primary process and that nevada could be the final say for the nomination

2761725 i think i was the last guy in san marino to see him

2761778 john mccains top foreign policy adviser lobbied for and has a vested interest in the republic of georgia and mccain has mirrored the position advocated by the government
2761779 the obama campaign has offered nothing more than cheap and petty political attacks that are echoed only by the kremlin the reaction of the obama campaign to this crisis is so at odds with our democratic allies and yet so bizarrely in sync with moscow doesnt merely raise questions about senator obamas judgment it answers them
2761780 its never been this rough to get tech companies to ipo
2761781 were seeing entrepreneurs more than willing to go the acquisition route rather than go public
2761782 most tech ipos tend to be smaller high growth companies with a relatively greater degree of risk
2761783 so it becomes harder to prove themselves to an ipo audience that is looking for a lower amount of risk
2761784 with nine of the last 10 ipos trading below their initial price companies see this and are willing to wait it out
2761785 companies that need these funds to grow will at some point look at alternative sources
2761786 because of the slowdown companies are looking at their it budgets
2761787 hopefully when the market is open again tech companies will be ready

2761801 it is with profound anguish that i am following the news each day more dramatic coming from georgia over the breakaway south ossetia region that has already caused many innocent victims and forced a great number of civilians to leave their homes it is my dearest hope that military action will stop immediately and that they will abstain in the name of their common christian inheritance from further clashes and violence that could lead to an even larger conflict i call too for respectful and constructive talks and negotiations avoiding further tragic suffering for those dear populations
2761802 i invite the international community and the countries with most influence in the current situation to make every effort to support and promote initiatives aimed at finding a peaceful and lasting solution we join our orthodox brothers in the prayer on this issue trusting that the holy virgin mary mother of jesus will intercede

2761825 our filters are made with carbon any impurities that can be found in water will stick to the carbon which becomes nonusable which is why it has to be changed at this time there is no way to recycle the carbon
2761826 cpscs mission is to shift californias product waste management system from one focused on local government funded and ratepayer financed to one that relies on producer responsibility in order to reduce public costs and drive improvements in product design that promote environmental sustainability cpsc urges clorox to redesign its brita filter cartridges so that they can be refilled and or create a system to recycle these plastic filter cartridges instead of sending them to the landfill
2761827 californians against waste supports extended producer responsibility plastic is the fastest growing component of the waste stream and plastic litter is contaminating our environment at a staggering rate objects where there is no proper avenue for disposal like brita filters are more likely to be littered or landfilled if a corporation is going to produce a plastic item incompatible with our recycling stream they have an obligation to give consumers the opportunity to dispose of their product in an environmentally preferable manner
2761828 here at co op america we believe in cradle to cradle design principles and in planning ahead to reuse products after they have reached the end of their life cycle last year we were proud to call on our members to start asking brita to take back its water filters and were so pleased to endorse this take back the filter campaign organized to do just that brita should learn from any number of the great green businesses of co op america s green business network tm and build more sustainability into its supply chain
2761829 water filters appear to be an attractive solution for people concerned about chlorine and other potential contaminants in their tap water but throw away water filters only add to the waste that is crowding our landfills and polluting our soil and water the take back campaign is a smart and simple way to stop this waste
2761830 brita water filters are an ideal example of a product that could easily be redesigned to be re used re filled then re manufactured before ultimately being recycled back into new filters by the manufacturerer instead they deliberately design their product to become waste brita should seize the opportunity to take responsibility for their product and create a closed manufacturing system for their filters
2761831 the sierra club believes that increased recycling and the adoption of
2761832 ecycle group supports nearly 15 000 community based printer cartridge and cell phone recycling initiatives across america we commend the grassroots leadership which take back the filter is demonstrating in their campaign by applying market pressure groups like take back the filter show that responsible waste stream management is a business opportunity and not a burden
2761833 great design is our business at synchrosina and we believe its poor design to throw something recyclable away thats why we are proud to join take back the filter in the campaign for earth friendly water filtration theres no better gift we can give the world than the gift of sustainable solutions
2761834 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2761835 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2761836 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2761837 we demand freedom and democracy for citizens of both countries today and not tomorrow
2761838 we shall accordingly continue to pile on pressure until a settlement is reached that is based on our demands
2761839 we want a total isolation of mugabe and his cronies
2761840 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2761841 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2761842 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2761843 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2761844 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2761845 the principles which inform the code are respect for the right of adults to choose the programming they want while protecting children and young persons from unsuitable material through appropriate scheduling and the need to protect persons from harm or unnecessary offence

2761848 its never been this rough to get tech companies to ipo
2761849 were seeing entrepreneurs more than willing to go the acquisition route rather than go public
2761850 when they look at how long a trek it is to go public an ipo is no longer the golden ring
2761851 most tech ipos tend to be smaller high growth companies with a relatively greater degree of risk
2761852 so it becomes harder to prove themselves to an ipo audience that is looking for a lower amount of risk
2761853 with nine of the last 10 ipos trading below their initial price companies see this and are willing to wait it out
2761854 companies that need these funds to grow will at some point look at alternative sources
2761855 because of the slowdown companies are looking at their it budgets
2761856 hopefully when the market is open again tech companies will be ready
2761857 we need the market to stabilize and see one or two companies that step up and have a strong debut
2761858 will have a significant long term impact on u s russian relations
2761859 youd think you would have to stop every few miles and siphon out some gas to make room in your tank for all the fuel you were saving
2761860 there are things you can do individually though to save energy
2761861 making sure your tires are properly inflated simple thing but we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups youd actually save just as much
2761862 obama is correct that properly inflating our tires would save fuel
2761863 the x factors here are the fact that sen obama used both tire inflation and tune ups in his remarks and no one knows what volume you could would get from additional drilling in the outer continental shelf
2761864 the maximum estimated fuel economy i e mileage savings drivers could expect as a result of keeping their engines properly tuned 4 replacing air filters up to 10 properly inflating tires up to 3 and using the correct motor oil 1 2 is 18 19 since american drivers use roughly 380 million gallons of gasoline not including diesel per day an 18 improvement translates into a savings of 68 million gallons or 1 62 million barrels of oil per day
2761865 so the production offset is more likely to approach 800 thousand barrels per day a tidy sum and a worthwhile target for savings but not equal to ocs output
2761866 finally without knowing what production volumes could be expected from lifting the ban on ocs drilling moratoria its impossible to assert that taking these fuel savings actions would exceed future offshore oil volumes and in fact one might argue that the combination of achieving these savings and developing new supply would doubly enhance us energy security
2761867 dont go around tonight well its bound to take your life theres a bathroom on the right bad moon on the rise
2761868 baby the minute i feel your energy the vibes just taken over me start feelin so crazy babe lately i feel the funk coming over me i dont know whats gotten into me the rhythms got me feelin so crazy babe

2761873 i think the more minutes we get together in the olympics the better it is
2761874 we have 180 minutes now and get 90 more against new zealand so we will improve our game from one game to another
2761875 i was very happy about our performance against a very technical and talented japan team besides a great goal by carli lloyd i was pleased with our tactics which accommodated a fast player up top amy rodriguez and the way heather oreilly played on the right side
2761876 we are aware that we dont have the goal scorer
2761877 we still have created scoring chances and we talk about so much about the centre of midfield if the centre midfield with carli and shannon boxx are involved in the attack we will create scoring chances and it is ok to win 1 0
2761878 we put a priority of a rod getting past the japanese defence and the same with heather oreilly on the right side
2761879 they did a lot for our attacking but at the same time we were compact in our defending even though japan played very nice football in the attacking third actually some of the best ive seen however we stayed compact and they didnt score a goal not only the defenders played well but i thought the whole team did a good job of that and followed the game plan very well
2761880 pressurising the opposition into making mistakes is a tactic that came off for us
2761881 the koreans caused us some problems to begin with they have a really strong team control the ball well and are good going forward in the second half they were even more attack minded
2761882 the girls need to concentrate right up until the final whistle in this case two defenders switched off
2761883 did you see the defence that korea put out against marta
2761884 that shows you just how good she is i dont think shell ever have come up against a defence like that we expect a great deal from her but she really needs to get more support from the midfield

2761897 the question is how long will it take to sober up and not try to do all these fancy financial instruments
2761898 we have of course one priority getting through this period with as little damage as little negative impact as possible on the economy but the second part is to take steps to reduce the likelihood of these sorts of things happening in the future
2761899 we sized that program to say how could we do something that will be meaningful this year but not so big that it would jeopardize some of our long term priorities and our fiscal priorities and balancing the budget so again my view would be lets see how this program works in the third quarter

2761903 i knew that he was the one person with the combination of guts and passionate concern about the war who would take the risk of helping me

2761961 were still considering their request but havent given a definitive answer
2761962 our concerns with gm trees are even more serious than crops because trees are very long lived
2761963 they are inherently geared up for spreading seeds and pollen because of they way the reproduce
2761964 it could have a really negative impact and cause widespread ecological damage
2761965 our concern is that biofuels will distract people away from other solutions

2761988 instead of a bowling alley in the basement of the white house paris would have a pilates studio and oh yeah shed have foam parties in the oval office for the white house staff and old girlfriends from boarding school
2761989 she would answer all questions while walking and posing for a wall of photographers and theyd be yelling out paris look here
2761990 the first half of every conference would be about what shes wearing paris would realize that as president she would have to tone it down a little shed lean toward prada
2761991 what would happen is rihanna would step off the plane in fishnet stockings music would blare and whole countries would melt at the sight of her

2761993 after years of dereliction when only a crash programme of measures could keep our lights on and our economy functioning our policy has become so skewed by blinkered environmentalism and diktats from the eu that we are fast heading for the worst of all worlds a near total dependence on foreign sources of energy which will not only be astronomically expensive but which can in no way be guaranteed to supply all the electricity we need
2761994 people have come to the conclusion that the closer he is to wanting to obtain power the more difficult others will make it for him to achieve that
2761995 a lot of people are very tired after living through the first sodomy trial which had a chilling effect on the country even until today people thought it was blatant political manoeuvering
2761996 the new sodomy charges against anwar ibrahim are all a political game because he is now a real threat to the prime minister
2761997 anwar was cleared of all the sodomy charges before so what are they trying to prove now we have all grown up in the last 10 years and people are not so stupid to just accept all these things blindly
2761998 it looks like the government is out to fix him again everyone knows that the charge against him is nothing but a lie
2761999 the only thing we can do now is to vote for anwar and make sure he gets to parliament and eventually form the government only then can we right all that is wrong in this country

2762015 we deplore the dangerous and disproportionate actions by russian forces and we would be particularly troubled if these attacks are continuing now as the georgians are pulling back
2762016 very very concerned if in fact there is ground action inside of georgia proper that is outside of these areas of abkhazia and ossetia
2762017 we will offer a resolution today that makes clear that the russian actions in georgia are unacceptable to the international community and we condemn this military assault
2762018 well see whats in there then well know what to do

2762056 to give the last chance for the egyptian government and the arab league to convince hamas to immediately end its coup and engage in the dialogue
2762057 but the door for dialogue will not be open forever and the leadership only gave one month time for the efforts
2762058 will be a dangerous thing if it was officially made

2762067 russia can neither be grasped by the mind nor measured by any common yardstick no attitude to her other than one of blind faith is admissible
2762068 broke russias back the red terror unleashed by its leaders their willingness to drown russia in blood is the first and foremost proof of it
2762069 the bitter russian experience which i have been studying and describing all my life will be for us a lesson that keeps us from new disastrous breakdowns

2762103 soaring price of oil will leave the iraqi government with a cumulative budget u s taxpayers have spent 42 billion for the stabilization and reconstruction of iraq in contrast the iraqi government has allocated 28 billion for similar improvements but has spent less than 4 billion
2762104 if we would have had our way we would have had a reasonable timetable for the redeployment of most of our troops which would have put pressure on the iraqi government to do what they are not doing
2762105 which is essential to end the conflict in iraq and that is to work out a political settlement among themselves
2762106 committed tens of billions of american dollars to various iraqi construction projects with no real plan for how all of its supposed to add up to a stable iraqi state
2762107 seeking a provision in the defense authorization bill that would preclude spending u s funds on large scale infrastructure projects in iraq defined as a those that exceed 2 million
2762108 cornyn iraqs massive 79 billion surplus is a success of bushs policies
2762109 the government has to respect the law or no one else will
2762110 while in past years we have provided rooms to accommodate single homeless persons now we will be able to unite husbands and wives and children in a common space that will become a real home for them
2762111 we go from the bible verse matthew 25 verses 31 46 to serve the population thats identified in those verses and build our ministry that way rather than a megachurch
2762112 could affect the ability of the parties to have a fair trial and the ability to seat a fair and impartial jury
2762113 will remain in effect permanently regardless of the outcome of this case unless modified or dissolved by the court
2762114 our experience is that many times the suits dont materialize because the familys attorney gets to see the circumstances of the death and the contributions of the deceased to the situation
2762115 they usually end up settling because both sides have had a chance to assess the evidence through the inquest process
2762116 they can better predict what a subsequent jury may find
2762117 i dont think its too much to ask that when someone dies that we bring some sunshine to the matter
2762118 theres a lot of people within the community who feel like theyre separated from any kind of hope thats a tragedy within itself

2762122 georgia is a sovereign nation and its territorial integrity must be respected
2762123 i for the life of me cant imagine how that could be a proportional response to allegations that georgians had fired upon russian peacekeepers
2762124 if a case is absolutely black and white and a person is a threat to themselves or someone else any officer should be able to handle the call without someone getting hurt
2762125 crisis intervention team trained officers really become a benefit to the department on the gray calls
2762126 they would have had a better understanding of what was driving walter pagels behavior
2762127 the goal of the department is to get more officers cit trained
2762128 but i know it may take a while to do that
2762129 they find that out and they come back to the training center blown away by how articulate and smart they are how normal the person is and that helps them the next time theyre in a situation
2762130 people in law enforcement are trying to solve the problems and this is a proactive approach to train officers who come out of the academy and have not been trained to deal with mental illness in general
2762131 the exposure in the training itself gives you a wider broader perspective of what people are going through
2762132 they really want to do the right thing when it comes to dealing with a person in a psychiatric crisis but they dont know how
2762133 officers need to be clued into the behavioral cues that theyre seeing
2762134 sometimes people with mental illnesses react differently when officers use a strong command presence
2762135 we tell cops you all look alike in those uniforms to the rest of the world
2762136 when you show up in uniform you may not have any intention of hurting them but you look an awful lot like the guy who showed up and wrestled him to the ground the last time
2762137 we were very strong in the past towards protecting ourselves from any liability and went the committal route when it didnt necessarily take into consideration the best interest of the person we were dealing with
2762138 were seeing that human services and law enforcement are working together
2762139 by partnering were seeing a lot of the barriers that kept people from getting treatment are vanishing

2762141 if you look at the traffic jams in nairobi you have no option but to walk
2762142 if we dont do anything to decongest nairobi soon i have no doubt it will come to a standstill in a decade
2762143 when you are stuck in a jam you feel a headache you feel disheartened and agitated
2762144 you want to flout all the rules just to beat the traffic
2762145 one of the most recent safety innovations is the literise touch system from hunter douglas a cordless lift system that allows shades or blinds to be raised and lowered with a gentle touch on the bottom rail
2762146 they do not consider any kind of danger or harassment they have a religious ideology that considers any difficulty they face as a merit and mercy for their piety
2762147 it will take a few risk takers to invest in iraq but when that happens others should follow
2762148 were worried about reopening the museum in case a suicide bomber with an explosive vest infiltrates
2762149 we should wait until the spread of peace and security in the country
2762150 its turbulent and extreme domestic situation makes iraq one of the least desirable places in the world to be
2762151 my only income was depending on what tourists gave me for historical accessories or postcards and handmade copper goods
2762152 there wont be zero coca but there wont be free cultivation of coca either
2762153 the u s required growers to quit planting coca before they could access alternative development programs without considering that their families needed to eat now the cato guarantees the farmers income giving them the chance to take risks with new crops
2762154 the total area used for coca is unlikely to be reduced significantly given market prices
2762155 before we rejected alternative development because it was an excuse for u s interference
2762156 in august well start burning the hills to prepare the earth and in october and november well be planting
2762157 i knew i was coming to beijing a long time ago for the olympic period i didnt think i would get many tickets so i asked for a ton and i ended up getting every one i asked for
2762158 the mens basketball match between china and u s has sold out yesterday it was over 1 460 and it has kept changing by the day
2762159 i think the issue here is that nobody should be deprived of his or her liberty without the benefit of a trial
2762160 re education through labor is completely illegal under international law this is arbitrary detention
2762161 mrs toguchi prayers are nice and its probably very helpful but you still need chemotherapy
2762162 dear lord youre the one who created my body so i know you can fix it

2762200 you are beautiful just as you are dont be afraid
2762201 i was shocked they were so cool and so proud of being native canadians
2762202 i realized that i have a beautiful culture and strong roots i decided that i should be a proud ainu and express that in my life
2762203 they felt that backwardness had been mapped onto their bodies
2762204 these young people are trying to overcome nasty historical baggage by creating positive self images through music and dance
2762205 young people are more aware of japans multicultural makeup but its still pretty shallow
2762206 japan is behind other nations in this way even though it claims to be an advanced economic power
2762207 being indigenous cant be cut off from issues related to the land
2762208 some people say you can have an identity as ainu but we japanese dont know what we can be proud of

2762210 we have said that this is a condition driven process
2762211 no no definitely there has to be a very clear timeline
2762212 we are only now able to discuss conditions based time horizons because security has improved so much this would not have been possible 18 months ago
2762213 we all look forward to the day when iraqi security forces take the lead on more combat missions allowing u s troops to serve in an overwatch role and more importantly return home
2762214 this was a heinous attack by al qaida in iraq against an iraqi family followed by a cowardly attack against innocent civilians their security forces and u s soldiers
2762215 i did not expect that a terrorist attack to take place in our secure town
2762216 al qaida is to blame for this attack operations in diyala have pushed them here

2762218 my determination has been one of my best aspects but i think its even greater this year
2762219 coming out and getting hurt last year ive got to prove myself man i havent done anything at this level and im excited to get out there and show my abilities
2762220 youve got to do it on grass but my confidence is a little higher im just kind of relaxing more and making plays
2762221 people always say if you think it slows you down that much and you cant make plays coming in as a rookie its hard not to think because you dont know nothing
2762222 tambi n lo desarroll para que sea inal mbrico y ahora estoy haciendo un brazo rob tico para personas que han perdido uno de sus brazos
2762223 certain pass plays i knew i was in trouble because i knew i wasnt capable of throwing a 20 yard out if coach jon gruden called that play last year i wasnt able to manage it i was thinking of ways i was going to survive the game and at least move the team down the field somehow some way
2762224 i think it is another step but for some reason im not really as nervous for that as i was the first two days of practice
2762225 i feel like ive got my feet under me and ive definitely got my confidence back my timing and rhythm are back so i feel this will be easier
2762226 im sure ill be nervous but i think im more excited than anything right now
2762227 i cant think about it that way or i lose track of whats really going to go down he said im just going to focus on my part and however many drives i get just make the best of it
2762228 i got to do the two minute drill at the end of practice even doing the scout team stuff just getting out there and throwing
2762229 its been so long since ive been out there am i going to see everything clearly or is it all going to be a mishmash i was confident i could do it because i put a couple of good weeks of practice behind me but yeah there were some doubts
2762230 he gave me a little hug and said he was proud of me
2762231 he has a long way to go to get it all back
2762232 i knew my body was ready to get hit again
2762233 chris and i have been together for four years and we have a great relationship and i know brian and chris are close too were all rooting for each other we want to see chris go back to being the quarterback he was and he took a big step forward tonight

2762249 toda tecnolog a inventada y exteriorizada por el hombre tiene el poder de entumecer la conciencia humana durante el per odo de su primera interiorizaci n

2762251 la informaci n es proporcional a la cantidad de alternativas
2762252 al trabajar con estos conceptos de comunicaci n y control la cibern tica es pertinente para el estudio del hombre porque existe en muchos sentidos un paralelo entre el comportamiento ese paralelo no es una met fora ya que hay semejanza estructural entre los procesos de la m quina y los del comportamiento humano

2762260 i think the blue skies will come especially after todays rain
2762261 today is raining and tomorrow will have rain too that will help reduce the air pollution level we believe the current air flow will be helpful in the dispersion of pollutants in the air
2762262 you can control beijing as much as you like but youre not going to see much of an effect
2762263 on the day of opening ceremonies we had rain clouds in the southwest and northwest they were moving closer to the birds nest and there was a high probability of rain
2762264 what if joseph holds a grudge against us and pays us back for all the wrongs we did to him
2762265 your father left these instructions before he died 17 this is what you are to say to joseph i ask you to forgive your brothers the sins and the wrongs they committed in treating you so badly now please forgive the sins of the servants of the god of your father

2762270 we do expect a lively turnout there a strong turnout
2762271 i do think that public financing levels the playing field and also encourages more people to compete
2762272 thats a good measure of progress and i think part of it is due to public financing because more people are willing to come forward and run
2762273 id heard they were coming to campus and one of my friends found an extras listing on craigslist
2762274 i actually did it because i was really interested in seeing or meeting alexis bledel
2762275 i kind of did it on a whim and i didnt expect to be chosen
2762276 im in the background of all the scenes where alexis bledels character is going to her summer art school
2762277 all of the clothes im wearing in the film are mine they asked for us to bring several changes of clothes
2762278 they checked us out to make sure we werent wearing colors that were too bright or wearing something close to what alexis was wearing
2762279 we were typecast as teachers or professors we basically walked down about 100 feet and turned right that was our big role
2762280 were hopeful that its an important scene and well be in the movie
2762281 the scout was driving down i 95 and saw the roof of the burroughs library he said it would be the best facility for one of the scenes
2762282 they made the set appear to be the rooftop of an apartment building i saw the first movie so it was exciting to be behind the scenes
2762283 they did one quick scene where america ferrera ran across the street to see her friends
2762284 all four of the girls were here they did the graduation scene on our lawn
2762285 we talked to the stars they were very approachable and we got to take pictures
2762286 her mom said shed just auditioned for this new show called gossip girls
2762287 basically we could come in and out as long as we didnt get in the way
2762288 they pretty much took everything out of the first floor of our house there was a mile of electrical wire inside the house
2762289 we were up on the second floor we just moved into other bedrooms
2762290 that was the only crazy part we were all stuck in two bedrooms
2762291 we left it that color actually we liked it that way
2762292 for us it was only a week so it was an adventure for that week
2762293 if it had been for months it probably would have gotten old
2762294 my friends will probably scream my name when i come on

2762305 whilst we note that the imc has been asked to prepare a special report on paramilitary structures including the current status of the ira we will be making our own assessment and using our own security contacts
2762306 the briefings we receive on a regular basis establish the extent to which the ira has progressed with the dismantling of its paramilitary structures
2762307 it remains our position that the army council must leave the stage and that the ira should no longer function in any respect
2762308 the final ending of the provisional army council pac may be difficult to call if three of them met today to plan the way forward is this a pac meeting
2762309 they have not formally disbanded but they arent doing what they were set out to do and they arent a security threat
2762310 in a democratic society you clearly cannot have an army council it is for the police and the security services to deal with the dissidents
2762311 the key thing about policing and justice the minute it is devolved is the powers it brings to the office of the first minister and the deputy first minister
2762312 you cant have in government a party with a paramilitary structure

2762346 lo nico que el pp y los empresarios buscan recurriendo el pot es perpetuar un sistema un modelo de crecimiento del descontrol del ladrillo por encima de las personas en el que no se garantiza un uso racional sostenible y combinado del territorio de manera que se garanticen los derechos econ micos los servicios la preservaci n del medio ambiente la movilidad el uso de los territorio infraestructuras comunes y se preserve sobre todo la costa occidental un elemento que hace que seamos la zona de espa a y andaluc a que m s crece desde el punto de vista tur stico porque ha imperado un criterio de sostenibilidad y de preservaci n del medio ambiente

2762369 we have already seen more than 115 tornado related deaths making this the deadliest tornado season since 1998
2762370 it is only the third time since the 1974 super tornado outbreak that there have been more than 100 tornado related deaths during a single tornado season in the u s
2762371 in 1998 and 1984 there were 132 and 122 tornado related deaths respectively 2008 will likely equal or exceed that record
2762372 the storm track over the last three months was very active across the rockies and into the east coast this active storm track lends itself to more severe weather events including tornadoes
2762373 in previous years major storms happened every week or so but we have had a major storm system affecting some part of the u s every three to four days through early spring
2762374 another contributing factor is this years early start to the season a total of 87 tornadoes struck the tennessee valley and midwest over a 24 hour period starting on feb 5 resulting in a total of 56 deaths
2762375 this storm ranks as number 15 in terms of the number of fatalities since 1950 february will likely turn out to be a record setting month once all the tornado reports have been verified

2762485 i want to become a dominant no 13 and be considered one of the best centres going around in world rugby and i want to play for the all blacks one day but first i just want to play good footy i want to win the competition with toulon and repay the faith that tana has shown in me by getting out there and helping his team

2762490 id think wed try to keep him at around 80 pitches this time
2762491 well see how it goes in terms of how stressful his innings might be
2762492 he had pretty good command of his pitches in his last time out and that certainly was encouraging his velocity is getting there so is his stuff but were still being a little careful because its only a year removed from surgery
2762493 its tough to have to go through that long rehabilitation process and not be able to compete for month after month
2762494 its something ive had to go through twice now but ive never been someone who starts asking why me or anything like that as tough as it might be you have to accept that injuries are part of the game sometimes and you have to do what you have to do to come back
2762495 the doctors and the coaches all tell me that the command of my pitches is the last thing to come back after a long layoff
2762496 so im pretty pleased with that aspect of things so far
2762497 im just trying to give my team a chance to win every game i start whether its five innings or whatever thats really all i can do at this point to try to stay strong and give my team the best innings i can pitch the good thing is that theres two months left to the season a lot of time for us to come back and get to the playoffs and for myself the goal will continue to be to keep getting stronger and hopefully get back to being the pitcher i was three years ago

2762705 if you watch the olympics gymnastics this year you may be confused by the new scoring system which will let athletes score 14 17 or even higher the new rules are heavy on math and employ two panels of judges one for technical difficulty which adds points up from a score of zero the other for execution and technique which starts at 10 0 and subtracts for errors the two numbers are then combined for the final score as one judge put it the system rewards difficulty but the mistakes are also more costly the new rules were adopted after south korea protested a scoring at the 2004 olympics

2762717 we do not intend to take the initiative in escalating the conflict in this region we are primarily interested in stabilisation in abkhazia
2762718 blind knowledge is working at useless ground and crazy faith is living the dream of its liturgy a new god is a word or the mere sound dont seek and dont trust for all is mystery
2762719 if the disproportionate and dangerous escalation on the russian side continues this will have a significant long term impact on u s russian relations
2762720 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
2762721 we have verified information that the russians are planning to attack zugdidi in several hours georgian parliament speaker david bakradze said referring to a georgian controlled city near abkhazia
2762722 we have left practically all of south ossetia as an expression of goodwill and our willingness to stop military confrontation georgian national security council secretary alexander lomaia told afp
2762723 we have asked united states secretary of state condoleezza rice to mediate with the russians to transmit them our message he said
2762724 disproportionate and dangerous escalation of the conflict could significantly harm relations between washington and moscow
2762725 this is definitely necessary for preventing arms shipments to georgia by sea interfax quoted a naval source as saying
2762726 a sea blockade of georgia will also help avert an escalation of military activity in abkhazia
2762727 strongly states its commitment to the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of georgia and its internationally recognised borders and urges russia to respect them said a statement released by france
2762728 underscores that the military actions against georgia could affect eu russian relations it added
2762729 the navy was ordered not to allow supplies of weapons and military hardware into georgia by sea
2762730 the georgians have dug in at the heights and they dont want to leave our fighters aided by the russians have been trying to flush them out of there
2762731 at this point we are particularly concerned that the conflict appears to be spreading beyond south ossetia into abkhazia
2762732 all of them are waiting for dawn to start active actions
2762733 russias aid arrived a bit too late and the town was completely destroyed we dont have tskhinvali anymore
2762734 georgias aspiration to join nato is driven by its attempt to drag other nations and peoples into its bloody adventures
2762735 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2762736 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
2762737 we will offer a resolution today that makes clear that the russian actions in georgia are unacceptable to the international community and we condemn this military assault
2762738 well see whats in there then well know what to do
2762739 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
2762740 russias aid arrived a bit too late and the town was completely destroyed we dont have tskhinvali anymore

2762742 the russian navy intercepted lotus i a moldovan flagged merchant vessel carrying wheat
2762743 the russian military appears bent on shooting burning and now starving innocent civilians
2762744 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
2762745 russian troops are heading south and the next place in that direction is the town of gori our troops are positioned to defend the town
2762746 russia further escalated its aggression overnight using weapons on unprecedented scale in these conditions our forces conducted redeployment
2762747 i believe that the position of the international community supported by australia is that georgia is an independent state its territorial sovereignty should be respected and therefore all states should exercise restraint and that includes the russian federation
2762748 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia
2762749 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
2762750 in a time of universal deceit telling the truth is a revolutionary act

2762752 were very honored that mr obama mentioned us and has eaten here in the past
2762753 it the platform is really something sen obama can run on and the rest of us can run on
2762754 today we pledge a return to core moral principles like stewardship service to others personal responsibility shared sacrifice and a fair shot for all
2762755 today we democrats offer leaders from the white house to the statehouse worthy of this countrys trust
2762756 commitment that every american man woman and child be guaranteed to have affordable comprehensive health care
2762757 if you have ideals and want to accomplish things youve got to be pragmatic about it
2762758 hes never known anything else here in hawaii the proportion of women working outside the home has always been high
2762759 theyre not pretentious his grandmothers lived in the same two bedroom apartment for 40 years they never drove fancy cars they chose to put their resources into education and travel their success was based on intellect and hard work grandparents who sacrificed its the american story
2762760 the work ethic she gave me was if you want to get ahead you work hard and you work wise
2762761 he had only to observe his mother in her life actions to see that here was someone who believed she could change the world by her individual acts whether it was marrying his father or trying to help poor women free themselves from the bondage of centuries
2762762 i condemn russias aggressive actions and reiterate my call for an immediate ceasefire
2762763 russia must stop its bombing campaign cease flights of russian aircraft in georgian airspace and withdraw its ground forces from georgia
2762764 the current escalation of military conflict resulted in part from the lack of a neutral and effective peacekeeping force operating under an appropriate un mandate
2762765 when i told people i was going out to utah i got a similar question if there are any democrats in utah and i said you know there are more than you think
2762766 weve seen it happen in colorado montana is getting close
2762767 we might not make it there this november in utah but together we can get there
2762768 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
2762769 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
2762770 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
2762771 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
2762772 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
2762773 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
2762774 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
2762775 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
2762776 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
2762777 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
2762778 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
2762779 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
2762780 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
2762781 im sorry but i can only hear your voice i cant hear the band its just really blahblahblah
2762782 tu fino ad ora per me non sei che un ragazzino uguale a centomila ragazzini e non ho bisogno di te e neppure tu hai bisogno di me io non sono per te che una volpe uguale a centomila volpi ma se tu mi addomestichi noi avremo bisogno uno dellaltro tu sarai per me unico al mondo e io sar per te unica al mondo
2762783 la mia vita monotona io do la caccia alle galline e gli uomini danno la caccia a me tutte le galline si assomigliano e tutti gli uomini si assomigliano e io mi annoio per ci ma se tu mi addomestichi la mia vita
2762784 ma non ho molto tempo per ho da scoprire degli amici e da conoscere molte cose
2762785 in principio tu ti sederai un po lontano da me cos nellerba io ti guarder con la coda dellocchio e tu non dirai nulla le parole sono una fonte di malintesi ma ogni giorno tu potrai sederti un po pi vicino
2762786 se tu vieni per esempio tutti i pomeriggi alle quattro dalle tre io comincer ad essere felice col passare dellora aumenter la mia felicit quando saranno le quattro incomincer ad agitarmi e ad inquietarmi scoprir il prezzo della felicit ma se tu vieni non si sa quando io non sapr mai a che ora prepararmi il cuore ci vogliono i riti
2762787 e quello che fa un giorno diverso dagli altri giorni unora dalle altre ore c un rito per esempio presso i miei cacciatori il gioved ballano con le ragazze del villaggio allora il gioved un giorno meraviglioso io mi spingo sino alla vigna se i cacciatori ballassero in un giorno qualsiasi i giorni si assomiglierebbero tutti e non avrei mai vacanza
2762788 io non ti volevo far del male ma tu hai voluto che ti addomesticassi
2762789 va a rivedere le rose capirai che la tua unica al mondo
2762790 voi non siete per niente simili alla mia rosa voi non siete ancora niente
2762791 nessuno vi ha addomesticato e voi non avete addomesticato nessuno voi siete come era la mia volpe non era che una volpe uguale a centomila altre ma ne ho fatto il mio amico e ne ho fatto per me unica al mondo
2762792 non si pu morire per voi certamente un qualsiasi passante crederebbe che la mia rosa vi rassomigli ma lei lei sola pi importante di tutte voi perch lei che ho innaffiata perch lei che ho messa sotto la campana di vetro perch lei che ho riparato col paravento perch su di lei ho ucciso i bruchi salvo due o tre per le farfalle perch lei che ho ascoltato lamentarsi o vantarsi o anche qualche volta tacere perch la mia rosa
2762793 ecco il mio segreto e molto semplice non si vede bene che col cuore lessenziale invisibile agli occhi
2762794 e il tempo che tu hai perduto per la tua rosa che ha fatto la tua rosa cos importante
2762795 e il tempo che ho perduto per la mia rosa
2762796 gli uomini hanno dimenticato questa verit ma tu non la devi dimenticare

2762802 people say that igloos are rather warm inside and theyre made of snow so maybe when the snow covers the car it will likewise get warm
2762803 no im isaac do you what to come in out of the snow
2762804 if he got lost then were fuck at least its warm
2762805 dont worry that is ishmael my brother ill just go check on him excuse me
2762806 what the hell do mean we have a diner guest is there even enough food
2762807 i cooked a lot because im extremely hungry no starving one could say to the point of exhaustion do you want me to die
2762808 why are you so hungry youve done nothing today exempt sit and read the philosophy books
2762809 fine just bring the sauces out and ill cook up some more hey be nice too
2762810 no map no destination journeying from a distant land through the country roads
2762811 you are happy spending your days lock up in this building patrolling your assigned rooms reading away the hours as the walls close you into this mausoleum of knowledge
2762812 yes i am quiet content plus people would ruin my books
2762813 yes you see there was a massive tree here when my grandfather built this library so big and beautiful was the tree that he turned it into a tower with a grand room in the top floor and that is where you well rest
2762814 there you go now relax that is only isaac plays his violin here try these for your eyes
2762815 how are you isaac and ishmael didnt mention anyone else being the building
2762816 well two men can not run this whole place alone
2762817 everyone has at least one story and if they are truly blessed them may have more so now lenny do you what to hear a story
2762818 dont worry youre not crazy i see them too and im completely sane
2762819 hell no he loves this place too much if i told him he wouldnt be able to handle it hell he is named after our grandfather who built this place i dont know why he cares so much its just a bunch of old books there was a town here before though but they hated my grandfather so the whole town voted to move ten miles away
2762820 why did they hate him was it because he was jewish
2762821 no it was because he was an alcoholic and well after his death my dad refused to come back here to run the library so a few years back isaac and i came instead
2762822 well who is the other man who helps run the library
2762823 i think he drank to forget his past he would always be talking to his brother while walking in town
2762824 his brother was murdered in romania by soldiers on the road to turkey
2762825 so why do you stay here ishmael if its just a bunch of old books
2762826 where would i go im a man from nowhere anyway i cant leave my brother
2762827 who is the other man who helps run the library
2762828 lenny there is no other man who runs this library
2762829 avoid the times when there have been really rancorous debates in the confirmation process
2762830 if todays game was the best the conference premier can offer what are we worried about for most of the game we outplayed them apart from the sucker punch penalty i think on this game the diamonds must be more worried than us especially as they are one of the favourites for promotion
2762831 rushden didnt look like title challengers this afternoon still early days of course but on that performance rushden can forget the play offs as well
2762832 b urgess looked a tidy player as did his partner in the middle
2762833 rushden were no better than us and the only thing that seperated the 2 teams was a dive
2762834 its disappointing to hear we didnt play terribly well although given the conditions the fact it was their first game in this league and that that was probably their biggest attendance in their history ill take a 1 0 win no matter how it comes
2762835 what seemed like an average performance was actually a battling performance against a newly promoted team keen to make an impression in hard conditions hope was very solid at the back and won every header but proabably should have scored wasnt too impressed with burton to be honest mariott was awesome and made 2 excellent saves that probably should have been goals tomlin osano jelleyman and woodhouse all had good games phillips didnt stop running but mcdonald didnt really get into it disappointed with burgess personally however someone behind me thought he was motm each to their own

2762842 the greatest battles of life are fought out every day in the silent chambers of ones own soul
2762843 my cultural observation made me want to find out how i could better this situation or make use of my finding by broadcasting it in a tiny way encouraging the notion of thinking about talking again
2762844 is a make believe transit of pretend conversations over scenes that have grown to be insignificant drawing a parallel to the theory of an anti social society incorporating intent to realize mixing aspects through typography illustration sound and photography among other components
2762845 i had no idea when you interviewed me that you considered much of my later work to be sentimental rubbish or that you thought songs like uptown girl and we didnt start the fire were abominations and your back slapping buddy buddy style of conversation betrayed no indication that you actually compared talking with me to sleeping with an inflatable girlfriend
2762846 you didnt bring any of this up during the interview and i certainly would have welcomed the opportunity to discuss those kinds of things person to person i believe that its always best to be upfront with someone when you have strong opinions about their work or their image simply as a gesture of respect or if the respect isnt there then purely as professionalism had i known you felt this way i still would have done the bloody interview but your comments reveal you to be already critically predisposed and somewhat insincere you are still welcome to attend our concert in auckland but just as a safety precaution please wear a hockey mask
2762847 so to summarize my wife needs to learn to keep her mouth shut because your husband and sister number twos husband are going to yell at you and sister number two because tits was talking about politics when an agreement had been reached unbeknownst to her to leave politics out of the dinner conversation and youre already about to leave your husband because he wont let you get a dog even though you make 95 000 a year which is three times what hes making did i mention that you make 95 000 because you mentioned it five times and together you and he are contemplating insurance fraud and oh yes by the way our oldest brother has aids oh and obama wants socialized medicine and leave bush out of it

2762851 tort litigation and especially class actions have reached crisis proportions because defendant corporations settle resulting in payoffs to plaintiff lawyers though this may make financial sense in the short term it makes no financial sense in the long run
2762852 settlement simply whets the voracious appetites of the plaintiffss trial bar to file more and more suits
2762853 another example is the silica industry which resolved not to repeat the mistakes of the asbestos industry
2762854 hopefully these lessons are not lost on other corporate defendants and their insurers
2762855 the allegations are absurd and baseless every penny that we got in aid since 2001 has been accounted for
2762856 not been passing on all the 1 billion dollars a year that the americans have been giving for the armed forces
2762857 the army has been getting 250 300 million dollars reimbursement for what they do but wheres the rest
2762858 they claim its been going in budget support but thats not the answer were talking about 700 million dollars a year missing the rest has been taken by mush for some scheme or other and weve got to find it
2762859 i think he has a slush fund being used for this and for some activity for the future

2762900 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
2762901 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
2762902 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
2762903 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
2762904 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
2762905 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
2762906 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
2762907 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
2762908 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
2762909 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
2762910 liberals want illegal aliens and felons to vote they benefit from such rampant fraud

2762927 the commander in chief threshold you will have to ask senator obama with respect to his candidacy
2762928 in this election we need a nominee who can pass the commander in chief test someone ready on day one to defend our country and keep our families safe and we need a president who passes that test because the first and most solemn duty of the president of the united states is on protect and defend our nation and when there is a crisis and when the phone rings whether its 3 00 p m or 3 00 a m in the white house there is no time for speeches and on the job training senator mccain will bring a time of experience to the campaign i will bring a lifetime of experience and senator obama will bring a speech he gave in 2002 i think that is a significant difference i think that since we now know senator mc cain will be the nominee for the party national security will be front and center in this election we all know that and i think its imperative that each of us be able to demonstrate we can cross the commander in chief threshold and i believe that i have done that certainly senator mccain has done that and you will have to ask senator obama with respect to his candidacy
2762929 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other

2762935 regardless of the title make clear if people will have the authority to use their own creativity and do things in new ways
2762936 one suggestion is to get tied in to local user group communities especially ones that attract freelancers and learners
2762937 but good programmers also get paid a bit better and thrive on a community of other programmers which means other area employers
2762938 another thing to tout is the ability to choose the technical stack amp freedom to explore new languages frameworks if true
2762939 also is there any chance you could offer a referral bonus to univ employees no better applicants than that

2762946 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2762947 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2762948 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2762949 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

2762972 ross is an excellent person and an outstanding member in his community ive known him for quite some time and its a pleasure to represent him
2762973 his article starts by distinguishing between protestant catholics and roman catholics this is odd for two reasons first because he uses titles that each side generally does not use for itself protestants generally do not refer to themselves as catholics let alone protestant catholics and catholics do not generally refer to themselves as roman catholics we are catholics and if we are in the latin rite particular church within the catholic church we are properly latin rite catholics not roman catholics
2762974 second dr godfreys terminology suggests that both protestants and catholics are members of a larger genus i e catholic
2762975 dr godfrey says here that the protestant conception of sola scriptura is that scripture alone is our authority if we took this statement at face value it would imply that no protestant pastor or session or presbytery or general assembly has any authority over any protestants but of course in practice such protestant offices and bodies do exercise some sort of authority over those persons who have placed themselves under them so either dr godfrey is not being careful here or he is endorsing the individualism of private judgment and solo scriptura
2762976 rather the catholic church teaches that the oral tradition and teaching authority of the church already existed from the day of pentecost on in the teaching and preaching of the apostles the new testament scriptures were eventually added to the oral tradition and to the teaching authority of the church
2762977 but the church has never existed without her teaching authority and without the oral tradition in the form of the preaching of the apostles
2762978 it is not difficult to show that since scripture is the word of god and obviously nothing can have more authority than the word of god that therefore the scripture must be the
2762979 so the point of disagreement between protestants and the catholic church regarding sola scriptura is not primarily about which authority in the church has the most or highest intrinsic authority but is rather about who has final or highest interpretive and teaching authority and on what ground or basis these persons have such interpretive and teaching authority
2762980 the disagreement between protestants and the catholic church regarding whether the word of god was also passed down as oral tradition depends for its resolution on who has interpretive and teaching authority to give the authoritative ecclesial judgment on this question
2762981 bound up in the protestant concept of sola scriptura is much more than the mere notion that scripture is the highest intrinsic authority in the church the protestant conception of sola scriptura includes the assumption of perspicuity namely that the scripture is sufficiently clear and plain that whatever is necessary to be believed for salvation can be known by everyone who reads it
2762982 perspicuity does not exclude the means necessary for interpretation i e the internal light of the spirit attention of mind the voice and ministry of the church sermons and commentaries prayer and watchfulness for we hold these means not only to be useful but also necessary ordinarily
2762983 this perspicuity assumption is taught nowhere in scripture or tradition it is a novel assumption imported by protestants from outside scripture and tradition to the process of interpreting scripture we do not find it in the first 1500 years of the church just as if the apostles did not teach any such doctrine to the church
2762984 nor would the apostles likely have done so given that the printing press was not invented until the fifteenth century
2762985 so the catholic response to the sixteenth century protestant claim regarding perspicuity is who told you that perspicuity is true
2762986 i want to focus not on the origin but on the implications of the perspicuity assumption the perspicuity assumption implies that we do not need any interpretive authority if by need we are referring to only what is necessary to know and believe for salvation
2762987 and whatever else might be good to know we can decide for ourselves whether we want to learn it
2762988 so right here in an implicit assumption hidden behind the more obvious and explicit definition of sola scriptura is the basis for the individualism that makes each protestant interpreter his own final interpretive authority
2762989 but what if salvation is more complicated than that what if there are gradations of happiness in heaven and our measure of happiness in the life to come has something to do with how we live in this life what if we are called to be saints in this life to be perfect and yet we only do the very minimum squandering a life time of opportunities for acts of heroic virtue in that case the minimalistic and nominalistic approach to christianity that seeks to do whatever just gets people inside the pearly gates is a misleading theology that potentially detracts from our eternal happiness
2762990 if as perspicacity implies we do not need an interpretive authority then there is no point to a magisterium having authority in perpetual succession from the apostles
2762991 perspicuity makes the churchs magisterium both superfluous obsolete and presumptive for surely jesus would not have established an enduring interpretive authority if we did not need such a thing
2762992 therefore given the perspicuity of scripture it follows logically that those persons claiming to have interpretive authority from the apostles are at best mistaken and at worst presumptive having at some point arrogated to themselves an authority that they do not have
2762993 perspicuity in this way is incompatible with the catholic churchs long standing teaching regarding the role and authority of the bishops in succession from the apostles
2762994 the protestant notion of perspicuity entails and grounds the ecclesial consumerism that in practice leads to the vast proliferation of sects for since there is no given interpretive authority then by default we are left to accumulate to ourselves teachers who teach according to what we believe 2 tim 4 3
2762995 and both the explosion of competing protestant sects and their inability to reconcile with each other over the past five hundred years undermines the notion that we have no need if not in the sense of personal salvation at least in the sense of corporate unity for a living interpretive authority
2762996 protestant history testifies that we need a perpetual interpretive authority in order to maintain ecclesial unity
2762997 so in this way protestant history testifies against perspicuity and in favor of what the catholic church has always taught about her bishops and the nature of their authority as passed on through sacramental succession from the apostles
2762998 but already he has begged the question possibly without realizing it consider what is implicit in his claim that it can be shown that my position is the clear position of scripture he is implicitly assuming here that no heretic could show to that heretics own satisfaction and to those likeminded to him that his own heresy is the clear position of scripture
2762999 for if heretics can in principle do this then the fact that someone can show to his own satisfaction and that of those likeminded to him that his own position is the clear position of scripture does not show whether that position is heretical or orthodox in which case we would need the living church authority to adjudicate the question for us
2763000 therefore dr godfreys methodology if it is to be consistent with protestantism must assume at least implicitly that in principle no heretic can show to that heretics his own satisfaction and to that of those likeminded to him that his own heresy is the clear position of scripture
2763001 to approach scripture as though each individual has the authority to determine definitively for him or herself what it says is not to approach the scripture in a neutral manner
2763002 it is to approach scripture as though the first 1500 years of christianity were deeply misguided and protestantism is true
2763003 in order to talk about the issue of sola scriptura therefore we have to step back from debating the interpretation of the scriptures themselves that is the point tertullian made here and st vincent of lerins made here
2763004 we have to examine how exactly the church has operated from the beginning regarding the resolution of disputes over the interpretation of scripture
2763005 only if the practice of the early church was to treat scripture as self interpreting and as though there was no need for adjudication of interpretive disagreements by the apostles and bishops would we be justified in approaching scripture as though we ourselves have the authority to determine definitively for ourselves what it says
2763006 if however the church did not treat scripture as self interpreting but relied upon the decisions of the bishops to determine what is the orthodox and authorized teaching of the church and the authoritative interpretation of scripture then for us to approach scripture as though the bishops are not the interpretive authorities of scripture is performative if not propositional heresy
2763007 there is no neutral interpretive starting point here either we come to scripture recognizing and submitting to the ecclesial authority of the bishops or we come to scripture rejecting knowingly or unknowingly the ecclesial authority of the bishops
2763008 so the impossibility of neutrality here concerns those who know that the apostles appointed bishops and gave them perpetual authority in the church
2763009 if we wish to know how to approach the scriptures we must determine what those bishops taught about their own authority in relation to the deposit of faith and the interpretation of scripture otherwise we will beg the question and talk past each other in the protestant catholic ecumenical dialogue

2763082 some sports such as weightlifting have a pretty bad record and that is demonstrated time and again with numerous athletes from that sport
2763083 i think weightlifting understands as cycling understands that there is a huge risk for both those sports if the cheating is continued and continued to be exposed
2763084 the entire 11 member bulgarian weightlifting team was barred from the beijing olympics after testing positive for steroids and 11 of greeces 15 olympic lifters also were excluded after failing pre games controls several weightlifters were busted during the 2000 and 2004 olympics
2763085 there is no sport that anybody can suggest is doping free
2763086 but there are some sports that have had a history and i would suggest theres a level or a culture of doping that has developed in some of those sports
2763087 code compliance is essential for participation in any olympics summer or winter so there is an incentive to get themselves up to speed
2763088 we will not hesitate if there are a set of circumstances and facts and findings that lead to an outcome of noncompliance to pass that on its up to the ioc after that
2763089 wada director general david howman said sports that continue to be tainted by doping will come under pressure to be suspended or kicked out of the olympics
2763090 the issue of how long will there be patience in the sporting world is a good one and should be addressed by the ioc once theyve received our compliance report and they see the history of number of cases and so on
2763091 i wouldnt isolate weightlifting there are probably several sports who might fall under the same microscope
2763092 were not going to hide the fact that some may not be compliant
2763093 well continue to work after to bring up to speed any organization that is not compliant at the time
2763094 if the u s pga can see the benefit then there clearly must be something for the major professional sports in the united states

2763097 as he spoke a stream of athletes from around the world packed into wadas small booth in the olympic village to learn about the agencys outreach program and to take an online doping quiz

2763143 as developed for more than 200 years academic libraries in the united states and abroad have generally been designed first and foremost as places to collect access and preserve print collections
2763144 while information technology has not replaced print media and is not expected to do so in the foreseeable future it has nonetheless had an astonishing and quite unanticipated impact on the role of the library
2763145 the library is the only centralized location where new and emerging information technologies can be combined with traditional knowledge resources in a user focused service rich environment that supports todays social and educational patterns of learning teaching and research whereas the internet has tended to isolate people the library as a physical place has done just the opposite

2763171 ik heb een keuze gemaakt niet voor het geld maar voor mijn gevoel
2763172 we zijn heel erg blij met de prijs ik vind het echt helemaal te gek
2763173 ik zat aan ronnie tober te denken die had een liedje vroeger in 1 woord geweldig alle makers van de top 2000 en ik zelf zijn er ontzettend blij mee
2763174 blijkbaar zorgt stoppen ervoor dat je kansen op een prijs enorm toenemen dus ik denk eraan ook maar te zeggen dat ik met televisie stop
2763175 giel beelen dj bij radio 3fm won de zilveren radioster voor radioman van het jaar
2763176 wie ik moet bedanken zijn de mensen die me op de radio hebben gelaten en natuurlijk mijn fucking luisteraars echt te gek
2763177 je gaat echt naar de klote in dat huis en driemaal is scheepsrecht dat heb ik thuis moeten beloven
2763178 het gaat om een ontzettend goed doel en we gaan extreem veel geld ophalen
2763179 ik heb er goed over na gedacht en weet heel zeker dat ik graag dat huis in ga
2763180 ik heb met de reclassering afgesproken dat ik niet zeg waar ze kennen me daar niet en denken dat ik stage loop
2763181 ik mag niks zeggen alleen dat het heel mooi werk is
2763182 de acteurs waren geschokt over het feit dat er jaarlijks vier miljoen mensen sterven door gebrek aan schoon drinkwater dat zij besloten hebben om zich in te zetten voor 3fm serious request
2763183 they ate and they drank and they got up to enjoy
2763184 do not forsake me as i get old and dont take your holy spirit from me
2763185 g d open my lips and let my mouth speak your glory
2763186 my sons odor is as the odor of the field that g d blessed
2763187 we kennen elkaar al een jaartje of twaalf en toen vond ik hem ook al een raar mannetje hij had altijd al de drang om anders te zijn we konden het al vanaf het begin af aan goed met elkaar vinden en giel is inmiddels echt een maatje van me geworden
2763188 giel leeft en ademt radio hij heeft twee hele verschillende kanten en zijn extroverte kant wordt nog eens extra versterkt door de microfoon maar op die dertigduizend liter cola en dubbel zo veel sigaretten na is hij heel gewoon hij eet normaal en ik heb hem zelfs wel eens fruit zien eten
2763189 wij gaan regelmatig naar sterrenrestaurants om daar heel decadent te gaan eten
2763190 giel is een echte workaholic een waaghals doet graag vreemde dingen en hij is nergens bang voor in het dagelijks leven is hij daarentegen een aardig lief en schuw mannetje
2763191 beelen is een nieuwsgierig brutaal en een stout kind maar wel met een klein hartje hij is een beetje warrig maar staat altijd voor je klaar hij zal niets doen vanuit een negatieve gedachte en hij doet echt geen vlieg kwaad
2763192 ik weet niet waar die drang van hem vandaan komt giel zocht altijd al de grenzen op daarom is hij ook al meerdere malen ontslagen
2763193 maar de dingen die vroeger heel schokkend waren zijn dat nu niet meer ik denk dat hij die grens voor een groot deel verlegd heeft
2763194 soms maak ik me wel zorgen om hem ik weet nooit wat ik bij hem kan verwachten als ik vraag wat hij de vorige dag gedaan heeft dan krijg ik te horen dat hij gemarteld is of leven begraven was maar de volgende ochtend zit hij wel weer in de studio dat eist ook zijn tol vind je het gek dat hij zijn eigen auto een paar weken geleden in de prak heeft gereden tegen mij heeft hij al een paar keer gezegd dat hij nooit heeft gedacht dat hij de dertig zou halen hoewel hij die leeftijd al gepasseerd is komt het op zulke momenten dan toch heel dichtbij
2763195 ik denk dat het komt omdat hij extreem nieuwsgierig is hij heeft graag een mening over bepaalde zaken maar hij wil die wel ergens op kunnen baseren eerst kijken hoe de vork in de steel zit en daarna een mening vormen
2763196 as for me the silence and the emptiness is so great that i look and do not see listen and do not hear
2763197 a solid plot intriguing characters and a realistic depiction of scuba diving and marine creatures
2763198 may be the most beautiful most important underwater themed book ever published

2763202 its not that i dont like having sex with tyler
2763203 dalam novel ini clara hanya bercerita tanpa pretensi dalam frame penerimaan ini jauh berbeda dengan novelnya herlinatiens yang berjudul
2763204 bahasa itu senjata sekaligus penangkal racun sekaligus penawar bahasa dapat memenjara sekaligus membebaskan
2763205 media massa yang homophobia turut berperan dalam stigmatisasi kaum non heteroseksual
2763206 saya berharap lebih banyak penulis fiksi yang memotret penerimaan kepada homoseksualitas untuk mengimbangi media massa yang masih negatif dalam memandang masalah ini
2763207 i know jean and i love you too with all my heart and soul i dont ever want to leave this place
2763208 id like to stay here too darling but if the owners come home and find two strangers in their house theyll separate us with the bars of a jail cell
2763209 the law requires that when a non profit board is discussing personnel matters that it be done in executive session we are familiar with freedom of information laws and employee rights the members will be informed of what we are permitted by law to share
2763210 or i dont think the work environment will be very pleasant
2763211 the almighty has done great things for me and holy is his name
2763212 its the druggist he insulted me terribly this morning on the phone i had to call multiple times before he would even answer the phone
2763213 now just a minute listen to my side of it
2763214 i saw his body was wide open so as id hurt him with the same punch early on so i went for it
2763215 this was a mature performance from a youngster in his first major tournament in fact i would say he is even a bit more mature than amir was at this stage hes a tough kid he can box fight and is very adaptable
2763216 it was tough last time but this will be harder
2763217 so what are you doing this weekend someone asked me on friday hhmmm well im going to melbourne next weekend
2763218 if china decided to consume the way we do in the u s wed need another planet

2763221 perd n a los periodistas pero aqu hay terrorismo medi tico yo s que no son los periodistas son fundamentalmente los due os de los medios de comunicaci n
2763222 algunos spots algunas solicitadas contra el gobierno son pagadas desde estados unidos desde all est n pagando a los sectores opositores en bolivia
2763223 los grupos pol ticos y econ micos que dominaron el pa s durante d cadas y que a n mantienen gran parte del poder medi tico son los mismos que sometieron a la pobreza y al atraso a la gran mayor a de su poblaci n convocamos a los gobiernos organizaciones internacionales y a todos los ciudadanos del mundo a contribuir al reencuentro de la sociedad boliviana que en los pr ximos d as participar en una jornada en la que prevalecer n la raz n y el entendimiento
2763224 this is blatant indiscriminate electioneering in one of the final winters before the general election
2763225 they were talking about deals investments and large sums of money then i realised they were civil servants discussing government policy
2763226 the two of them were having a wide ranging conversation they were talking about their career plans and their summer holidays but they were mainly talking about the government plans relating to the rising price of fuel
2763227 it was only as we drew into the station that it became clear exactly what the plan was
2763228 i heard him say he wants to give it to the ordinary people i think he was referring to gordon brown his colleague suggested the extra cash would go to the needy but he replied no a fuel rebate for everybody on child benefit
2763229 no decisions on any new measures have yet been taken
2763230 it has to be set lower than the amount currently paid to pensioners
2763231 but high enough that people will really notice the difference
2763232 traditional forms of respite care force older people into care homes we want to give families the right to make a different choice
2763233 pensioners to take holidays in british resorts with relatives who look after them presumably stopping the carers benefit and expect their full time 24 7 unpaid carer s to get jobs these people already receive extremely generous tax credits if they are low or medium paid that in some cases double their net income only a small minority really needs help but as usual the government refuses to target the help another 1bn down the drain and onto state borrowings i get child benefit for my 16 year old boys they laugh in the face of cold choosing to camp out in march and ghyll scramble we are able to afford our heating bills the government should target the money some children are poorly fed and clothed living in badly insulated homes because of course the average single professional who doesnt get any government handouts who is not allowed to get on keyworker or social housing lists to get cheap property to sell at a profit whose taxes pay for those that do dont have high fuel bills do they gordon laura roberts london united kingdom its very simple if youre single or without children fork out another 150 to those who do have them gordon brown as father christmas yet more socialist theft why not adjust the tax free allowance upwards to take low earners out of paying tax simple fair cheap to operate too simple for this meddling controlling government the administration costs of taking money away and giving it back must be huge beware the grey vote mr brown once again pensioners have been ignored presumably because we can still burn our furniture to keep warm and heat our food on a bbq the fact that the pension is already so low and is then taxed by this ridiculous government is bad enough bonkers whenever gordon looks for people to give money to it never seems to be me i just get the bills as a childless couple who only pay tax and receive absolutely no benefits i am supposed to pay the increased fuel bills that brown will tax to give to these single parents etc got to go now as me and my wife are going to keep warm by making babees and then we can sign on the dole yet another ill concieved bribe does he think we are stupid i will gladly take the 150 but i wont be voting labour again i object to families getting this kind of help where was the goverment when i was groing up with 4 boys in the house and both parents working about time people took responsability for themselves decide not to but the latest 356

2763243 de esta forma y con la suscripci n de esta acta de entendimiento y del contrato que acabo de mencionar el estado boliviano evita ser demandado ante un tribunal de arbitraje internacional
2763244 el gobierno debe involucrar a las prefecturas para garantizar inversiones

2763256 we have been handed a note that from 5 a m 0100 gmt georgia stopped firing and is withdrawing forces from the conflict zone but our information does not confirm the georgian statement
2763257 the opportunity it provides to run aggressive policies towards russia

2763266 i said to bob bowman his coach i wanted to sing on the medal podium but i just couldnt stop crying
2763267 georgia expresses its readiness to immediately start negotiations with the russian federation on a ceasefire and termination of hostilities
2763268 we must check all that we dont trust the georgian side
2763269 we heard a plane go over and then a big explosion
2763270 russia further escalated its aggression overnight using weapons on unprecedented scale
2763271 we communicated that message beforehand to the russians through us secretary of state condoleezza rice
2763272 if the disproportionate and dangerous escalation on the russian side continues that this will have a significant long term impact on us russian relations
2763273 its hard to get taken seriously dont you think when youre younger than everyone else and youre a girl and people think youre attractive its awkward its weird doesnt it bother you
2763274 i pretend im a forty year old dude and im just tricking them into thinking im a 28 year old woman
2763275 my boyfriend is a cancerous gene hes mutated too many times i think hes broken
2763276 hell never be ok i thought i could fix him but i cant
2763277 i held everything together with hope for years but i dont have any hope any more i really thought i could help
2763278 the meeting focused on possible cooperation projects in certain sectors in the upstream and refining drilling and transporting oil and gas in iraq
2763279 its kind of disappointing when you talk it up and talk it up and then nothing happens
2763280 the houston area got most of the rain today two to four inches
2763281 with instability caused by the low pressure we could still see a 50 percent chance of rainfall throughout the day
2763282 we all need touch we all deserve some kind of intimacy and there is all kinds of research out there that the body and mind respond to touch in very positive ways
2763283 whether it will actually have an impact on the progression of this degenerative disease is very unlikely but providing someone with a connection can only be positive for both
2763284 holding his wife her old memory would remember his presence because thats not affected in alzheimers
2763285 so it would be comforting to her and decrease her stress and anxiety and hopefully her agitation
2763286 i was so depressed from it that i was shaking all over and i thought i was about to have a nervous breakdown
2763287 i said its not so much my mother its my dad
2763288 i got in bed with her and loved her up and i got rid of all my depression
2763289 i would like to press everybody if they have a spouse in a nursing home a hospital or rehabilitation center to try to get into bed with them
2763290 and if you have another person in the room dont feel bashful thats why they have curtains
2763291 she couldnt move at one point and now she gets up looking for him every guy that passes by she says sol
2763292 what we should be doing and what not enough places are doing is to encourage family members to do what sol is doing to have physical contact
2763293 shes got advanced alzheimers i know shes not going to recover from that
2763294 but while shes with me i want to enjoy every minute of it
2763295 there is no question about it wall street got drunk
2763296 thats one reason i asked you to turn off your tv cameras
2763297 the question is how long will it take to sober up and not try to do all these fancy financial instruments
2763298 we have of course one priority getting through this period with as little damage as little negative impact as possible on the economy but the second part is to take steps to reduce the likelihood of these sorts of things happening in the future
2763299 we sized that program to say how could we do something that will be meaningful this year but not so big that it would jeopardize some of our long term priorities and our fiscal priorities and balancing the budget so again my view would be lets see how this program works in the third quarter
2763300 why dont you go through the classifieds one more time

2763309 the past two olympics there were medals from canada at this event so for sure were going to have a lot of pressure
2763310 weve been top three quite often for the past three years so were really looking forward to this we have a shot but well have to work really hard
2763311 i dont think their results necessarily show how good they are
2763312 with this last game meaning so much for them i think theyre going to come out very strong and i think itll probably be our toughest game of the tournament
2763313 there somewhat is relief the day is over we overcame so much it was all kind of a whirlwind
2763314 and we got the nerves out and the mistakes out
2763315 i knew things were happening i couldnt control and that were obviously not very good
2763316 it was a little bit hard to go out from there
2763317 a few of us had tears in our eyes because we know how badly she wanted to be out there we said lets do it for her lets do it for our families lets do it for the people back home
2763318 well come back strongly in the team finals and fight for it
2763319 ive been doing it so well in training i think i just pulled so hard and i overrotated
2763320 i am very satisfied with the chinese girls performance if i can give them a score i would say 70 percent mainly for he kexin falling off the uneven bars its a big pity for her
2763321 maybe she was nervous because she wanted to perform her best
2763322 washington braucht russland bei wichtigen fragen wie iran zu sehr um jetzt alles zu riskieren nur um georgien zu verteidigen
2763323 traemos una propuesta de resoluci n que sabemos que no ser aceptada por rusia miembro permanente del consejo y con derecho de veto pero quiz consiga el apoyo de los otros catorce miembros
2763324 el problema es que georgia dice una cosa pero luego sobre el terreno hace otra
2763325 tiene preparado un texto de propuesta de resoluci n en la que al menos se condenen las acciones de rusia
2763326 detener de inmediato las hostilidades y a comprometerse sin mayor dilaci n con unas negociaciones que consigan el establecimiento de la paz
2763327 los contingentes armados que no est n autorizados por los respectivos acuerdos de osetia del sur deben abandonar la zona de conflicto
2763328 theres nothing you can do about it so well just get ready to go today
2763329 we were actually lucky to be one of only three mens eights crews that got out on the course for the warmup the rest were stuck on dock so we got to open our bodies up heck were used to the rain coming from where we do
2763330 they say at the olympics everybody puts it all on the line and theyre absolutely right
2763331 my family has been supportive here in the stands of the 7 500 seat badminton venue at beijing university of technology but they are going to have to step it up today because they will be competing against a loud chinese crowd
2763332 the crowd will be rooting for her but i will thrive off that the pressure is totally on her
2763333 this has been a goal of mine for so long there are little things to improve of course but i have to be happy
2763334 the thing is i dont know if i can get another chance to go to the olympics so well see
2763335 i might sit it out to save up for the 4x100 relay
2763336 i knew it was going to be that way its undecided now ill have to talk to my coach vancouvers tom johnson the olympic teams coach
2763337 our team is young and i think we were impressed and nervous
2763338 we did not play to our usual level were disappointed but well do better in our next game
2763339 a gente tem de inverter a rela o n o apesar de suas cren as religiosas e m sticas que o newton consegue dar o pulo do gato nos trabalhos sobre a gravidade justamente devido a elas
2763340 os pr prios estudos b blicos de newton j denotam uma sensibilidade mais cr tica e moderna uma tentativa de estudar as profecias de forma quase matem tica usando cronologias detalhadas
2763341 a gente costuma deixar ci ncia e religi o bem separadas mas o fato que os manuscritos de newton que chegam a 4 000 p ginas abordam principalmente esses estudos m sticos e esot ricos
2763342 com a morte dele a universidade de cambridge e a royal society principal sociedade cient fica do reino unido da qual ele fazia parte que tinham um modelo para o que deveria ser o trabalho cient fico privilegiaram parte da obra dele e deixaram o resto vir a p blico de forma meio aleat ria
2763343 menor e tr s dos primeiros foram arrancados para dar lhe lugar este chifre tinha olhos id nticos aos olhos humanos e uma boca que proferia palavras arrogantes
2763344 no hebraico b blico existe a palavra makom que significa lugar mas com a evolu o do pensamento rabin co ela passa a designar a pr pria divindade o newton cita essa palavra em seus escritos e parece ter usado o conceito para explicar como a gravidade atuava dist ncia como a gravidade do sol pode atrair a terra por exemplo como se entre o sol e a terra houvesse um makom que deus o qual est em todos os lugares
2763345 attempts to apply such a doctrine have plunged europe into war in the past and we have reason to remember how hitler used this very doctrine little more than half a century ago to undermine and attack substantial parts of central europe
2763346 we did not accept military intervention by milosevics serbia in other yugoslav states on the grounds of protecting serbian passport holders
2763347 in this sense it is also a question of a violation of international law as soon as you start to go down the road of military action

2763372 i was shocked they were so cool and so proud of being native canadians
2763373 i realized that i have a beautiful culture and strong roots i decided that i should be a proud ainu and express that in my life
2763374 they felt that backwardness had been mapped onto their bodies
2763375 these young people are trying to overcome nasty historical baggage by creating positive self images through music and dance
2763376 young people are more aware of japans multicultural makeup but its still pretty shallow
2763377 japan is behind other nations in this way even though it claims to be an advanced economic power

2763405 alcohol and drugs are most often the cause behind it
2763406 i have been working in the city for 10 years so i have experienced and seen a lot there wouldnt be an officer who hasnt been abused or attacked
2763407 there just seems to be a lack of respect from this generation x
2763408 i dont think people who are perpetuating this will take any notice of a campaign they need to be shown they can go to jail if they assault or abuse an officer

2763410 now is the time qantas should sit down with us to commit now to maintaining maintenance operations onshore
2763411 from the veteran communitys point of view he is not the person we want in the job
2763412 he is representing veterans and our history and our contribution
2763413 during the vietnam war he left australia then actively campaigned against the war in the uk saying it was a sad day when the viet cong was defeated this is the guy weve got to deal with and thats not good enough
2763414 we would not consider him an appropriate person to be doing veterans affairs
2763415 his views on conscription at the time of the vietnam conflict are well known and were indeed shared by many other australians both at the time and across the spectrum of australian military and political history

2763420 eu estava lendo um roteiro h pouco e vibrei acontecia uma coisa horr vel com os personagens e disse ao bart
2763421 t he us administration urged for an immediate cease fire in the conflict between russia and georgia over the unrecognized republic of south ossetia
2763422 the things that were happening in kosovo the things that were happening in iraq we are now following the same path the further the situation unfolds the more the world will understand that georgia would never be able to do all this without america south ossetian defense officials used to make statements about imminent aggression from georgia but the latter denied everything whereas the us department of state released no comments on the matter in essence they have prepared the force which destroys everything in south ossetia attacks civilians and hospitals they are responsible for this the world community will learn about it
2763423 the number of victims with women children and elderly people among them can be counted in hundreds and even thousands
2763424 civilians including women children and elderly people are dying in south ossetia in addition to that georgia conducts ethnic scouring in south ossetian villages the situation in south ossetia continues to worsen every hour georgia uses military hardware and heavy arms against people they shell residential quarters of tskhinvali the capital and other settlements they bomb the humanitarian convoys the number of refugees continues to rise the people try to save their lives the lives of their children and relatives a humanitarian catastrophe is gathering pace
2763425 the fact that georgian peacemakers in the structure of joint peacemaking forces opened fire on their russian comrades from one and the same contingent speaks for itself i think
2763426 now it is clear to us why georgia never accepted russias offer to sign a legally binding document not to use force for the regulation of the south ossetian conflict
2763427 not so long ago before the military actions in south ossetia georgias president saakashvili said that there was no point in such a document because georgia would not use force against its people as he said it just so happens that it is using it
2763428 we have repeatedly warned that the international community should not turn a blind eye on massive purchases of offensive arms in which the georgian administration has been involved during the recent two years
2763429 i believe we have a moral responsibility to deal with this and to deal with it by any means that we can
2763430 the contest is a lions fight so chin up put your shoulders back walk proud and strut a little you dont lick your wounds you celebrate them you are a fighter just because you didnt win doesnt mean you dont know how to roar

2763435 it was a little bit hard to go out from there
2763436 a few of us had tears in our eyes because we know how badly she wanted to be out there we said lets do it for her lets do it for our families lets do it for the people back home

2763455 his views on conscription at the time of the vietnam conflict are well known and were indeed shared by many other australians both at the time and across the spectrum of australian military and political history
2763456 they hoped to lock me in jail for two years because i like thousands of others had not registered for what was euphemistically called national service in vietnam
2763457 we did explore options for two of the 737s to be checked in malaysia however as a space became available at tullamarine a decision was taken to have the work done there
2763458 now is the time qantas should sit down with us to commit now to maintaining maintenance operations onshore
2763459 and to move off the path of cost cutting and any further possibilities of further job reductions in their maintenance and engineering area

2763519 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2763520 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2763521 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2763522 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2763523 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2763524 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2763525 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2763526 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2763531 but dont you think the latest grill is supposed to be the best grill
2763532 is it coincidence that in the seven years that rage against the machine has been away that the country has slid into right wing purgatory i think not it occurred to all of us that the times were right to see if we can knock the bush administration out in one fell swoop and we hope to do that job well
2763533 rage broke up only now is it safe for us to seize power

2763565 we are always going to have some pockets of tension because of what we do because of the enforcement aspects of the work that police departments do
2763566 with the so called gentrification of the neighborhood i think there are even stronger relationships than those that existed in the past
2763567 we have a lot more ownership of property in the neighborhood
2763568 appears to be a little bit more polarized than i have ever seen it
2763569 there is an unusually high demand for kids to be stopped and show identification

2763587 ah i am going to make a video blog today
2763588 we know this could be expensive after all there are only about 1 500 people in our town but all the players and the coach are putting their money into this
2763589 this will be an adventure for this small club the town and hopefully the ks football association of iceland people have not yet realised what we are going into but we are serious and always prepared
2763590 it can be that its no longer you and me against the world its you and me against each other
2763591 el proceso de creaci n de cada poema m o suele ser muy fluido no me gusta forzarlo aunque eso no quiere decir que no lo trabaje que no vuelva la mirada sobre el texto varias veces despu s de haberlo escrito suelo escribir vali ndome de todo lo que imagino lo que percibo a trav s de los sentidos de todo lo que intuyo de todo cu nto he vivido
2763592 este poema en particular lo escrib hace m s de cinco a os acababa de leer la novela mrs dalloway de la escritora inglesa virginia woolf una de mis autoras de cabecera y me sent a embargada por una sensaci n muy honda de insignificancia y de p rdida ante todas las cosas as que me sent frente al ordenador y escrib este texto que aparece en mi segundo poemario titulado desnuda
2763593 we were walking in the jewish quarter and suddenly we saw this our first thought was that we were back in 1934
2763594 it seems no one here is making a big deal out of it the guard at the center said he hadnt seen a thing and that it must have happened during the night they dont have a clue who did it but i myself saw a gang of skinheads lurking nearby maybe it has something to do with them
2763595 i think that the fact that it happened on tisha bav is symbolic
2763596 they knew exactly when and where to do it in any case the community has no plans of taking it off so that everyone can see whats happening
2763597 according to my knowledge there is not much anti semitism here except for the annual nazi parade on march 16 but its coordinated with the police

2763622 thats a coaching decision we feel very comfortable with our approach
2763623 the way of community is about the inward journey not the journey into
2763624 we just spoke about when things are going bad we seem to fracture as a group
2763625 we just said if anyone has a problem lets hear it now lets hear what the team has to do if you have a problem with anyone else in the team lets hear it
2763626 it was just an honesty session from my point where we were on the ladder was all the incentive we needed
2763627 they made a break up the middle and he made that tackle
2763628 hes been tremendous all year for us and what he did in that last five minutes is indicative of his season
2763629 for him to miss out on that is quite surprising given the season he has had the side hasnt been in the limelight as much as it was last year his contribution as an individual has been as good as its ever been
2763630 we looked like we were tired we looked like we didnt really challenge them that much
2763631 they were a lot more desperate it came down to that one play at the end where we could have scored its hard to imagine us doing much good in the semi finals if we come with that attitude
2763632 we pretty much concluded we had been letting each other down over the last few weeks we needed to address why we were not playing well and playing well as a team we just had a few things we needed to talk about
2763633 when it comes to pressure of the game things go a bit awol the forwards play as forwards the backs play as backs we werent playing as a team
2763634 today we just had a more upbeat attitude we werent panicking when they scored
2763635 i think we could get growth numbers in 2009 and 2010 which are under 2 per cent
2763636 i think the 2 25 per cent could be brought down to 1 75 to 2 per cent
2763637 i think the rba will have inflation coming back to 3 per cent sooner and that obviously would justify a potential rate cut in september
2763638 the market has 33 basis points factored in for september
2763639 there has been some talk of them going by 50 basis points so i think the market is toying with that idea at the moment
2763640 we are not ruling out them going by 50 basis points but we cant see the need for that size this time around
2763641 its tricky for the banks but the big unknown is what the banks do and whether they pass on the full benefits of a rate cut
2763642 if they only pass through some of the cut or they are slow in doing so the rba could have to do more
2763643 because at the end of the day the issue isnt fairness
2763644 the race was not easy especially after the penultimate restart with the two acuras in front of me behind these cars we lost a lot of down force so it was incredibly difficult to close the gap to them once i even went off the track at the end it worked well
2763645 thanks to audi tdi power we got the acuras on the straights it was a nice race i spent a lot of time in the car it was a lot of fun
2763646 i paid for it why should you get the damned thing
2763647 forgive me this time i shall never forget it who knows but what i may be able to do you a turn some of these days
2763648 its not that i dont like having sex with tyler
2763649 i now know by an unbelievable coincidence of fate that i am destined to travel
2763650 we looked into the future with impatient joy we seemed to breathe more freely a lighter air an air of adventure
2763651 i wanted to be successful as everyone does at that time it was all about personal triumph i was as well are a product of my environment
2763652 we must groom our hair every day why not our hearts too
2763653 the only passion which guides me is for the truth
2763654 dream and you will be free in spirit fight and you will be free in life
2763655 if there isnt coffee for everyone there shall be coffee for no one
2763656 i am content that i feel i am someone in life
2763657 to reach the people you have to feel one of them you have to know what they want what they need
2763658 one must not live celebrating victories but rather overcoming defeat
2763659 it is better to go barefoot than to steal shoes
2763660 every day you have to fight so that love for humanity can be transformed into concrete deeds into acts that set an example that mobilize
2763661 peaceful coexistence must be practiced between all states independently of their size of the previous historical relations between them and of the problems that may emerge between some of them at any given moment

2763663 aunque desde la consejer a de sanidad nos han hecho saber que la seguridad de los deportistas est cubierta con la presencia de una de estas c maras en el hospital universitario en tenerife hasta donde podr an ser trasladados a baja altura en helic ptero sin embargo nosotros consideramos que la isla que ha apostado firmemente por este turista necesita esta c mara que nos dar a tranquilidad y calidad al servicio que se presta a los buceadores
2763664 esta feliz iniciativa no s lo contar con el apoyo de los amantes del submarinismo en la isla sino de todos los buceadores canarios que desde 1997 hemos disfrutado y querido a este impresionante ejemplar de mero que tantos buenos momentos nos ha hecho pasar
2763665 it will be like college again playing 36 in one day
2763666 it happens and everyone else has to do it too so we just have to go out there and deal with it theyve got 12 hours to work on the golf course and it needed the rain
2763667 i think it is fair to say they will be significantly more receptive
2763668 i made double bogey at the 18th because i was mad i was almost fighting for the lead and suddenly i was trying to make the cut i was so mad the rest of the round

2763676 bonjour mr vous tes lap ro mais il ny a pas dap ro sans belin
2763677 im a competitor i like competing and i wanted to stay in and finish the game but sometimes your emotions get the best of you and you might do something irrational out there he thought i did thats part of the game its all patched up now though were buddies i missed a month without being here with the team and i wanted to try to prove myself again that i can pitch in the big leagues and i wanted to stay out there as long as i could he made the decision and thats his decision
2763678 hes fine he just wanted to stay in the game and i like that theres nothing wrong with that in fact if he didnt want to stay in the game id probably be mad ill tell you something his confidence got back thats why i took him out of the game i wasnt going to let him lose the game he was leaving on a high note and theres four left handed hitters standing there i wasnt going to give him a chance to get hit he already pitched a good game and did a good job
2763679 the regionalization program has by and large been a failure and maybe this explains why it hasnt worked

2763690 its my first olympics so if its snowing raining i dont care
2763691 the people in the stands that stayed were super loud
2763692 when you look up it pelts you in the eyes
2763693 but its beach volleyball we have to play the elements sometimes its howling wind
2763694 we really felt the loss as one of our own
2763695 maybe thats why it hurts so much it hit so close
2763696 in volleyball if you let up the other team takes advantage
2763697 weve always been talking about team and that goes for the coaches too
2763698 the best we can honor them is to go out and play hard
2763699 its my first olympics so if its snowing raining i dont care
2763700 the people in the stands that stayed were super loud
2763701 when you look up it pelts you in the eyes
2763702 but its beach volleyball we have to play the elements sometimes its howling wind
2763703 this victory comes as a reward to everything i have been doing and everything i have already done its for all the people who believed in me and helped me on my return
2763704 we have three goals from two games that might not sound enough but you can score 10 goals but still not qualify for the next round
2763705 so im happy with three goals and qualifying for the next round
2763706 i am very confident in my team we knew our goal and we are marching towards our goal we still need a few improvements to keep mistakes to a minimum
2763707 those who had the honour of knowing master cpl roberts describe him as the embodiment of a brother in the truest sense of the word
2763708 truth honour and loyalty were not mere words to josh but the unspoken creed by which he lived his life josh would be there for his friends at any time to lend a hand or to give them honest advice sometimes it was not the advice they wanted to hear but it was always the advice they needed
2763709 the kind of guy that we would describe as the soldiers soldier
2763710 was always carrying his share and more and always looking out for his buddies and comrades any which way
2763711 he had been extremely patient and always kept a sense of humour about it
2763712 some sports such as weightlifting have a pretty bad record and that is demonstrated time and again with numerous athletes from that sport
2763713 i think weightlifting understands as cycling understands that there is a huge risk for both those sports if the cheating is continued and continued to be exposed
2763714 there is no sport that anybody can suggest is doping free
2763715 but there are some sports that have had a history and i would suggest theres a level or a culture of doping that has developed in some of those sports
2763716 code compliance is essential for participation in any olympics summer or winter so there is an incentive to get themselves up to speed
2763717 we will not hesitate if there are a set of circumstances and facts and findings that lead to an outcome of noncompliance to pass that on its up to the ioc after that
2763718 the issue of how long will there be patience in the sporting world is a good one and should be addressed by the ioc once theyve received our compliance report and they see the history of number of cases and so on
2763719 i wouldnt isolate weightlifting there are probably several sports who might fall under the same microscope
2763720 the other more clean sports will be saying youre the ones that are actually sullying our reputation
2763721 were not going to hide the fact that some may not be compliant
2763722 well continue to work after to bring up to speed any organization that is not compliant at the time
2763723 if the u s pga can see the benefit then there clearly must be something for the major professional sports in the united states
2763724 you can see some cynicism and some credibility gap in the minds of the sporting public out there
2763725 the challenge that we all have is to restore that confidence to the sporting public
2763726 i have observed that in all other countries including in america people are complaining about how prices of gasoline are going up
2763727 the cure is not to reduce the price but on the contrary to raise it even higher to break our addiction to oil we are going to introduce a new tax reform in the direction of even higher taxation on energy and the revenue generated on that will be used to cut taxes on personal income so we will improve incentives to work and improve incentives to save energy and develop renewable energy
2763728 its the druggist he insulted me terribly this morning on the phone i had to call multiple times before he would even answer the phone
2763729 now just a minute listen to my side of it this morning the alarm failed to go off so i was late getting up i went without breakfast and hurried out to the car just to realize that id locked the house with both house and car keys in side and had to break a window to get my keys then driving a little too fast i got a speeding ticket later when i was about three blocks from the store i had a flat tire when i finally got to the store a bunch of people were waiting for me to open up i got the store opened and started waiting on these people and all the time the darn phone was ringing off the hook then i had to break a roll of nickels against the cash register drawer to make change and they spilled all over the floor i had to get down on my hands and knees to pick up the nickels and the phone was still ringing when i came up i cracked my head on the open cash drawer which made me stagger back against a showcase with a bunch of perfume bottles on it half of them hit the floor and broke meanwhile the phone is still ringing with no let up and i finally got back to answer it it was your wife she wanted to know how to use a rectal thermometer and believe me mister as god is my witness all i did was tell her

2763763 what is the ultimate proof of indian citizenship if even a foreigner can get an indian passport
2763764 a passport is a document issued by our government permitting us to travel to other countries how many countries will agree to give us visas on our passports once it becomes known that even a foreigner or a terrorist from another country can acquire an indian passport without verification
2763765 let alone admitting to the fact that more and more bangladeshi nationals are getting themselves registered as indian citizens thanks to their easy access to crucial documents like ration cards and even passports the state government seems to be reluctant even to admit the presence of infiltrators and has all along been maintaining a casual approach on the issue if the state government needed any further proof of cross border influx as also the evil designs behind the infiltration the high court ruling should wake it up from its slumber

2763771 avoid the times when there have been really rancorous debates in the confirmation process
2763772 if theres one truism in economics i believe its that recessions always kill inflation every time without a doubt theres no way around it even in stagflation once youre stuck in a recession your prices are going to plunge
2763773 so which is the better measure of inflationary expectations the spread between tips and treasuries or a spread between tips and a risk adjusted rate for all long bonds
2763774 there are critics though and i am one of them that think perhaps investors are not quite getting what they expect for a start the holdings in the index funds are market capitalisation weighted this sounds sensible of course except when you consider just how much the biggest companies dominate the portfolio the top one hundred stocks in america representing just 3 of the number of stocks in the index funds actually account for over 60 of the funds invested in vanguards fund
2763775 when you get down to the genuinely small capitalisation stocks there is actually very little money invested in each stock which is why it probably isnt surprising that over long periods of time the wilshire 5000 index performs pretty much the same as the big capitalisation growth stock dominated s amp p500 index
2763776 the art of creating a good portfolio is not about owning everything in market weighted proportions as the total market index does but in having significant exposure to every asset class and rebalancing the portfolio at an appropriate frequency
2763777 so if you want to take advantage of the rebalancing effect you are going to need to have a much larger small cap value exposure in your portfolio than just a couple of percent
2763778 while s amp p 500 index and total market funds make for effective pieces on an investment pie they should only be slices not the whole pie they just dont provide sufficient diversification as stand alone vehicles
2763779 the notion that compared with their large and mid cap counterparts small cap active equity managers are more likely to outperform their market segment

2763814 do not worry about your life what you will eat or about your body what you will wear consider how the lilies grow they do not labor or spin yet i tell you not even solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of these
2763815 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
2763816 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
2763817 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
2763818 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
2763819 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
2763820 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
2763821 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
2763822 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
2763823 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
2763824 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
2763825 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
2763826 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
2763827 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
2763828 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
2763829 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
2763830 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
2763831 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
2763832 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
2763833 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
2763834 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
2763835 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
2763836 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
2763837 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
2763838 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
2763839 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
2763840 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
2763841 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
2763842 who are open to doing something on the production side
2763843 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
2763844 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
2763845 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
2763846 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
2763847 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
2763848 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
2763849 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
2763850 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
2763851 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
2763852 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
2763853 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
2763854 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
2763855 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
2763856 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
2763857 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
2763858 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
2763859 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
2763860 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
2763861 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
2763862 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
2763863 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
2763864 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
2763865 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
2763866 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
2763867 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
2763868 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
2763869 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
2763870 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
2763871 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
2763872 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
2763873 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
2763874 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
2763875 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2763876 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
2763877 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
2763878 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
2763879 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
2763880 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
2763881 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
2763882 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
2763883 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
2763884 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2763885 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
2763886 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
2763887 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
2763888 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
2763889 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
2763890 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
2763891 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
2763892 der ars markt wird f r lange zeit tot sein und das allerletzte was wir wollen ist dieses zeug auf unseren b chern zu halten

2763894 wir schaffen mit diesen cdos ein irrsinniges monster last uns hoffen dass wir alle wohlhabend und pensioniert sind bevor das kartenhaus zusammenkracht
2763895 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
2763896 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
2763897 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
2763898 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
2763899 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
2763900 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
2763901 we have said that this is a condition driven process
2763902 no no definitely there has to be a very clear timeline
2763903 we are only now able to discuss conditions based time horizons because security has improved so much this would not have been possible 18 months ago
2763904 we all look forward to the day when iraqi security forces take the lead on more combat missions allowing u s troops to serve in an overwatch role and more importantly return home
2763905 this was a heinous attack by al qaida in iraq against an iraqi family followed by a cowardly attack against innocent civilians their security forces and u s soldiers
2763906 i did not expect that a terrorist attack to take place in our secure town
2763907 al qaida is to blame for this attack operations in diyala have pushed them here
2763908 the struggle against terrorism is not in the villages of afghanistan
2763909 the only result of the use of airstrikes is the killing of civilians this is not the way to wage the fight against terrorism
2763910 abandon the idea that the afghan government will be under its control
2763911 we do not want to be the slaves or puppets of other countries

2763929 plans for our new stadium are progressing though this will always be dependent on the world cup being held in england in 2018 if this is not the case then it is probable that we would rebuild the main stand and refurbish the city ground to give us all a stadium we can be proud of in the coming decades
2763930 the military commanders have made their decision to pull out from tskhinvali this morning
2763931 they have reached out to the russians to ask for a cease fire which is very important something that we also support but we havent seen a response
2763932 were looking into that urgently as that would be a further escalation of what is already a very very serious situation
2763933 and we would be particularly troubled if these attacks are continuing now as the georgians are pulling back and very very concerned if in fact there is ground action inside of georgia proper that is outside of these areas of abkhazia and ossetia
2763934 you could see it as a prequel to bram stokers novel in some ways
2763935 im writing a new version of the invisible man for universal im in the process of doing that right now and im working with some conceptual artists in tandem with writing the script im actually working with one of the artists from batman begins and the dark knight so it could be magneto or it could be the invisible man next
2763936 well the invisible man the universal film is a great movie a claude rains film my take is kind of an extrapolation it actually deals with a nephew of the first character its got some of the characters from the h g wells book but its kind of a continuation it involves scotland yard getting their hands on the current invisible man and basically saying wow youd be a really good secret agent to send into imperial russia right now it starts off from there
2763937 it kind of crosses a lot of genres its very steam punk i dont want to give too much away but i took what being invisible could mean to the next logical extreme we do a lot of crazy things in it that are sort of far beyond what anyones done with it yet

2763968 words cannot describe the depth of sadness in our hearts
2763969 there are more than three million displaced in the country only sudan tops it and the levels of political violence keep being extremely high it is the place in the world with the highest death rate for trade unionists already 27 this year
2763970 the degree of threats and pressures that affect the capacity of the civil population to express themselves fully to guerrilla groups of the left like farc spanish acronym of the revolutionary armed forces of colombia and anl spanish acronym of army of national liberation who in the areas they control create their own mini state with their own laws but in a less evident manner the paramilitaries who operate as mafias do the same
2763971 the law of justice and peace was designed to give a way out to those who played a part against it
2763972 in reality the paramilitaries never had much to fear of the colombian state on the contrary we have documented many cases of tolerance and connivance between the military and paramilitary sectors but the dynamics changed when the united states in 2002 sought the extradition of three paramilitary chiefs for narco trafficking with the inclusion of auc spanish acronym for colombian self defence units in the list of terrorist organisations the paramilitaries started to look for something that would let them cleanse themselves in exchange for minimum pain and the uribe government played the game with them
2763973 what we have criticised from the start is that the process of demobilisation was not focussed on the dismantling of all of the group it was not enough to have large ceremonies for handing over arms as the government did
2763974 the constitutional court responded last year to a demand against the law and managed to change substantially the law it said there had to be a full and truthful confession it eliminated some limitations that impeded how the prosecutors investigated and said that if the demobilised paramilitaries lied or did not hand over the goods acquired in an illicit manner or returned to criminality they would lose all benefits
2763975 the big question now is if the prosecution which is in charge of putting all this is practice is going to have enough capacity and independence to do it as it should be the financial structures of paramilitarism have practically not been touched where they took their resources to the criminal network of narco trafficking and extortion it has not been investigated because it wasnt the objective of the process of demobilisation many reports say there are 3 000 armed men in different groups other reports says of up to 8 000 armed paramilitaries which is what the figure was in the end of the nineties

2764011 the web is turning into one large gated community where if you dont have the right credentials cred youll always find yourself on the outside this way of thinking is inherently exclusionary and in my mind flies in the face of the open spirit that used to exist in the early days of the web snip this isnt the social community i want to be a part of i want to be part of a community where people are willing to share their expertise so that we all get better i want to be part of a community that mimics that hoary old cliche about rising tides that lift all boats

2764019 i met with joshua in cleveland in august of 2007 after he fired andre cologna and signed with me shortly thereafter
2764020 at that time joshua indicated a concern about the contract he signed when he was with cologna he also indicated that his plan to address it was to perform on the field all joshua did was have a pro bowl season in 2007 he has never once complained to the team or the media
2764021 this notion that joshua all of a sudden became dissatisfied with his contract after the pro bowl and hired us to fix it is absolutely inaccurate
2764022 joshua has expressed a concern all along about feeling protected as his agent i would not be doing my job if i did not explore ways to better protect and secure him

2764039 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
2764040 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
2764041 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
2764042 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings

2764046 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
2764047 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
2764048 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
2764049 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
2764050 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
2764051 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
2764052 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
2764053 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
2764054 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
2764055 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools

2764057 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
2764058 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools

2764067 we recommend for inclusion amongst others the right to trial by jury the right to administrative justice and international human rights as yet not incorporated into uk law
2764068 we believe that there is a strong case for detailed rights for children and we recommend that the public should be consulted about including specific rights for other vulnerable groups
2764069 rights such as the right to adequate healthcare to education and to protection against the worst extremes of poverty touch the substance of peoples everyday lives and would help to correct the popular misconception that human rights are a charter for criminals and terrorists
2764070 a great deal of our work in this parliament has concerned the vulnerable and the marginalised older people in healthcare asylum seekers adults with learning disabilities and children in secure training centres for example
2764071 we have often pointed out serious shortcomings in the protection of the human rights of these vulnerable and marginalised people
2764072 whilst not diminishing the obligation on parliament to legislate effectively and in compliance with human rights principles strengthening the legal protection for the rights of such people should in our view be one of the principal purposes of any new bill of rights

2764094 en otros tiempos ser a un motivo de orgullo del xito de la tecnolog a israel pero no en d as en los que georgia se encuentra en conflicto con rusia pa s al que israel exige que frene su asistencia a ir n mejor no despertar y enfadar al oso ruso
2764095 al principio el ministerio de defensa se hizo el duro y quiso presionar a rusia para que deje de ayudar a ir n y siria con el suministro de armas
2764096 es cierto que es delicado el apoyo a georgia por ordenes de arriba hemos tenido que bajar el perfil y reducir el suministro
2764097 debemos tener mucho tacto rusia ya vende mucho arsenal a ir n y siria y no debemos darle otro pretexto para que les den armas m s modernas
2764098 cada intermediario que representa una compa a israel y llegaba a georgia le era asignado un familiar del ministro de defensa que le abr a las puertas todo queda en familia

2764117 we have said that this is a condition driven process
2764118 no no definitely there has to be a very clear timeline
2764119 we are only now able to discuss conditions based time horizons because security has improved so much this would not have been possible 18 months ago
2764120 we all look forward to the day when iraqi security forces take the lead on more combat missions allowing u s troops to serve in an overwatch role and more importantly return home
2764121 this was a heinous attack by al qaida in iraq against an iraqi family followed by a cowardly attack against innocent civilians their security forces and u s soldiers
2764122 i did not expect that a terrorist attack to take place in our secure town
2764123 al qaida is to blame for this attack operations in diyala have pushed them here
2764124 it has not escaped me that we have made less progress than the teams around us

2764139 no lance you need more prayers the more pain and hurt you see in your congregation and those y ou are helping outside
2764140 pray that i will given the message to speak and that i may fearlessly explain the mystery of the good news
2764141 we definitely dont look at it like pressure on us
2764142 a lot of people said this was the weaker of the two freestyle relays the four of us set out to do something that not a lot of people thought we could do
2764143 we werent afraid to feel the pain which is why im so dizzy right now
2764144 there were words said but we know theyre a force to be reckoned with and were going to have to go against them
2764145 i just try to conserve everything and make it into the semifinal i try to bank as much rest as i can tonight recover and sleep and try to warm down and get out of here as fast as i can so im not getting so run down
2764146 i was still running off the adrenaline and hyper from this morning
2764147 the 100 back is probably the quickest progressing event in the past year in swimming theres a lot of pressure on me but im going to enjoy it as much as possible

2764149 that was a little faster than what i expected to do

2764153 i think it is fair to say they will be significantly more receptive

2764157 jaswir was just like a rubber ki gudiya in the performance amazing compliment for jaswir jaswir got perfect 10 for the performance from both the judges
2764158 its so much easier to attack the person than attack the argument but to be fair dumpy isnt competent in even knowing what the arguments are or even who is making them so who can blame him
2764159 trough a dip that is being compounded by a problem in defence that norths small forwards tellingly exposed
2764160 every week even the ones we lost weve played some good football we were equal with geelong at half time 14 points down against carlton we played some very good footy last week and we played some very good football today so theres form there
2764161 its not like no one is playing well or no one is playing well in fits and bursts they are playing well its just that we need a consistent effort over four quarters
2764162 i know the media build us up a bit but we are a workmanlike side we need to have our pressure up we need to work hard if we dont we lose
2764163 we had a bit of a cracker of a break
2764164 campo gave me the evil eyes when he walked into the dressing sheds he had obviously heard about missing the record
2764165 i just thought give herbie a go that was pretty disappointing on my behalf but we didnt know it at the time
2764166 when the fox tv guys were talking to me after the game they let me know
2764167 i was surprised to tell you the truth when all the boys are playing like that the last thing on your mind is breaking records
2764168 tonguey apologised to me but it doesnt bother me they just said herbie was next in line for the kick and he got man of the match so give him one to put him on the scoring list
2764169 i got man of the match but im sure campo will be players player
2764170 he played great and hes been playing great at the back end of the season
2764171 our stats man whispered in my ear but herbie already had the shot lined up
2764172 i said oh well well let it run obviously if wed known earlier we would have sent the message out there to let campo take it
2764173 if we are able to make the eight and weve got a fair bit of work to do that the challenge is being able to play against the better sides
2764174 if you look at is this year we havent gone consistently well against the top four sides so thats a challenge thats further down the track
2764175 from the seasons perspective we all know how the premiership table is tightening up so it was a pretty critical game for both clubs
2764176 its good for us because a win makes it a bit better for andrew great for him
2764177 we kicked over 100 points in those conditions and for our forward line to have 12 goal scorers weve just got to keep finding ways of making sure we can kick a score
2764178 were bitterly disappointed with our performance season on the line stuff and to come over and not play our game style was disappointing
2764179 it started virtually from the first kick of the game
2764180 but ill assess my options when i return to australia if there are any
2764181 i cant ever remember one coming up as short as him in an opening market
2764182 usually you expect the favourite to come up around the 10 or 12 mark and id say 8 is about as short as i can remember
2764183 ill be surprised if hes not around the 2 1 mark come race day last year we had maldivian around 2 75 on the day because of his form and the good handicap before he hurt himself in the barriers
2764184 weekend hussler would go in to the caulfield cup with about 56kg and i dont think it will be a difficulty at all he just wins and wins by panels and the further he goes the better he will get
2764185 i think even 80 per cent fit he will beat them this weekend on raw ability i can see him going through this campaign undefeated
2764186 he claimed in his book that he should have got his chance in our first xi sooner than he did and that when he got a go he did fantastically well but his scores were more mediocre than fantastic i always say to guys prove me wrong pick yourself
2764187 he improved after he left school he got stronger and ended up playing for natal schools since then he has grown incredibly as a batsman he was very aggressive when i knew him but not a match winner
2764188 he was young for his year which im sure affected his development but always had a word for somebody id call it confidence rather than arrogance
2764189 i get great delight when he scores a hundred because i know why he left south africa which is to be measured for what hes worth and theres a lot of sportsmen disappearing in south africa because they cant be
2764190 kevin has gone overseas determined to prove the system here is wrong i take my hat off to him for that
2764191 he was 18 and wouldnt have been in our set up if he hadnt been talented
2764192 what stood out in his innings against england of 61 not out for natal in 1999 was how cleanly he hit the ball shaun pollock said hed never seen a guy hit the ball so cleanly at that age
2764193 at the end of the season he was offered a one year contract for not a substantial amount and had the chance to go to england i was not surprised he went he had a british passport and it was an option
2764194 as long as he could put to rest in his own mind that if he never played for south africa he could live with that then going to england was an opportunity to have a good career
2764195 i was led to believe he was a batter but kevin desperately wanted to bowl
2764196 he would ring me on a friday asking to bowl more overs but we had two spinners and his off spin was inconsistent there was a certain arrogance though that is not a bad thing
2764197 he did very well with the bat it was unfortunate that he left early natal was touring western australia because he missed us clinching the title that season was the pinnacle for us kevin made a lot of friends though he had difficulties with the club over money
2764198 i wouldnt want to take the credit but maybe that season was when he began to think of himself chiefly as a batsman
2764199 the conditions were bowler friendly and carl greenidge bowled really well and quickly all their batsmen struggled all except one carl dropped slightly short and pietersen hooked it miles over square leg it flew out of the ground over some trees and knocked the tiles off the roof of a house it made us all sit up
2764200 matthew hayden hadnt arrived so i was leading the side
2764201 we played again in a one dayer at the end of the season it was my last match at northampton as i was retiring and we had a party after the game and kevin came along i know hes not everyones cup of tea but he seemed a nice guy to me i admire his self belief and work ethic
2764202 he had an unusual style unique really for a tall guy he got very low to drive and he hit the ball as hard as anyone
2764203 rod marsh was head of the academy and i spoke to him regularly while the england a team were in india the team did not do well but pietersen had a very good tour rod spoke a lot about him
2764204 shortly after he qualified we picked him for a one day series in zimbabwe and duncan fletcher the england coach was so impressed he wanted to find a way to get him on the south africa tour
2764205 this happened when andrew flintoff returned home injured from the one dayers then it was like a one man show pietersen scoring hundreds on his own batting in an extraordinarily controlled way
2764206 kevin didnt get off to a great start in zimbabwe
2764207 he has been quoted as saying that he wants to improve every day and he means it
2764208 the personnel coming in and out makes it hard its the chemistry of the guys they have played together a fair bit but they are coming in and out
2764209 without the consistency of personnel it is really hard to get that consistency of game style instead of leo barry next to you you have heath grundy or teddy richards its no disrespect to them its just that different personnel do different things
2764210 a lot of teams are at our heels at the moment so it keeps that little buffer with a few of the teams below
2764211 tonight when we review the game and analyse it and have a really good crack against geelong next week well look back on this game as being a month out from the finals as the one that turned it for us
2764212 it has been an extraordinary year for the track no racing at all for more than three months at one point then no horses at all for two months
2764213 thats five months all up i just want to hear horses walking about the place again
2764214 the world youth day organisation hands the track back to the jockey club on sunday august 24
2764215 we have a very busy two week schedule left but i am pleased with the progress and i can see no reason why we wont finish in time
2764216 god is not mocked whatsoever a man soweth that shall he also reap
2764217 i expected a fast race because i wanted to attack my personal best
2764218 entering the final straight i didnt know they were so far behind it was mentally tough for me tonight but i was ready to pull out a great victory it was my world championships today
2764219 the victory was very important for me but i want to run against the top guys
2764220 i came home and everybody was telling me you are the best so it was very important for me to win today i had a very simple plan my coach told me to stay in the middle of the pack and then to attack at the end
2764221 the piste is good but its tough to say if its fast because everyone is tired from worlds and not necessarily on form
2764222 its new so the track is still quite thick i prefer it when its a bit worn
2764223 its good to be back on the track a very good feeling
2764224 the time is no surprise to me because i was working hard at the world championships
2764225 im going to just try to stay patient to relax
2764226 ill try to stay off my feet for a couple of hours
2764227 what contemptible scoundrel has stolen the cork to my lunch
2764228 no doubt that the mood has darkened in the last two or three months
2764229 a year ago it seemed reasonable to hope that the worst would be over by now this has turned out not to be the case
2764230 the cbi along with most other forecasters has been consistently over optimistic about the economic outlook over the past 12 months
2764231 nhl for 15 years brought young players from europe first and foremost from russia i think that it is time to end this simply put time to stop robbing us
2764232 before his three season tenure in toronto that included only one playoff appearance maurice spent nine seasons with hartford carolina he turned a perennial also ran into a consistent winner
2764233 up to 12 battery packs can be fitted within slots in the syntactic foam which make up the centre section of the vehicle
2764234 it is the worlds deepest volcanic ridge and totally unexplored
2764235 will sample fluids and sediments from around the lip of the vents to test their geochemistry and also collect animal specimens
2764236 the temperatures around these hydrothermal vents were so hot because they were so deep dr copley said they could be hotter than 500 c 930 f and if they are that hot they will probably have quite different chemistry and life forms we expect to find new species the researchers expect that at depths greater than 3 000m one in every two animals they come across will be a species new to science
2764237 our goal is to offer the best customer service and the widest range of pop culture items on ebay at down to earth prices
2764238 high performing site specific search engine on just about every content rich web site that is worth its salt
2764239 with a growing mass of web content from blogs news sites image and video archives personal web sites and more internet users have an option to turn not only to the major search engines but also to search engines on individual sites as vehicles to reach the information they are looking for
2764240 i would speculate that theres so much information out there that no other organizational tool can manage the volumes of content that people online consume
2764241 search has become an essential utility for almost all internet users

2764290 we are setting records and we are definitely breaking year on year footfall figures
2764291 it was an exceedingly busy saturday the fifth busiest of the year to date even though we had so many visitors it was spread over a 12 hour day the malls were never crowded and there was plenty of room
2764292 we are definitely breaking year on year records for footfall
2764293 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2764294 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2764295 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2764296 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2764297 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2764298 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2764299 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2764300 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2764322 un contraste ahurissant entre la f te grandiose et la magnificence des jo et la terreur qui continue r gner non seulement lhassa mais presque sur lensemble du tibet historique

2764329 une nouvelle session est pr vue en octobre apr s les jo ce sera une rencontre charni re
2764330 le dala lama et le pr sident fran ais ont convenu que provoquer le gouvernement chinois avec une rencontre au moment des jeux nam nerait quun durcissement de la position des chinois
2764331 une rencontre mutuellement d sir e entre le dala lama et le pr sident sarkozy va se faire cette ann e apr s les jeux dans un climat beaucoup plus favorable sans que cela soit ressentie comme une gifle
2764332 il faut faire comprendre la chine que cest dans son int r t dans son souci de stabilit et dunit de r pondre aux aspirations l gitimes des tib tains

2764337 i appeared the other day on fox business network to debate alexis glick and tracy byrnes about a new study citing an increase in female unhappiness at age 48
2764338 why do you think women are relationship experts perfect little angels who have no faults why do you automatically assume men are the culprits
2764339 women havent even voted for 100 years and we men should cut them a break
2764340 qu barbaridades m s gordas tiene que estar de co a
2764341 la eclosi n liberal por qu los progres est n nerviosos
2764342 las trampas que nos han tendido y que han servido para colocarnos ante la opini n p blica en posiciones que no son las nuestras y para que al votante desenga ado del psoe le resulte dif cil dar el paso de votar a
2764343 es que si hay que acumular puntos de islamopgoggetagismo t sumas un bonus
2764344 if you take full advantage of its aggregator compatibility for example you can force a single tweet to appear in your friends stream up to 15 times
2764345 if you step into this arena youll see a thing of beauty its really a thing of absolute beauty
2764346 its a perfect depth because if its too deep you lose your sense of vision and where youre at in the pool but its just deep enough to where the waves dissipate and the turbulence dissipates down to the bottom
2764347 its physics and its not sports but it makes sense
2764348 you make a deeper and a wider pool and you give all of those waves and all of that splashing and all of that moving water a chance to move away from the swimmers and get out of their way which makes them go faster its as simple as that
2764349 everything is just fantastic about this pool ive never seen such a big facility in my life and you get a great feeling walking into that facility knowing that this is where the olympic games are held
2764350 technology has really kind of tapped out as far as the building of these kinds of facilities
2764351 its not like track and field where the types of tracks just get faster and faster because i guess there is more spring to them
2764352 but i dont know how you make fast water its just not possible
2764353 el llamado voto til benefici a la derecha regal ndole

2764356 en el peor de los casos mariano va a subir

2764358 s lo apoyar al gobierno si el gobierno busca derrotar a eta
2764359 las v ctimas han muerto por lo que yo defiendo han muerto por mis ideales
2764360 respondi zapatero dejando las cosas claras si tanto se ha
2764361 s por eso se empe aron en atribuirle el 11 m
2764362 se preocupa por los problemas reales de los espa oles
2764363 me voy a preocupar por los problemas reales de los espa oles
2764364 al enumerar las ocasiones en que el pp hab a utilizado pol ticamente el terrorismo etarra entre otras hab an usado el problema terrorista incluso para justificar su apoyo a la invasi n de iraq con aquello de que
2764365 no s qui n le habr dicho que toque este tema
2764366 usted gan unas elecciones con iraq y el 11 m y parece que quiera volver a ganarlas con lo mismo
2764367 de haberlo hecho hubiera ganado muchos enteros pero lo suyo es
2764368 el sistema es una mierda lo que hay que hacer es no votar para que se enteren los pol ticos
2764369 soy del psoe de toda la vida pero zp me ha traicionado por romper espa a y rendirse a la etabatasuna as que me quedo en casa

2764373 c mo vienen ustedes a vendernos que contendr n las subidas de precios si no hicieron
2764374 en fin que zapatero di buenas respuestas pero no profundiz en ellas con lo que no aprovech su efecto y as quedaron la mayor parte de los temas en tablas
2764375 pero de los 45 de zp hay que restar 10 puntos de iu y nacionalistas as que rajoy de puta madre
2764376 se ha pasado 4 a os hablando de que se rompe espa a de de juana chaos y que se destruye la familia y a un mes de las elecciones ha descubierto la econom a y se ha puesto a improvisar propuestas econ micas despu s de 4 a os ignorando esos temas
2764377 en el d a de hoy cautivo y desarmado el ej rcito faccioso han alcanzado las tropas republicanas sus ltimos objetivos militares la guerra ha terminado
2764378 mira c mo se desploma zapatero mientras rajoy aguanta como un campe n
2764379 la mitad de los contribuyentes no se beneficiar a de la devoluci n del irpf que promete zapatero
2764380 5 millones de espa oles se beneficiar n de la reducci n del irpf que promete rajoy
2764381 la mayor a de los espa oles no se beneficiar an de la reforma fiscal de rajoy
2764382 todo dicho con un tono de desd n y desprecio entre la risa jijiji y la mirada por encima del hombro como dando a entender que ese es un foro de mindundis
2764383 ha dicho usted que si pierde las elecciones no piensa dimitir
2764384 its not easy but we have to try to do the right thing

2764402 el talante de zapatero se ha convertido en el fascismo que niega sus derechos a partidos y ciudadanos
2764403 y no se puede decir que zp fuera m s

2764633 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
2764634 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market

2764641 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort

2764645 then the sons are exempt but so that we may not offend them go to the lake and throw out your line take the first fish you catch open its mouth and you will find a four drachma coin take it and give it to them for my tax and yours

2764647 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2764648 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2764649 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
2764650 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
2764651 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
2764652 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
2764653 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
2764654 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
2764655 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
2764656 ive been assured by newpage that they are quite happy with the performance of the point tupper mill
2764657 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
2764658 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
2764659 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
2764660 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
2764661 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
2764662 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
2764663 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
2764664 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2764665 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy

2764669 the childrens hospital is a matter that im concerned about and thats why ive met with the district manager to express my very strong desire to see an improved performance
2764670 this is the first time we have seen a significant improvement in elective surgery waiting lists in a number of years
2764671 it is inevitable that these results will go up and down but to see an improvement of this magnitude gives me confidence that queensland health really is turning the corner with significant investment in new facilities and new staff
2764672 surgery connect should only be used as a stopgap measure
2764673 the health minister is constantly praising himself for employing more and more staff but he is heavily relying on private hospitals to treat sick queenslanders
2764674 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
2764675 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
2764676 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
2764677 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
2764678 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
2764679 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
2764680 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
2764681 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
2764682 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
2764683 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
2764684 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2764685 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
2764686 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
2764687 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
2764688 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
2764689 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
2764690 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
2764691 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2764692 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2764693 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
2764694 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
2764695 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
2764696 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
2764697 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
2764698 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
2764699 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors

2764720 after three years its unbelievable that everything is taking so long to get moving
2764721 for people who want to come home rent is more expensive utilities are more expensive everythings more expensive nobodys doing anything to get people home a lot of people are in bad health because of stress
2764722 the problem is that too many people have their hand in the cookie jar
2764723 a lot of people are thinking too much about themselves and not looking at the bigger picture that goes for city government all the way up to the federal government politicians will promise you the world but when it comes down to it its politics as usual
2764724 we dont want songs running through heads outside the show we dont want to be waking up in the morning and by mistake start singing phantom of the opera in the shower and ive never had that
2764725 when the show started the melodies were constantly going through my head
2764726 and i would wake up in the middle of the night and hear some tunes my son loved the music so much it was playing on the radio every time i came home i had to ask him not to play it but then after a few weeks i got to the point where if somebody asked me to sing something from the show i couldnt do it somehow my brain just repressed it
2764727 ive always had nightmares of not being able to get to the theatre being stuck somewhere or harp breaks
2764728 playing music and listening to music is not exactly the same thing
2764729 its a wonderfully written harp part theres one little chord i have the audience would never know the difference but there are nights where i arpeggiate the chord exactly right there are places all through the show where i really am satisfied if i play it the way i like to play it
2764730 i know in my body when im supposed to be playing when im not playing i read books i study languages and when i pick up the instrument again its a little like tourettes syndrome i drop the book and blat out a few notes on trumpet and pick up the book again
2764731 there was a moment with the pyrotechnics theres a flash when phantom disappears and a spark from the explosion went and landed in the hair of the oboist she was uninjured but there was some damage to her hair which the hair department took care of theyre experts in that field
2764732 i think manufacturers who make money should do all they can to make their products safe
2764733 this is just one step it ought to be banned for everything
2764734 many common everyday products could disappear from grocery stores all across california
2764735 decisions about these products ought to be evaluated through a more rigorous scientific process than debated in legislatures
2764736 the assertion is somehow were going to ban some material thats going to keep food fresh and safe thats a terrible thing to say and its not true
2764737 we should definitely take steps to limit our exposure to the substance
2764738 anything we can do to reduce bisphenol a could potentially have big payoffs to protecting human health

2764771 a n quedan bastantes cosecheros locales y comarcales que no tienen por qu pasar por los grandes y oscuros circuitos comerciales de las corporaciones monopolistas de los alimentos
2764772 de esta manera se puede acercar al consumidor alimentos mas sanos a la vez que tambi n con un buen acuerdo ganar m s ambas partes al romper la tremenda distancia que imponen las multinacionales entre el precio del productor al consumidor
2764773 a n les falta el valor para que definitivamente el consumidor que no desee alimentarse y meter en su cuerpo alimentos y organismos manipulados gen ticamente como como az cares aceites y almidones que est n en porcentaje muy alto de alimentos por falta de un etiquetado real que los identifique

2764775 no sintonizan a pesar de que el portavoz de la calle g nova el valenciano estaban gonz lez pons ha sido miembro destacado de los populares valencianos
2764776 no concuerdan con las declaraciones de dirigentes populares como el conseller de agricultura pesca y alimentaci n juan cotino que defienden la gesti n de los aeropuertos valencianos
2764777 ha dicho abiertamente que no est de acuerdo con ninguna regla t cnica si no sirve para incluir a manises y el altet en el paquete de gesti n auton mica sin reparar a cuantos aeropuertos m s afectar a
2764778 la falta de visi n global de cotino es significativa y marca de forma clara las diferencias y contradicciones con el pp nacional
2764779 hace unos d as ya se evidenci esta falta de conexi n cuando el portavoz gonz lez pons hizo declaraciones en la misma sede de los populares valencianos rechazando cualquier tipo de variaci n en la actual gesti n de los aeropuertos
2764780 una vez m s a cotino a que reflexione antes de hablar
2764781 este fin de semana ha estado poco afortunado en todas sus declaraciones
2764782 este horizonte de fuerte discrepancia que ha materializado tan claramente entre la pol tica dom stica del consell y la pol tica general del pp nacional le puede costar un tir n de orejas
2764783 las razones del pp nacional est n claras porque s lo quiere molestar a la enemiga de rajoy esperanza aguirre y a adir una piedra m s a las relaciones del gobierno central con la generalitat
2764784 si todas las iniciativas del consell tienen el mismo respaldo de la direcci n ubicada en g nova es evidente que la relaci n entre camps y rajoy ha llegado al l mite aceptable del deterioro

2764835 but they arent taking into account what that revenue could later buy for the states
2764836 weve given them the benefit of the doubt for a long time
2764837 a sales tax free weekend will be welcomed more than ever in this tough economy especially with the high prices of food and fuel

2764870 the roman catholic family can be described today as dysfunctional toxic or abusive

2764873 a lot of the old parishioners dont consider the new ones parishioners at all
2764874 our fight was about property but never about religion the people who have come here since then are here for different reasons where are they taking this church
2764875 theres a group of parishioners who have been there a long time and who dont like change

2764878 if you hire someone who doesnt follow along the dotted line
2764879 you cant expect him to follow it when you want him to
2764880 i think its worth it to keep him there because who else are we going to get as a priest
2764881 we dont have six other priests knocking on our door asking to get in there
2764882 we need food to eat cars to drive places to live
2764883 no one has an ambition to create a new denomination
2764884 my vision is to be roman catholic and wait for the regime to collapse

2764899 airlines everywhere are struggling with the current price of oil but the solution to their problems should not lie in an anti competitive agreement which will inevitably lead to less competition and higher fares
2764900 ba and aa will argue that their alliance is now acceptable because the competitive environment has changed with the open skies accord on uk us routes this is a complete red herring open skies which is only a temporary accord as it may be unwound in 2010 has not significantly increased competition on uk london us routes
2764901 neither is the current economic slowdown a justification for waiving through any application the job of the regulators is to assess the long term impact of the alliance on competition not to provide special protection from the immediate challenges of the economic cycle with which every other airline has to deal with
2764902 ba aa would have a combination of high frequencies and a transatlantic network that could not be replicated by any other airline alliance and which would make it impossible for other carriers to compete for time sensitive corporate or business travelers
2764903 we now have a similar situation at new york airports with government imposed restrictions the heathrow new york jfk route is by far the most important transatlantic market accounting for over 25 of the total heathrow us market

2764974 perkara ini tidak akan didedahkan kepada masyarakat umum kerana ini akan mengundang interpretasi yang pelbagai dan implikasi negatif
2764975 memang apa pun sistem yang ada ada kelemahan tetapi tidak mustahil untuk kita boleh memperbaikinya tetapi bukan dengan cara menyanggah daripada orang lain merujuk kepada majlis peguam yang tidak patut mencampuri hak dalam hal ehwal kita
2764976 mereka boleh memberi pandangan tetapi biarlah dengan bijaksana bukan dengan bersikap kurang ajar seperti yang ditunjukkan dalam forum itu
2764977 kita berharap biar pun jika terdapat beberapa kelonggaran atau kelemahan dalam undang undang atau organisasi yang melaksanakan perundangan ini ia harus dibincangkan dengan kami bukan dengan membangkitkan dalam satu forum terbuka dengan memanggil wartawan luar negara

2764983 as one cataclysmic moment beware of such moments but as an endless succession of surprises moving zigzag toward a more decent society we dont have to engage in grand heroic actions to participate in the process of change small acts when multiplied by millions of people can transform the world
2764984 i am totally confident not that the world will get better but that we should not give up the game before all the cards have been played the metaphor is deliberate life is a gamble not to play is to foreclose any chance of winning to play to act is to create at least a possibility of changing the world

2765104 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2765105 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2765106 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2765107 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2765108 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2765109 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2765110 i dont just say no to anybody because id hope that people wouldnt say no to me just because im an actor but they would have to be pretty extraordinary

2765128 today is raining and tomorrow will have rain too that will help reduce the air pollution level we believe the current air flow will be helpful in the dispersion of pollutants in the air
2765129 on the day of opening ceremonies we had rain clouds in the southwest and northwest they were moving closer to the birds nest and there was a high probability of rain
2765130 we wanted our daughter to know her parents were married that was the big thing for us
2765131 our journey to parenthood was not easy cheap or fun
2765132 the result however has been the most amazing experience in the world being called daddy and dad by our loving daughter
2765133 all the realms involved with men are much more complex
2765134 for future generations knowing they can fall in love get married have a child absolutely that will become a way of life more than it is
2765135 as a couple with kids you really see the importance of it trying to get as many protections as you can

2765147 it comes from africa and it arrives in the swiss banks thats all you need to know
2765148 there is a desire to deal with this but the question is how
2765149 home depot can track every 2 by 4 to its forest of origin
2765150 you can track every bag of coffee every diamond to a specific diamond field but for gold theres nothing
2765151 if i have one wish its that i might someday have a little bit of money
2765152 sometimes i dream that one day ill own something made of gold
2765153 i wont be happy until i am more famous than god

2765176 i lament the loss of a ferociously funny and hardcore family man my thoughts are with his wife rhonda and their family
2765177 the world just got a little less funny he will be dearly missed
2765178 bernie mac was one of the best and funniest comedians to ever live but that was the second best thing he did bernie was one of the greatest friends a person could have losing him is like losing 12 people because he absolutely filled up any room he was in im gonna miss the mac man
2765179 its hard to put into words just how i feel and what a painful loss this is bernie was a brother a friend and one of the comic masters of our time sharing the marquee with him during the phenomenon of the bonded us like family and created a unique moment in comic history marking some of the most meaningful memorable and fun times of our lives his comedic approach was his own brand and will definitely stand the test of time the level of his talent always inspired me and other comedians to bring their a game i promise you that you never wanted to be the guy who had to follow bernies set as a husband and father he was the man and my thoughts and prayers are with his family he will truly be missed but so well remembered
2765180 this is a very sad day for many of us who knew and loved bernie he brought so much joy to so many he will be missed but heaven just got funnier
2765181 we are heartbroken he will be deeply missed he was a wonderful kind and gentle man
2765182 its a tremendous loss because of his age and the fact that he was such a vital original human being when i use the word original i really mean it he was like no other person i knew he lived his life to the fullest even when we were on the set of oceans he had his own little apartment and he cooked and invited people to lunch every day and he had food that was for everybody he made very exotic things his conversations were always different than any conversations i had with anyone else they were very family oriented he talked about his wife and children with such love and its very hard to believe that hes not with us anymore
2765183 his passing is such a major loss to the acting and comedy communities bernie mac was the personification of the word real he kept it real that kind of genuine spirit that he carried all the time cannot be easily duplicated but i will do my very best to try
2765184 bernie mac was a gifted talent whose comedy came from an authentic and highly personal place he was a tremendous live performer and a wonderful actor fox was proud to be the home of the bernie mac show and all of us at fox and 20th century fox television extend our deepest sympathies to his wife rhonda and daughter jeniece
2765185 bernies style of comedy was bold courageous and revolutionary i never knew anyone who loved to be funny as much as bernie he will most definitely be very missed
2765186 it goes without saying that bernie was one of the preeminent comedians of our generation he was also an attentive husband a great father and loving grandfather i feel blessed to have shared years of friendship with bernie mac and im honored to have finally costarred with him in what i consider to be his finest cinematic acting achievement my sincere prayer is that his family will be comforted by the warmth of love from all of us who knew and respected this man
2765187 bernie mac was a brilliant performer whose legacy will bring laughter to all of us for many years to come the thoughts of everyone at the weinstein company and hugh downs reports
2765188 the worst thing that happens to you can be the best thing for you if you dont let it get the best of you

2765191 russian officials believe that it was the usa that orchestrated the current conflict the chairman of the state duma committee for security vladimir vasilyev believes that the current conflict is south ossetia is very reminiscent to the wars in iraq and kosovo

2765193 known for its extensive links to albanian and european crime syndicates the kla was supported from the outset in the mid 1990s by the cia and germanys intelligence agency the bundes nachrichten dienst bnd in the course of the 1999 war the kla was supported directly by nato
2765194 the kla had extensive links to al qaeda which was also involved in military training mujahideen mercenaries from a number of countries integrated the ranks of the kla which was involved in terrorist activities as well as political assassinations
2765195 the things that were happening in kosovo the things that were happening in iraq we are now following the same path the further the situation unfolds the more the world will understand that georgia would never be able to do all this without america south ossetian defense officials used to make statements about imminent aggression from georgia but the latter denied everything whereas the us department of state released no comments on the matter in essence they have prepared the force which destroys everything in south ossetia attacks civilians and hospitals they are responsible for this the world community will learn about it
2765196 the rapid increase in us strategic influence in the caucasus has alarmed russian policy planners moscow is keen to take steps to shore up its eroding position in the region however russian officials have limited options with which to counter us moves while at the same time maintaining cordial relations with washington
2765197 the most prominent us moves in the caucasus are the decision to dispatch military advisers to georgia and a march 29 state department announcement on the lifting of an arms embargo imposed on armenia and azerbaijan both actions have the potential to tilt the military establishments of all three caucasus nations away from russia and towards nato
2765198 the rose revolution was not a simple uprising but was aided by the cia and ambassador richard miles think serbia from early 2002 onwards the cia had been operating in georgia supposedly to combat al qaeda
2765199 spokesmen for the state department and the c i a declined to confirm that mr woodruff was working for the intelligence agency but high ranking administration officials said he was adding that he was not spying on georgian officials but was training mr eduard shevardnadzes security forces

2765203 a deadly firefight between georgian troops and separatists in a russian backed breakaway region ahead of rices arrival a senior state department official who did not want to be identified told reporters that unchecked conflict in the region could lead to catastrophe the official also said moscow should realize its soviet empire is gone
2765204 in addition to the spy drones israel has also been supplying georgia with infantry weapons and electronics for artillery systems and has helped upgrade soviet designed su 25 ground attack jets assembled in georgia according to koba liklikadze an independent military expert based in tbilisi former israeli generals also serve as advisers to the georgian military
2765205 georgian administration has found the use to its arms which they have been purchasing during the recent several years we have repeatedly warned that the international community should not turn a blind eye on massive purchases of offensive arms in which the georgian administration has been involved during the recent two years

2765223 t his interview will open many peoples eyes it will shake islam from the roots and im not exaggerating
2765224 what other case do you know where a son of a hamas leader who was raised on the tenets of extremist islam comes out against it
2765225 a verse like love thine enemy had a great influence on me
2765226 at this stage i was still a muslim and i thought that i would remain one but
2765227 i studied islam more thoroughly and found no answers there i re examined the koran and the principals of the faith and found how it is mistaken and misleading
2765228 the people who supposedly represent the religion admired mohammed more than god killed innocent people in the name of islam beat their wives and dont have any idea what god is
2765229 i have no doubt that theyll go to hell i have a message for them there is only one way to paradise the way of jesus who sacrificed himself on the cross for all of us
2765230 i felt responsible it was better for me to be there rather than a gang of fools who would poison his mind
2765231 i tried to understand those people their thoughts in order to change them from inside by means of a strong person like my father who admitted to me in the past that he does not support suicide attacks
2765232 nobody knows them and how they operate as well as i do
2765233 then in prison i understood that not everyone in hamas is like my father hes a nice friendly man but i discovered how evil his colleagues are
2765234 after my release i lost the faith i had in those who ostensibly represented islam
2765235 you jews should be aware you will never but never have peace with hamas
2765236 islam as the ideology that guides them will not allow them to achieve a peace agreement with the jews they believe that tradition says that the prophet mohammed fought against the jews and that therefore they must continue to fight them to the death
2765237 in palestinian culture a suicide terrorist becomes a hero a martyr sheiks tell their students about the heroism of the shaheeds martyr
2765238 they hamas are blind and ignorant its true there are good and bad people everywhere but hamas supporters dont understand that they are led by a wicked and cruel group that brainwashes the children and gets them to believe that if they carry out a suicide attack theyll get to paradise

2765240 now the price of building materials is rocketing sky high we can cut down the price by half as we dont use sands and rocks to make our building materials
2765241 we are trying to create the third type of brick from household waste called elaston after sand and clay bricks
2765242 this technology has been proven effective in containing pollution and safeguard the environment and has been accepted in europe it is also widely used in australia
2765243 even the construction of burj dubai the soon to be tallest building in the world uses elaston it is called german stone in dubai
2765244 production will increase between 10 per cent and 15 per cent annually

2765250 we are using the online platform to make this a reality it is not an easy task but we are sure it can be achieved
2765251 lately there has been wide promotion on the world halal market the trading in dinar complements religious requirement and fits the final piece into this halal transaction
2765252 that was our first factory out of germany and we have seen increased revenue in asia since as malaysia is well equipped and has an ideal location to market our products particularly in the asean region

2765254 after the economic crisis in 1998 however the export business was expanded
2765255 today between 80 per cent and 90 per cent of vogelsitze malaysias revenue come from exports
2765256 a proper food court with systematic food court management at universities would allow undergraduates in various courses to do practical training

2765259 the average sales improved from rm400 000 a month to the current average of rm1 4 million a month
2765260 the employee who i promised i would not name has been an employee there for a very long time and the employee gave me a run down of how things have changed at the refinery since the hiring of a new manager who seems to have questionable people skills according to this employee this new plant manager made everything personal and began threatening the union president and the union safety rep basically telling them they would be gone in 3 months allegedly in two instances in the recent past the company refused to act to resolve problems with equipment and procedures in the handling of benzene which is a known carcinogen the safety rep had to ask for the quebec worker safety board to intervene and they did supposedly when this happened became personal and the manager then decided to remove the safety rep in an industry where companies like petro canada makes billions in profits youd think they wouldnt have a problem putting up the money for simple safety but of course this is the same company that rolled back these workers wages in 2001
2765261 as you surely know i and my coworkers are still locked out despite the fact that the truth about the real reasons are slowly coming out a recent interview with ron brenneman exposed the reason for our lock out the national pattern is the target and we are the fall guys in this absurd game despite having 3 judgements in our favor at the labour relations board of which i will will include the links to petro canada is still defying the orders and continues to use scabs and continues to lie to the media as to the real reasons for the lock out here then are the links the documents are in french here i can tell you that they have brought workers in from all over the country and seemingly from outside as well they have deliberately delayed our entry into the refinery for up to an hour which of course gave them ample time to replace the scabs we overheard on the radios with others this is a sad sad revelation of just how far they have gone to destroy us i have had confirmation that the majority of the scabs have been paid in excess of now hold on to something 300 000 so far this year meanwhile the company has been lying to the media and having them repeat it that we earn 120 000 a year which is a lie the highest salary for a unionized worker is about 85 000 and that is for someone who is a replacement or acting foreperson it would take many hours of overtime to earn 120 000 for sure a safe guess would be 600 700 hours of overtime
2765262 if canadians knew the truth about this lock out that they would not rally to support us by selling their under performing petro canada stocks and by boycotting at the pumps
2765263 this includes the rm1 65 million poseidon borealis full ships bridge simulator a norwegian expert will install the hardware this month
2765264 we honour the contract signed with the pahang state government and we stick to the raw water purchase rate
2765265 i was informed that the pipe linkage between pahang and selangor could materialise by 2012
2765266 we hope to complete the restructuring by the end of the year
2765267 this is where the statement cheaper than air faster than sea comes about
2765268 as maskargo is known for its efficiency and reliability we were chosen to handle this because our customers know that their cargo will be in good hands
2765269 the arabs may be fewer in kuala lumpur but they have spread themselves around malaysia
2765270 in 2005 tourism malaysia adopted a strategy to encourage the middle east visitors to go beyond kuala lumpur the word out there in the arab world was that kuala lumpur hotels were full during the season
2765271 august looks like it will be pretty busy for the first three weeks and then occupancy tapers off in the last week
2765272 the average length of stay of arab tourists has also shortened they used to stay in kuala lumpur for about two weeks now it is only for seven or eight days
2765273 our business continues as normal we will stay focus and overcome the hurdles during bad times our philosophy is to provide great food and service by employing good staff and treating them right by getting them involved in the business
2765274 with crap we can maintain cost despite inflation and there is no compromise on quality and service
2765275 while unfortunate our technical team is working closely with orbital sciences intelsat corp the launch services provider and sealaunch intelsats subcontractor to ascertain the most prudent approach to repair the spacecraft and prepare it for a revised launch date
2765276 there is a misconception about how we become overweight and what constitutes proper nutrition with slim shots helping people effectively exercise portion control and the nutritional guidance i offer the opportunity for behavioral and physical transformation just increases dramatically
2765277 to be quite honest our strategy is to grow faster than the market if the market is growing at eight per cent we aim to grow at 12 per cent
2765278 to some extent we have to do that because we have the largest order book coming in the next three to four years
2765279 whatever happens to the freight rate we know we have to keep driving the unit cost down we need to work closely with the key hub ports that we got and westports is one of them
2765280 we need now to look at all markets namely sabah and sarawak the east coast of peninsular as well as penang we need to feed in or make sure we have the service capability whether by feeder or rail to bring in that business into port klang which is our hub port we are looking at all possible sources of revenue
2765281 to see where we can fit into their global sourcing and shipping patterns
2765282 we are expecting close to 20 per cent growth for westports and we should be pretty much there
2765283 we are looking forward to developing cnc in port klang and integrating it with the other group services that we got
2765284 there is a lot of uncertainty at the moment i think you can see signs of some lines cutting back a little a bit on capacity maybe cutting on one or two services
2765285 queda de manifiesto que se ha atentado a uno de los rewe correspondiente al territorio lafkenche lago budi por la carretera de la costa en la comuna de saavedra
2765286 por tanto se denuncia al estado y al gobierno de chile por no escuchar y hacer caso omiso a nuestras peticiones para evitar la construcci n de la carretera en nuestros espacios sagrados y la incapacidad de solucionar los graves problemas existentes en los diferentes territorios de nuestro pueblo

2765291 defenderemos hasta las ltimas consecuencias nuestras tierras y espacios sagrados
2765292 comenzando por el se or alcalde de puerto saavedra sr ricardo tripainao calfulaf por cuanto l fue quien autoriz y propici la construcci n de dicha carretera usando a las personas con enga o diciendo mejoramiento de camino pasando por encima de los estudios de impactos ambiental sociocultural llevado a cabo por la universidad de la frontera adem s el ministerio de obras p blicas y la intendencia estaban en conocimiento de los hechos y acontecimientos acaecidos en dicho territorio
2765293 no queremos que avance un metro mas la carretera porque fue un gran enga o del se or alcalde ricardo tripainao diciendo que era mejoramiento de camino esto no es mejoramiento de camino sino que derechamente una carretera

2765295 lo que proponemos como alternativa es que la carretera pueda pasar por otra v a
2765296 nosotros no estamos en contra del camino porque es necesario pero queremos que se respeten los lugares sagrados
2765297 obviously anyone would love to be part of an organization like rcr
2765298 i always try to be up front about this stuff but the fact is nothing is signed and im still talking to other teams
2765299 i certainly hope so the sooner the better were very close on a couple of things
2765300 but if it was on a team that had the personnel and equipment to make the car fast enough to qualify it might be a possibility

2765331 even oil producing countries which have been importing refined oil could make policy decisions to start their own refinery to save on transport costs
2765332 if the price of oil isnt bad enough the shortage of seafaring staff has also contributed to ballooning costs as the immediate response is to accelerate wage levels
2765333 current tight credit conditions will also mean high financing costs for owners embarking on a growth strategy

2765414 while we are democrats and republicans in our hearts we are all idahoans
2765415 one of the hardest things weve had to do here is taking off our party hats
2765416 this is outrageous the people of idaho are entitled to have their representatives base their votes on the merits of a bill not on who backed the loser in a speakers contest
2765417 there was one of those six projects that was removed altogether why because the senator and the representatives from that district were from the wrong political party we need to take a step back

2765426 were really stuck with the idea that we want to look progressive and modern and cosmopolitan but we also want to play up our romantic past
2765427 in 1908 denver was trying to have it both ways
2765428 i think thats part of our civic psychology its deep in our civic dna
2765429 were trying to show off the kind of flavor of what the west has to offer
2765430 the fact is our economy now is extremely diversified resilient and contemporary
2765431 people assume an international cosmopolitan image is at variance with the notion of being a cow town
2765432 well evaluate that and see generally theyll go 10 or 15 somewhere between those number of snaps

2765459 mr bunyan you stand before this court accused of persistent and willful transgression of the conventicle act which prohibits all british subjects from absenting themselves from worship in the church of england and from conducting worship services apart from our church you come presumably with no legal training and yet without counsel i must warn you sir of the gravity of the charge the harshness of the penalty in the event of your conviction and the foolhardiness of acting as your own counsel in so serious a matter i hold in my hand the depositions of the witnesses against you in each case they have testified that to their knowledge you have never in your adult life attended services in the church of this parish each further testifies that he has observed you on numerous occasions conducting religious exercises in and near bedford
2765460 the depositions speak the truth i have never attended services in the church of england nor do i intend ever to do so secondly it is no secret that i preach the word of god whenever wherever and to whomever he pleases to grant me opportunity to do so i have no choice but to acknowledge my awareness of the law which i am accused of transgressing likewise i have no choice but to confess my guilt in my transgression of it as true as these things are i must affirm that i neither regret breaking the law nor repent of having broken it further i must warn you that i have no intention in the future of conforming to it
2765461 it is obvious sir that you are a victim of deranged thinking if my ears deceive me not i must infer from your words that you believe the state to have no interest in the religious life of its subjects
2765462 the state m lord may have an interest in anything in which it wishes to have an interest but the state has no right whatever to interfere in the religious life of its citizens
2765463 the evidence i hold in my hand even apart from your own admission of guilt is sufficient to convict you and the court is within its rights to have you committed to prison for a considerably long time i do not wish to send you to prison mr bunyan i am aware of the poverty of your family and i believe you have a little daughter who unfortunately was born blind is this not so
2765464 very well the decision of the court is this in as much as the accused has confessed his guilt we shall follow a merciful and compassionate course of action we shall release him on the condition that he swear solemnly to discontinue the convening of religious meetings and that he affix his signature to such an oath prior to quitting the courtroom that will be all mr bunyan i hope not to see you here again may we hear the next case
2765465 mlord if i may have another moment of the courts time
2765466 yes but you must be quick about it we have other matters to attend to what is it
2765467 i cannot do what you ask of me mlord i cannot place my signature upon any document in which i promise henceforth not to preach my calling to preach the gospel is from god and he alone can make me discontinue what he has appointed me to do as i have had no word from him to that effect i must continue to preach and i shall continue to preach
2765468 i warn you sir the court has gone the second mile to be lenient with you out of concern for your familys difficult straits truth to tell it would appear that the courts concern for your family far exceeds your own do you wish to go to prison
2765469 no mlord few things there are that i would wish less
2765470 you will not find the procedure burdensome and even you mr
2765471 before you answer mark you this should you refuse the court will have no alternative but to sentence you to a prison term think sir of your poor wife think of your children and particularly of your pitiful sightless little girl think of your flock who can hear you to their hearts content when you have secured your licenses think on these things and give us your answer sir
2765472 mlord i appreciate the courts efforts to be as you have put it accommodating but again i must refuse your terms i must repeat that it is god who constrains me to preach and no man or company of men may grant or deny me leave to preach these licenses of which you speak mlord are symbols not of a right but of a privilege implied therein is the principle that a mere man can extend or withhold them according to his whim i speak not of privileges but of rights privileges licenses granted by men may be denied by men rights are granted by god and can be legitimately denied by no man i must therefore refuse to comply
2765473 if you manage to survive i should think that your experience will correct your thinking if you fail to survive that will be unfortunate in any event i strongly suspect that we have heard the last we shall ever hear from mr john bunyan now may we hear the next case

2765558 russian troops that had poured into the disputed territory of south ossetia moved to enclaves boundary with georgia on sunday witnesses said as the conflict appeared to be developing into the worst clashes between russia and a foreign military since the invasion of afghanistan in 1979 overnight russia landed ground troops off of warships into the disputed territory of abkhazia and broadened its bombing campaign to the georgian capitals airport the organization on security and cooperation in europe said georgia was ready to negotiate a ceasefire but a top russian defense official said no formal offer had been received georgian authorities said sunday morning that they expect russian attacks to come on three fronts from gali and zugdidi two spots on the abkhazian border and from ossetia according to gigi ugulada the mayor of tbilisi they also expect more bombing on the kodori gorge the only part of abkhazia that remains under georgian control witness reports from the border between south ossetia and georgia suggested that russian forces had moved up to the winding disputed boundary line but a top russian defense official said sunday that russia had no immediate plans to move troops into georgia
2765559 russian pm vladimir putin earlier suggested it was unlikely that south ossetia would re integrate with the rest of georgia saying the countrys territorial integrity had
2765560 i am less sympathetic to the georgian case because i think that escalating the war and providing an excuse for russian counter escalation was a damn stupid thing for saakashvili to do and a remarkably damn stupid thing for him to do absent an extremely compelling cause
2765561 1 as in the good old days of the cold war this has also been a testing ground between western doctrines and arms against their russian counterparts and to state the obvious the former has come off very badly true the russians came in greater numbers but the lesson for a lot of the other post soviet republics is clear fancy western military aid and training doesnt mean you can stand up to the bear so it may be prudent to avoid antagonising the bear by forming military or any other relationships with the west in the first place so kiss goodbye to a lot of our influence in the post soviet space 2 the us nato long term strategy of increasing strategic influence in the caucasus is now probably dead this has huge knock on effects the west has been trying to gain a strategic foothold in russias underbelly since the end of the soviet union the long term goal has been a to establish a military presence in a strategically sensitive area just in case but more importantly b to open up an alternative transit route for central asian oil and gas that bypasses both russia and iran and to do this the caucasus is really your only game in town if as seems likely russias war aims are now to completely destroy georgian military capability sever off abkhazia and south ossetia and replace saakasvhili with a more pliant satrap and to be clear i think theyre more than likely to accomplish all of these goals then this strategy is dead as a door nail after this demonstration of brute force no one in the caucasus is going to risk an alliance with the us and georgia will be a dismembered and thoroughly cowed nation i cannot over emhpasise what a huge setback this is for europe and the us and what a boon it is for russia
2765562 a senior state department figure was here in tbilisi last week and i would expect that the georgian side at least hinted very broadly about what was up he would have to deny that of course in the way of these things we can assume that the americans did not warn them off
2765563 if true this has to be one of the most indefensible things the bush administration has done in the last few years saakashvili took a reckless gamble and it didnt work out the americans have more or less encouraged saakashvilis dangerously confrontational approach to russia and have given them hopes of nato membership which was never going to happen they may also have had unrealistic expectations about us support in the event of a war this war would likely never have happened if the us had discouraged the georgians update in the last few years not saying the low level visit last week was crucial rather than telling the result is an probable own goal by the bushies

2765582 sutts said he has put together a chronology of events after he was contracted by prosecutors
2765583 we feel its necessary to put the record straight people in windsor are even wondering if we are being truthful
2765584 we feel we need to reveal the facts notwithstanding it may cause more difficulties for the mayor in detroit
2765585 with detroit councils month long flip flopping it appears that his chronology focused on the period starting july 17 and following
2765586 his staff has meetings planned with windsor on friday and he expects the 75 million deal will go forward
2765587 i did not have face to face tunnel relations with that detroit mayor
2765588 he started with detroit councils month long flip flopping on supporting the proposed tunnel deal that eventually led to a statement by kilpatrick on thursday july 17 2008 that he would travel to windsor the next day to meet with officials and salvage the tunnel proposal
2765589 he says this deal is very important and we need to keep it on track that we need to get in a room and finalize all issues of the deal
2765590 i said i would welcome the opportunity and our teams should get together
2765591 eddie called me right after that call and said they were requesting a meeting
2765592 sutts and francis also disagreed that it was an emergency meeting
2765593 if the meeting was established on friday for the following wednesday is that an emergency
2765594 i suppose he could have picked up the phone but he realized by coming over it makes an impression he really wants the deal going to the trouble of coming over makes you believe they are serious
2765595 reached thursday by the free press francis said whatever comments have been made by our lead legal adviser in the past are comments that i stand behind
2765596 he seems fully consumed with the tunnel matter which i guess has taken a turn
2765597 the detroit city council has presented the governor with charges that mayor kilpatrick misused public funds for personal gain and failed to obtain the councils informed consent to settle a lawsuit involving public funds

2765604 we jumped and he hit a screamer low and hard and when that happens theres not much chance as my main focus is the other side of the goal unfortunately we just picked the wrong option tonight
2765605 the one thing weve been doing is improving as we go along
2765606 tonight was a good game for us were of course disappointed that they scored the equalizer but we just need to make sure we get this out of our head and concentrate on the positives when were together were a good team

2765632 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2765633 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2765634 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2765635 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2765636 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2765640 there somewhat is relief the day is over we overcame so much it was all kind of a whirlwind
2765641 and we got the nerves out and the mistakes out
2765642 i knew things were happening i couldnt control and that were obviously not very good
2765643 it was a little bit hard to go out from there
2765644 a few of us had tears in our eyes because we know how badly she wanted to be out there we said lets do it for her lets do it for our families lets do it for the people back home

2765647 i am very satisfied with the chinese girls performance if i can give them a score i would say 70 percent mainly for he kexin falling off the uneven bars its a big pity for her
2765648 maybe she was nervous because she wanted to perform her best
2765649 would it not be strange if a universe without purpose accidentally created humans who are so obsessed with purpose
2765650 i thought people would be honest enough to see me as a person who was trying to do something good and not as a celebrity
2765651 my mother always taught me say something good or say nothing at all

2765661 you can listen to recorded music and you cannot listen to live music is something which is not understandable how can the police say that listening to music in a club and having a drink lead to crime this has nothing to do with the live band the attitude of the police should be questioned here
2765662 we take so much time producing tracks but there is no one to listen to it honestly i want to go out of this city if this continues
2765663 it has affected our business to about 60 to 70 per cent even today being saturday my club is completely empty

2765668 we really felt the loss as one of our own

2765747 there was a very very large amount of fire when we arrived and the extent of the explosion if the blast was heard as far away as it was could have been much more serious
2765748 hopefully we wont find that there are a lot of people missing or injured but so far it looks like we got off very lucky
2765749 i certainly dont think it will be days i think it will be hours
2765750 but that all depends on what we run into if we run into some more problems or problems that we dont see now then it could be longer
2765751 it was just a tremendous explosion and blew all the windows out of the house just blew the house up and i just managed to get out of there in time
2765752 my whole room lights up orange and i look out i live on the top floor so i had a perfect view and i just seen a huge ball of flame hundreds of metres in the sky big black pillars of smoke
2765753 we got freaked out my family woke up they thought it was a plane that went down
2765754 he was going to check on my parents but the explosions were getting louder and louder so the three of us just ran and ran and ran
2765755 everyone was just running down the street it was like something from a movie
2765756 we were concerned when this company moved at the end of the street
2765757 but we werent even advised that they were going to be there they just moved in and weve been concerned since they were there that something like this would happen im surprised that they let a company like that move in a residential area
2765758 those concerns always come up as to whether or not they should be in certain areas but like i say unless you want to put those facilities away and not build anything anywhere close to them any residences i dont know that you can do that
2765759 this was a big violation of human rights and they dont want to recognize that

2765764 we must check all that we dont trust the georgian side
2765765 we heard a plane go over and then a big explosion
2765766 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2765767 the deployment is quite natural we dont want a repeat of what happened in south ossetia
2765768 if the disproportionate and dangerous escalation on the russian side continues that this will have a significant long term impact on u s russian relations

2765787 this guy was talking about something that really seemed to matter i thought how proud he must feel whenever he described to others what he did if i did something similar i could see it being a move from success to significance it would tick the boxes i had set for myself
2765788 there is no evidence to suggest an increase in prosperity leads to an increase in happiness

2765825 the public considers that the jews have no rights in iraq as they sold everything and left but so did the iranian kurds and the iranian shias they took back their property when the saddam regime ended the kurds are using 100 year old documents to prove their rights in kirkuk so why do we deny the rights of an ethnic group of iraqi origin because they went to israel what about those from other ethnicities who left iraq from the opposition and those who went to iran the country we had a ten year war with

2765831 credit to germany they were very clinical and took their chances very well but the scale of the defeat hurts a great deal
2765832 i think the players know we were off our game in a few areas and we will look hard at that
2765833 we had some chances and if at 2 1 we could have brought it back to 2 2 we would have been in with a shout
2765834 it was that next goal which was crucial and i think once the germans get a roll on they make it very difficult
2765835 it was disappointing because we unpicked them at times and it was just scoring those chances when we had them
2765836 i want to win a gold medal at the olympics
2765837 it was a little blue bike with stabilisers and she got very angry with the stabilisers straight away and demanded we take them off
2765838 since then weve brought her a bike for most birthdays and for every christmas
2765839 she had a passion for riding straight away and we all went on tandem bike ride holidays together
2765840 she was always competing at school and knew this is what she wanted to do as a career
2765841 i used to go out cycling with her but eventually she sacked me
2765842 when she was 14 she was waiting for me to go for a ride with her when she said you dont have to come with me
2765843 she said she wanted to win gold medal and that that was her ultimate ambition that was when she was 11
2765844 she had beaten all the boys in her age group and she was asked what she wanted to do next and she said win a gold medal at the olympics
2765845 shes done that now and i cant tell you how deeply satisfying that will be for her and how exciting it is for us
2765846 this was the ultimate goal for her she has done a lot of hard work and preparation to achieve this ambition of hers and she has come up with a result

2765856 loyalty seems to be primarily to pakistan this is a crime unpardonable this is also the impression of a large percentage of non muslim intellectuals in india here is the root cause for there being a none too happy felling towards muslims by a large percentage of the majority this is understandable
2765857 when the india pakistan war began in september 1965 a muslim majority battalion of the rajput regiment stationed in the crucial poonch sector of jammu and kashmir far from being hastily withdrawn was allowed to play its part in the execution of the armys forward actions according to several high ranking indian army officers the fact that the battalion did not flinch and carried out its assigned role with considerable credit sufficiently dispelled worry at least within the military about the loyalty of indian muslim soldiers
2765858 were able to find not a single muslim officer above the rank of a major general occupying a responsible position of military command
2765859 in our defense services there are hardly any muslims left what concerns me most is that there is no effort being made to improve this situation which is likely to grow worse unless checked
2765860 the percentage of muslims in the armed forces forces which was 32 percent at the time of partition

2765867 all georgian troops have been withdrawn from the conflict zone
2765868 georgia expresses its readiness to immediately start negotiations with the russian federation on ceasefire and termination of hostilities
2765869 we have been handed a note that from 5 a m 0100 gmt georgia stopped firing and is withdrawing forces from the conflict zone but our information does not confirm the georgian statement

2765890 communication in this view is seen not as individual phenomenon but as a societal level one
2765891 social interaction are the act action or practice of two or more people mutually oriented towards each others selves that is any behavior that tries to affect or take account of each others subjective experiences so that the social interaction means it must be aware of each other have each others self in mind
2765892 dibangun kondisi komunikasi yang yang menjamin sifat umum norma norma yang dapat diterima dan menjamin otonomi warga melalui kemampuan emansipatoris sehingga menghasilkan proses pembentukan kehendak bersama lewat perbincangan

2765895 jane i just got the strangest revelation i dont know what to make of it
2765896 hoes do the work and the pimps make the money
2765897 social interactions are the acts actions or practices of two or more people mutually oriented towards each others selves that is any behavior that tries to affect or take account of each others subjective experiences or intentions this means that the parties to the social interaction must be aware of each other have each others self in mind this does not mean being in sight of or directly behaving towards each other
2765898 communication is perhaps the most human of all human activities
2765899 communication can be seen as a cornerstone of society it links the ways messages are transmitted and received via technology with the composition of these messages or more broadly as communicative relationships and with the analysis of the effects of these communicative acts

2765933 the most amazing part of the story of the nine year old jesus playing a form of cricket with the boys at the sea shore is that he would go on playing the game on water over the sea waves
2765934 he jesus would take the boys to the seashore and carrying the playing ball and the club he would go over the waves of the sea as though he was playing on a frozen surface hitting the playing ball

2765993 i could feel in every follicle of my finely blow dried hair that this baby did not want to create a scandal
2765994 in fact i could channel the babys thoughts for months what kind of doctor would permit such a tragedy to persist under these circumstances
2765995 we all know how rielle was passed around more than conspiracy theories at a nut er netroot convention this is why democrats stand for more government involvement in health care it is all the fault of bushs policies to allow these doctors to act in an unrestricted manner
2765996 heck hillary had her husband bill on her side what else did you expect john edwards to do besides john knew that elizabeth would be ok with it after all he channeled her thoughts also
2765997 absolutely theres a lot of truth to what the president said and in terms of wall street there was too much leverage in the system and more leverage than was appropriate and more than people recognized because the leverage came into the system in the form of highly complex structured products which were difficult to understand
2765998 there is no question about it wall street got drunk
2765999 thats one reason i asked you to turn off your tv cameras
2766000 the question is how long will it take to sober up and not try to do all these fancy financial instruments
2766001 we have of course one priority getting through this period with as little damage as little negative impact as possible on the economy but the second part is to take steps to reduce the likelihood of these sorts of things happening in the future
2766002 we sized that program to say how could we do something that will be meaningful this year but not so big that it would jeopardize some of our long term priorities and our fiscal priorities and balancing the budget so again my view would be lets see how this program works in the third quarter
2766003 i think the blue skies will come especially after todays rain
2766004 today is raining and tomorrow will have rain too that will help reduce the air pollution level we believe the current air flow will be helpful in the dispersion of pollutants in the air
2766005 you can control beijing as much as you like but youre not going to see much of an effect
2766006 on the day of opening ceremonies we had rain clouds in the southwest and northwest they were moving closer to the birds nest and there was a high probability of rain
2766007 we communicated that message beforehand to the russians through u s secretary of state condoleezza rice
2766008 we must check all that we dont trust the georgian side
2766009 we heard a plane go over and then a big explosion
2766010 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2766011 the deployment is quite natural we dont want a repeat of what happened in south ossetia
2766012 if the disproportionate and dangerous escalation on the russian side continues that this will have a significant long term impact on u s russian relations
2766013 whatever side is used to bomb civilians and the positions of peacekeepers this side is not safe and they should know this
2766014 complete genocide putin also said georgia had effectively lost the right to rule the breakaway province an indication moscow could be preparing to fulfill south ossetians wish to be absorbed into russia
2766015 our toilet even had two different flushing powers depending on how do i say this delicately what exactly youre flushing a two gear toilet ive never found any of this at an american hotel

2766023 you are beautiful just as you are dont be afraid
2766024 i was shocked they were so cool and so proud of being native canadians
2766025 i realized that i have a beautiful culture and strong roots i decided that i should be a proud ainu and express that in my life
2766026 they felt that backwardness had been mapped onto their bodies
2766027 these young people are trying to overcome nasty historical baggage by creating positive self images through music and dance
2766028 young people are more aware of japans multicultural makeup but its still pretty shallow
2766029 japan is behind other nations in this way even though it claims to be an advanced economic power
2766030 being indigenous cant be cut off from issues related to the land
2766031 some people say you can have an identity as ainu but we japanese dont know what we can be proud of
2766032 we are the last domestic manufacturer of our type of product

2766038 i know our program manager is ranking captains on landing with less fuel i dont care to be ranked i think this is a safety problem and i believe fuel is your friend
2766039 looking back i would have liked more gas yesterday and i was already carrying tanker fuel if i wouldnt have had this extra there would have been real problems
2766040 far below my comfort zone and probably less than the minimum fuel required by the fars federal aviation regulations
2766041 our fuel situation had not become critical yet but had we had any delay i would have had to declare a fuel emergency
2766042 i am not sure if the flight plan as given to me by my company was a real flight plan or if they were just telling me it was so that i would continue to jfk thus saving them time and expense in the future if such a situation presents itself again i will divert to my initial destination regardless of what my company says i can do the safety of my crew far outweighs any financial burden to the company
2766043 this was probably the new fuel saving initiative by the company management to save money
2766044 north south operation is very unpredictable along the east coast i dont think this is a place where we should skimp on fuel
2766045 relaying my opinion on the reduced fuel load and my suggestion not to compromise fuel loads in and out of florida
2766046 we can easily forgive a child who is afraid of the dark the real tragedy of life is when men are afraid of the light

2766050 we have several potentially big customers say they wont use puppet gt because of the gpl
2766051 however they have said that they gt would work with us if we had a bsd style license
2766052 we dont have any customers who say they wouldnt work with us if we gt were bsd instead of gpl we do have many who say they wouldnt if we gt were gpl instead of bsd for us we would prefer for a license to be gt less controversial not more
2766053 russia will have to think real hard before delivering this system to iran which is possibly on the brink of conflict with either israel or the us since if the system is delivered an ew electronic warfare system will likely be developed to neutralize it and if that happens it would be catastrophic not only for iran but also for russia

2766056 no man in history including jesus christ has directly revealed to the world the satanic weapon used to enslave mankind intellectual thought
2766057 they thought i was fair game i was an instrument of purpose to achieve their desires and not 100 percent real and also that they had me by the short curlies because i thought that the world revolved around them and therefore i think that i am fair game and rightly so if they want to play dirty i get to too its not a one way street i will use the physcial strength that i have over them my superior 4
2766058 you would no longer be here if i were to stop praying for you

2766060 but now the end is near now mark foley comes along and is making
2766061 in fact jesus said something about that i do believe

2766063 i am the only one who has outer filthed ward
2766064 if you write a letter to the editor attacking bush you could be deemed as purposefully and materially supporting hostilities against the united states if you organize or join a public demonstration against iraq or against the administration the same designation could befall you one dark comedy aspect of the legislation is that senators or house members who publicly disagree with bush criticize him or organize investigations into his dealings could be placed under the same designation in effect congress just gave bush the power to lock them up
2766065 when i told abbie hoffman that he was the first one who made me laugh
2766066 a demonstration should turn you on not turn you off
2766067 and thats another mistake on your part your playing games on usenet and im not playing it has nothing to do with impressing you it has more to do with making sure you have the education youll need to debate the debate is no fun for me if you are mentally incapable of it im giving you an opportunity to educate yourself thats all

2766070 immorality the morality of those who are having a better time
2766071 my own opinion even speaking as a woman is that no more female input should be allowed in establishing and enforcing the rules and regulations of a men group if this is to be a haven for men to discuss mens issues then women shouldnt be designing the room and painting it pink and putting up lace curtains and a lot of frilly doilies jmo

2766082 it is for the first time in the history of parliament that monsoon session which normally commences by july end is yet to start it seems the government is afraid of facing the opposition after it has won the confidence vote by using unfair means
2766083 the inflation rate is above 12 per cent and it seems the government is unable to control it farmers are also facing a lot of problems and are forced to commit suicide

2766088 jake has developed a large body of work playing with ideas surrounding the hidden connections not just in the real world but from the work of artists and entertainment media with the idea that we are all plugged into a giant web of connections across time and space which means as ive said before that these connections are occurring at the fifth dimension where our reality comes from and this is why those instantaneous faster than light hidden connections i listed at the start of this blog violate no laws of physics
2766089 i find the idea that synchromysticism can be viewed as compatible with higher dimensional physics a delight
2766090 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2766091 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2766092 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2766093 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2766094 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2766095 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2766096 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2766097 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2766098 absolutely theres a lot of truth to what the president said and in terms of wall street there was too much leverage in the system and more leverage than was appropriate and more than people recognized because the leverage came into the system in the form of highly complex structured products which were difficult to understand
2766099 there is no question about it wall street got drunk
2766100 thats one reason i asked you to turn off your tv cameras
2766101 the question is how long will it take to sober up and not try to do all these fancy financial instruments
2766102 we have of course one priority getting through this period with as little damage as little negative impact as possible on the economy but the second part is to take steps to reduce the likelihood of these sorts of things happening in the future
2766103 we sized that program to say how could we do something that will be meaningful this year but not so big that it would jeopardize some of our long term priorities and our fiscal priorities and balancing the budget so again my view would be lets see how this program works in the third quarter
2766104 rowing isnt the worlds most popular sport but if you look at the stands both sides are full at 500 metres you can hear them belting out some kind of beat with thundersticks
2766105 we dont have a lot of races together but we know how the boats been feeling in practice and it feels good together
2766106 and shell always run silent and shell always run deep
2766107 i think this is probably somebodys effort to get a deposit to a lawyer on an expedited basis in a case thats got a lot of scrutiny
2766108 i suspected that the shooter was a law enforcement officer and more specifically a detroit police department officer
2766109 the bowman affidavit is a little less than idiotic and more than absurd
2766110 human beings evolved from the upright walking southern apes genus australopithecus around two mission years ago the transition from apes to humans as we have learned in an earlier chapter was driven by two distinct developments the helplessness of prematurely born infants which requires supportive families and communities and the freedom of the hands to make and use tools which stimulated brain growth and may have contributed to the evolution of language maturanas theory of language and consciousness allows us to interlink these two evolutionary drives since language results in a very sophisticated and effective coordination of behaviour the evolution of language allowed the early human to greatly increase their cooperative activities and to develop families communities and tribes that gave them tremendous evolutionary advantages the crucial role of language in human evolution was not the ability to exchange ideas but the increased ability to cooperate as the ability and richness of our human relationships increased our humanity our language art thought and culture unfolded accordingly at the same time we also developed the ability of abstract thinking of bringing forth an inner world of concepts objects and images of ourselves gradually as this inner world became ever more diverse and complex we began to lose touch with nature and became ever more fragmented personalities thus arose the tension between wholeness and fragmentation between body and soul which has been identified as the essence of the human condition by poets philosophers and mystics throughout the ages human consciousness has brought forth not only the chauvet cave paintings the bhagavad gits the brandenburg concertos and the theory of relativity but also slavery witch burnings the holocaust and the bombing of hiroshima among all the species we are the only ones to kill their kind in pursuit of religion free markets patriotism and other abstract ideas
2766111 the buddist doctrine of impermanence includes the notion that there is no self no persistent subject of our varying experiences it holds that the idea of a separate individual self is an illusion just another form of maya an intellectual concept that has no reality to cling to this idea of a separate self leads to the same pain and suffering duhkha as the adherence to any other fixed category of thought cognitive science has arrived at exactly the same position according to the santiago theory we bring forth the self just as we bring forth objects our self or ego does not have any independent existence but is a result of our internal structural coupling a detailed analysis of the belief in an independent fixed self and the resulting cartesian anxiety leads francsico varela and his colleagues to the following conclusion our grasping after an inner ground is the essence of ego self and is the source of continuous frustration this grasping after an inner ground is itself a moment in a larger pattern of grasping that includes our clinging to an outer grounds in the form of the idea of a pregiven and independent world in other words our grasping after a ground whether inner or outer is the deep source of frustration and anxiety this then is the crux of the human condition we are autonomous individuals shaped by our own history of structural changes we are self aware aware of our individual identity and yet when we look for an independent self within our world of existence we cannot find any such entity the origin of our dilemma lies in our tendency to create the abstractions of separate objects including a separate self and then to believe that they belong to an objective independent existing reality to overcome our cartesian anxiety we need to think systemically shifting our conceptual focus from objects to relationships only then can we realise that identity individuality and autonomy do not imply separateness and independence as lynn margulis and dorion sagan reminded us independence is a political not a scientific term

2766119 i always worried about him when he went climbing but i never stopped him doing his dream he was always getting hurt
2766120 he once climbed up ben nevis and the friend he was climbing with was falling and ians quick thinking saved his life ian hurt himself in the process and ended up with metal pins in his hand
2766121 i could never keep him in the house even when it was raining he would have to go to a climbing wall i just wish his life could have been longer
2766122 i got a phone call on thursday afternoon from ians friend who he was climbing with who said there has been an accident and it doesnt look good
2766123 ian was being taken to hospital but although he fought he died in the helicopter
2766124 so ian had to abseil down the rest of the way but something went wrong with one of his ropes and he fell
2766125 ian loved to climb he was going to university in september to bangor and i am sure he picked it for the mountains around snowdonia he was loveable cheeky and very determined
2766126 we are waiting here to decide what to do if we can fly over there or if they will fly him back to us his friends are very shaken and cut up
2766127 they saw their friend falling from the top to the bottom they could do nothing because when he was falling it was too late
2766128 when he was abseiling down one of the guys made a big technical mistake and he fell when you abseil you must take two ropes and he only took one rope
2766129 the helicopter came but it was too late he fell a long way he had no chance
2766130 i was a pretty fat kid didnt do much other than eat and play computer games
2766131 early teens i got into scuba diving which got me outside but didnt do much for exercise i was introduced to rock climbing when i was 14 by chris woodal
2766132 climbing made me way to competitive for scuba diving and i soon became bored of this expensive hobby climbing took over when i was 16 after a trip to the dolomites
2766133 these last years ive lost my belly and took climbing seriously finding it a vent from life and somewhere to push myself competitively ive learnt a lot about myself some of it good some of it bad climbing is my demon but its also my cure

2766144 the obvious beneficiaries of weaker oil and a firmer us dollar are global stock markets as the us has been the rocky horror show in terms of concerns it is now one of the more obvious candidates for a relief short covering rally
2766145 policy responses to the credit crunch have helped to successfully get out of a financial squeeze you need three things 1 a cheap currency 2 a positive yield curve and 3 the recapitalization of bank balance sheets with surprising speed all three of these conditions are now being met in the us
2766146 bull markets are born on pessimism grow on skepticism mature on optimism and die on euphoria
2766147 eurozone gdp almost certainly contracted in q2 eurostat will release its flash estimate on august 14 the same day that germany and france release their own first estimates if the numbers surprise on the downside the markets will start anticipating a rate cut by the ecb on september 4
2766148 europe has moved further along the road towards a recession than the us the economic data of the past two weeks make that conclusion hard to avoid
2766149 investor marc faber publisher of the gloom boom amp doom report talks with bloomberg about the euros performance against the us dollar the commodities market and the global economy the euro fell the most in almost eight years against the dollar as traders pared bets the european central bank will raise interest rates as the economy slows
2766150 is this simply a bounce from the extreme levels that we highlighted three weeks ago or is the investment environment starting to improve we argue the following
2766151 so the investment environment is not that dire in fact away from the massive volatility prevalent in the financials and commodity space which together seem to account for almost 50 or more of most indices and volumes traded other sectors technology healthcare staples are holding their own at this juncture we reiterate our belief that it makes more sense to focus on these forgotten parts of the market and resist the urges to call tops or bottoms in the overcrowded financial and commodity spaces
2766152 the world economy is precariously close to a recession in 2009 ubs said as it cut next years global growth forecast due to a us slowdown
2766153 global gross domestic product will expand 2 9 next year from an earlier prediction of 3 1 ubs chief economist larry hatheway wrote in a report published yesterday ubs considers a 2 5 global growth rate as one that is consistent with a recession
2766154 a global recession would be the first since 2001 2002 and may ease inflation thats already projected by the international monetary fund to be the fastest in nine years
2766155 softer global economic activity for longer suggests peaking and then declining inflation hatheway said a sustainable recovery of risk assets probably requires policy recognition that the primary macroeconomic challenge remains weak growth not temporarily high inflation
2766156 the fed will cut interest rates by a further half percentage point this year from the current 2 rate ubs predicts the ecb and the bank of england will probably lower borrowing costs next year hatheway said
2766157 george magnus senior economic advisor of ubs talks about the impact of the credit crunch on companies and nations he believes there will be low growth up to and beyond 2010 and the slowdown will hit emerging markets as well as rich nations
2766158 the july ism manufacturing survey showed further softening in already weak domestic demand while a slowing in overseas growth presents a new headwind
2766159 global leading economic indicators have rolled over implying that slower overseas growth will diminish one of the key sources of support for us manufacturers
2766160 the only silver lining is that energy prices have finally begun to recede although oil prices will have to move substantially lower before having a significant economic impact energy price relief will help to ease pressure on profit margins and lower inflation expectations
2766161 bottom line the overall manufacturing sector will continue to grow at a sub par pace and the risks will stay on the downside until the consumer retrenchment is further advanced and or much more relief from commodity prices arrives
2766162 the fed left the federal funds rate unchanged at 2 0 no surprises here president fisher dissented he would have preferred a higher federal funds rate the committee included one new member governor elizabeth duke who voted in favor of holding the federal funds rate unchanged
2766163 the fed retained most of the june 25 statement but rearranged the order of sentences and made subtle but important changes
2766164 second the more hawkish part of the june 25 statement the upside risks to inflation and inflation expectations have increased is eliminated entirely the recent reduction in energy and commodity prices is captured by the phrase earlier increases in prices of energy and some other commodities as opposed to continued increases in prices of energy and some other commodities which suggest that the fomc views recent downward movements in energy prices as meaningful
2766165 the adjusted monetary base as calculated by the st louis fed continues its near vertical surge
2766166 the pending home sales index phsi of the national association of realtors increased 5 3 points to 89 0 in june according to the national association of realtors the phsi leads sales of existing home sales by one or two months based on this sales of existing homes should show gains in the july august period
2766167 the mortgage bankers associations mortgage purchase index rose to 315
2766168 sales reports of existing and new home for june contained faint signs of a housing market mending but additional support from a pickup in hiring and willingness of banks to lend money will be necessary for stability in the housing market
2766169 given the weakness in labor market conditions and the absence of the one off tax rebate check consumer spending will most likely decline in the third quarter
2766170 personal income increased 0 1 in june after a 1 8 gain in may the difference in growth of personal income reflects the impact of the economic stimulus act of 2008 excluding the impact of tax rebates personal income increased 0 3 in june following a 0 4 jump in may
2766171 the overall personal consumption expenditure price index moved up 0 8 in june putting the year to year increase at 4 1
2766172 i came away from the freddie mac conference call feeling a little shall we say nicely confused
2766173 the ceo richard syron warned of the troubled times in housing even revised his forecast for home price drops peak to trough from 15 to 18 20 he said were only halfway through the correction
2766174 but then one of his underlings went on to assure everyone that freddie would be able to withstand 40 billion worth of credit pain through 2009 if it finishes raising that 5
2766175 freddie in the second quarter wrote down the value of its subprime and alt a portfolio by 1 billion
2766176 i think armando falcon a former head of ofheo said it best when i interviewed him yesterday
2766177 theyve only written them down by lets say five or 6 total over the past few quarters
2766178 some of the most strongly worded emails from analysts questioning their own ratings came from s amp p according to a draft version of the 38 page report which includes the firms and was reviewed by the wall street journal the unit of mcgraw hill is the largest bond rating firm by revenue
2766179 in one email an s amp p analytical staffer emailed another that a mortgage or structured finance deal was ridiculous and that we should not be rating it the other s amp p staffer replied that we rate every deal adding that it could be structured by cows and we would rate it
2766180 meanwhile an analytical manager in the collateralized debt obligations group at s amp p told a senior analytical manager in a separate email that rating agencies continue to create an even bigger monster the cdo market
2766181 morgan stanley the second biggest us securities firm told several thousand clients this week that they wont be allowed to withdraw money on their home equity credit lines said a person familiar with the situation
2766182 the action mostly affected clients with properties that have lost value according to the person who declined to be identified because the information isnt public the new york based investment bank will review home equity lines of credit or helocs monthly from now on the person said
2766183 wall street firms including morgan stanley are ratcheting back on risks after the collapse of the subprime mortgage market and ensuing credit contraction saddled banks and brokerages with almost 500 billion of writedowns and losses
2766184 consistent with the terms of the heloc or home equity line of credit morgan stanley periodically reassesses client property values and risk profiles said christine pollak a morgan stanley spokeswoman in new york
2766185 the first wave of americans to default on their home mortgages appears to be cresting but a second far larger one is quickly building
2766186 homeowners with good credit are falling behind on their payments in growing numbers even as the problems with mortgages made to people with weak or subprime credit are showing their first tentative signs of leveling off after two years of spiraling defaults
2766187 the percentage of mortgages in arrears in the category of loans one rung above subprime so called alternative a mortgages quadrupled to 12 in april from a year earlier delinquencies among prime loans which account for most of the 12 trillion market doubled to 2 7 in that time
2766188 while it is difficult to draw precise parallels among various segments of the mortgage market the arc of the crisis in subprime loans suggests that the problems in the broader market may not peak for another year or two analysts said
2766189 the obviously beneficiaries of weaker oil and a firmer usd are global stock markets
2766190 i think it is now getting a second wind and will recover further provided that banks hold above their initial support levels established by the higher reaction low on 28th and 29th july
2766191 elsewhere wall street shows the steady performance of transports where you can see higher reaction lows since january and the nasdaq which never broke beneath its january march lows
2766192 a steady to rising wall street would represent a tailwind for other stock markets remember the influential leash effect
2766193 asian stock markets should get some traction from a positive wall street leash effect and lower oil prices however the china leash has yet to turn favourable india has shown the best form recently resources markets are currently among the most subdued as brazil and canada were among the last to peak but they have some of the best long term fundamentals despite the correction underway in commodities australia is one of the more oversold markets currently and having seen a downside failure this week should now at least take out the july rally high
2766194 so far weve seen only two 90 downside days since the march high there should be more how many more nobody knows
2766195 given weak technicals the durability of the bear market rally is now in question
2766196 investors often ask how we can tell the difference between a bull market and a rally in a bear market charting experts will argue many points from choppiness in price action to limited participation in the rally by various sectors of the market
2766197 i argue that it is all of the above this confirms that the current rally is of the bear market variety and while it can move higher in its current condition its days are starting to become numbered
2766198 the phrase fits and starts is a good one to apply to todays market
2766199 followers of elliott wave analysis are familiar with the term impulse wave which is just a strong price move in the direction of the major trend
2766200 in contrast corrections are marked by lower activity and technical indicators that do not confirm the action
2766201 price action since the july low has certainly not been in a strong trend by any definition a market in a strong bullish trend does not take two steps forward and one step back to allow weak bulls to buy comfortably at what are seen as reasonable prices strong markets take five or 10 steps forward and that can leave the timid in the dust
2766202 heres the really big problem for all investors and traders in todays markets unless one was operating in 1931 he or she has never experienced what is occurring now
2766203 as we have noted in past missives since wwii the fed instigated recessions when it feared inflation mostly wages or excess inventories
2766204 however the current situation recession and the worst financial conditions since the great depression have occurred while the fed was not only pumping record amounts of credit but was also creating a record number of credit facilities taf tslf pbdc
2766205 fiscally tax cuts have already been enacted and the deficit is at a record level before recession has intensified and there has been an inordinate amount of socialization and de facto nationalization
2766206 thats why we asked a couple weeks ago how do we get out of this mess and get the economy growing given all the fixes maneuvers and gambits enacted to prevent recession and debt contraction
2766207 the record amount of fixes have rendered the concepts of freely traded markets moral hazard and market capitalism as fantasies solons are fighting for the life of the political and financial systems
2766208 a very astute executive recently informed us that equity prices are extremely important in pricing and garnering credit you can be sure than solons are keenly aware of this and are acting accordingly
2766209 ergo stocks are likely to continue their manic depressive volatility until an event induces a critical mass of investors and traders to act in a concerted manner
2766210 the last thing that the fed should want is for stocks to surge
2766211 ergo stock market returns are likely to be below trend in the coming quarters if not years
2766212 several money managers are calling for the fed to cut rates now that commodities have declined
2766213 the question for stocks becomes how long will this relief rally on the latest crisis and fix last the post bear stearns crisis relief rally on record fed credit creation and vehicles lasted two months the ensuing decline on the recessing economy and further bank and gse woes lasted two months will this rally last one or two months stay tuned
2766214 the dow surged 331 points moves like that typically take place in bear markets
2766215 go back to the 2000 02 bear market and you will see much the same thing there were actually nearly twice as many 300 up days in that down phase as there were 300 point losses and this was in the context of a 38 peak to trough decline in the djia so think of what happened yesterday as a characteristic of a bear market even if the shorts got painfully squeezed that should not be lost on investors as we go through this oversold technical rally that has seen the financials soar 30 from the mid july lows
2766216 some items to be noted according to this weeks barrons earnings on the dow are now a negative 81 34 the dow is running at a net loss this means that the price earnings ratio for the dow is infinity nothing times nothing nothing
2766217 im not saying that were in for a repeat of the 1932 37 bull market im just saying that occasionally great buying areas occur during times of seemingly disastrous statistics
2766218 heres a chart that every home owner and wall streeters should like and its a chart that i havent seen anywhere else what you see here is iyr the exchange traded fund for real estate shares relative to the s amp p 500 composite
2766219 first note that relative strength for iyr turned up in january then a dip with a higher low and most recently a rally toward the april high if the current rise in relative strength breaks out above the upper horizontal line the market will be saying something good about real estate and housing its getting interesting here even while most analysts continue to moan and groan about real estate and housing
2766220 the slick from the sudden fall in oil prices is spreading cheaper oil is good for the economy but investors face a risk of accidents as traders retreat from the expectation that the oil price would continue rising
2766221 yet energy stocks have still fallen more than the underlying oil price
2766222 with energy stocks one of the most popular vehicles for hedge funds playing the oil boom they have sold off disproportionately
2766223 another casualty the big oil exporting emerging markets that were viewed as a geared play on the commodity boom
2766224 there is one asset class that conspicuously has not yet joined the list of casualties oil exporters currencies
2766225 brazils real has appreciated 4 2 against the dollar since energy stocks peaked in may and by an astonishing 35 6 since oil was last at 50 a barrel the rouble has also gained slightly since may and is up 12 8 against the dollar since january last year how long can this last
2766226 as more investors realize that the us economy may not be in such dire straits after all we expect the current positive momentum of the us to persist this is all the more true since the us remains very cheap on a purchasing parity basis especially against the euro and that the us trade balance is now improving rapidly standing in the way of this us is likely to be very painful
2766227 i mean growing up and playing baseball my whole life never had any kind of failure or adversity to go through this year its been a whole ball of adversity trying to find different ways trying to find a routine that works for me that i can stick with
2766228 they know if i get in trouble ill go to off speed stuff and they still dont swing at it
2766229 they get in fastball counts and i have to throw a fastball regardless of where its at somebodys sitting fastball if its not painted on the knees black outside corner its sort of hard for them not to hit
2766230 so ive got to work on getting probably getting ahead in the count a bit more often where they dont have a choice to swing at off speed stuff
2766231 were trying not to have this thing get to the part where it did last year
2766232 missing two starts is not what were shooting for but pitching at half speed for the next 10 is not what were looking for either
2766233 if you step into this arena youll see a thing of beauty its really a thing of absolute beauty
2766234 its a perfect depth because if its too deep you lose your sense of vision and where youre at in the pool but its just deep enough to where the waves dissipate and the turbulence dissipates down to the bottom
2766235 its physics and its not sports but it makes sense
2766236 you make a deeper and a wider pool and you give all of those waves and all of that splashing and all of that moving water a chance to move away from the swimmers and get out of their way which makes them go faster its as simple as that
2766237 everything is just fantastic about this pool ive never seen such a big facility in my life and you get a great feeling walking into that facility knowing that this is where the olympic games are held
2766238 technology has really kind of tapped out as far as the building of these kinds of facilities
2766239 its not like track and field where the types of tracks just get faster and faster because i guess there is more spring to them
2766240 but i dont know how you make fast water its just not possible
2766241 im not so good at depicting violence so i dont go there the gruesomeness in my books is always after the fact
2766242 it was just a tremendous explosion and blew all the windows out of the house just blew the house up and i just managed to get out of there in time
2766243 there was a very large of amount of fire when we arrived
2766244 there i looked at it you dragged me across the country for this
2766245 we trained very hard but it seemed that every time we were beginning to form up into teams we would be reorganised i was to learn later in life that we tend to meet any new situation by reorganising it can be a wonderful method of creating the illusion of progress while creating confusion inefficiency and demoralisation
2766246 you know i think this class would have been more effective if you had used more visuals
2766247 in the end we can never be given knowledge by others we can only be stimulated we must develop our own knowledge
2766248 im worth 50 million obama and his wife are never going to make it to the white house he needs to be taken out that man will never know what hit him i just may do that ive got the money and the clout

2766252 the russians need control over energy routes from central asia and the caspian sea
2766253 in addition they want to get rid of us they want regime change
2766254 every democratic movement in this neighbouring region must be got rid of
2766255 he understands that its not really about georgia but in a certain sense its also an aggression against america
2766256 the russians need control over energy routes from central asia and the caspian sea
2766257 thats a lot no wonder theyre twitching all the time
2766258 even during the election bush was saying some pretty scary things if i were a republican right now id be having nightmares too
2766259 if we are its because were left cleaning up the mess left by eight years of bill clinton we sleep better now bush is in the white house
2766260 whats striking is that the nightmares of people on the right are more nightmarish they were bleaker there was more hopelessness
2766261 he opened his eyes on his own and looked at rhonda she called his name and he opened his eyes and nodded to her she smiled at him and told him dont leave me im waiting for you to come back he shrugged his shoulders and she said thats when she knew he was tired he signaled to her that his body was tired
2766262 they tried to resuscitate him two times one time he came back for about an hour then he went into cardiac arrest the second time
2766263 he told his wife non verbally that he could breathe on his own and he wanted the ventilator out he motioned that he wanted it out
2766264 but because he had it his immune system was compromised he had an infection he was on a new medication that suppresses the immune system and thats where the pneumonia came from
2766265 he was critically ill when he was in the hospital
2766266 shes devastated however shes at peace about his transition because of her faith in god her faith is what is sustaining her
2766267 they had 30 years of marriage thats unprecedented in todays time particularly for celebrities that brings joy to her they loved each other and respected each other on a daily basis she was by his side to the very end
2766268 when they started dating he said girl you better come on board this train because im going to be rich and her response was okay and they were married thats how he charmed her with his sense of humor
2766269 when they got married they were kids he was 20 and she was 19 they both grew up together and they both matured in this marriage
2766270 what she will treasure the most is the fact that she was his wife for 30 years and not only was she his wife but she was his best friend shes going to miss him dearly

2766298 mullah bari ghul was directly responsible for the importation of componentry the provision of specialists in the construction of ieds improvised explosive devices and authorising their emplacement across the province
2766299 he was also ultimately responsible for the july 13 suicide bomber attack in the deh rawood bazaar that killed 21 afghans and injured a further 12
2766300 the loss of the one person who knew what was currently underway what was planned for the future and had the contacts to gain further support is a significant blow to the taliban extremists command and control in the province

2766316 im surprised by the emotion that welled up at the moment
2766317 weve been married for a long time really but having our friends and the community that acknowledgement is just so powerful
2766318 this is something that we never expected would happen its still sinking in

2766326 this victory comes as a reward to everything i have been doing and everything i have already done its for all the people who believed in me and helped me on my return
2766327 we have three goals from two games that might not sound enough but you can score 10 goals but still not qualify for the next round
2766328 so im happy with three goals and qualifying for the next round
2766329 i am very confident in my team we knew our goal and we are marching towards our goal we still need a few improvements to keep mistakes to a minimum

2766335 we are looking to have good partnership in the morning i hope laxman and dravid play what they played in kolkata in 2001 and put us in a good situation and from there if we win the game it will be a great win for indian cricket
2766336 we are not out of the match there is still a big hope on laxman and rahul they are very capable of getting 100s and and my hope keeping my fingers crossed both of them get a brilliant hundred tomorrow and we have some sort of target to defend them let us see
2766337 obviously it is a little disappointment that as a batting unit we did not perform what we should actually have these are the guys who have won games for india it is just a matter of not clicking perhaps
2766338 its just day to day but i dont feel very good today theres no way i could swing a bat
2766339 on a 2 1 pitch i took kind of an awkward swing
2766340 i couldnt breathe it looked up on me thats why we think its spasms its not one side so thats a good thing
2766341 i think ill be ok but i never experienced anything like that i dont know what to expect
2766342 we went in a number of weeks ago and really there is just a hall there
2766343 there is a great deal of work that would need to be done
2766344 we are all shocked at what has happened he was just walking to see a friend and now is in a very bad way his family are really close and are devastated by what has happened
2766345 we have spoken on the phone and i was in tears afterwards
2766346 enough is enough this city has lost too many children to this kind of violence
2766347 our results show that an important mediator of stress induced analgesia could be the potent modulation by noradrenaline of pain pb inputs in the central amygdala
2766348 the impressive new study provides important mechanistic clues helping to explain this phenomenon
2766349 there are reasons to be concerned that chronic alcohol abuse by donors could increase the risk of complications in the transplanted lung
2766350 our goal is not to exclude donors which would be the worst case scenario rather it is to understand the biology so that we can know how to intervene and make outcomes better
2766351 there is considerable evidence that alcohol abuse increases the risk for lung disease and lung injury
2766352 so it is a natural progression to look at lung transplants
2766353 chronic rejection remains the major barrier to successful lung transplantation and unfortunately suppressing the immune system doesnt change the outcome
2766354 august 8 2008 computerworld this year marks an almost forgotten 40th anniversary the conception of the device that ultimately became the pc and no it did not happen in california for decades histories have traced the pcs x86 lineage back to 1972 with intel corp s introduction of the 8008 chip the 8 bit follow on to the 4 bit 4004 itself introduced in 1971 and remembered as the worlds first microprocessor but the full story was not that simple for one thing the x86s lineage can be traced back four additional years to 1968 and it was born at a now defunct firm in san antonio

2766358 the weight loss results are all the more impressive considering that diabetics in general do not respond well to weight loss programmes
2766359 losing weight is never easy and even harder for diabetics
2766360 to achieve these results over a six month period is excellent and with no more side effects than an occasional decrease in blood glucose easily corrected by a reduction in medication is very impressive indeed
2766361 cutting down on portion sizes and eating balanced meals will help people control their weight therefore some people may find this plate useful
2766362 however controlling weight can be achieved effectively without spending extra money
2766363 now patients and their doctors are much more aware of the possible link between avandia and cardiovascular disease this is good this is going to help us going forward to determine whether or not this drug is safe
2766364 its good that theres awareness of the reporting system but drawing conclusions on such data is inappropriate
2766365 you really cant infer anything about incidence rates from that
2766366 it just heightens the concern about the poor reporting we have
2766367 driven by the undiminished intent to attack the homeland and a continued effort by terrorist groups to adapt and improve their capabilities
2766368 have constrained the ability of al qaida to attack the u s homeland again and have led terrorist groups to perceive the homeland as a harder target to strike than on 9 11
2766369 the same folks that are bombing innocent people in iraq were the ones who attacked us in america on sept 11
2766370 thats why what happens in iraq matters to security here at home
2766371 president bush chose to invade iraq thereby diverting our military and intelligence resources away from the real war on terrorism
2766372 threats to the united states homeland are not emanating from iraq they are coming from al qaida leadership
2766373 europe could become a platform for an attack against this country
2766374 there is a considerable al qaida presence at the border but they are under pressure
2766375 the commission offers extensive recommendations for how industry and government can protect against the effects of an emp attack and ensure a quicker recovery
2766376 explicitly discuss a nuclear emp attack that would gravely harm the united states
2766377 one of a small number of threats that can hold our society at risk of catastrophic consequences

2766383 to surrender is the most important thing you can do to bring about positive change any action you take is secondary no truly positive action can arise out of an unsurrendered state of consciousness
2766384 well one of your classes complains that you are not culturally sensitive enough towards the lod culture
2766385 well some of your students girls are complaining that you are touching them in class
2766386 they say that some vocabulary words you give for the week have sexual meaning to it
2766387 and apparently you mentioned the word homosexual in your class
2766388 now u just have to hold on to those sexual feelings you have lil girl its inhuman to have such feelings you must leave them in your closet and be as cold as a freaking dead person

2766437 we recommend for inclusion amongst others the right to trial by jury the right to administrative justice and international human rights as yet not incorporated into uk law
2766438 we believe that there is a strong case for detailed rights for children and we recommend that the public should be consulted about including specific rights for other vulnerable groups
2766439 rights such as the right to adequate healthcare to education and to protection against the worst extremes of poverty touch the substance of peoples everyday lives and would help to correct the popular misconception that human rights are a charter for criminals and terrorists
2766440 we conclude that a bill of rights and freedoms should not include directly enforceable duties

2766459 bottom line the k200d is a very nice entry level dslr the new 10 2 megapixel ccd image sensor combined with a lot of modern technology create a wonderful camera for the price the in body shake reduction capability and improved dust reduction system show that pentax is serious about providing a great camera for the beginner i might have liked to see a live view function but would the novice photographer miss it
2766460 as an entry level dslr the pentax k200d does a great job it manages to create decent shots for any photographic style which is great for the learner trying to find a niche
2766461 but when the price and performance overall are looked at and the sheer amount of neat kit the camera has as standard the k200d is a camera that should be high on your list if youve a tight budget and no previous brand lenses sitting a cupboard
2766462 what to make of the k200d on balance its an unquestionably solid camera and i generally found its straight from camera images rich vibrant and with the right settings smooth all the reasons we buy dslrs visually and functionally the camera is a bit vanilla given the really sharp intuitive interfaces on some of its competitors the pentax may be a bit of hard sell for newbies who heavily bias look and feel in making purchasing decisions advanced shooters may be equally disappointed that pentax didnt cut the questionably valuable scene modes altogether and retain a more advanced control layout with two dials the fact that the k200d didnt at least step up to the k10ds rather paltry continuous shooting performance either is another strike against the new model where serious shooters are concerned
2766463 the most substantial thing is truth nothing is more impressive

2766494 i have no doubt they wanted to target the pipeline there is nothing else here
2766495 it was terribly intense the smell of cordite spread everywhere i had to abandon my car and hide in a ditch but the jets werent interested in other targets
2766496 they immediately made you feel so at ease as it if was your home too
2766497 we were selling the bachmans on ucla but they truly wanted to get to know us
2766498 you knew 30 40 minutes before the game they would be there smiling and cheering
2766499 the first thing she would do is apologize to the player for hitting somebody
2766500 and it wasnt sarcastic it was a genuine remark a reflection of wizs parents
2766501 they had just as much fun watching wiz play volleyball as wiz had playing volleyball
2766502 she was so happy that her parents were going to be there and she was going to get to spend some time with them
2766503 i want to stop everything right now and find the recipe for the bachman bars
2766504 i thought the olympics was in china yall is the special olympics
2766505 the loss of the one person who knew what was currently underway what was planned for the future and had the contacts to gain further support is a significant blow to the taliban extremists command and control in the province brigadier dawson said
2766506 shadow governor responsible for authorising bomb attacks across the province
2766507 extremist cells in afghanistan operate in small isolated groups and only a few key individuals have any sense of the overall provincial insurgency plan brigadier dawson said
2766508 mullah bari ghul was directly responsible for the importation of componentry the provision of specialists in the construction of ieds and authorising their emplacement across the province brigadier dawson said
2766509 he was also ultimately responsible for the july 13 suicide bomber attack in the deh rawood bazaar that killed 21 afghans and injured a further 12 people

2766512 rielle hunter was a private individual who is not running for public office and she wanted to maintain her privacy
2766513 rielle is therefore making no statement now or in the future furthermore rielle will not participate in dna testing or any other invasion of her or her daughters privacy now or in the future
2766514 i am and have been willing to take any test necessary to establish the fact that i am not the father of any baby and i am truly hopeful that a test will be done so this fact can be definitively established
2766515 this was our private matter and i frankly wanted it to be private because as painful as it was i did not want to have to play it out on a public stage as well
2766516 many use the term flat earther as a term of abuse and with connotations that imply blind faith ignorance or even anti intellectualism
2766517 coming across some literature from the flat earth society a few years ago
2766518 i came to realise how much we take at face value
2766519 we humans seem to be pleased with just accepting what we are told no matter how much it goes against our senses
2766520 the earth is flat and horizontally infinite it stretches horizontally forever
2766521 it is always good to question how we know what we know but it is also good to have the ability to accept compelling evidence such as the photographs of earth from space
2766522 work as if you lived in the early days of a better nation
2766523 if these are the early days of a better nation there must be hope and a hope of peace is as good as any and far better than a hollow hoarding greed or the dry lies of an aweless god

2766533 the premise is that pierre haugh haugh is the ex lover of zsu zsu and he wanted to bring her to burning man and he built her this beautiful trailer to make her happy and comfortable
2766534 its kind of an observation of how america sees itself in the world
2766535 in america were kind of isolationist even when we go abroad we dont want to come out of our american style hotel and im guilty of this too sometimes i prefer my single serving packets of other cultures
2766536 ill be listening to people and seeing how they feel
2766537 there is this amazing wealth of energy that is so different from the bay area what happens in the smaller towns like reno is this spring of creativity is starting to bubble to the surface there are people taking the lead and doing amazing work it really blows me away
2766538 to see an artist that is playing with nature playing with the wind is very subtle and very exciting
2766539 so we will get some international recognition for the sculptures that are going up here at the roundabout
2766540 because theyre kinetic and theyre constantly changing and moving as the wind moves and changes people can watch them and in a sense interact by just watching them
2766541 and they will actually interact with the environment out there
2766542 so for an artist to create something that is incorporating that i love that
2766543 out there nature is the element that really is in control to see an artist that is playing with nature playing with the wind is very subtle and very exciting
2766544 it ticked me off that that symbol was a degradation of america
2766545 la tdt es ya una realidad para gran parte de los ciudadanos y en pocos meses ser la nica opci n de televisi n gratuita por ello son preocupantes y poco prudentes situaciones como la de castilla la mancha
2766546 si dejamos que el proceso de adaptaci n se aplace hasta la fecha l mite es probable que nos encontremos despu s con un problema de saturaci n en el sector de los instaladores nada beneficioso para el usuario
2766547 por eso es conveniente realizar la transici n de forma ordenada ya que son muchos los municipios de espa a en los que el apag n se producir antes del 3 de abril de 2010
2766548 precisamente tanto las administraciones locales como impulsa tdt est n promoviendo campa as de concienciaci n ciudadana as como planes de extensi n y mejora de cobertura de la tdt con el fin de que nadie se quede sin televisi n llegada la fecha del cese de emisiones
2766549 el esfuerzo de las administraciones locales y de las comunidades es cada vez mayor lo que nos permite ser optimistas respecto al xito en el cumplimiento de las fechas establecidas
2766550 situaciones de baja penetraci n como la de castilla la mancha deben hacer que las instituciones y la administraci n p blica reaccionen de manera inmediata la tdt es una tecnolog a obligatoria y con fecha de implantaci n debemos transmitir a la sociedad sin margen para la duda que si no adaptan su televisor en pocos meses simplemente no podr n ver ning n canal de televisi n en abierto
2766551 there somewhat is relief the day is over we overcame so much it was all kind of a whirlwind
2766552 and we got the nerves out and the mistakes out
2766553 i knew things were happening i couldnt control and that were obviously not very good
2766554 it was a little bit hard to go out from there
2766555 a few of us had tears in our eyes because we know how badly she wanted to be out there we said lets do it for her lets do it for our families lets do it for the people back home

2766572 he hates it the way most red sox fans hate the yankees with a genuine passion he is the type of republican who goes out of his way to criticize republican leaders in washington not just democrats for their irresponsible use of our tax dollars
2766573 growing up in manchester many of my political views were shaped by the editorials in the
2766574 i am so thrilled to have earned their support and i intend to keep doing the things that i have done in the past making government smaller more efficient and more effective that caused this important new hampshire institution to endorse my candidacy
2766575 if the economics fit for additional expansion it should be evaluated

2766603 georgien russland und die ganze welt sehen jetzt ganz klar ein dass sich die georgische f hrung mit ihren nato bestrebungen kaum von dem wunsch leiten l sst ein teil der globalen sicherheitssystems zu werden und zum internationalen frieden beizutragen
2766604 ihre nato bestrebungen sind auf etwas anderes zur ckzuf hren und zwar auf den versuch andere l nder und v lker in ihre blutigen unterfangen hineinzuziehen
2766605 gem den geltenden internationalen abkommen darunter aus dem jahr 1999 bernimmt russland friedensmissionen falls eine konfliktpartei gegen die vereinbarung ber den gewaltverzicht verst t ist russland verpflichtet die andere partei in schutz zu nehmen das haben wir in bezug auf s dossetien auch getan
2766606 wir fordern die georgische f hrung auf die aggression gegen s dossetien sowie verst e gegen die bisherigen friedensvereinbarungen sofort zu stoppen und legitime rechte und interessen anderer v lker zu beachten
2766607 in russland verhielt man sich immer mit gro em respekt zum georgischen volk man h lt es f r ein brudervolk so bleibt es auch k nftig trotz der verbrecherischen politik der heutigen georgischen staatsf hrung dieses wird das georgische volk nach einiger zeit selbst objektiv bewerten

2766637 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2766638 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

2766652 but whats funny is that a lot of people come up to me now telling me how much they love the first record initially there was a backlash because every fan who followed my former band wanted to hear rust in peace from any of us that were in that band laughs thats like the heisman trophy record that album is the holy grail of the work we did right wrong or indifferent but the reality of it is life moves on and im happy with all the work that ive done the other thing is now when i do new things theyre not under that band name so by nature they have the creative liberty to be different i know a lot of people that say we just want you to go back to that band and do that thing and i get it i appreciate it and thank you but f5 has really become my creative home for the last few years the thing about a drug for all seasons is that it takes you on this listening journey through a lot of different stuff i think the f5 records are best when listened to as a body of work rather than just pulling a single track out
2766653 for me if the new record was going to be compared to my past stuff as so much of my current work always is it fits in the category with countdown to extinction
2766654 i think when people first heard me launch out on my own there was naturally a similarity that theyre going to draw a comparison to the first f5 record was successful in that it was heavy but it clearly wasnt following in the same footsteps because quite honestly that would have been easy it would have been a no brainer to get a bunch of guys together put on black shirts and play thrash metal ive been doing that my whole life
2766655 our guitarist steve conley who is a real old school metalhead and a big fan of shred guitar playing he walked away from the first record feeling dissatisfied because he felt he wasnt able to really let his gifts shine when we got on the road and when we started writing new material which was a few years ago now thats when we really laid the goods on the table we approached the production for the new record differently we didnt put any limitations on things keep in mind that its 2008 the first record was made in 2004 and released in 2005 and in three or four short years its a different world f5 was never a band that followed what other people did we got together in a room and made music good or bad and thats what it is
2766656 for me theres a huge sense of pride that we were able to make a second one
2766657 i think the reckoning shows huge growth and again in a former setting i did a record called killing is my business and that was very raw it was as cut and dried meet and potatoes as it got but when we graduated to peace sells but whos buying it was a huge monumental jump that happens when bands stay together and work together by nature they grow im just referencing the past only because ive been down these roads before laughs and in my case im doing something new and fresh to have the experience already and have a second chance at it in a new setting all these years later its sort of the pride of family that i have for this new f5 record i mean sales will be what they are radio play and all the rest of it is completely out of our control i try not to even go there anymore for me its about what can we control what can we improve and what can we do to make f5 even better
2766658 fundamentally the music was well on its way so when jimmy came in he was the icing on an already very tasty cake that was being made laughs when we knew the drum change was coming down the guys in f5 immediately looked at me point blank and said degrasso what are you waiting for why havent you called him yet laughs and when i called him and asked if he wanted to play on the new f5 record he told me of course i do i told you you should have called me to play on the first one in my opinion this is one of the best records jimmy has recorded i think its the best record ive ever played on with him musically from a songwriting point of view its the best from a pure showcasing of chops and ability its the best record that ive worked with him on we did a record a couple years ago under the name killing machine and jimmy crushed on that one he and i were a rhythm section monster and its been fun to play in a lot of different settings with him
2766659 my spot on the bed is my spot in the world
2766660 pleasurable and i might go cast the people and see my characters come to life and i put the music in and i see the characters playing their scenes to the beautiful music behind them you know i get a kick out of that and if nobody else does thats too bad
2766661 when youre a kid you think to yourself fame and fortune and its going to be so exciting and but then you quickly find after three or four films you find wait a minute the upside is nothing and the downside is nothing the adulation of the multitudes or of the critics is an impersonal experience and the negative feelings from people is an impersonal experience the contract that the audience has with the person is you entertain us and well show up and that is as the contract should be
2766662 i always wanted to make the kinds of films that i saw in the 1950s the truffaut films and the goddard films and the bergmans and fellinis and those are the films that always influenced my work and ive always copied them and been influenced by them vicky christina barcelona looks to me when i see it like one of those films its got all the earmarks the music the people bicycling through europe the interaction of the characters and the out of focus scenes that you see in those pictures
2766663 barcelona is a city that i can live in very easily
2766664 if they mentioned some city in the ukraine or the sudan or something i would have said no but barcelona is a beautiful wonderful city
2766665 and when i saw her i thought my god shes if you can believe this more beautiful in person than she is on the screen i thought she was so beautiful it took my breath away
2766666 i would have given her all the furniture you know
2766667 i thought ok i have these two great tempestuous spaniards and barcelona but i dont have a film
2766668 if there are no parts for me then i just wont play any and if theres a lovable character named gramps who you know was wise beyond his years you know then
2766669 im not like dustin hoffman or robert de niro these guys go out and do miracles on the screen im a perfectly believable actor in my small range so i can play a college professor i can play a shrink i could play an intellectual even though im not an intellectual or i can play a lowlife i can play like broadway danny rose or i could play a cheesy little bookmaker or a grifter of some sort because i can handle that me the character for real is closer to the sleaze ball but i can act both of them
2766670 i always feel like i am doing the same process all the time i dont make them any differently
2766671 i dont feel any sense of liberation in europe i dont feel that i make happy films when im happy and sad films when im sad i dont feel i make autobiographical films i was not particularly happy or going through a good time of life when i made take the money and run and bananas those are two of my most silly comic films whereas when i made cassandras dream and match point i was going through a very wonderful time of life these have been very good years for me i have a great marriage great kids there is no plan or agenda to it or anything its luck its random
2766672 its a way of coping with the world you know in the same way that somebody copes with it by being a stamp collector or a sports addict or a titan of industry or an alcoholic or something my way of coping with the horrors of existence is to put my nose to the grindstone and work and not look up

2766722 we have said that this is a condition driven process
2766723 no no definitely there has to be a very clear timeline
2766724 we are only now able to discuss conditions based time horizons because security has improved so much this would not have been possible 18 months ago
2766725 we all look forward to the day when iraqi security forces take the lead on more combat missions allowing u s troops to serve in an overwatch role and more importantly return home
2766726 this was a heinous attack by al qaida in iraq against an iraqi family followed by a cowardly attack against innocent civilians their security forces and u s soldiers
2766727 i did not expect that a terrorist attack to take place in our secure town
2766728 al qaida is to blame for this attack operations in diyala have pushed them here
2766729 georgia expresses its readiness to immediately start negotiations with the russian federation on cease fire and termination of hostilities

2766731 we heard a plane go over and then a big explosion
2766732 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2766733 the deployment is quite natural we dont want a repeat of what happened in south ossetia
2766734 if the disproportionate and dangerous escalation on the russian side continues that this will have a significant long term impact on u s russian relations
2766735 whatever side is used to bomb civilians and the positions of peacekeepers this side is not safe and they should know this
2766736 complete genocide putin also said georgia had effectively lost the right to rule the breakaway province an indication moscow could be preparing to fulfill south ossetians wish to be absorbed into russia georgia borders the black sea between turkey and russia and was ruled by moscow for most of the two centuries preceding the breakup of the soviet union today russia has approximately 30 times more people than georgia and 240 times the area russia also laid much of the responsibility for ending the fighting on washington which has trained georgian troops washington in turned blamed russia georgia said it has shot down 10 russian planes including four brought down saturday according to lomaia it also claimed to have captured two russian pilots who were shown on georgian television russian col gen anatoly nogovitsyn deputy chief of the general staff confirmed saturday that two russian planes had been shot down but did not say where or when russian military commanders said 15 peacekeepers have been killed and about 150 wounded in south ossetia accusing georgian troops of killing and wounding russian peacekeepers when they seized russian checkpoints the allegations couldnt be independently confirmed in abkhazia the separatist government said it intended to push georgian forces out of the kodori gorge the northern part of the gorge is the only area of abkhazia that has remained under georgian government control separatist forces also were concentrating on the border with georgias zugdidi region and russias ntv television reported that additional russian troops landed in abkhazia sunday heading in the same direction georgian troops retreat after russian onslaught iraq demands clear timeline
2766737 no state man or woman should fear the influence of loving religion
2766738 a constitution differs from a statute or ordinary act of legislation in three important
2766739 1 it is enacted by the people as a whole that is by vote of the qualified electorate who are to be governed by it instead of by their representatives in a congress or legislature 2 a constitution can be abrogated repealed or modified only by the power which created it namely the people in the sense stated above whereas a statute may be repealed or changed by the legislature the people however can modify or repeal their constitution only through the medium of a constitutional convention or constituent assembly or by affirmative vote on amendments or on a new constitution duly submitted by the legislature in those states where the initiative and referendum are in use the provisions of the constitution are as binding on the people in the exercise of their legislative prerogative as upon the legislature that is these devices cannot be used to alter the constitution in any other mode than as the constitution itself provides state v dixon 59 mont 58 195 p 841 state v stewart 53 mont 18 161 p 309 city of ft collins v public utilities commission 69 colo 554 195 p 1099 3 the provisions of a constitution refer to the fundamental principles of government and the establishment and guaranty of liberties instead of being designed merely to regulate the conduct of individuals among themselves constitutions announce principles while statutes apply them sproules v state 97 tex cr r 561 262 s w 757 but the tendency towards amplification in modern constitutions derogates from the precision of this last distinction
2766740 im afraid what its going to turn out to be is kind of a circus of folks feeling like they have to make a statement on whether nbaf should be here or not which is not really the purpose of the meeting
2766741 i cannot support bringing a federal facility to a community in my district that does not welcome it
2766742 i continue to believe that we must do the research that would be conducted at the proposed facility to protect public health and our food supply whether at the current location at plum island or elsewhere and that wherever the research is done it must be done safely
2766743 i dont have the sense that homeland security has been withholding information
2766744 at this point theres nothing that will change my mind about this lab
2766745 i think it will be very similar to the previous meetings
2766746 progress energy is far above the industry average in three important areas emergency reactor shutdowns required inspections and the fact that it has interconnected harris reactors cooling system to four high level waste pools the largest in the nation
2766747 spent fuel recently discharged from a reactor could heat up relatively rapidly and catch fire
2766748 the fire could well spread to older fuel the long term land contamination consequences of such an event could be significantly worse than chernobyl
2766749 a hard hitting critique that sort of undermines the study deeply
2766750 after 9 11 the nuclear industry faked a report to convince the public that an airplane hitting a nuke plant is nothing to worry about and now the nrc has directed the production of a bogus study to deny decades of science on the perils of pool fires

2766764 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2766765 the deployment is quite natural we dont want a repeat of what happened in south ossetia
2766766 if the disproportionate and dangerous escalation on the russian side continues that this will have a significant long term impact on u s russian relations
2766767 whatever side is used to bomb civilians and the positions of peacekeepers this side is not safe and they should know this
2766768 complete genocide putin also said georgia had effectively lost the right to rule the breakaway province an indication moscow could be preparing to fulfill south ossetians wish to be absorbed into russia

2766787 one of the most interesting findings from our nac user study is that networking groups are responsible for day to day management of nac at about two thirds of the medium and large organizations we interviewed
2766788 nac is a very unique example of a critical piece of it infrastructure that is entirely driven by security concerns but largely managed by networking gurus selling nac solutions requires a certain amount of finesse vendors need to understand how to appeal to both groups and most importantly to acknowledge and handle the security teams concerns while ultimately focusing on making a solution that is deployable by a networking professional
2766789 as a key component of unified communications sales of communicator software clients are taking off the nortel microsoft alliance drove growth in 2007 and microsoft captured close to half the communicator market
2766790 market share will likely bounce around in the coming years as vendors from different backgrounds try to establish themselves as the leader in the nascent uc market and promote their offerings aggressively
2766791 the emergence of non traditional providers like google and enterprise acceptance of software as a service has boosted the opportunity for content security services particularly in the cloud services and these services are really driving the strong growth we forecast through 2011
2766792 meanwhile in the managed encrypted vpn space the drivers are still there productivity improvements and costs savings combined with the complexity of deploying them but mpls is really starting to steal business away from encrypted site to site vpn services

2766795 this confirms what many managers in the workforce are already keenly aware of there is an acute and growing need for more it professionals
2766796 with more and more businesses moving critical operational functions over to the network the it department is assuming a much more strategic role in the organization and needs its infrastructure to be designed implemented and maintained by highly skilled highly trained individuals
2766797 t here is a skill gap the difference between the supply of skilled workers and the demand for those skills represents a challenge for networking vendors and their clients and an opportunity for it professionals
2766798 the overall gap between supply and demand for networking professionals is about 8 percent of the total demand the good news is that the overall gap isnt getting any bigger the bad news is that in some specialties such as wireless networking the gap is large and in other segments such as network security the gap is growing very fast
2766799 customer demand and ip and next gen network transformation projects are the two main factors contributing to the growing popularity of ethernet and ip mpls vpn services
2766800 companies like these services because they offer considerably more bandwidth with little or no increased wan costs compared to their legacy counterparts
2766801 customers expect and get a better per bit cost for ethernet services and service providers like them because they help bring in new revenue so requests for ethernet and ip mpls vpn services are coming from both sides
2766802 deployment of 40 gbps circuits throughout our ip core enables next generation data voice and video applications and allows sprint to scale its ip network to address customer needs as ip increasingly becomes the basis of communications services
2766803 while service provider wireless and fmc equipment and enterprise routers switches and wireless lan equipment make up the largest portions of revenue the increases were seeing in the overall telecom and datacom equipment market are being fueled by the transformation to ip packet networks as evidenced by strong growth in the iptv and service provider voip and ims segments
2766804 with the rapid proliferation of networking technology and new consumer electronics devices the ability to quickly and easily connect to a range of devices content and services throughout the home is becoming paramount to achieving a satisfying consumer experience

2766834 from the veteran communitys point of view he is not the person we want in the job
2766835 he is representing veterans and our history and our contribution
2766836 during the vietnam war he left australia then actively campaigned against the war in the uk saying it was a sad day when the viet cong was defeated this is the guy weve got to deal with and thats not good enough
2766837 we would not consider him an appropriate person to be doing veterans affairs
2766838 his views on conscription at the time of the vietnam conflict are well known and were indeed shared by many other australians both at the time and across the spectrum of australian military and political history

2766868 georgia expresses its readiness to immediately start negotiations with the russian federation on a ceasefire and termination of hostilities
2766869 we do not plan to escalate the conflict in this region
2766870 they were on a mass scale and were directed against individuals
2766871 were being driven away the place was in flames and we couldnt stay
2766872 this reminds me all too much of other recent conflicts that have torn our continent apart particularly in the balkans
2766873 in no way do we have plans to invade georgia
2766874 there is a military airfield there so what were actually doing is we are striking against legitimate military targets in order to prevent georgian aircraft and military attack our peacekeepers
2766875 we want to force the georgian leadership to peace and what we see right now on the ground is that georgian troops not withdrawing but regrouping including increased attacks on south ossetia capital tskhinvali
2766876 the best thing he could do right now is to unconditionally i repeat unconditionally withdraw his troops and sign a legally binding agreement with ossetians on no use of force
2766877 russian planes dropped several bombs on a military airfield not far from tbilisi international airport
2766878 the secretary general of nato repeated today his call for an immediate ceasefire

2766898 he made it clear that i owe it to my teammates and coaches and everyone involved to stick with it and do my best
2766899 his big thing has always been mental toughness not allowing things that i cant control as a goalie to bother me
2766900 ive been away from home since i was 15 years old
2766901 we havent had the opportunity to do the things that a father and son do going out to dinner watching football games

2766903 he didnt want me to make the same mistakes that a lot of young guys do make that money make it early and start to spend lavishly and get crazy he wants me to be smart about it
2766904 the only thing we have to do is hold rick back from spending
2766905 but i give him credit hes been very smart about it
2766906 every time theyre around each other you can tell big rick is so proud of little rick
2766907 his dad is such a key person in ricks development as a person and as a hockey player
2766908 sometimes i call him on a saturday and ask what are you doing and hell sat oh watching old games on tivo he loves it
2766909 but i never worry about him just blowing smoke sometimes the truth hurts he tells me straight and i appreciate it
2766910 ive gotten him to open up to have more fun and be more relaxed about everything
2766911 sometimes hes the life of the party now hes telling jokes hes a lot funnier than what i remember as a kid its unbelievable how the relationship grows when you get older you get to see a side of your parents that you never saw as a young kid
2766912 at the end of the day as selfish as it is that you want them to stay together as you get older you realize that you want your parents to be happy and if its divorce then thats the way

2766997 it was a little bit hard to go out from there
2766998 a few of us had tears in our eyes because we know how badly she wanted to be out there we said lets do it for her lets do it for our families lets do it for the people back home
2766999 well come back strongly in the team finals and fight for it
2767000 ive been doing it so well in training i think i just pulled so hard and i overrotated
2767001 i am very satisfied with the chinese girls performance if i can give them a score i would say 70 percent mainly for he kexin falling off the uneven bars its a big pity for her
2767002 maybe she was nervous because she wanted to perform her best
2767003 pick up the tab for the highest cost medical cases

2767007 if there was one couple that deserved to make it it was john and carol mccain
2767008 they endured nearly six years of unspeakable trauma with courage and grace in the end it was not enough they won the war but lost the peace
2767009 based on the witnesses statements and the preliminary evidence we believe they were drag racing
2767010 speed appears to have been a factor from what we know the witnesses skid marks and the accident itself
2767011 the first car flew around us speeding and the second car went to pass me too and then went fishtailing
2767012 we were out celebrating my fathers retirement from raytheon some retirement party huh

2767029 fine son what part of the war would you like me to tell you about
2767030 the actual fighting i mean youre first battle must have been so awesome
2767031 do you remember my son that one night when you woke in the young hours of the morning gasping for breath and wailing out of fear
2767032 it was because of a nightmare you ran into my bedroom and practically jumped on top of your mother you were shouting shouting at the top of your lungs that there was a horde of demons chasing you
2767033 my first battle was your nightmare i shot and shot and shot but the demons kept coming i couldnt really see them there was too much dust and fear in the air my heart was crunching in on itself the rest of me terribly shaking i ran i ran oh how i wish i could have woken up and ran into my mothers bedroom
2767034 no jacob battles and war are not like a nightmare i woke up the next morning and my friends were still gone the demons got them my mother was far far away

2767041 today is raining and tomorrow will have rain too that will help reduce the air pollution level we believe the current air flow will be helpful in the dispersion of pollutants in the air
2767042 you can control beijing as much as you like but youre not going to see much of an effect

2767055 the new fashion for biological determinism in debates about differences between the sexes
2767056 reveal the neurological explanations behind why a woman uses about 20 000 words per day while a man uses about 7 000 a woman remembers fights that a man insists never happened a teen girl is so obsessed with her looks and talking on the phone thoughts about sex enter a womans brain once every couple of days but enter a mans brain about once every minute a woman knows what people are feeling while a man cant spot an emotion unless somebody cries or threatens bodily harm a woman over fifty is more likely to initiate divorce than a man
2767057 journalists and the public often assume that one can turn small differences in group distributions into categorical statements about all members of that group
2767058 the men varied a great deal in talkativeness and so did the women but on average men were somewhat more talkative than women if you listened to a hundred conversations between men and women youd find that in 54 of the conversations the man talked more than the woman while in 46 of them the woman talked more than the man even if you listened only to men talking with men and women talking with women youd find the same tendency a slight advantage in talkativeness for the men on average but a great deal of overlap between the groups

2767061 hoe breng ik in n keer de cultuur van qbuzz over op honderden buschauffeurs
2767062 ons eigen geld zit erin dus als het fout gaat is het over en uit
2767063 nee geen spaans strandje ik ben nu ondernemer dat is heel leuk met bussen heb ik niets maar wel wat met dienstverlening klanten en aansturen van grote groepen werknemers we zijn nu volop bezig met het bestellen van bussen het aannemen van personeel en het laten maken van kleding en qbuzz betekent niets gewoon een lekkere naam het zal vooral de jeugd aanspreken omdat zij de grootste gebruikersgroep is van streekbussen
2767064 we zijn het nederlandse antwoord op het feit dat inmiddels alle streekvervoersbedrijven in buitenlandse handen zijn gevallen connexxion is van het franse transdev veolia is frans en arriva is brits red om die reden zochten we ook een nederlandse aandeelhouder we hadden ook een buitenlandse partner kunnen kiezen deutsche bahn en first group uit engeland willen hier graag beginnen met ns als partner denken we de reiziger een beter product te kunnen leveren we vertrekken pas met onze bussen als de trein binnen is bij qbuzz staat de klant centraal dat zeggen de concurrenten ook maar wij doen het bussen vertrekken op tijd dus niet te vroeg mocht dat toch het geval zijn dan krijgt de klant zijn geld terug zijn er forse vertragingen dan krijg je ook je geld terug net als bij de ns het geval is wat ook belangrijk is is dat in elke bus een display komt te hangen die aangeeft hoe laat men bij het station aankomt

2767066 we recommend for inclusion amongst others the right to trial by jury the right to administrative justice and international human rights as yet not incorporated into uk law
2767067 we believe that there is a strong case for detailed rights for children and we recommend that the public should be consulted about including specific rights for other vulnerable groups
2767068 we conclude that a bill of rights and freedoms should not include directly enforceable duties
2767069 i try to serve the forwards in which ever way they want whether its at ground level or from a deep position my primary aim is to create space and movement and to take the initiative with the other midfielders
2767070 we could do better if we could score early on the games would become a lot easier
2767071 in any team it is important to have a technical leader we had one last year johan micoud and when he left we replaced him with gourcuff who is an excellent technical player who can inspire the others to play well you could also consider fernando cavenaghi in that category so having two on the pitch is a considerable advantage

2767077 i love playing attacking football and seeing my players in constant movement i can promise you the same style when i take over as china coach
2767078 absolutely theres a lot of truth to what the president said and in terms of wall street there was too much leverage in the system and more leverage than was appropriate and more than people recognized because the leverage came into the system in the form of highly complex structured products which were difficult to understand
2767079 there is no question about it wall street got drunk
2767080 thats one reason i asked you to turn off your tv cameras
2767081 the question is how long will it take to sober up and not try to do all these fancy financial instruments
2767082 we have of course one priority getting through this period with as little damage as little negative impact as possible on the economy but the second part is to take steps to reduce the likelihood of these sorts of things happening in the future
2767083 we sized that program to say how could we do something that will be meaningful this year but not so big that it would jeopardize some of our long term priorities and our fiscal priorities and balancing the budget so again my view would be lets see how this program works in the third quarter
2767084 the united nations security council began meeting for a fourth day on sunday to discuss the conflict it has so far failed to agree on the wording of a statement calling for a ceasefire
2767085 absolutely theres a lot of truth to what the president said and in terms of wall street there was too much leverage in the system and more leverage than was appropriate and more than people recognized because the leverage came into the system in the form of highly complex structured products which were difficult to understand
2767086 there is no question about it wall street got drunk

2767098 strengthening the taiwanese economy through a warming of relations with the mainland
2767099 633 is not just a number it is our promise to taiwan
2767100 the idea is quite simple we dont want to negotiate a peace agreement while our security is under the threat of missile attack
2767101 our position is that the diaoyutai islands are taiwans territory they belong to taiwan
2767102 ive got the full backing of the club the board and the players
2767103 i feel a bit miffed because we stayed up the year before and got mid table last year but nothing surprises me in football anymore
2767104 we tried so hard for people not to have pot shots at us last season but it looks as if they are back
2767105 i wanted to be on the back pages for the right reasons last season but it doesnt concern me the players are behind me
2767106 going into any game i always believe i can score
2767107 over the two legs i could have got one or two goals i dont think kaunas were anything great
2767108 even on their day i dont think theyre any better than a team finishing fourth or fifth in scotland
2767109 they didnt create anything apart from set pieces but we only have ourselves to blame the fans were with us every step of the way last year but weve let them down
2767110 last season seems so far away even in pre season we just havent been at it
2767111 you need players that can create and i dont think we have that
2767112 we would have taken quaresma and saviola but the players decided not to come
2767113 we have always thought that this formula could be successful so we have looked at crosas we are not finally there but that deal is now a structure which will hopefully allow us to add players going forward
2767114 hopefully it makes a lot of sense not only with barcelona but with other clubs too
2767115 a young or fringe barcelona player could come here play in our first team play in front of 60 000 and in europe and develop as a player both clubs could benefit from that
2767116 birds cause some considerable problem in forms of noise and dirt
2767117 not only do their droppings damage and contaminate property the birds also carry various diseases such as salmonella
2767118 food put out for them will also attract rats and vermin
2767119 if we establish that a nuisance or pest problem does exist we may have to reconsider further action
2767120 its absolutely ridiculous about 90 of people in belford feed their birds im not going to stop
2767121 we would encourage people to feed their garden birds throughout the year
2767122 this is an important time when a lot of adolescent birds are putting down fat to see them through the winter and they need to feed up
2767123 the unique tangle of chinese food and culture and the ways both have been influenced by the countrys volatile political history
2767124 i know this sounds strange but i want to go to starbucks and mcdonalds i want to see what kinds of local tastes are represented there

2767146 bloody harvest report into allegations of organ harvesting of falun gong practitioners in china
2767147 the goal of the olympics is to place sports everywhere at the service of a harmonious development of man with a view to encouraging the establishment of a peaceful society concerned with preservation of human dignity to this effect the olympic movement engages alone or in cooperation with other organizations and within the limits of its means in actions to promote peace
2767148 safeguarding the dignity of the individual is a fundamental requirement of the olympics
2767149 we have carefully thought about what kind of role the ioc an organisation created to bring the benefits of sport to society can play in more diverse matters
2767150 the ioc is committed to bringing the olympic movement to china for the first time in history because we believe that examples set by the olympic ideals have and will continue to have many positive benefits for china and the world
2767151 regrettably it confirms our earlier conclusion that the government of china and its agencies in numerous parts of the country in particular in hospitals but also detention centers and peoples courts have put to death a large but unknown number of falun gong prisoners of conscience since 1999 their vital organs including hearts kidneys livers and corneas were virtually simultaneously seized involuntarily for sale at high prices sometimes to foreigners who normally face long waits for voluntary donations of such organs in their home countries
2767152 bloody harvest revised report into allegations of organ harvesting of falun gong practitioners in china in january this year
2767153 according to law no filmmaker can use animals in their films without the permission of the awbi but neither the filmmakers nor the censor board bothered to get this clearance
2767154 two months back they were sent a notice regarding the issue but they didnt take our permission and got a go ahead from the censor board
2767155 its only on dec 25 that they applied for permission which is really too late to seek permission
2767156 das war heute alles nicht so locker und leicht wie es schon einmal war
2767157 there somewhat is relief the day is over we overcame so much it was all kind of a whirlwind
2767158 and we got the nerves out and the mistakes out
2767159 i knew things were happening i couldnt control and that were obviously not very good
2767160 it was a little bit hard to go out from there
2767161 a few of us had tears in our eyes because we know how badly she wanted to be out there we said lets do it for her lets do it for our families lets do it for the people back home
2767162 well come back strongly in the team finals and fight for it
2767163 ive been doing it so well in training i think i just pulled so hard and i overrotated
2767164 i am very satisfied with the chinese girls performance if i can give them a score i would say 70 percent mainly for he kexin falling off the uneven bars its a big pity for her
2767165 maybe she was nervous because she wanted to perform her best
2767166 after three years its unbelievable that everything is taking so long to get moving
2767167 for people who want to come home rent is more expensive utilities are more expensive everythings more expensive nobodys doing anything to get people home a lot of people are in bad health because of stress
2767168 the problem is that too many people have their hand in the cookie jar
2767169 a lot of people are thinking too much about themselves and not looking at the bigger picture that goes for city government all the way up to the federal government politicians will promise you the world but when it comes down to it its politics as usual

2767171 we wanted our daughter to know her parents were married that was the big thing for us
2767172 our journey to parenthood was not easy cheap or fun
2767173 the result however has been the most amazing experience in the world being called daddy and dad by our loving daughter
2767174 all the realms involved with men are much more complex
2767175 for future generations knowing they can fall in love get married have a child absolutely that will become a way of life more than it is
2767176 as a couple with kids you really see the importance of it trying to get as many protections as you can
2767177 ik merkte al op training dat glenn in conditie stak en een verbetering niet onmogelijk was
2767178 zijn record dateerde echter pas van eind juni dat hij op zon korte tijd nog zon progressie zou maken verraste me toch een beetje surgeloose had bovendien het lichte nadeel in baan 8 te moeten zwemmen waardoor hij de rest van het veld niet zag zijn prestatie mag er zijn hij is niet langer meer de zwemmer van rond de kerktoren waarvoor sommigen hem versleten vergeet ook niet dat hij de jongste deelnemer was van het hele lot
2767179 wat elise hier vandaag liet zien was klasse ze kneep nog een heel stuk af van haar vorig record liefst 58 honderdsten het feit dat ze als n van de jongste deelneemsters de halve finale haalt is op zich al een prestatie haar eerste rendez vous met de groten is geslaagd ze leeft echt op een wolk alles wat nu nog komt is pure winst zowel op het vlak van ervaring als wie weet van tijd

2767190 well continue working until the people of burma have their freedom that they deserve
2767191 the very best solution would be if the regime than shwes regime would start real dialogue and accept refugees in safety and security
2767192 i think its hard to overstate the influence of laura
2767193 the issues in burma are much less ambiguous than they are for other places
2767194 by attacking burma you get to address the broader issue state your principles without jeopardizing important relationships
2767195 a large trend is being crystallized among the palestinian national authority pna in ramallah to call for settling the situation with the gaza strip by force
2767196 to give the last chance for the egyptian government and the arab league to convince hamas to immediately end its coup and engage in the dialogue
2767197 but the door for dialogue will not be open forever and the leadership only gave one month time for the efforts
2767198 will be a dangerous thing if it was officially made
2767199 it will boost the internal split and separate gaza from the west bank
2767200 fatah elements who dominate the plos executive committee have a plan to prevent any attempt of approach between hamas and fatah

2767204 we want them to feel that theyre being judged on their smarts and their competitiveness and their compassion and not just you know looking cute
2767205 well she seems like a good person her family seems to love her everybody makes mistakes so i hope that people wont judge her for just this one picture
2767206 we want to make sure that theyre not landing on some site that would make us blanch
2767207 when i let her know that i understood and heard what she was saying i think that was important to her
2767208 as a consequence of my books doing well suddenly its easier to get takeout whenever we feel like it its easier to get a housekeeper to come in one or two days to help do the laundry or help clean up its easier to do a lot of things that frankly the vast majority of american women cant afford but were not that far removed from the situation where this work was falling on her in a very heavy way
2767209 but what i know is that shell be at the center of the democratic party for a very long time

2767211 by taking the nomination in a slimey way from a very competent female someone more prepared to assume the mantle of president of united states than him but gender won out here and played out here all across the united states
2767212 the statements from the whole group result in a total lack of coherence from which we easily conclude that theyre all lying
2767213 i am appealing to you as a fellow human being to work with us if possible to include us and to remember that we are madeleines parents lack of communication is torture
2767214 there is a sense of anger frustration and great sadness theyve waited for this evidence of sightings for a long time its work they could have started 15 months ago but this is the time for them to keep focus and consider everything carefully before deciding what course of action to take then they will have their day they will make their views clear
2767215 i believe he can recommend charges or action be taken against the police as a whole as well as individual officers
2767216 the early stages of the investigation led by detectives in portimao really were very poor
2767217 a number of people had touched the window and entered madeleines and the twins room prior to the arrival of the gnr local police
2767218 her eyes met mine as i walked past and thats when i saw the little blemish in her right eye it was like a little fleck
2767219 intelligence suggests that a paedophile ring in belgium made an order for a young girl three days before madeleine mccann was taken somebody connected to this group saw maddie took a photograph of her and sent it to belgium the purchaser agreed that the girl was suitable and maddie was taken
2767220 one must suppose that the child madeleine mccann could have died inside the apartment
2767221 the whole attitude throughout was one of we think theyre involved there are some vague indications lets throw caution to the wind and see if we can get a conviction
2767222 the documents are a field of potential leads and any one of them could unlock the case they will never give up the search for madeleine
2767223 a network with all kinds of criminal activities really does exist but the authorities dont want to look into it
2767224 in general paedophiles ask for a particular type of abuse rather than a particular child
2767225 the majority of sexual abuse occurs in the home or by people the child knows
2767226 people have come to the conclusion that the closer he is to wanting to obtain power the more difficult others will make it for him to achieve that
2767227 a lot of people are very tired after living through the first sodomy trial which had a chilling effect on the country even until today people thought it was blatant political manoeuvering
2767228 the new sodomy charges against anwar ibrahim are all a political game because he is now a real threat to the prime minister
2767229 anwar was cleared of all the sodomy charges before so what are they trying to prove now we have all grown up in the last 10 years and people are not so stupid to just accept all these things blindly
2767230 it looks like the government is out to fix him again everyone knows that the charge against him is nothing but a lie
2767231 the only thing we can do now is to vote for anwar and make sure he gets to parliament and eventually form the government only then can we right all that is wrong in this country
2767232 the new bureaucracies of virtue or when form fails to follow function
2767233 having now been on the receiving end of irb objections that i find incomprehensible i appreciate my colleagues multiple frustrations
2767234 the mission creep or bureaucracy run amok complaint the process of prospective review is unwarranted there is no convincing evidence that the risks attached to social science research justify it
2767235 the inappropriate model argument even if what we did was sufficiently risky to warrant prospective review the model that we are saddled with is so rooted in the model of the biomedical randomized clinical trial that we cannot use it sensibly
2767236 journalists are allowed to do what we seek to do without fetters
2767237 there is no evidence that irbs have been very successful in preventing just those abuses that they were designed to create argument
2767238 bureaucracies of mass deception institutional review boards and the ethics of ethnographic research
2767239 the problem with the chorus of complaint is that it fails to explain the organizational logic that enabled even encouraged such pernicious mission creep or what to do about it now that it has become an inescapable part of the lived experience of ethnographic research
2767240 leads workers to ignore goals and focus on even sanctify the means or operating rules and procedures the forms properly filled out and filed the meeting of organizational timetables and the exercise of authority by those who possess it all have a value that transcends the original motives and intentions that created the formal organization
2767241 regulating creativity research and survival in the irb iron cage
2767242 we seem to forget that those who serve on irbs are our colleagues that their service spares us unwanted burdens and that they deserve a civil dialogue
2767243 why researchers did not more actively resist their own silencing
2767244 the gravest ethical problem facing the people studied by anthropological research is posed by unknowing and overzealous irbs and by governmental regulators attempting to force qualitative ethnographic studies into a biomedical mold
2767245 the problem with complaint the undeniable compensatory charm that a sputtering public moral outrage provides notwithstanding is that it does not create a viable alternative to the status quo
2767246 might be remedied by educating better irb members about the nature of qualitative methods or of the regulations themselves
2767247 research on autonomous adults whose methodology consists entirely in collecting data by surveys conducting interviews or observing behavior in public places be exempt from the requirement of irb review straightforwardly exempt with no provisos and no requirement of irb approval of the exemption
2767248 the point is not simply to complain about the world but to change it

2767251 grunnen til at jeg hater iphone er p grunn av mangelen p hardware og software kontra pris

2767256 this place if you stay here more than a week they dont provide toilet paper
2767257 people do make choices and some of those choices arent so good
2767258 i want to show them something to think ahead on things to kind of organize things
2767259 thats really hard when theyre in the shelters and moving from place to place
2767260 i hear a lot of people say why cant they go to mcdonalds and get a job flipping hamburgers but mcdonalds has criteria you know they do criminal background checks even if they have a job there they cant pay rent and gas and child care
2767261 i told him if you even think of doing that again think of me sitting on your shoulder
2767262 when you are a young mother you look for guidance and me not having family here i looked into the community
2767263 there was times we sat on the floor for two hours just waiting for him to calm down
2767264 she basically said youre a loving man youre a good man and im pulling for you because i know you can do this she kept saying that
2767265 no other person understood what i was going through she knew she just did
2767266 ill talk to you guys when you take me to new york and i can see my lawyer
2767267 i believe the u s state department knows the prisoners well their way of thinking and their plans after being released from prison
2767268 that the four who remain are any more or less sic dangerous than the ones who were returned
2767269 follow in the footsteps of prisoners who wrote in the gulag the nazi concentration camps and closer to home japanese american internment camps
2767270 wow i had no idea for the first time in my life i am ashamed to be seen as an american
2767271 carl struggled with wondering if his mental illness meant he was subnormal
2767272 he knew he had a very high iq and artistic talent but he also felt socially inferior
2767273 i think he wanted to say to the world im not just normal
2767274 tell belinda im sorry mom dad mamaw etc i wish i had been more for you im down the tracks
2767275 what hurts me most is that he felt he had no hope for his life
2767276 i wish i could have told him son you dont have to do this
2767277 but there is also hope in the life of his daughter and in believing that god can heal him from his pain where he is now
2767278 you know how you sometimes see one marble that just sparkles carls eyes were like that
2767279 it wasnt that he was being rebellious or making a statement he just had a different way of seeing and doing things
2767280 it was his parents and my parents and all formal carl didnt say much but after we left he called me up and wanted to know if he could smoke cigarettes in the car it was his way of asking if i was cool that broke the ice and we were best friends from then on
2767281 i think that was when it clicked with me that he really was different
2767282 there were a lot of red flags at this point
2767283 what he was saying was not only irrational it just didnt make any sense
2767284 i just thought he was really mixed up and depressed
2767285 i kept hoping that someone would do or say something to make it all better
2767286 i was trying to prove that any kid with all those changes would have problems
2767287 but i just figured that he really was not schizophrenic he was not
2767288 it was the only way i could get him to hold still
2767289 before this we had never really paid that much attention to his painting
2767290 he just did it but mother morris spent a lot of time with him
2767291 he did those three constantly his writing and painting was a way to vent
2767292 he was always very quiet and had a sweet personality i believe he was continually searching in life
2767293 there is no doubt about that but he was also a very tormented soul tormented by things that most people would miss
2767294 his art is really unique unusual disturbing it shows a gut level of honesty most people arent willing to express
2767295 i used to joke that he would paint on my head if i would have held still long enough
2767296 he had sheets shirts skirts anything and he was so excited about filling them all
2767297 most kids would paint three or four pieces but carl would do 10 12
2767298 he would paint so fast he would sling paint everywhere but he was completely oblivious to what was going on around him
2767299 it was just something that was going to happen his form of expression
2767300 he never really considered any of his pieces as finished
2767301 i thought of his painting as therapy and if it was keeping him alive that was wonderful
2767302 connecting with people was just very difficult for him he vibrated on a different frequency than everyone else but he just wanted to be understood
2767303 unfortunately many of his friends were pot smokers and drank
2767304 i came back home and told his parents that carl would not live much longer if he stayed in memphis
2767305 someone he thought was his friend betrayed his trust and carl took that very personally
2767306 you dont have to go to hell itll come to you
2767307 his speech got to the point where you couldnt follow him
2767308 depending on what medicine he was on hed be up all night giddy and crazy
2767309 other times you couldnt even get him out of bed there were all those wild swings and no middle ground
2767310 they were both depressed and had their problems but it was good for carl they really loved each other
2767311 i believe that was one of the things that was hard on him
2767312 he only had around 20 left in his bank account and he knew he couldnt take care of belinda
2767313 i could always tell when he was down but he seemed different that day
2767314 i believe it was because he had determined he was going to kill himself it was almost like he was relieved that he wouldnt have to face life anymore
2767315 and they wouldnt let me go back to my son
2767316 i wasnt that surprised because we knew how carl struggled but his death was just a heavy heavy blow
2767317 at my funeral id like them to say he always lifted people up he tried to better himself so he could be a better person he read the bible and loved philosophical debates he was idealistic and believed everyone should enjoy their quirks he believed it was possible for every person on the earth to be happy
2767318 i could see that carl had done some interesting work and it wasnt all dark he painted in so many styles
2767319 many of the images are haunting and disturbing probably influenced by his illness his work is a really special unique exhibit
2767320 we made mistakes but what love could do we had done

2767386 she was so alert and aware of all around her
2767387 she was so brilliant but so troubled for all her life
2767388 she was a spectator of life wanting very much to take part with others but never able to know how to fit in
2767389 she was drawn to trees especially for their beauty and grandeur and she found solace in their shelter
2767390 one of the things she said to me was that she wished i liked her better so that we could have talked more
2767391 i hope susans soul is now free of all the misery her mental illness caused her
2767392 no more secrets a family speaks about depression anxiety and attempted suicide

2767394 this book and being able to speak out is the reason god put me on this earth
2767395 this is what he is called to do articulately passionately and honestly we dont have to conceal the truth anymore
2767396 its something weve all paid into so it should be there if you are in need of it
2767397 the system you have to work with is a nightmare
2767398 they want to make it as complicated as possible so that we give up or die trying
2767399 youre caught in a time warp still in the middle of an appeal tearing your hair out your conditions worsening and youre staring death in the face this is the epitome of helplessness
2767400 they just kind of stand there and watch you suffer

2767405 finally an actual run in with this mighty korean wave that ive heard about on a daily basis from the korean media
2767406 no no im pretty sure the korean version came first
2767407 ive got two shoes what the hell do you got bitch
2767408 blog typed the blog name from memory it may be
2767409 is a significant portion of coreans really as dumb as we think
2767410 well what responsibility does the american government have for this situation
2767411 what responsibility does the korean education system have for producing an entire generation of idiots
2767412 phelps is tiger woods in a speedo he hates to lose
2767413 absolutely theres a lot of truth to what the president said and in terms of wall street there was too much leverage in the system and more leverage than was appropriate and more than people recognized because the leverage came into the system in the form of highly complex structured products which were difficult to understand
2767414 there is no question about it wall street got drunk
2767415 thats one reason i asked you to turn off your tv cameras
2767416 the question is how long will it take to sober up and not try to do all these fancy financial instruments
2767417 we have of course one priority getting through this period with as little damage as little negative impact as possible on the economy but the second part is to take steps to reduce the likelihood of these sorts of things happening in the future
2767418 we sized that program to say how could we do something that will be meaningful this year but not so big that it would jeopardize some of our long term priorities and our fiscal priorities and balancing the budget so again my view would be lets see how this program works in the third quarter
2767419 i thought it would have been a great nod to our western heritage and we could talk about western values as we move forward
2767420 were really stuck with the idea that we want to look progressive and modern and cosmopolitan but we also want to play up our romantic past
2767421 in 1908 denver was trying to have it both ways
2767422 i think thats part of our civic psychology its deep in our civic dna
2767423 were trying to show off the kind of flavor of what the west has to offer
2767424 the fact is our economy now is extremely diversified resilient and contemporary
2767425 people assume an international cosmopolitan image is at variance with the notion of being a cow town
2767426 the national western stock show isnt partisan it doesnt take sides
2767427 its an opportunity to bring people of all different backgrounds culture races together thats what the west is really about

2767524 the important thing is we should also protect the player
2767525 if the player wants to play somewhere else then a solution should be found because if he stays in a club where he does not feel comfortable to play then its not good for the player and for the club
2767526 im always in favour of protecting the player and if the player he wants to leave let him leave
2767527 i think in football theres too much modern slavery in transferring players or buying players here and there and putting them somewhere
2767528 we are trying now to intervene in such cases the reaction to the bosman law is to make long lasting contacts in order to keep the players and then if he wants to leave then there is only one solution he has to pay his contract

2767551 londoners agree that the mayors plans to introduce a massive new charge for larger vehicles is totally unfair and is more about squeezing money out of motorists than trying to help the environment the mayor should take the chance to reconsider his plans before he leaves us with a system that risks damaging london and irritating massive numbers of people
2767552 we always knew the environmental impact of this unfair tax would be minimal now we know it will make matters worse the mayor and tfl need to explain why this report was not disclosed and why they want to increase taxes on motorists that will increase co2

2767645 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
2767646 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
2767647 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
2767648 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
2767649 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
2767650 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
2767651 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
2767652 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
2767653 liberals want illegal aliens and felons to vote they benefit from such rampant fraud
2767654 employees here dont know where hell get the ethanol there are only gas pumps here
2767655 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
2767656 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
2767657 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
2767658 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
2767659 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
2767660 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
2767661 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
2767662 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
2767663 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
2767664 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
2767665 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
2767666 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
2767667 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
2767668 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
2767669 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
2767670 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
2767671 its like magical thinking with no one bothering to scratch the surface
2767672 full on pander mode flailing around looking for anything that has traction in polls
2767673 saying that we can drill our way out of it this idea that every little bit helps is denying reality
2767674 it may not be good politics but its not fair to the electorate to let them think that a few little tweaks are going to fix the problem
2767675 if we want to enable the technologies of tomorrow like plug in electric cars we need electricity to plug into
2767676 state capitalism with direct intervention in a large sector of the economy
2767677 if wall street sees 4 8 plants built with important federal support over the next seven years on cost and on schedule i think youre going to see robust support from the financial sector
2767678 thats just not a feasible or responsible thing to say
2767679 if were going to cut down on greenhouse gases we have to find a way to sequester them and emissions in general
2767680 i have been an oil man my whole life but this is one emergency we cannot drill our way out of
2767681 on this issue i think that americans are ahead of the candidates of both parties
2767682 our energy economy is undergoing a transformation and were just in the early stages
2767683 hey im changing so i can get votes in texas or arizona
2767684 its the first big unequivocal test about what this possible president really thinks
2767685 youve got to be sure that you get the right person the person has got to be of presidential stature has got to be someone you can be comfortable with work with and help you as president compatibility is very crucial
2767686 the chemistry between us had been correct but not warm
2767687 you dont want it to be a reason for people to question your judgment
2767688 barr conceivably could be to john mccain what ralph nader was to al gore in 2000 ruinous
2767689 you have in ralph naders candidacy a genuine arab american who has a lot of notoriety and publicity it would be detrimental to obamas candidacy
2767690 obama cannot take the peace vote for granted there are peace candidates running from across the political spectrum
2767691 on the right are bob barr and chuck baldwin on the left are cynthia mckinney and ralph nader he needs to earn the vote of americans opposed to further war
2767692 the jonah factor 13 spiritual steps to finding the job of a lifetime
2767693 the cake went all over me that was the end of my suit
2767694 i always wondered whether sometime a political protester would hit me with a pie in the face i never thought a friendly birthday cake would attack me from the rear
2767695 id like to hear the governor and legislative leaders tell the voters where the shortfall is coming from and unless i hear that im not sure we ought to take a gamble
2767696 education funding is very important part of our economy has to be based on attracting and keeping good paying jobs and we cant do that without a well educated work force
2767697 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
2767698 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
2767699 we are pleased to note ofcom has vindicated the ipccs claim against channel 4 in spirit and in substance
2767700 it is entirely appropriate people should bear a cost if only of unpopularity and criticism for speaking freely however the cost should be reasonable and not disproportionate there should not be in the words of a famous supreme court decision a chilling effect on free speech
2767701 i thought it would have been a great nod to our western heritage and we could talk about western values as we move forward
2767702 were really stuck with the idea that we want to look progressive and modern and cosmopolitan but we also want to play up our romantic past
2767703 in 1908 denver was trying to have it both ways
2767704 la gente se enfocar en barry allen estando de vuelta pero de lo que realmente trata flash rebirth es sobre restaurar completamente el mito de flash queremos realinear todo nuevamente que todo tenga sentido y hacerlo m s atractivo para cada uno de los fans de flash
2767705 por esto tendr que haber algunos cambios visuales para algunos de estos personajes
2767706 no hago las cosas sin raz n si a suceder en la historia entonces b deber suceder tambi n
2767707 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
2767708 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
2767709 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
2767710 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
2767711 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
2767712 there are good muslims and bad muslims that i have to admit just like there are good and bad jews
2767713 no this was their place first they could take the hot weather and some of them went far in this world theyre not lazy
2767714 i know hes smart i dont think hes a dummy like bush
2767715 im fine i have to go for blood work again they keep me waiting for an hour im all sunburned like a berry i get in the water and i forget to get out i get in conversations
2767716 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
2767717 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
2767718 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
2767719 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
2767720 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
2767721 just so you all know we did set a record
2767722 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
2767723 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
2767724 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
2767725 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
2767726 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
2767727 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
2767728 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
2767729 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
2767730 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
2767731 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
2767732 senator lieberman supports both democrats and republicans and he gave to the committee as a senior member of the caucus
2767733 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
2767734 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
2767735 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
2767736 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
2767737 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
2767738 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
2767739 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
2767740 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
2767741 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
2767742 that doesnt meet my definition of a maverick you cant be a maverick when politically its important for you but not a maverick when it doesnt work for you
2767743 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
2767744 theres frustration there because theyre watching these childish ad campaigns and they know exactly how to answer it but theyre powerless to do so
2767745 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
2767746 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
2767747 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
2767748 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
2767749 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
2767750 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
2767751 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
2767752 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
2767753 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
2767754 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
2767755 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
2767756 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
2767757 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
2767758 carbon tax alone wont solve climate change but we cant solve climate change without carbon pricing
2767759 areas where the sun shines and the wind blows to the cities in the east and west that need the electricity
2767760 alberta and saskatchewan for example have some of the best wind and solar resources and could benefit from better interconnections with b c and manitoba respectively
2767761 without transmission and without storage a utility cannot put more than a few new percentage points into the system
2767762 nuclear power is not renewable power its mined out of the earth and its toxic
2767763 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
2767764 its certainly technically and technologically doable and this is the sad thing it may not be politically doable
2767765 i just want to see an understanding that gore was right about the first inconvenient truth global warming but we have to recognize the second inconvenient truth which is that we dont have the means to do it right now
2767766 despite all the talk about sexism in the presidential campaign the majority of women voters laid the blame for hillarys loss squarely on her and her strategists shoulders they largely reject gender as a cause of her demise
2767767 the larger theme is how environmentalism seems to harm the poorest people in the poorest places on the planet
2767768 its looking at how the hysteria around global warming will affect people on low or fixed incomes it asks is there a disease and is the cure worse than the disease the science isnt settled global warming was invented five or 10 years ago
2767769 the film al gore and hollywood dont want you to see
2767770 i dont think it would be a bad thing for this earth to warm up
2767771 greenpeaces claims are based on science and the science is very clear the latest report from the uns leading scientists says that climate change is happening human activity is causing it and its a huge threat to our species
2767772 but we can prevent the worst if we act immediately to slash emissions and kickstart an energy revolution with a massive expansion of renewables and improvements in energy efficiency
2767773 despise ryanair because it used to be that we with our own sort whereas i see ryanair as making ireland wealthy they see it as a negative for ireland
2767774 obama telling us not to drive suvs and al gore saying that you cant use air conditioning
2767775 the global warming climate change issue is so important that people on both sides of the issue including policymakers should be fully informed before policy is actually formulated tragically thats not happening in the global warming issue
2767776 many things we thought we knew about the climate system just a few years ago are now proving to be uncertain or quite mistaken
2767777 its become quite news worthy to go out and tell people that we are about to have an apocalyptic climate change and the moment you make that announcement its easy to go around the world and find things to support that viewpoint
2767778 the ipcc is a political organization setup by the un to provide evidence to support the framework convention on climate change its entirely political they made up what they were going to do beforehand and choose whatever science they ipcc could find to support their theory
2767779 this cuts at the heart of national sovereignty of the u s we would be saying that we would allow an international body to come in and dictate to our industries our businesses our people what they can do and what they cant do the use of what energy the sources of energy the cost of energy etc
2767780 carbon dioxide gas co2 lags behind temperature changes in history by 800 years co2 doesnt cause temperature change
2767781 based on the evidence of ice core studies at the polar ice caps it shows that co2 follows temperature not the opposite so the fundamental assumption of the whole theory of climate change by human intervention of co2 emissions causing temperature changes is wrong
2767782 human intervention accounts for a small fraction of co2 of the atmospheric gases in the atmosphere that water vapor accounts for about 97 of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere co2 accounts for 1 9 therefore man is responsible for less than 3 of all greenhouse effect in the atmosphere globally
2767783 0 55f 0 30c cooler than the 1971 2000 average
2767784 my concern is that we may be moving away from an irrational lack of concern about climate change to an equally irrational panic about it
2767785 the problem is that in this panic we are going to spend our money unwisely we will take actions that are counterproductive and we will fail to do many of those things that will benefit the environment and ourselves for example right now the clearest threat to many species is habitat destruction take the orangutans for instance one of those charismatic species that people are often fascinated by and concerned about they are endangered because of deforestation in our fear of global warming it would be sad if we fail to find funds to purchase those forests before they are destroyed and thus let this species go extinct at the heart of the matter is how much faith we decide to put in science even how much faith scientists put in science our times have benefited from clear thinking science based rationality i hope this prevails as we try to deal with our changing climate
2767786 co founder of ipcc al gore is trying to be a climate change profiteer essentially he wants to make a fortune by creating a new market for a product that he is attempting to create by legislative fiat if he succeeds and carbon emissions trading comes to the united states al gore will be uniquely positioned to cash in hes made sure of that
2767787 gore himself is chairman and founder of a private equity firm called generation investment management gim he says the london based firm invests money from institutions and wealthy investors in companies that are becoming environmentally friendly to use green parlance gim appears to have considerable influence over major carbon credit trading firms the u s based chicago climate exchange ccx and the u k based carbon neutral company cnc ccx appears to be the only firm in the u s that claims to trade carbon credits as a politician gore speaks warmly of transparency but as gim chairman gore has not been forthcoming little is known about his shadowy firms finances where it gets funding and what projects it supports
2767788 al gores carbon crusade the money and connections behind it
2767789 the consensus in kyoto as outlined in the ipcc report will bind america to reduce energy consumption by 25 which will have a devastating effect on the american standard of living and the u s economy it will continue to drive more industries out of america for a more global economy
2767790 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
2767791 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
2767792 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
2767793 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
2767794 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
2767795 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
2767796 want to continue flying in your private jet and air conditioning your 16 000 square foot mansion and not worry about hurting the environment then send us your money and well offset the damage youre doing by planting trees
2767797 i think theres a certain skepticism among the intelligentsia of the american sporting world that we torontonians can tailgate with the best of them
2767798 so heres our opportunity to show them that were up to the challenge
2767799 i think hes staying through the ball a little better the balls he used to roll on hes shooting through the middle
2767800 he put the ball on the ground was strong and efficient
2767801 hes going to be in our rotation eventually were confident hell get back to where he needs to be
2767802 hasta ahora la situaci n est as confirmamos la retirada de las fuerzas georgianas georgia ha empezado a retirar a sus tropas de tsjinvali
2767803 the air is slower and video quality is not as good as other macbooks but i am an extreme user
2767804 i have forty or fifty windows open at the same time then again a new macbook is due later in the year if you can wait you could buy a mac air now and if you dont like it you could sell it and get the new macbook
2767805 but i never take my mac out of the house unless i absolutely have to
2767806 then get a desktop computer why pay a premium for a battery if youre not carrying it around
2767807 but what if i have to cover a war in chechnya
2767808 why should we be paying road prices when we have nothing to do with the roads
2767809 i thought it would have been a great nod to our western heritage and we could talk about western values as we move forward
2767810 were really stuck with the idea that we want to look progressive and modern and cosmopolitan but we also want to play up our romantic past
2767811 in 1908 denver was trying to have it both ways
2767812 i think thats part of our civic psychology its deep in our civic dna
2767813 were trying to show off the kind of flavor of what the west has to offer
2767814 the fact is our economy now is extremely diversified resilient and contemporary
2767815 people assume an international cosmopolitan image is at variance with the notion of being a cow town
2767816 an anonymous secondhand quotation from sen barack obama at a closed house democratic caucus meeting on july 29 caused an uproar among partisans it is an excellent example of how the pernicious use of unnamed sources so pervasive in washington can backfire on journalists and sources
2767817 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
2767818 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
2767819 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
2767820 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
2767821 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
2767822 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
2767823 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
2767824 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
2767825 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore
2767826 ill use every talent i possess and all my energy to try to bring back tolerance decency and generosity to the country i love
2767827 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
2767828 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2767829 the un secretary general has not uttered a word meaning that he respects our laws and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us say that malaysia is not up to their standards
2767830 why should gore and the us president give their evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning of the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
2767831 but if they have any substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss it with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
2767832 oh yeah but hes not as good as al gore if only al gore had won did i tell you how much i like al gore
2767833 its no good running a pig farm badly for 30 years while saying really i was meant to be a ballet dancer by then pigs will be your style
2767834 this boat is going to be the toyota prius of the houseboat business
2767835 it is the most eco friendly houseboat anywhere in the country
2767836 gore will consume a lot more fuel driving to and from the lake than he will ever use cruising on this houseboat
2767837 climate confusion how global warming hysteria leads to bad science pandering politicians and misguided policies that hurt the poor
2767838 we are a debt relief agency amp have proudly helped people file for bankruptcy for over 30 yrs
2767839 this will give the true picture so there will be no misconceptions that can hurt malaysias image
2767840 any judgment or directive by a court or the legal department should be upheld foreign countries should understand the malaysian legal system and that we do uphold the rule of law
2767841 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2767842 i think he should concentrate on his environmental pursuits instead of interfering anyway he has gore d us before
2767843 various departments are engaged in this exercise the home minister will be annexing certain documents and i believe the home ministry will also be producing certain reports to augment the submission
2767844 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
2767845 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
2767846 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
2767847 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
2767848 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
2767849 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
2767850 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
2767851 it is a scary story made more scary by the fact that most people in america dont understand what the problems are
2767852 we have to live with our feet very much rooted in reality
2767853 were pursuing renewables as well but you cant simply take away half of your energy base
2767854 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
2767855 it would be difficult for north carolina to meet a 10 percent renewable portfolio standard with only new north carolina renewable supply resources by 2021
2767856 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
2767857 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
2767858 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
2767859 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
2767860 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
2767861 we have regular exchanges with malaysian diplomats in washington on a number of subjects including with the malaysian charge daffaires yesterday
2767862 anwar ibrahims case was one of the topics of conversation
2767863 we take note of the many serious questions raised within malaysia including by the malaysian bar council concerning this case
2767864 for the second time gore is goring us repeating the 1998 goring
2767865 we hope he will stop goring as it is about time he re examines the goring process within himself and his country
2767866 there is no way other countries should look down on us in the administration of our own laws our criminal procedure code and the penal code emanate from the common law
2767867 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any other power in the world to criticise us in administering justice and the rule of law

2767870 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
2767871 to those who say the costs are still too high i ask them to consider whether the costs of oil and coal will ever stop increasing if we keep relying on quickly depleting energy sources to feed a rapidly growing demand all around the world
2767872 reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years

2767878 al gores carbon crusade the money and connections behind it
2767879 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
2767880 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
2767881 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
2767882 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
2767883 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
2767884 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
2767885 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
2767886 i thought it would have been a great nod to our western heritage and we could talk about western values as we move forward

2767897 i think the blue skies will come especially after todays rain
2767898 today is raining and tomorrow will have rain too that will help reduce the air pollution level we believe the current air flow will be helpful in the dispersion of pollutants in the air
2767899 you can control beijing as much as you like but youre not going to see much of an effect
2767900 on the day of opening ceremonies we had rain clouds in the southwest and northwest they were moving closer to the birds nest and there was a high probability of rain
2767901 if a person is too safe and conservative hes not likely to come up with great ideas

2767914 with an almighty crash the ice split right between my feet and a 300 tonne block broke off fortunately i fell on to the main part of the chunk but now it started turning round so i ended up in the water i began swimming around the chunk hoping to find a point of access to the ice there was none i was not afraid of being so close to drowning but of deserting inge and our two kids and i was furious at having agreed to do the job without proper surveillance
2767915 the benefits of strong and early action far outweigh the economic costs of not acting
2767916 a degree of warming that would surely yield dangerous climate impacts
2767917 sea level changes of several metres per century occur in the palaeoclimate record in response to forcings slower and weaker than the present human made forcing this indicates that the ice may disintegrate and melt faster than previously assumed and that the warming may be delayed less by the ice than assumed
2767918 if humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilisation developed and to which life on earth is adapted palaeoclimate evidence and ongoing climate change suggest that co2 will need to be reduced from its current 385ppm to at most 350ppm
2767919 low cost solar power geothermal energy some non intrusive climatic engineering or genetically engineered carbon eating trees
2767920 that about 8 of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is absorbed by vegetation and returned to the atmosphere every year
2767921 a thirst for oil comes back to haunt a nation of gas guzzlers
2767922 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
2767923 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
2767924 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
2767925 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
2767926 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
2767927 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
2767928 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment

2767935 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of that has got to change
2767936 gore backed his case for renewable electricity with logical case studies
2767937 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
2767938 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
2767939 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
2767940 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
2767941 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
2767942 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
2767943 i thought it would have been a great nod to our western heritage and we could talk about western values as we move forward
2767944 were really stuck with the idea that we want to look progressive and modern and cosmopolitan but we also want to play up our romantic past
2767945 in 1908 denver was trying to have it both ways
2767946 i think thats part of our civic psychology its deep in our civic dna
2767947 were trying to show off the kind of flavor of what the west has to offer

2767956 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
2767957 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
2767958 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
2767959 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
2767960 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
2767961 tenemos que trabajar duro con nuestros hijos hay que educarlos sobre los valores de la honestidad sobre los valores del trabajo de la dignidad pero sobre todo de los m s altos valores humanos y de la integridad

2767970 it meant a tremendous amount to myself and the guys when we heard from him
2767971 he talked about trying to move on he just told us it will be difficult but together well be much stronger
2767972 we wanted to have a moment of silence where we could gather our thoughts before starting this journey
2767973 it was a moment of silence to honor the bachman family
2767974 the one thing weve always talked about is that this is about a team its not about individual people
2767975 the thing that came across as hugh was talking to us is you know what ive got this happening right now but we came here with a goal in mind and weve invested all this time in it and we need to go out there and try to complete what we started
2767976 it means going out there and playing better every match than we did the previous match
2767977 we really felt the loss as one of our own
2767978 maybe thats why it hurt so much it just felt so close
2767979 the best way we can honor them at this juncture is to go out and compete every day and play hard every day and enjoy and love the game of volleyball and it is a game
2767980 we should be playing it and enjoying it and loving it as they would
2767981 were totally aware that we may see him and we may not
2767982 thats completely all right with us he has other priorities
2767983 yeah everyone sort of knows but like what are we going to do
2767984 this ad is for a small mosaic look bistro table and 2 woven chairs the legs are wrought iron they have been used both indoors and outdoors in good condition with some normal wear on the chairs
2767985 it may have a psychological effect on the public but its a tragedy that we live in a kind of world where that happens
2767986 i thought it would have been a great nod to our western heritage and we could talk about western values as we move forward
2767987 were really stuck with the idea that we want to look progressive and modern and cosmopolitan but we also want to play up our romantic past

2767993 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years

2768014 kebanyakan pengguna internet indonesia memang baru memanfaatkan internet untuk mengakses konten belum menciptakan konten

2768027 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
2768028 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
2768029 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
2768030 the reason which cannot draw superior is in your body
2768031 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
2768032 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
2768033 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
2768034 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
2768035 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
2768036 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
2768037 i thought it would have been a great nod to our western heritage and we could talk about western values as we move forward
2768038 were really stuck with the idea that we want to look progressive and modern and cosmopolitan but we also want to play up our romantic past
2768039 in 1908 denver was trying to have it both ways
2768040 i think thats part of our civic psychology its deep in our civic dna
2768041 were trying to show off the kind of flavor of what the west has to offer
2768042 the fact is our economy now is extremely diversified resilient and contemporary
2768043 people assume an international cosmopolitan image is at variance with the notion of being a cow town
2768044 the national western stock show isnt partisan it doesnt take sides
2768045 its an opportunity to bring people of all different backgrounds culture races together thats what the west is really about
2768046 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
2768047 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
2768048 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
2768049 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
2768050 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
2768051 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
2768052 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that

2768100 taken together the two decisions are an acknowledgment of shortcomings that continue to hinder nato and american led operations in afghanistan with the war in iraq still an obstacle to any immediate american troop increase in afghanistan the plan was described by officials as an attempt to increase allied and afghan capabilities in advance of deploying the additional american brigades that mr gates and his commanders agree are necessary

2768109 obamas popularity is not because of his race but in spite of it he is popular because of his charisma enthusiasm vision energy convictions and because of the confidence and hope that emanate from his persona
2768110 his stated policies are potentially extremely destructive and foolish such as massive tax increases and protectionism
2768111 it is our business however to go after terrorist enemies of the united states and our nato allies wherever we find them
2768112 it is this intensely emotional response to obama that is such a concern his followers love him with the zeal of cult members without bothering to discuss policy
2768113 what i am now is a citizen of a country that was attacked by people who flew commercial airplanes into buildings and i think we need to keep that in mind
2768114 but none of obamas supporters bothered to discover the facts which are readily available

2768117 youre using the obama campaign site as a reference for his tax policies
2768118 q would obama tax my profits if i sell my home would he tax my ira would he tax my water
2768119 i think the most reasonable take is that obama is probably doing just fine

2768128 the mere presence of an iraq run by friendly to the us and containing us troops is anathema to iranian fundamentalism and its desires for the iraqi south and the holiest shrines of the shia imagine how intolerable it is for iran to have the us in the nations all around it turkey afghanistan saudi arabia iraq pakistan etc
2768129 it may be ifficult for you to understand iran and islamic facism is the nazi threat of this century

2768131 hitlers legal power was based upon the enabling act which was passed quite legally by the reichstag and which allowed the fuehrer and his representatives in plain language to be what they wanted or in legal language to issue regulations having the force of law exactly the same type of act was passed by the knesset israelis parliament immediately after the 1967 conquest granting the israeli governor and his representatives the power of hitler which they use in hitlerian manner

2768133 jewish villages were built in the place of arab villages you do not even know the names of these arab villages and i do not blame you because geography books no longer exist not only do the books not exist the arab villages are not there either nahlal arose in the place of mahlul kibbutz gvat in the place of jibta kibbutz sarid in the place of huneifis and kefar yehushua in the place of tal al shuman there is not a single place built in this country that did not have a former arab population
2768134 we will have to face the reality that israel is neither innocent nor redemptive and that in its creation and expansion we as jews have caused what we historically have suffered a refugee population in diaspora
2768135 when we followers of the prophetic judaism returned to palestine the majority of jewish people preferred to learn from hitler rather than from us
2768136 imagine how intolerable it is for iran to have the us in the nations all around it turkey afghanistan saudi arabia iraq pakistan etc

2768142 question on my part as in israel and palistine i am ill informed is the current thinking in israel the same as in 1895 and 1940 respectfully
2768143 the zionist movement arose in late nineteenth century europe influenced by the nationalist ferment sweeping that continent zionism acquired its particular focus from the ancient jewish longing for the return to zion and received a strong impetus from the increasingly intolerable conditions facing the large jewish community in tsarist russia the movement also developed at the time of major european territorial acquisitions in asia and africa and benefited from the european powers competition for influence in the shrinking ottoman empire one result of this involvement with european expansionism however was that the leaders of the nascent nationalist movements in the middle east viewed zionism as an adjunct of european colonialism moreover zionist assertions of the contemporary relevance of the jews historical ties to palestine coupled with their land purchases and immigration alarmed the indigenous population of the ottoman districts that comprised palestine the jewish community yishuv rose from 6 percent of palestines population in 1880 to 10 percent by 1914 although the numbers were insignificant the settlers were outspoken enough to arouse the opposition of arab leaders and induce them to exert counter pressure on the ottoman regime to prohibit jewish immigration and land buying

2768149 the majority of black americans are unaware of the complexity of the meaning of israel to american jews but ironically afro zionists have as an intense an emotional identification with africa and with the third world as american jews have with israel doubly ironic this same intensity of identification with a motherland seems rooted in the mythologies common to both groups in this special sense in the spiritual sense implied by zion and diaspora and promised land maybe black americans are americas jews but given the isolation of black americans from any meaningful association with africa extensions of the mythology would be futile we have no distant homeland preparing an ingathering
2768150 israel has the most powerful military in the region including nuclear weapons and has the unconditional support of the most powerful nation in the world the usa
2768151 considering the circumstances the best thing the palestinians could do is accept their fate and negotiate an agreement leading to the creation of a sovereign nation encompassing th gaza strip and west bank

2768153 the real point as noticed here by one of americas most prominent one man bloggers is that the brits are actually leading the way in pointing out to the world that american faults are generally over reported and american strengths under reported

2768155 even if evidence does not link iraq directly to the attack any strategy aiming at the eradication of terrorism and its sponsors must include a determined effort to remove saddam hussein from power in iraq failure to undertake such an effort will constitute an early and perhaps decisive surrender in the war on international terrorism

2768238 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2768239 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2768240 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2768241 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2768242 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2768243 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2768244 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2768245 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2768285 foi como quando me vi morrer no filme em fora de rumo isso realmente me fez perceber que ok eu ainda estou aqui aquele personagem est morto naquele mundo ele est morto mas a pessoa que o interpretou seguiu em frente para interpretar mais personagens
2768286 isso me deu toda uma outra forma de olhar para minha criatividade quando voltei ao bobby digital agora para mim ele tem uma identidade pr pria antes eu precisava que o sujeito expressasse meus pr prios sentimentos agora eu n o sinto que ele um alter ego eu apenas estou tentando tornar o personagem poderoso ter muita imagina o e fazer coisas que funcionem para ele que n o sejam necessariamente a meu respeito

2768289 eu penso que quando ele for conclu do ele encerrar minha carreira como letrista ele est parado no momento eu n o encontrei a m sica apropriada para expressar o que estou escrevendo
2768290 se isso n o for parar em um lbum ent o eu vou colocar em um livro ou algo assim e ent o assim que for lan ado eu acho que ser o fim ser o momento de sair e viver livremente tudo aquilo que digo para as pessoas sem arrependimentos

2768301 i have no doubt that union soldiers sat under it for all
2768302 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
2768303 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
2768304 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
2768305 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
2768306 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
2768307 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
2768308 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
2768309 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
2768310 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
2768311 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
2768312 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
2768313 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
2768314 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

2768326 i came in the boot of a car georgian snipers were firing at us from the forest i heard the bullets hitting the chassis
2768327 my brother stayed to fight our grandparents home was turned to rubble we dont know where they are nothing is left of their village it was totally destroyed by rockets and tank fire
2768328 i got out this morning a friend found me and brought me out on the back of his motorbike i was already waiting for death in my basement the city is in ruins there are bodies lying in the street
2768329 all i have left is the clothes im standing in and these two bags my house was wooden it was turned to splinters by the shells i climbed out of the ruins i dont know where i will go i dont know what to do
2768330 i saw our house in flames as we ran theres nothing left for us to go back to our lives are ruined
2768331 people have no water no electricity no gas and no food
2768332 my relatives told me georgian soldiers burnt to death a family of seven people in their apartment an 18 year old boy who climbed out into the street for a few moments was shot dead by a sniper
2768333 ossetian patriots first let us cleanse our markets of georgian spies then forward to liberate the homeland
2768334 we are sending men who have done military service so teenage lads dont go to die
2768335 in tskhinvali you cant find one brick standing on top of another the city is still disputed there are georgian strong points on the hills surrounding it im going back to fight tonight ive got my own team of guys
2768336 my cousin came from dmenis village last night he got two bullets in the back were going to go there and slaughter the georgians like the fascist pigs they are if the russians let us well smash them all the way to tbilisi we are a warrior race we know how to fight
2768337 the georgians hit our positions with grad missiles they surrounded us but we managed to break out if im needed ill be heading back
2768338 a 78 year old woman with an infant under each arm was crushed by a tank

2768348 nosotros jugamos al nivel de un equipo que va a pelear por el oro cuando nos quebraron fue porque nos embocaron varios tiros de tres puntos y nos encontramos con una diferencia de 12 puntos a pocos minutos del final

2768351 weve decided to do a five part mini series one big story that will run during one week
2768352 i wanted to make a really big noise about the show
2768353 torchwood really represents the essence of the channel its sexy action packed and a little bit subversive
2768354 so rumor has it that the bbc was unhappy and russell had to rush to write her out of series 3
2768355 personally id be very happy if they didnt add any more principle characters between jack ianto and gwen there are plenty of possible stories to tell for a season thats only having a five episode run
2768356 lets not irritate the physicians or else theyre going to take their patients to another hospital
2768357 the number one issue in the errors that occur is bad communication
2768358 the scissors didnt cut to his liking he was trying to cut suture material he said they were dull he tossed them across the room one of the nurses had to dodge the scissors
2768359 these incidents happen because the or environment is so high stress
2768360 surgeons hold patients lives in their hands yet theyre dependent on equipment and people who are outside their control this incident was over a year ago and there has not been another incident with this physician
2768361 you have an industry in crisis where people are having to do much more with limited resources that combination can be a potent one

2768367 so every time im working on it im really really happy
2768368 i always describe it as in season 1 we were learning how to walk and in season 2 were running
2768369 he is a lot more comfortable with his immortality you learn about how the team around him became a part of torchwood and you also learn about his feelings and relationships with each of them which i think is really important
2768370 he was the emperor and his power in his rationality and foresight few suspected him of being the mutant he was
2768371 sienna is being portrayed as a femme fatale and fears for her career because hollywood hates a home wrecker
2768372 she hopes balthazar can get rosetta to put out a statement saying their marriage was already over they have already got friends to speak out saying he was sleeping on their sofas
2768373 when balthazar went away in may rosetta thought it was to see his sick mum in germany but she now knows that it was to cavort with sienna in prague
2768374 the original plan was definitely to release it this year the date was in all the trade magazines
2768375 one of the main reasons for the delay is siennas love life the studios hope the coverage will have died down by the spring
2768376 it is very hard some days to know which way is up

2768383 what contemplative prayer actually entails is described very clearly by the following writer
2768384 mike bickle director of the international house of prayer ihop in kansas city and a well known leader in the prophetic movement claims that god is restoring contemplative prayer to the church
2768385 the protestant wing of the western church which is a tiny percentage of the body of christ is nearly completely 98 unaware that the holy spirit is restoring contemplative prayer center stage to the church the holy spirit is restoring this precious jewel contemplative prayer to the body of christ this is the god ordained means of attaining the fullness of god
2768386 every one in the body of christ is called to live lives of contemplative prayer
2768387 contemplative prayer you gotta get over that hurdle barnes amp noble is prophesying it hurtle one we gotta understand its for everybody everybody is called to the fullness contemplative prayer were
2768388 a study of the lives of the mystics the contemplatives through history and clearly the most inspiring compelling examples of history in my world have come out of the catholic dark ages i cant find anything like it in modern times in america in the protestant world
2768389 we need a little holy spirit catalytic jump start we need to see where a few have gone before us and say if they did we can and we can go further and if youre going to go deep into that well im sad to say the vast majority of them are going to have catholic roots in history
2768390 bernard clairou became my most inspiring life outside the bible
2768391 the protestant world is in great need of examples like these that will beckon us to the fullness of god
2768392 dont evaluate yourself dont evaluate others just keep going after it
2768393 god the holy spirit is the servant of the father and the son
2768394 however when he the spirit of truth has come he will guide you into all truth for he will not speak on his own authority literally from himself but whatever he hears he will speak and he will tell you things to come he will glorify me for he will take of what is mine and declare it to you
2768395 the war in ossetia instantly showed the idiocy of our state management
2768396 to do a creeping annexation of south ossetia and abkhazia and secondly to overthrow saakashvili who is a tremendous thorn in their side
2768397 we deplore todays russian attacks by strategic bombers and missiles which are threatening civilian lives
2768398 mandy god loves you not because you are lovable but because it is his nature to love you
2768399 but ive tried to take my own life neil how can god overlook that
2768400 just suppose mandy that your son grew despondent and tried to take his own life would you love him any less would you kick him out of the family would you turn your back on him
2768401 of course not id feel sorry for him and try to love him more
2768402 are you telling me that a perfect god isnt as good a parent to you as you an imperfect person are to your children
2768403 i write this to you so that you will not sin
2768404 but if anybody does sin we have one who speaks to the father in our defense jesus christ the righteous one he is the atoning sacrifice for our sins and not only for ours but also for the sins of the whole world
2768405 with his baseball background and my legal training we thought we could provide a pretty good service for our clients
2768406 there are a lot of agents out there that arent necessarily lawyers
2768407 and we thought to get a lawyer involved would be beneficial to our clients they can find comfort in knowing the lawyers taking care of everything ive been from a baseball family my entire life and it seemed like a wonderful opportunity to take my legal training to do something i would really enjoy doing
2768408 and the way the draft and the signings go professionally i see a lot of guys taken advantage of in latin america so i decided to get involved several years back with the process of signing their contracts with the teams to make sure its fair and theyre going to be taken care of
2768409 there are so many guys who signed and got released in a year and have nothing
2768410 some of them dont even know they are not eligible to play college anymore
2768411 we want to make sure we take care of them to the max at least they know what theyre signing a lot of guys from puerto rico cannot speak english theyre signing contracts without understanding whats in it so thats when i decided i wanted to get involved after seeing a lot of these situations
2768412 he never saw any of that money just not understanding
2768413 he thought it was 100 000 guaranteed it wasnt guaranteed money up front
2768414 a lot of these guys didnt even know this was in the contract so none of them use it
2768415 they dont get the money unless they actually go to school
2768416 we actually told benny how it worked its a big process of educating the guys
2768417 we want to make sure clients really understand what they are signing and making sure we can get them everything we can
2768418 any doubt i call them and they make calls and get the best advice for the benefit of the player
2768419 they are working hand in hand with us and weve really seen the fruits of their work if not for their expertise and knowledge we might not be able to do the job they are for us our council and lawyer they make sure organizations treat us the same as the other major leaguers are treated in the united states
2768420 we didnt want to go overboard and have the kid get hurt in the process the yankees loved him but they actually wanted him to come in and play games before signing him we were afraid of him getting hurt
2768421 they needed catchers they needed young talent we decided to go there
2768422 the puerto rican guy taken in the same round were talking 300 000 thats a big difference its a lot of money for anywhere but if its fair to give that kind of money here then its fair to give that kind of money in puerto rico
2768423 these guys are poor fifteen thousand dollars is a lot of money
2768424 you have to be really strong to survive here you get homesick the food is totally different i know guys who leave because they cant handle it
2768425 you come from a tropical place and its cold even 50s and 60s is still cold for these guys
2768426 the first thing that goes through my mind is what am i doing here
2768427 i could not speak english so i couldnt say take me back because i was already here
2768428 i made a lot of mistakes i was just thrown out there saying crazy things i spoke a lot with my hands it was definitely an adjustment i know if i wasnt strong enough i wouldnt have survived a lot of my friends came back after me they would last maybe a year if that they went back im going on 19 years since i left puerto rico
2768429 i request when i send kids to colleges that they room with an american kid
2768430 it forces them to actually speak the language thats the only way they learn
2768431 were trying to do things that agents dont normally do
2768432 a lot of the work were doing with in puerto rico with benny and the major league baseball players association because it never really had a presence in puerto rico and we facilitated or organized the first meeting for major league baseball alumni association in puerto rico with bennys help we had about 120 former players show up at the first meeting
2768433 a lot of people think baseball players are out making millions
2768434 theres a lot of guys who paved the way for the a rods of today who didnt make that much money they predate the pension rules so they dont qualify for the mlbs health insurance or pension money
2768435 were talking about guys who played in the bigs who cant afford their light bills cant afford their mortgages weve been working with and helping the older players in puerto rico get assistance from the baseball assistance team bat
2768436 i guess i envisioned wed be signing guys and then waiting five years for them to work up to the bigs then it would be the hard work so its been quite the opposite
2768437 the business end the idea is to recruit young talent get them signed and of course we would make money on the signing bonuses
2768438 guide them through the minor league system and then represent them at the big league level and of course they get some pretty substantial salaries in major league baseball and we would make money of that as well
2768439 whoever tells you theyre not here to make money is lying
2768440 we definitely want to make money there are a lot of agents out there good ones and a lot of bad ones its like anything else
2768441 love is lifes first blessing and health is the second blessing money cannot buy them

2768448 we train them by taking them out and engaging the taliban
2768449 it was pretty frustrating because wed spent all this time mentoring them and then they were gone
2768450 until we can give the people security the ones who can effect change on the population are the taliban
2768451 we need the police to do that because we cant be everywhere at once
2768452 were trying to get them doing the right thing so that when the ministry of the interior catches up they can hit the ground running
2768453 its been hard at times to focus on mentoring when its such a kinetic situation
2768454 driving around kandahar you can see a big difference between units that have been through the training and those that havent
2768455 most of these guys come in without any training and lack basic skills how to do personal hygiene how to maintain a weapon a lot of them are very young
2768456 the top of it is totally broken off and the storm severely damaged 70 to 80 percent of the tree

2768462 i am not a nazi but russia is a curse in the world
2768463 i have no doubt they wanted to target the pipeline there is nothing else here

2768465 at the moment the pipeline is not running at any capacity because there was a fire
2768466 they need sea ports they need transportation infrastructure and primarily they want to get rid of us

2768473 we do not plan to escalate the conflict in this region
2768474 they were on a mass scale and were directed against individuals
2768475 were being driven away the place was in flames and we couldnt stay
2768476 this reminds me all too much of other recent conflicts that have torn our continent apart particularly in the balkans

2768570 scientists and researchers in climate and related fields economists policymakers and busin the polar bears are all right
2768571 but if you take all the chemistry thermal dymanics and theiries about carbon etc and take them down to basic priciples and back them up by the last hundred years of research and scientific findings then you update them with the mass of evidence from all of the recent studies if you do all this and you link to the studies the scientists and all of this is backed by facts the global warming hoax people

2768597 we have no plans to insert money in either of those institutions
2768598 it was very important that we get these temporary backup facilities because fannie and freddie are very important to our capital markets
2768599 lets see how this program works in the third quarter
2768600 this anticipation supported the market so that we didnt see any big falls last month but faith collapsed a couple of hours ahead of the games
2768601 confidence in building positions became very shaky especially for those short term buyers who are very sensitive to government support
2768602 there are investors who bought these stocks on the hope that beijing would rescue the markets before the olympics and that these stocks would rise more sharply
2768603 i think the trend in stocks is up i do feel that july 15 represented the bottom for stocks and we are going to move higher
2768604 i really feel that what investors are looking for right here is signs that the economy is starting to pick up right now
2768605 it looks like we are finally getting the break weve been waiting for in terms of slowing down the inflation spiral that has been taking place
2768606 you have a tremendous rise in the dollar and thats putting pressure on crude oil which is helping to buoy u s equity markets
2768607 clearly the economy is still weak some of the stimulus from the tax rebates is
2768608 once you go above 6 percent the concerns about recession will go up
2768609 look at the prices of food around the world its unfair to look at just the price of oil as the leading indicator of where inflation trends may be
2768610 theres strong likelihood that the fed is going to have to start to raise interest rates to control inflation
2768611 for a long term investor id advocate slowly going back into commodities right now gold will be my favorite recommendation
2768612 its never been this rough to get tech companies to ipo
2768613 were seeing entrepreneurs more than willing to go the acquisition route rather than go public
2768614 when they look at how long a trek it is to go public an ipo is no longer the golden ring
2768615 most tech ipos tend to be smaller high growth companies with a relatively greater degree of risk
2768616 so it becomes harder to prove themselves to an ipo audience that is looking for a lower amount of risk
2768617 with nine of the last 10 ipos trading below their initial price companies see this and are willing to wait it out
2768618 companies that need these funds to grow will at some point look at alternative sources
2768619 because of the slowdown companies are looking at their it budgets
2768620 hopefully when the market is open again tech companies will be ready
2768621 we need the market to stabilize and see one or two companies that step up and have a strong debut
2768622 severely damage competition on major transatlantic routes and leave consumers worse off
2768623 airlines everywhere are struggling with the current price of oil but the solution to their problems should not lie in an anti competitive agreement which will inevitably lead to less competition and higher fares

2768645 from our research and understanding of it we learnt that there is an unmet demand for bhojpuri content across the bhojpuri population which led to the creation of mahuaa tv it is the first offering from our stable as we intend to launch of a bouquet of other channels like bhojpuri news bhojpuri music and bhojpuri film channels shortly to cover the entire gambit of offering for our viewers
2768646 we have already spent close to rs 10 crores towards marketing to ensure maximum visibility for the newly launched channel mmpl has a full fledged set up with over 150 people currently working exclusively on the mahuaa channel bhojpuri is currently a high growth regional market with total regional markets accounting for more than 24 of the total television advertising pie as a first mover mahuaa tv will enjoy the advantages like advertising revenues and creating a strong brand image
2768647 bhojpuri movies have done extremely well over the past few years and is a huge industry today mahuaa tv will definitely help to take it to the next level by giving it a medium to reach the masses across the globe and also attract the huge pool of untapped talent
2768648 mahuaa tv is a great commitment from mmpl to compliment the voracious bhojpuri talent and entertainment that did not have a medium to showcase itself with stalwarts like prakash jha producing shows for mahuaa tv its sure to be an instant hit throughout the country

2768652 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2768653 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2768654 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2768655 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2768656 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2768657 he played outfield on saturday so im pretty sure hes ok

2768675 the creature at your feet dismissed as a bug or a weed is a creation in and of itself it has a name a million year history and a place in the world its genome adapts it to a special niche in an ecosystem the ethical value substantiated by close examination of its biology is that the life forms around us are too old too complex and potentially too useful to be carelessly discarded
2768676 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2768677 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2768709 doctors have long suspected that secondary infections may keep some patients from healing quickly after severe muscle strain this hypothesis has now been proved by preliminary results of a study of two groups of patients the first group of patients all being treated for muscle injuries by dr newland a doc tor who specializes in sports medicine took antibiotics regularly throughout their treatment their recuperation time was on average 40 percent quicker t han typically expected patients in the second group all being treated by dr alton a general physician were given sugar pills although the patients bel ieved they were taking antibiotics their average recuperation time was not si gnificantly reduced therefore all patients who are diagnosed with muscle str ain would be well advised to take antibiotics as part of their treatment

2768763 some sports such as weightlifting have a pretty bad record and that is demonstrated time and again with numerous athletes from that sport

2768765 there is no sport that anybody can suggest is doping free
2768766 but there are some sports that have had a history and i would suggest theres a culture of doping that has developed in some of those sports

2768772 i would hate to see our teachers and classrooms lose out on money because the state doesnt have enough revenue
2768773 i understand why legislators want to give people a break because the economy is down and people are hurting and cant afford the things they want to buy
2768774 but they arent taking into account what that revenue could later buy for the states

2768782 we have no reason to harbor any mistrust against our world for it is not against us if it has terrors they are our terrors if it has abysses these abysses belong to us if there are dangers we must try to love them and if only we arrange our life in accordance with the principle which tells us that we must always trust in the difficult then what now appears to us as the most alien will become our most intimate and trusted experience how could we forget those ancient myths that stand at the beginning of all races the myths about dragons that at the last moment are transformed into princesses perhaps all the dragons in our lives are princesses who are only waiting to see us act just once with beauty and courage perhaps everything that frightens us is in its deepest essence something helpless that wants our love

2768837 i am proud of my partys efforts on crime reduction strategies and i hope most people out there welcome these also it is important that we collectively build a better safe and secure society for generations to come
2768838 i will make it up to my family especially my daughter
2768839 i dont know if either one of us has a lot to be proud of today

2768845 this is yet another nightmare capability project weve inherited from the previous government mr fitzgibbon told fairfax today
2768846 and this time were not talking about a complex project like a seasprite helicopter every army around the world operates trucks
2768847 to help his mate the hunter based shadow minister for defence science and personnel bob baldwin brendan nelson rushed to the hunter valley firm varley to announce the company and others like it would be beneficiaries of the overlander project he said
2768848 this process failure demonstrates yet again what can happen when governments meddle in defence procurement for political gain
2768849 operations of this sort that involve the nsw police force and community are important in ensuring that people can enjoy themselves in a safe drug free environment
2768850 it is also good to ensure that we have stopped such dangerous addictive drugs from being distributed to juveniles as well as the general community and we are very pleased to have had the co operation of the general community it is a very pleasing result
2768851 ive never taken a fight i didnt think i could win
2768852 if meruelo maddux can make it happen so can others
2768853 the impact will be greater pressure on a litigation staff that is already operating at maximum potential these cuts will result in a high risk to the core mission of the district
2768854 in addition to the adverse traffic impacts noise pollution and other environmental concerns the street level crossing design poses a significant safety hazard
2768855 at vermont normandie western and crenshaw which abut large urban schools parks and places of worship crossing gates arent even proposed
2768856 it isnt its racist and we contend that nothing less than an equitable and safe underground or elevated route is acceptable in our community as well
2768857 we intend to send as strong message to the mta and to the public utilities commission
2768858 in a screech of emergency brakes and the shriek of twisted metal
2768859 this is a lot of money for a property that the district could have purchased years ago and the run up in price is based on the developer speculating that if the district didnt buy it he could put a huge development on it and make double his investment
2768860 lausd staff walked away from the property only to become interested again after a frustrated seller put it back on the market and re approached the entities that had provided purchase offers nearly a year prior
2768861 i voted against what i thought was a sweetheart deal for the developer
2768862 and i remember several of my colleagues saying they were going to hold their nose and vote for it i couldnt do that
2768863 i think its unfortunate that mr meruelo dragged the district through this process for as long as he did for the reasons that he did and these are taxpayer dollars that had to pay for this
2768864 of course its unfortunate because it was a game to him
2768865 on its own the lausd decided to accept a settlement agreement rather than continue discussions or litigating the matter a clear indication that it believed both history and their arguments were not on solid ground
2768866 this is where lawyers make their money so we weighed that we really did and at the end of the day we could keep fighting it and fighting and use those 50 million and still be back at square one
2768867 for me the most important thing was to build the school
2768868 if you were to compare a school nurse from 40 years ago she was someone who usually waited for a student who needed a band aid
2768869 we welcome those kids we want them to come to school and they have that right
2768870 but today school nurses are managing kids who need pharmaceuticals children with cardiac problems cancer kidney treatments
2768871 teachers have been told in the past that they would have to do certain things at one point the district wanted teachers to give shots our nurses were up in arms
2768872 not only is the california department of education breaking state law with this directive by violating the established scope of nursing practice but by negating the need for licensed nurses to administer insulin they are placing the children at risk
2768873 we have a certain degree of student population that are at risk and they have a right to have a medical professional to be there for their needs
2768874 were all very concerned about access to health care in the federal government
2768875 when kids come to school and theyve never had a checkup they come with a lot of health problems and its a real challenge
2768876 that to me is a challenge because how do we meet those needs of those in early education
2768877 through early detection we can see if a child needs a pair of glasses or has an ear infection if we just had a nurse in every school we would be available to follow up with these children
2768878 as long as leaders like barr and cortines engage in clear honest talk instead of excuses and obfuscation theres hope
2768879 teachers will have more say on curriculum and teaching methods and the green dot model is thin on administration
2768880 students will demonstrate an understanding of and a belief in the values of capitalism
2768881 ignoring the needs of children affected by hiv and continuing to marginalize groups at greatest risk for infection will only lead to more new infections and fewer people on treatment
2768882 it is the needs of all children especially vulnerable children not whether they meet the definition of orphan that must be our primary focus

2768903 it could have a significant chilling effect on the reporting of the private lives of celebrities
2768904 the most significant changes to the privacy act in the 20 years of its existence
2768905 there is a strong expectation that special minister of state senator john faulkner will commit the government to act on the alrcs recommendations and that he will introduce relevant legislative amendments in the foreseeable future
2768906 protection of privacy needs to be balanced against the public interest in allowing the free flow of information and upholding freedom of speech
2768907 it has not been demonstrated that existing privacy protections fail to achieve this balance
2768908 the alrc has failed to demonstrate a breach of privacy by the media is not already dealt with by existing laws such as defamation and surveillance laws or self regulation by the media
2768909 the law would be irrelevant to ordinary citizens in whom the media has no interest it would be open to abuse by irresponsible claimants who would clog our already over burdened courts

2768950 no ser a justo culpar a nadie en particular de esta situaci n pero los hechos demuestran que tenemos una tremenda asimetr a entre la voluntad pol tica manifestada en el centenar de medidas anunciadas o en los recursos invertidos y los resultados reales de su aplicaci n cobertura e impacto final
2768951 tenemos un problema estructural en los programas de fomento hoy en chile hay nueve ministerios relacionados con el sector a trav s de 30 instituciones que impulsan m s de 200 instrumentos de fomento con poca o ninguna coordinaci n entre ellas
2768952 de los mil millones de d lares que todos los a os aporta el estado a este sector cu nto efectivamente llega a las pymes qu cantidad queda en medio de la amplia mara a de instituciones intermediarios y ejecutores que intervienen en los programas de fomento
2768953 la fronda institucional que apoya a las pymes es confusa para los empresarios e ineficiente en el uso de los recursos porque adem s hemos fallado en construir una pol tica de indicadores que mida los resultados de los programas
2768954 de una vez por todas debemos dar pasos concretos hacia la construcci n de una pol tica nacional para las pymes iniciativa que se debe efectuar en el marco de la modernizaci n del estado y producto de un amplio acuerdo nacional
2768955 en ese escenario es urgente la creaci n de una autoridad para las pymes que tenga responsabilidad fiscal y d cuenta del impacto de todos los recursos que el estado invierte en el sector
2768956 conjuntamente con eso que se haga cargo frente a la opini n p blica de corregir las fallas de mercado legales y normativas existentes en el acceso de estas empresas a los factores productivos tales como financiamiento capital humano innovaci n materias primas equipamiento y maquinaria entre otros
2768957 el estado no puede seguir imp vido frente a los abusos de posici n dominante de las grandes tiendas que pagan cuando quieren o no respetan las condiciones de compra es una verdadera ley de la selva

2769033 jasmine was i would say a blessing in disguise shes my blessing
2769034 the thing about hazel is she just puts one foot in front of the other thats what i really appreciated about her and jony was always right there
2769035 said hazels mom ruth green of pasco whos been with hazels dad more than 30 years

2769050 its wonderful to be able to access the latest research and anecdotes at one site
2769051 theories are discussed snake oil cures are debunked and support is given to all
2769052 kalam has already written to the students on 10 themes a student would have to primarily build upon
2769053 the themes are highly motivating for instance one of them is on reducing the urban rural divided the second is about energy security third is about water conservation and the fourth is about governance with discrimination the 10 issues are all basic issues relating to governance and policy making synergy between agriculture industry and the service sectors
2769054 the outcome of the course is also likely to be shared with the parliamentary standing committee as well which in turn could take it up with the respective bodies to initiate any changes they feel plausible
2769055 this would indeed be useful for many students and in case they step into politics their priority could be development which is not the case with contemporary politicians guided mostly by their political priorities
2769056 we shall invest more than 2 million bahraini dinars 5 3 million to make it one of the best schools in the gulf
2769057 the facilities at both campuses will be upgraded to international standards
2769058 we shall focus on the overall personality development of children
2769059 now we are allowing industry professionals to register and attend any of our 450 regular courses offered every semester
2769060 this is not like a professional development programme but like a regular class that our students go through they can attend classes along with our students and brush up skills in the laboratories
2769061 we have already registered 42 professionals this semester the aim is to fully utilise our resources and help others grow
2769062 but there is no restriction on any industry professional and the course that he or she wants to pursue
2769063 this is a pilot project and once it delivers results it will provide a major boost for industry professionals we may also have a full fledged set up for this distant education mode

2769080 the harsh truth is that there is good reason for israel to make a precipitate strike at iranian nuclear capacity
2769081 less than a year ago diplomats in the middle east were taking bets on the likelihood of a us military attack on iran with some assessing it at higher than 50 per cent suspicions were fuelled by recent israeli military manoeuvres over the mediterranean which some us officials described as target practice for an iran strike

2769083 clinton began to grow angry according to a participants notes
2769084 this has been a very instructive call talking to myself she snapped and hung up
2769085 the anger and toxic obsessions overwhelmed even the most reserved beltway wise men
2769086 h er advisers couldnt execute strategy they routinely attacked and undermined each other and clinton never forced a resolution s he never behaved like a chief executive and her own staff proved to be her achilles heel
2769087 what is clear from the internal documents is that clintons loss derived not from any specific decision she made but rather from the preponderance of the many she did not make

2769095 not only do their droppings damage and contaminate property the birds also carry various diseases such as salmonella
2769096 food put out for them will also attract rats and vermin
2769097 if we establish that a nuisance or pest problem does exist we may have to reconsider further action
2769098 its absolutely ridiculous about 90 of people in belford feed their birds im not going to stop
2769099 we would encourage people to feed their garden birds throughout the year
2769100 this is an important time when a lot of adolescent birds are putting down fat to see them through the winter and they need to feed up
2769101 it means now we have to truck all the food in

2769121 ive been struggling ever since i came back from the ankle injury
2769122 i always look back later at things i compose in anger regretting them rethinking them
2769123 anger is just as good an emotion as any other
2769124 i know it works as an emotion but i consider angry writing to be a research stage not the finished product i just have to get it out then ill separate from it and come back to it later with perspective
2769125 years from now when i regret this afternoon when i rethink this youll be the hero of the book
2769126 do me a favor when you re write make sure you mention that i when i left i didn t close the door

2769128 all the threads that hold a community together a common identity role models a sense of safety were given by young people as motivations to join gangs
2769129 our research suggests that young people are creating their own youth communities and gangs in search of the influences that once could have been found in traditional communities
2769130 if i asked my dog to run up that hill right now she would do it
2769131 she would never give up she just loves to work
2769132 within a fortnight she had pretty much forgotten about it she didnt once fall over shes pretty resilient
2769133 theres been no other research for us to look at so we cant predict what we will see we are not really setting out to find out something in particular we are going out there to gather information
2769134 we will be able to extract some information from it and then be able to feed that back into whoever is involved in working dogs
2769135 the overall aim is to increase the dogs longevity and performance
2769136 i am yet to meet a farmer who runs a farming operation which involves sheep or beef without a dog they are covering huge amounts of distance every day they also get places that vehicles cant

2769141 we had to have something steiner y and gnomes are a big part of the education in the kindy and with the younger kids
2769142 theyre there to protect and look after you so we thought it would fit in with the school and the business side of things
2769143 the fact that we have got light at the end of the tunnel
2769144 patients may be disconcerted when they see an open neck and short sleeves and may think it is very casual or even disrespectful
2769145 there have been some expressions of concern from staff but people are largely complying
2769146 it is useful to highlight the fact that consultants are changing what they wear so people know it is not dressing down it is part of infection control practice
2769147 some may disagree but the general feeling is that it reminds everyone to wash their hands
2769148 most hospitals have so few changing rooms there would be a queue to get in and out so it is just not practical and the laundries are not geared up for it yet
2769149 but i think eventually we will be doing that in this country but it will take some time
2769150 you better come get your uncle i just killed him
2769151 its a busy and popular route but we see it as under served because theres no low fare option
2769152 expansion is not driven by anything other than the fact that the business model is working well and there seems to be buoyancy in those markets that should enable us to do what weve done in all the other markets which is grow them
2769153 pacific blue is the first low cost carrier to operate on the sydney sector which is the largest single international route on offer from auckland airport
2769154 we knew six months ago the market was starting to ease in a lot of places so it is a confirmation of that anecdotal evidence
2769155 dated properties leaky homes and properties with overgrown sections are noticeably affected
2769156 the question has now changed from when will prices stop rising to when can we expect to see them stabilise
2769157 it has had a doubling in the past five years so it might sit quietly for five years and away well go again
2769158 consequently our share target price falls to 8 50 from 10 10
2769159 the question is not that the new zealand outlook is bleak but how bleak
2769160 however a strong construction forward order book australian exposures and the potential to win several further large projects should provide a measure of protection
2769161 arguably the outlook for residential construction in new zealand is amongst the worlds worst
2769162 the key question in determining our recommendation is when will sentiment turn and value start to be recognised
2769163 while the near term earnings risk for fletcher is on the down side we believe much of this is probably already reflected in the price
2769164 im aware of the speculation and aware of the potential issues around it as well
2769165 humes is about the same size as rocla fletchers australian piping business both have about a third of the market
2769166 there are a significant number of vendors who have mounting pressure on them to meet the market as mortgage repayments on top of increased costs of living start to bite
2769167 this change of position reflects a greater understanding and acceptance of the property market and the wider economy
2769168 there are many examples of significant losses being realised currently
2769169 because of the sheer volume that is on the market the people who want to sell quicker need to drop their prices to be more competitive
2769170 the ones that are most motivated will drop the most so there are some good buys out there
2769171 ive just sold a home for about 50 000 less i sold it for 492 000 last year
2769172 anybody that doesnt need to sell is probably not in this market i would say
2769173 were trying to expose this rot and we havent got any help
2769174 were working toward our 2010 financials and growing by then to 50 million in turnover based on historical growth its an achievable target

2769188 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2769189 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2769190 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2769191 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2769192 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2769193 if only this had a real honest shot it could be big
2769194 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2769195 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2769196 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2769199 llenen la tierra y som tanla manden a los peces del mar a las aves del cielo y a cuanto animal vive en la tierra yo les entrego toda clase de hierbas de semillas y de rboles frutales para que todos les sirvan de alimento tambi n les doy todos los animales de la tierra todas las aves del cielo y cuanto ser viviente se mueve sobre la tierra

2769208 he visto la tribulaci n de mi pueblo y he o do el clamor que le arrancan sus opresores y conociendo cu nto padece he bajado para librar a mi pueblo de la opresi n de los egipcios y para llevarlo a un pa s grande y f rtil a una tierra que mana leche y miel

2769218 no porque exceden en n mero a las dem s naciones se uni el se or a ustedes y los eligi pues al contrario son el menos numeroso de los pueblos sino porque el se or los am y ha cumplido el juramento que hizo a los padres de ustedes
2769219 mira c mo pertenecen al se or tu dios los cielos y la tierra y todo cuanto contienen y no obstante se uni estrech simamente por amor con tus padres y despu s de ellos con ustedes

2769225 dentro de un a o sara tu mujer tendr un hijo

2769227 abrah n no flaque en la fe al considerar su cuerpo ya marchito pues era casi centenario y la incapacidad generativa de sara no vacil ante la promesa de dios ni se dej llevar por la incredulidad sino que fortalecido por la fe dio gloria a dios por su pleno convencimiento de que el que lo hab a prometido ten a tambi n poder para cumplirlo
2769228 prob dios de nuevo a abrah n y le dijo toma a isaac tu hijo nico a quien amas y me lo ofreces en sacrificio
2769229 por la fe puesto a prueba por dios ofreci abrah n a isaac y ofrec a a su unig nito al que era depositario de las promesas crey que dios ten a poder para resucitarlo de entre los muertos
2769230 juro por m mismo que ya que has hecho esto y no me has negado a tu hijo el nico que tienes te colmar de bendiciones y multiplicar tanto tus descendientes que ser n como las estrellas del cielo y como la arena que hay a la orilla del mar yo bendecir por medio de tus descendientes a todos los pueblos de la tierra
2769231 por la fe abandon mois s egipto sin miedo a las iras del rey y persever firme en su prop sito como si contemplase al invisible
2769232 por qu motivo has echado sobre m la carga de todo este pueblo
2769233 jefe de una naci n grande y m s poderosa que sta n m 14 12 l no duda y suplica enseguida la salvaci n de su pueblo y con tal confianza lo hace que se ve que l ya sabe que dios le tiene concedido lo que le pide ex 32 11 14 n m 14 13 20

2769239 por qu nos han tra do a este desierto para matar de hambre a toda la gente
2769240 por qu nos has hecho salir de egipto para matarnos de sed
2769241 el se or ha o do las quejas de ustedes con las que han murmurado contra el porque qui nes somos nosotros contra el se or son y no contra nosotros las murmuraciones de ustedes
2769242 hab an puesto a prueba a dios diciendo est o no est el se or con nosotros
2769243 de ning n modo podremos conquistar a este pueblo siendo como es m s fuerte que nosotros
2769244 hasta cu ndo va a blasfemar de m ese pueblo hasta cu ndo no van a creerme despu s de tantos portentos como he hecho a su vista
2769245 ninguno de los hombres que han visto mis prodigios y me han tentado ya por diez veces ver la tierra prometida ni uno siquiera de los que han blasfemado contra m la llegar a ver levanten el campamento y vu lvanse al desierto
2769246 en este desierto quedar n tendidos los cad veres de ustedes andar n sus hijos vagando por el desierto por espacio de cuarenta a os pagando la pena de la falta de fe de ustedes hasta que sean consumidos los cad veres de sus padres
2769247 un pueblo pobre y humilde que pone su esperanza en el nombre del se or
2769248 si uno de ustedes pierde una oveja de las cien que tiene no deja las otras noventa y nueve en el campo para ir en busca de la perdida hasta encontrarla y cuando la encuentra muy feliz la pone sobre los hombros y al llegar a su casa re ne amigos y vecinos y les dice al grense conmigo porque encontr la oveja que se me hab a perdido yo les declaro que de igual modo habr m s alegr a en el cielo por un solo pecador que cambia su coraz n y su vida que por noventa y nueve justos que no tienen necesidad de convertirse

2769253 he opened his eyes on his own and looked at rhonda she called his name and he opened his eyes and nodded to her she smiled at him and told him dont leave me im waiting for you to come back he shrugged his shoulders and she said thats when she knew he was tired he signaled to her that his body was tired
2769254 they tried to resuscitate him two times one time he came back for about an hour then he went into cardiac arrest the second time
2769255 he told his wife non verbally that he could breathe on his own and he wanted the ventilator out he motioned that he wanted it out
2769256 but because he had it his immune system was compromised he had an infection he was on a new medication that suppresses the immune system and thats where the pneumonia came from
2769257 he was critically ill when he was in the hospital
2769258 shes devastated however shes at peace about his transition because of her faith in god her faith is what is sustaining her
2769259 they had 30 years of marriage thats unprecedented in todays time particularly for celebrities that brings joy to her they loved each other and respected each other on a daily basis she was by his side to the very end
2769260 when they started dating he said girl you better come on board this train because im going to be rich and her response was okay and they were married thats how he charmed her with his sense of humor
2769261 when they got married they were kids he was 20 and she was 19 they both grew up together and they both matured in this marriage
2769262 what she will treasure the most is the fact that she was his wife for 30 years and not only was she his wife but she was his best friend shes going to miss him dearly
2769263 im not one of those people who says whats the point of marriage
2769264 find someone you can be yourself around who makes you laugh who challenges you in a good way and where you just speak off each other
2769265 my parents have been married more than 25 years with all the glory and all the pain you can imagine but theyve stayed together
2769266 it makes life easier besides the possibility has never really arisen
2769267 because id hope that people wouldnt say no to me because im an actor but theyd have to be a pretty extraordinary
2769268 i havent been this excited about a new record since the 80s
2769269 im a loner in my private life so the party animal only comes out on stage thats really my connection to people
2769270 i liken them to favorite children you never get tired of trotting out your kids when they do well at something youre really proud of it
2769271 there are a lot of people who were fans when they were little kids theyve grown up and are bringing their kids and women are bringing their husbands
2769272 obama had as good a trip overseas as you could possibly have and nothing moved
2769273 john mccain at this point is identified with four more years of george bush
2769274 thats exactly the way obama wanted to paint him and it is the way people see him
2769275 i know why you wanna hate me cause hate if all the worlds even seen latetly

2769278 absolutely theres a lot of truth to what the president said and in terms of wall street there was too much leverage in the system and more leverage than was appropriate and more than people recognized because the leverage came into the system in the form of highly complex structured products which were difficult to understand
2769279 there is no question about it wall street got drunk
2769280 thats one reason i asked you to turn off your tv cameras
2769281 the question is how long will it take to sober up and not try to do all these fancy financial instruments
2769282 we have of course one priority getting through this period with as little damage as little negative impact as possible on the economy but the second part is to take steps to reduce the likelihood of these sorts of things happening in the future
2769283 we sized that program to say how could we do something that will be meaningful this year but not so big that it would jeopardize some of our long term priorities and our fiscal priorities and balancing the budget so again my view would be lets see how this program works in the third quarter

2769306 todd bachman was one of the finest people ive ever met i think theyre just some of lifes finest people
2769307 this purchase puts government relief for social housing in jeopardy it is much harder to ask for money to help the council out when it apparently has 17m available for a property developer
2769308 how can the council find 17m to bail out a property developer when it could not find money to help the most vulnerable residents in council owned social housing and rushed through a rent increase of 24
2769309 the purchase at market rates has to be seen against the alternative of allowing the properties to go on the open market in the current market the council could have picked them up for a much lower price than market rates it looks like the council is quick to help out property developers and slow to help out its most vulnerable and struggling residents
2769310 the three day time limit sounds like an encyclopedia salesman who says you have to buy them now or the deal is off
2769311 tenants will find it particularly galling to have been told by council that there was no alternative to savage increases in their rents yet now money can be found to bail out a property developer
2769312 not everyone would want to jump in a nuclear reactor its a definite breed

2769319 people are so poor they are just looking for ways to buy bread we need to open their minds as they dont know the value of their history we have to give them that knowledge and then they will protect it

2769400 for 90 minutes it was 0 0 which against manchester united has to be considered a very good result
2769401 it was fantastic just to get a game under my belt
2769402 after being out so long im just happy to be out there again
2769403 i didnt feel anything bad today ive had a decent pre season and just need more games for my sharpness
2769404 its definitely mind over matter the body goes through different phases you have to continually resist the physical urge to breathe
2769405 so when i get in the water ive got all my energy for my dive
2769406 i think thats the beauty of it its quite meditative
2769407 i knew it was pretty bad as soon as i hit the car
2769408 i was sort of hoping i could just get a discharged without conviction during the court case i was pretty worried about having that over my shoulders
2769409 the canadian authorities can use that as a basis for denying a visa
2769410 it was sleeting the wind was absolutely freezing and showers were coming through some of those thin girls were just blue
2769411 the kids hands were red and their legs bright blue children shouldnt be treated like that
2769412 but they stuck at it and were alive at the end
2769413 i was shocked they did not think of the girls safety their hands were numb so they were using wrists to try and catch the ball
2769414 el trabajo de serrano apoya la idea de que el envejecimiento es m s una acumulaci n de fallos que una acci n preprogramada su grupo ha demostrado la relaci n entre la acci n del gen

2769417 its just an utter tragedy its as simple as that theres nothing to hang it on its just a crazy man
2769418 how do you live with that how do you live with any of it the mind just doesnt want to comprehend any of it really its just so random and incredible
2769419 todd bachman was one of the finest people ive ever met i think theyre just some of lifes finest people
2769420 we knew six months ago the market was starting to ease in a lot of places so it is a confirmation of that anecdotal evidence
2769421 dated properties leaky homes and properties with overgrown sections are noticeably affected
2769422 the question has now changed from when will prices stop rising to when can we expect to see them stabilise
2769423 it has had a doubling in the past five years so it might sit quietly for five years and away well go again
2769424 we had to have something steiner y and gnomes are a big part of the education in the kindy and with the younger kids
2769425 theyre there to protect and look after you so we thought it would fit in with the school and the business side of things
2769426 the report was prepared as part of a large information gathering exercise around the governments work on an ets
2769427 it has parts withheld because they discuss commercially sensitive information that ngai tahu and others do not wish to be in the public arena
2769428 converted maori land to perpetual leases and maori to an entitlement of peppercorn rentals
2769429 there are no claims or legal suits about it at the moment but they have been warned about it terribly theyve probably done this work to assess the risk of maori basically suing them
2769430 it wouldnt be a bad idea to flush them out so this report can see the light of day
2769431 if i asked my dog to run up that hill right now she would do it
2769432 she would never give up she just loves to work
2769433 within a fortnight she had pretty much forgotten about it she didnt once fall over shes pretty resilient
2769434 theres been no other research for us to look at so we cant predict what we will see we are not really setting out to find out something in particular we are going out there to gather information
2769435 we will be able to extract some information from it and then be able to feed that back into whoever is involved in working dogs
2769436 the overall aim is to increase the dogs longevity and performance
2769437 i am yet to meet a farmer who runs a farming operation which involves sheep or beef without a dog they are covering huge amounts of distance every day they also get places that vehicles cant
2769438 at the end of the day if you buy a two year old dog for 5000 and get five years work out of it youre paying them a grand a year where will you get any other worker who will work for a grand a year
2769439 if we diverted millions of dollars into city plumbing that money would have to come out of health services which would be inappropriate
2769440 it might be most appropriate for the funding for citywide infrastructure to come via some direct arrangement between government and local bodies
2769441 it is our desire to have water capacity inside the city
2769442 we are twice the size we were two years ago
2769443 the oil isnt going to last for ever and they are setting themselves up for a different future english is the language of the web and if you cant speak english your job chances are diminished
2769444 we are very much driven by exchange rates and we will expect our business to be growing now that the exchange rate is coming back in our favour
2769445 as a total export education is estimated to be worth 2 3 billion thats seriously large
2769446 building business on the back of scholarship students isnt sustainable how long do we expect the saudi government to keep providing scholarships for the only way we can have a sustainable market is if we have a diversified market

2769480 welcome to japan fareefor air travelers residing outside of japan
2769481 weve seen a tremendous increase and a tremendous interest in higher education
2769482 its such a contradiction to spend your time in classes talking about economics sustainability environmental awareness health consciousness and knowing where the food you eat comes from and then go to your lunchroom and eat something from halfway across the planet
2769483 theres such a disconnect between where our food comes from and i feel theres even less information about meat and how its raised and its contents
2769484 to have an option thats more reliable and where i know im consuming something that was produced in a responsible way is really helpful to me as a student
2769485 the students here are great theyre pretty green and sustainability is pretty pronounced here with the windmills and composting
2769486 the more you do the more the students want you to push the envelope

2769491 it is dangerous to allow speculation about what iran might be able to do in the future to permeate debates about the threat posed by iran today
2769492 conflating future and present threats creates an artificial sense of urgency about what the united states must do to protect itself
2769493 a comparison of the united states and irans conventional military capabilities demonstrates the overwhelming superiority of the united states
2769494 people need to spend less time hyperventilating about the rhetoric of two unpopular leaders and more time using realistic assessments to formulate smart policies
2769495 pursuing diplomacy with iran is not going to be easy and it will not resolve all of the outstanding issues overnight
2769496 but it is an approach that is worth trying particularly given the disastrous consequences that would result from a military confrontation between the united states and iran
2769497 these are systems that form the backbone of any countrys military capabilities anti missile technologies intelligence gathering and radar systems and precision munitions technology the uae has been really pushing hard to improve its military capabilities in the last few years theyre in the midst of a pretty significant build up a lot of this is just standard textbook military modernization after beginning to accrue significant wealth if its a country by a body of water it has to protect its ports it needs to protect its shipping lanes economic interests play a pretty big role

2769500 he was just never the same when he came back because of all the things he saw

2769503 no binding mutual defense agreement has even been concluded without the participation of congress
2769504 progress continues to be slow if not stagnant in public services and the economy
2769505 conflict levels have diminished to some extent because warring communities find it more difficult to penetrate communal enclaves
2769506 everyone is convinced coalition forces are going to leave and they are saying we do not want al qaeda to take control of the area when that happens
2769507 evidence shows that allowing gays and lesbians to serve openly is unlikely to pose any significant risk to morale good order discipline or cohesion
2769508 the study group was saddened that not a single expert who opposes gays in the military was willing to meet or talk with us in person
2769509 thanks that we are affluent enough to receive all of this
2769510 i thought it was a domestic but i pulled the front door open and everything was in flames
2769511 we had to run out the back end of the house it was freezing out there
2769512 they say they have been really sick and go to the hospital
2769513 the girl say i have been sick for two days we want the money
2769514 they appeared to be the most genuine couple you could meet
2769515 i was gutted i just couldnt believe it because they seemed so honest
2769516 i hope its a one off and it doesnt get repeated business owners shouldnt be paying for that and they should politely decline to do so
2769517 the bird strike and subsequent fault current caused the high voltage lines to break cutting off supply to all customers supplied by the kairanga substation

2769519 we can utilise the people in the auckland support centre
2769520 we discovered as we went along that the shop wasnt ideal and customers didnt like the length of the store

2769524 received intelligence that my nawab felt very impatient and uneasy on account of my long absence
2769525 the grotto full of wonderful congelations is the amarnath cave where blocks of ice stalagmites formed by dripping water from the roof are worshipped by many hindus who resort here as images of shiva
2769526 the ceremony at the cave of amarnath takes place on the 15th of the hindoo month of sawan
2769527 founded the chhawni anmarnath at ram bagh in srinagar where the sadhus from the plains assembled and where he gave them free rations for the journey both ways from his own private resources
2769528 i guess that admiration respect and deep gratitude doesnt extend to providing troops with an education once theyve served out their commitment on the battlefield
2769529 to the public these men are members of a familiar fraternity presented tens of thousands of times on television and radio to give authoritative and unfettered judgments about the most pressing issues of the post sept 11 world
2769530 going to come from personnel cuts thats where its going to come from they know it
2769531 all writers and distinguished voices to send their articles and opinions to the agency for publication
2769532 what the u s wants is to take the current status quo and try to regulate it in a new agreement and what we want is greater respect for iraqi sovereignty signing the agreement would mean that the iraqi government had given up its sovereignty by its own consent and that will never happen
2769533 the americans insist so far that is they who define what is an aggression on iraq and what is democracy inside iraq if we come under aggression we should define it and ask for help
2769534 the agreement wasnt satisfactory to say the least the proposals contained some good points but they were not up to what we had expected
2769535 the americans are making demands that would lead to the colonization of iraq
2769536 there is a national consensus on rejecting many issues mentioned by the american side because its compromising the iraqi national sovereignty
2769537 i dont think with the conditions provided in that agreement that it would get approved such conditions cant be tolerated by iraq the whole agreement needs to be reconsidered
2769538 the agreement will humiliate iraqis rob the iraqi government of its sovereignty and give the occupier the upper hand we do believe that the presence of the occupation is the main reason behind all of our crises and unfortunately we hear some of our government officials calling on the occupation forces to stay
2769539 we rejected the whole thing from the beginning in my point of view it would just be a new occupation with an iraqi signature
2769540 they are calling for unlimited jurisdiction in countering terror with mere american will they want the air and land to be opened without any restrictions they want immunity for those working with the army this is not only an attempt to control but rather an agreement with such characteristics worse than the occupation
2769541 the occupation is trying to get a long term agreement that will be a colonial guardianship
2769542 we are just trying to see what motive might have been behind it
2769543 they the victims are obviously a bit shaken up they are normal joe public people which is why it may be mistaken identity
2769544 we believe there might have been a group of four or five walking around the area at the time
2769545 it ripped those doors open and forced those ones shut and broke all the locks
2769546 thats where the roof started to lift which is right above katies bedroom
2769547 it was like a rumble and both pep and i sat up in bed
2769548 i was petrified then it was dead calm not a breath of wind like nothing had even happened

2769554 my lord your highness ought not to be surprised to see me tremble when i appear before you at the head of a company of ecclesiastics were i at the head of an army of thirty thousand men i should tremble much more
2769555 i have been misinformed sir your highness does not treat me as if i were an enemy
2769556 it is quite impossible for any man to be angry with you
2769557 what do you think one can remember a thing for ever

2769561 as they pleased the king i hope they will please the reader
2769562 you honour your father and your mother that your days may
2769563 because sir if it had been your intention to condemn me you would not have added irony to misfortune
2769564 aha do you want to be killed a second time i am your man
2769565 as often as the name of robespierre was mentioned to me i used to take off my hat in order to see if my head was in it
2769566 love and bless you my lady let me light my pipe in your eyes
2769567 sir you may ask me for any other favour but as for your life it is impossible for me to grant it
2769568 all your exploits are mere commonplace in comparison to those which i have achieved and i will relate a single one that surpasses all yours
2769569 as i was returning to town from the country i had to pass through a narrow lane well known for being infested with highwaymen my horse was in good order my pistols loaded and my broadsword hung at my side i entered the lane without any apprehension scarcely had i reached the middle when a loud shout behind me made me turn my head and i saw a man with a short gun running fast towards me i was going to face him with my horse when two men with large cudgels in their hands rushing from the hedge seized the reins and threatened me with instant death undaunted i took my two pistols but before i had time to fire one was knocked out of my hand the other went off and one of the robbers fell i then drew my sword and though bruised by the blows i had received struck with all my might and split the head of the other in two freed from my danger on their side i attempted a second time to turn my horse
2769570 thou canst not hit it hit it hit it thou canst not hit it my good man
2769571 mind your own business this quarrel is no business of yours
2769572 the lion as any one can tell you who has been chased by them as often as i have is a very savage animal and there are certain individuals among them though i will not guarantee it as a general law who do not drink coffee
2769573 it was most absurd of you to offer it you might have known if you had had any sense that no old sailors ever like gruel
2769574 but i thought as he was an uncle of yours
2769575 you may call it stuff if you like all i know is my uncles are all old men and they like gruel like anything
2769576 do come away i cant stand this squeezing any more no crowded shops are comfortable you know very well
2769577 why i do of course and im sure there are some
2769578 they say no doctors are metaphysical organists and that lets me into a little fact about you you know
2769579 why how do you make that out you never heard me play the organ
2769580 dont talk to me ive known more rich merchants than you have and i can tell you not one of them was ever an old miser since the world began
2769581 and what has that got to do with old mr brown
2769582 why dont you see that its absurd to call him a miserly merchant either hes not a merchant or hes not a miser
2769583 it is so kind of you to enquire im really feeling a great deal better to day
2769584 and is it nature or art that is to have the credit of this happy change
2769585 art i think the doctor has given me some of that patent medicine of his
2769586 well ill never call him a humbug again theres somebody at any rate that feels better after taking his medicine
2769587 no i dont like you one bit and ill go and play with my doll dolls are never unkind
2769588 so you like a doll better than a cousin oh you little silly
2769589 of course i do cousins are never kind at least no cousins ive ever seen
2769590 well and what does that prove id like to know if you mean that cousins arent dolls who ever said they were
2769591 what are you talking about geraniums for you cant tell one flower from another at this distance i grant you theyre all red flowers it doesnt need a telescope to know that
2769592 i dont deny it and what then i suppose youll be telling me some of those flowers are geraniums
2769593 of course thats what i should tell you if youd the sense to follow an argument but whats the good of proving anything to you i should like to know
2769594 boys youve passed a fairly good examination all things considered now let me give you a word of advice before i go remember that all who are really anxious to learn work hard
2769595 i thank you sir in the name of my scholars and proud am i to think there are some of them at least that are really anxious to learn
2769596 very glad to hear it and how do you make it out to be so
2769597 why sir i know how hard they work some of them that is who should know better
2769598 well theyve got their own way to make in the world we cant leave them a fortune apiece and moneys not to be had as you know without moneys worth they must work if they want to live and how are they to work if they dont know anything take my word for it theres no place for ignorance in these times and all authorities agree that the time to learn is when youre young ones got no memory afterwards worth speaking of a child will learn more in an hour than a grown man in five so those that have to learn must learn when theyre young if ever theyre to learn at all of course that doesnt do unless children are healthy i quite allow that well the doctor tells me no children are healthy unless theyve got a good colour in their cheeks and only just look at my darlings why their cheeks bloom like peonies well now they tell me that to keep children in health you should never give them more than six hours altogether at lessons in the day and at least two half holidays in the week and thats exactly our plan i can assure you we never go beyond six hours and every wednesday and saturday as ever is not one syllable of lessons do they do after their one oclock dinner so how you can imagine im running any risk in the education of my precious pets is more than i can understand i promise you
2769599 people are here for themselves and thats how its going to stay take or leave it
2769600 when i say people are here for themselves make it sound that people are bad i guess i have put it in that way

2769672 we are on offense on the most important domestic issue before the country which is the energy crisis
2769673 we have blunted obamas momentum both nationally and in the key states where were ahead even or just slightly behind in a horrific political year
2769674 the most underappreciated dynamic of the race is the intensity advantage
2769675 thats why george bush won in 2004 they had an intensity gap and we have it now
2769676 people are very mediocre predictors of their own behavior what they tell you in june and july will not necessarily comport well with what they do in november
2769677 it was one of the most amazing swims ive ever seen in my life it blew me away
2769678 he looked at me held up his fist and said you better win all those medals
2769679 im friends with one of the assistant coaches on the basketball team and he texted me and said lebron was fired up after my morning swim
2769680 it was one of the most amazing swims ive ever seen in my life it blew me away absolutely blew me away hes going to be on fire now
2769681 it will be a very tough race and i think we have a very good shot to do well but id say on paper theyre the favorites
2769682 we had a guys only meeting the other day and we were all pretty fired up
2769683 we shared some stories and were just going back and forth talking about the hopes we have for this meet and so far were living up to those expectations
2769684 thats my best prelim swim so i have to be happy
2769685 weve got to continue this tomorrow kevin millar said after the os second nine run offensive explosion
2769686 nick did a great job of freezing on that line drive to right field to stay out of the double play millar said
2769687 you get tired of driving in runs sometimes he said
2769688 those of you that have been around markakis have come to understand what kind of player this guy is and how he has a real good sense of the etiquette of the game which is one of the things were trying to get done around here
2769689 to be included with cal ripken eddie murray jim palmer brooks robinson and frank robinson i dont think ive had an honor that will compare and i dont think i ever will
2769690 that was one of the great moments of my life he also gave the introduction at yesterdays luncheon obviously im prejudiced but i thought he was absolutely sensational
2769691 two my first real save in oakland and me screwing up the game in no 160 by thinking too much
2769692 the stretchy guy from fantastic four couldnt have stopped that pitch i learned a lot that night looking across the clubhouse and seeing jamie quirk saying he should have had it jamie was man enough to take the blame but it was 100 percent my fault i remembered that every time i screwed up the rest of my career and tried to follow that lead and say it was my fault
2769693 hes the fourth outfielder on this team but he will play trembley said
2769694 he deserves a shot he put up great humbers at bowie but this is the big leagues luke scott is playing with an achilles and a problem with his arch i will be reasonable with getting him out of there and reasonable with getting montanez in there but if people are waiting for him to play seven days in a row i dont think thats realistic
2769695 its a fact of life for the police officer working today
2769696 lets just say they are doing things that they didnt have to do
2769697 these products need to be returned to the ground as part of our rehabilitation program
2769698 they give children the chance to play with a wide variety of different toys
2769699 most parents will know how easily kids can get bored with some toys sometimes this can take the cost out of it
2769700 we have educational toys slides bikes right through to dvds children from birth through to 8 years old are catered for
2769701 naturally toys have a limited lifespan so they always have to be renewed
2769702 just wanted people to know it could be done and now
2769703 it takes time and effort but now is the right time to be making the switch
2769704 a lot of the components which were once specialised technology are now being mass produced in china
2769705 i was at a talk in dunedin where we had to turn people away the hall was so full

2769714 davon hatte ich immer getr umt daf r habe ich immer gearbeitet endlich habe ich es geschafft olympia war mein traum mit dieser medaille habe ich ihn mir erf llt
2769715 es ist mein umfeld das mich stark macht meine mitmenschen haben mich in den letzten jahren immer unterst tzt und in schlechten phasen wieder aufgebaut meine ganze karriere geh rt ihnen also ist es nur recht wenn ich jetzt auch f r sie da bin
2769716 wir sind wirklich freundinnen und wollen nicht in politische dinge gezogen werden sport ist nicht politik
2769717 wenn die welt aus meinem verhalten lehren zieht w rde es nie wieder krieg geben
2769718 wir leben im 21 jahrhundert wir sollten uns nicht gegenseitig bekriegen zwischen sportlern und v lkern soll es keinen hass geben
2769719 die politiker sollten die situation heute kl ren und wenn sie es nicht machen sollten wir involviert werden

2769727 i thought i was aiming for the heart and i missed

2769729 its going to be a packed house and a lot of fun and a great atmosphere for these young guys to put on their nfl uniform for the first time walk out on the field and say oh my gosh here i am it beats some of the places like the swamp university of florida and the coliseum southern california these guys have been
2769730 but the field doesnt change im just going out to play football im not worried about the crowd big time players show up in big time situations thats what i strive for
2769731 every year youre excited about getting to the first preseason game hitting somebody else and then seeing how your younger people respond in that environment
2769732 some guys are in an nfl game for the first time its always fun to watch their reaction see who seems comfortable and see who maybe seems a little out of their element
2769733 the games are different than practice theres no way to simulate it itll be fun to watch and see how they operate
2769734 we have an idea of what green bays going to do
2769735 what wed like to do is do our thing and find out how our guys react to things they havent seen before
2769736 its mostly about can they react under game time pressure this is a great atmosphere because its monday night and its green bay its going to be like a regular season game were going to find out if the lights are too bright for em or theyre ready to go
2769737 were not going to be distracted by the whole brett favre thing
2769738 that has nothing to do with the cincinnati bengals thats a green bay thing
2769739 were going to leave the distractions to the media and just go out there and hustle play hard and do our assignments
2769740 first of all this is something youve been doing your whole life
2769741 its still 10 yards for a first down you still have to cross the goal line to score a touchdown the main thing is go out and have fun because whatever you do if you have fun doing it youll do it a lot better
2769742 congress as the major party in the upa has to take a call on the leadership issue it should decide and discuss with the allies but if we want someone who is non controversial then manmohan singh is there
2769743 in the coming elections it is difficult for any party to get 160 170 seats
2769744 in the days of pandit nehru there were leaders like b c roy and govind vallabh pant in states in later years there was hardly any such thing and the states started being run through representatives of the central leadership it is no different in the bjp
2769745 there was no bio data culture before the seventies there was no centralisation of power nowadays it is unfortunate that those who have spent 30 40 years in the organisation are forced to give resumes to those who have not contributed 10 to 20 years for the party
2769746 wie pez anm gartmayer heute gespielt hat war ein wahnsinn er hat 90 prozent aller b lle bekommen er hat jedes side out gemacht er hat durchgezogen und das gegen einen der st rksten blockspieler der welt gegen den kolodinski
2769747 mir ist mein service nicht wirklich aufgegangen verteidigt habe ich gar nichts und die b lle die ich bekommen habe habe ich auch nicht wirklich gemacht man hat gesehen dass erfahrung bei olympischen spielen etwas wert ist
2769748 ich freue mich f r peter er hat ein sehr gutes side out gespielt
2769749 wir haben alles kurz auf barsuk serviert das war er nicht gewohnt das ist aufgegangen
2769750 sie wissen wie man in einem dritten satz spielt damit man ihn gewinnt und ich habe eine ein bisschen zittrige hand gehabt
2769751 das hat ihm nicht gut getan er hat immer wieder ins out geschlagen sie haben aber keinen zentimeter hergegeben und es uns nicht leicht gemacht
2769752 bombardierungen von strategischen orten wie bahnlinien hafenanlagen und milit rischen einrichtungen auch au erhalb des eigentlichen konfliktgebietes

2769796 what started us looking at this issue is the fact that senator mccain has declared his intention to maintain us forces in iraq for a hundred years
2769797 that means that mccain wants to control babylon for at least a century
2769798 as far as were concerned that was enough it means that mccain might easily pretend to be the redeemer
2769799 is code pink to the left what the westboro baptist church is to the right
2769800 theyre switching me to days again im a fucken yoyo
2769801 extremist cells in afghanistan operate in small isolated groups and only a few key individuals have any sense of the overall provincial insurgency plan

2769803 whoever concocted the bill did not have the best interests of the watersports industry at heart
2769804 i think im going to hire someone in indianapolis to break his leg
2769805 just joking if it happens its not me im not that kind of person i want to compete on the track
2769806 when i was going into turn three i thought i got it like im finally going to win this race
2769807 and all of a sudden im coming out of turn four all of a sudden the car just coughed
2769808 there is only one thing going right for one car only and thats scott dixon
2769809 i was very happy because i would have finished sixth or eighth or 10th and with a second place its very good
2769810 the championship it aint over yet well still continue working hard
2769811 definitely with sonoma and chicago and belle isle tracks that those guys are very good at as well we are going to make sure we dont lose too many points
2769812 even when they make a mistake they finish in the top 10
2769813 im just going to try and take it easy on him for a while so we dont lose him again
2769814 i wont be stealing any bases but aside from that ill be all right
2769815 maybe it will change here or there but thats where i want him to hit
2769816 he was in that spot before he got hurt and well just put him back in there
2769817 what i have noticed is that the new signings have adapted really quickly it seems as though theyve been with us for ages
2769818 this is good as in football you need team work and the more we are united the better
2769819 i see a strong secure defensive line it only needs to be polished up a little like all the lines of play thats what pre seasons are for
2769820 i try to serve the forwards in which ever way they want whether its at ground level or from a deep position my primary aim is to create space and movement and to take the initiative with the other midfielders
2769821 we could do better if we could score early on the games would become a lot easier
2769822 in any team it is important to have a technical leader we had one last year and when he left we replaced him with gourcuff who is an excellent technical player who can inspire the others to play well
2769823 you could also consider fernando cavenaghi in that category so having two on the pitch is a considerable advantage
2769824 we need to find a balance so our strike force doesnt paradoxically put us in danger
2769825 some sports such as weightlifting have a pretty bad record and that is demonstrated time and again with numerous athletes from that sport
2769826 i think weightlifting understands as cycling understands that there is a huge risk for both those sports if the cheating is continued and continued to be exposed
2769827 there is no sport that anybody can suggest is doping free
2769828 but there are some sports that have had a history and i would suggest theres a culture of doping that has developed in some of those sports
2769829 there are probably several sports who might fall under the same microscope
2769830 code compliance is essential for participation in any olympics summer or winter
2769831 we will not hesitate if there are a set of circumstances and facts and findings that lead to an outcome of noncompliance to pass that on its up to the ioc after that

2769865 someone tipped off the eagle tribune that alex had been found before the family was notified
2769866 and when we arrived to deliver the devastating news to andy alexs father who lives in lawrence the tribune was already in the house snapping pictures as the family was told breaking down in tears it was total exploitation of this family who had been through so much we were horrified by the picture they ran on the front page the next day it was such an invasion of privacy

2769868 con la mente tranquila y equilibrada con el coraz n ligero y feliz no hay lugar para los esfuerzos y las tensiones la vida trae tanto penas como alegr as para todos pero la diferencia consiste en la actitud de cada persona hacia lo que ocurre cuando uno aprende a caminar a la luz de lo eterno las dificultades y problemas cotidianos se vuelven menos importantes y menos dolorosos
2769869 para resistir las implacables arremetidas de las sugestiones muchas de ellas de car cter negativo a que estamos expuestos constantemente debemos poseer una gran dosis de fortaleza interna y equilibrio solo as podremos llegar a formular nuestras propias conclusiones opiniones y convicciones a decidir seg n nuestro criterio personal y aprenderemos a distinguir entre lo verdadero y lo falso lo noble y lo vil lo profundo y lo superficial

2769877 les chinois qui constituent un grand peuple respectent ceux qui sont clairs et fermes sur leurs principes
2769878 i wore a loose fitting t shirt it was very hot in london and its no secret i dont like wearing bras
2769879 my boob fell out twice and people on the blogs are saying it was a publicity stunt
2769880 can i just say i have been keeping myself very much to myself recently
2769881 if i wanted publicity id be accepting invitations not to mention money for turning up to glamorous events
2769882 whilst we note that the imc has been asked to prepare a special report on paramilitary structures including the current status of the ira we will be making our own assessment and using our own security contacts
2769883 the briefings we receive on a regular basis establish the extent to which the ira has progressed with the dismantling of its paramilitary structures
2769884 it remains our position that the army council must leave the stage and that the ira should no longer function in any respect
2769885 the final ending of the provisional army council pac may be difficult to call if three of them met today to plan the way forward is this a pac meeting
2769886 they have not formally disbanded but they arent doing what they were set out to do and they arent a security threat
2769887 in a democratic society you clearly cannot have an army council it is for the police and the security services to deal with the dissidents
2769888 the key thing about policing and justice the minute it is devolved is the powers it brings to the office of the first minister and the deputy first minister
2769889 you cant have in government a party with a paramilitary structure
2769890 the ira have clearly gone off the stage and have done so since 2005
2769891 i think im going to hire someone in indianapolis to break his leg
2769892 just joking if it happens its not me im not that kind of person i want to compete on the track
2769893 when i was going into turn three i thought i got it like im finally going to win this race
2769894 and all of a sudden im coming out of turn four all of a sudden the car just coughed
2769895 there is only one thing going right for one car only and thats scott dixon
2769896 i was very happy because i would have finished sixth or eighth or 10th and with a second place its very good
2769897 the championship it aint over yet well still continue working hard
2769898 definitely with sonoma and chicago and belle isle tracks that those guys are very good at as well we are going to make sure we dont lose too many points
2769899 even when they make a mistake they finish in the top 10
2769900 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits

2769905 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2769906 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
2769907 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
2769908 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
2769909 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
2769910 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
2769911 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
2769912 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
2769913 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
2769914 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
2769915 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
2769916 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
2769917 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
2769918 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
2769919 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
2769920 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
2769921 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
2769922 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2769923 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2769924 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
2769925 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
2769926 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
2769927 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
2769928 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
2769929 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
2769930 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2769931 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2769932 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
2769933 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2769934 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
2769935 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
2769936 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
2769937 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
2769938 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
2769939 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
2769940 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2769941 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
2769942 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
2769943 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
2769944 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
2769945 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2769946 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2769947 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
2769948 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
2769949 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
2769950 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
2769951 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
2769952 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
2769953 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
2769954 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
2769955 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
2769956 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
2769957 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
2769958 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
2769959 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
2769960 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
2769961 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
2769962 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
2769963 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
2769964 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
2769965 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2769966 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2769967 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2769968 this house is supposed to be a place where people come and enjoy it but its a home its family what better way to symbolize the governors mansion as home and family than to have a wedding

2769976 nobody heard the shot which appears to have been fired from a speedboat by a sniper possibly equipped with a silencer the expertise required to execute such a long distance sniper murder has led suspicion to fall upon the israelis
2769977 this is a significant achievement for israel in the framework of un institutions we do not enjoy many such events and this success leaves us hopeful for the future i hope that this will herald further israeli achievements at the un institutions in geneva
2769978 we feel complete determination that we will be back in gush katif
2769979 on the one hand we feel anger we feel frustration that we are so close to gush katif and we cannot visit the land which belongs to us
2769980 it depends on us it depends on our spiritual strength it depends on our determination and i believe that gush katif ultimately will be built again and will be even larger and stronger than the in the past
